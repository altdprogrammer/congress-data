    "text": "Children's Investment Trust Act of 1991 - Amends the Social Security Act (SSA) to establish in the Treasury the Children's Investment Trust (CIT). Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to accept and transfer to CIT: (1) for FY 1992 and subsequent fiscal years a mandated general fund appropriation equal to FY 1991 aggregate budget authority before sequestration (adjusted for inflation) for all described children's, youth, and family programs; (2) any additional appropriations made by the Congress; (3) the sum of the Children's Investment Tax; and (4) the sum of any income earned from investment of CIT funds. Provides for quarterly transfers to the Trust based on estimates, and for obligation of CIT funds. Makes the Secretary of the Treasury the Managing Trustee of CIT and chairperson of the Board of Trustees. Provides for investment of CIT funds. Directs the Managing Trustee to make quarterly payments from CIT, in accordance with appropriations Acts, to certain Federal and State programs. Directs the Managing Trustee to report to appropriate congressional committees on proposed methodologies to reimburse the Federal Government for costs associated with CIT administration, any amount of the Children's Investment Tax that may be subject to refund, and other expenses associated with CIT operations. Prohibits any loans between CIT and other trust funds. Requires the President to submit a six-year plan for CIT operation as part of the annual U.S. Government budget submitted to the Congress. Directs the Comptroller General, within 90 days after enactment of this Act, to prepare and submit to the appropriate congressional committees a list of Federal children's, youth, and family programs for which CIT funds may be obligated, as well as the FY 1991 appropriations for each such program. Requires such list to include a description of income tax credits that directly benefit families with children, for which reimbursements to the general fund may be made from CIT. Authorizes provision of funds under this title to an agency or department head as appropriations or as reimbursements to the general fund of the Treasury for costs related to the use of tax credits and reimbursable tax credits. Directs the CIT Coordinator to solicit comments from certain State entities and officials as well as professional and advocacy organizations in preparing the six-year plan. Directs the President to appoint a CIT Coordinator with at least ten years of progressive experience in designing, administering, or evaluating service programs for children, youth, and families. Requires the Director of OMB to provide administrative support to the Coordinator. Prohibits the Coordinator from having any authority to administer the provision of services to children, youth, and families. Authorizes appropriations. Establishes a CIT Planning Council to advise the President on use of CIT funds and methods for simplifying CIT administration and coordinating programs receiving such funds. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enter into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences to establish a CIT Evaluation Panel of experts and specialists to evaluate Federal children's, youth, and family programs. Requires the Panel to: (1) develop a plan for the evaluation, at least once in every six-year period, of programs, including State programs, that receive CIT funds; and (2) report, at least once in every six-year period, on the results of such evaluation plan to the CIT Planning Council, the President, and the appropriate congressional committees. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a program of entitlement grants to States for the provision of children's, youth, and family services. Entitles a State to such a grant if the Governor certifies that: (1) the grant funds will be used for specified authorized purposes; (2) the State has established an independent State body (as described under the Augustus F. Hawkins Human Services Act of 1990) to coordinate and improve delivery of services to children, youth, and families; and (3) aggregate expenditure of State funds during the fiscal year of the grant, for programs serving children, youth, and families, will not be less than such State expenditures in FY 1990, adjusted for inflation. Allows a State to use entitlement grant funds for: (1) grants for State and local program coordination and integration, and family resource and support; (2) supplements to other Federal funds received by the State under any program eligible for CIT assistance; (3) the matching share required under any program eligible for CIT assistance, to the extent that such matching share results from program expansions or improvements exceeding those required under Federal law at the time of the grant award; and (4) grants for specified types of program innovations and improvements, to local governments, education, health, and social service agencies, and other public and private entities. Requires: (1) States to apply for grant funds for program innovations and improvements; and (2) the Secretary to approve such applications if specified conditions are met. Requires States to report annually to the CIT Coordinator on their activities and accomplishments derived through use of such grant funds. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make grants to each State for training and technical assistance. Entitles a State to such a grant if the Governor certifies that: (1) the funds will be used to provide training and technical assistance to public and private agencies serving children, youth, and families; and (2) a description of the State's activities and accomplishments derived through use of such grant will be included in the annual report to the CIT Coordinator. Authorizes Federal agencies responsible for children's, youth, and family programs to provide, either directly or by contract, training and technical assistance services on a reimbursable basis to any State or other public or private entity that agrees to pay for such assistance. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to appropriate to the CIT amounts equivalent to taxes received in the Treasury from the Children's Investment Tax. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require that Concurrent Budget Resolutions set forth the aggregate amount to be made available from the CIT for programs and activities under this Act, including amounts for discretionary and for direct programs. Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to exempt from reduction by sequestration order amounts made available in appropriations Acts for Federal children's, youth, and family programs and transferred to the CIT."
