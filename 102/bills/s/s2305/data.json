    "date": "1992-03-03", 
    "text": "Crime Control Act of 1992 - Title I: Death Penalty - Federal Death Penalty Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criteria for the imposition of the death penalty for Federal crimes. Requires the Government, for any offense punishable by death, to serve notice upon the defendant a reasonable time before trial or acceptance of a plea, or at such time thereafter as the court may permit upon a showing of good cause, that it intends to seek the death penalty and the aggravating factors upon which it will rely. Requires a separate sentencing hearing before a jury, or the court upon motion by the defendant, when the defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense punishable by death. Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, without regard to the rules of evidence, but permits evidence to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury. Permits the Government to present information concerning the effect of the offense on the victim and the victim's family, including oral testimony, a victim impact statement, and other relevant information. Specifies mitigating factors which the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the information and aggravating factors which the Government must provide beyond a reasonable doubt. Sets forth special aggravating factors for: (1) treason, espionage, homicide, and the attempted murder of the President; and (2) drug offenses punishable by the death penalty (such factors include previous serious drug felony convictions, use of a firearm in committing or furthering certain continuing criminal enterprises, use of minors in trafficking, and lethal adulteration of controlled substances). Directs the court, or the jury by unanimous vote, to recommend the death penalty upon a finding of at least one aggravating factor and no mitigating factor, or one or more aggravating factors which outweigh any mitigating factors. States that no person who was under 18 years of age at the time of the offense or who is mentally retarded may be sentenced to death. Requires the court to instruct the jury not to consider the race, color, religion, national origin, or sex of the defendant or victim in its consideration of the sentence. Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence. Requires the court of appeals, upon consideration of the record and the information and procedures of the sentencing hearing, to affirm the decision if: (1) the sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; (2) the information supports the finding of aggravating factors; and (3) the proceedings did not involve any other prejudicial error requiring reversal of the sentence that was properly preserved for and raised on appeal. Specifies that the court of appeals, in a case in which the sentence is not affirmed, shall remand the case for reconsideration or for imposition of another authorized sentence as appropriate, subject to specified requirements. Requires the court to provide a written explanation of its determination. Sets forth procedures for the implementation of a sentence of death. Prohibits a sentence of death from being carried out upon a person who lacks the mental capacity to understand the death penalty and why it was imposed on that person, or upon a woman while she is pregnant. Prohibits requiring any employee of any State department of corrections, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), the U.S. Marshals Service, or any employee providing services to that department, bureau, or service under contract to be in attendance or to participate in any execution if such participation is contrary to such employee's moral or religious convictions. Provides for the appointment of counsel in Federal cases where a defendant against whom a sentence of death is sought, or on whom such sentence has been imposed, for an offense against the United States, is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation. Sets forth additional provisions with respect to: (1) representation before and after review of judgment; (2) standards for competence of counsel; and (3) claims of ineffectiveness of counsel. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) deadlines for collateral attacks on judgments imposing a sentence of death; and (2) stays of execution. Limits the circumstances under which a person subject to the criminal jurisdiction of an Indian tribal government may be executed under this Act. Provides for the imposition of the death penalty for specified Federal crimes, including: (1) treason; (2) delivering defense information to aid a foreign government; (3) specified Controlled Substances Act (CSA) offenses committed as part of a continuing criminal enterprise; (4) certain felony violations of the CSA, the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (CSIEA), or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act; (5) murders committed by prisoners in Federal correctional institutions; (6) certain offenses relating to drive-by shootings; (7) kidnappings which result in the death of any person; (8) attempting to kill the President of the United States (if such attempt results in bodily injury or comes dangerously close to causing the President's death); (9) murder in the aid of a racketeering activity; (10) civil rights murders and certain murders involving damage to religious property or obstruction of persons in the free exercise of religious belief; (11) genocide; (12) murder of Federal law enforcement officers, or of State or local law enforcement officers assisting Federal officers; (13) torture, if death results; (14) murder of Federal witnesses in the Witness Protection Program; (15) gun murders during Federal crimes of violence and drug trafficking crimes; (16) rape and child molestation murders; (17) causing death in the sexual exploitation of children; (18) specified offenses under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (FAA); (19) using, or attempting or conspiring to use, a weapon of mass destruction, if death results; (20) first-degree murders involving the use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon in a Federal facility; (21) murder by escaped prisoners; and (22) murders in the District of Columbia. Increases penalties for obstruction of justice offenses against court officers and jurors, and for retaliatory killings of witnesses, victims, and informants. Sets forth penalties for: (1) performing or attempting an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation which causes or is likely to cause serious injury or death; (2) destroying or seriously damaging the facilities of, or a civil aircraft not in service at, such airport; or (3) disrupting the services of such airport, if such an act endangers or is likely to endanger safety. Amends the FAA to delete a limitation on the applicability of aircraft piracy provisions to situations where the place of takeoff or of actual landing of the aircraft on board which the offense is committed is situated outside the territory of the State of registration of such aircraft. Establishes penalties for acts of violence against maritime navigation, such as seizing control of a ship by force, threat, or intimidation, and performing acts of violence against persons on board a ship that are likely to endanger safe navigation. Sets forth analogous provisions with respect to maritime fixed platforms. Sets forth provisions with respect to U.S. jurisdiction over the territorial sea and over crimes against U.S. nationals on foreign vessels. Title II: Habeas Corpus Reform - Subtitle A: General Habeas Corpus Reform - Habeas Corpus Reform Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal judicial code to establish a one-year statute of limitations for habeas corpus actions brought by State prisoners. Vests authority to issue certificates for probable cause for appeal of habeas corpus orders exclusively in the courts of appeals. Permits denial on the merits of habeas corpus writs notwithstanding the failure to exhaust State remedies. Prohibits the granting of a petition for habeas corpus with respect to any claim which has been fully and fairly adjudicated in State proceedings. Sets forth provisions with respect to the appointment of counsel. Subtitle B: Death Penalty Litigation Procedures - Death Penalty Litigation Procedures Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal judicial code to set forth special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases. Applies such procedures to Federal habeas corpus cases brought by prisoners in State custody who are subject to a capital sentence. Makes the applicability of such procedures contingent upon a State establishing a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings brought by indigent prisoners whose capital convictions and sentences have been upheld on direct appeal to the court of last resort in the State or have otherwise become final for State law purposes. States that the rule of court on statutes establishing such mechanism must provide standards of competency for the appointment of such counsel. Specifies that any such mechanism must offer counsel to all State prisoners under capital sentence and must provide for the entry of an order by a court of record: (1) appointing counsel to represent the prisoner upon a specified finding; (2) finding that the prisoner has rejected the offer of counsel and made the decision with an understanding of its legal consequences; or (3) denying the appointment of counsel upon a finding that the prisoner is not indigent. Provides for a mandatory stay of execution during the post-conviction review initiated pursuant to this Act. Details conditions which will cause such stay to expire.

Limits the number of aliens and members of their immediate families entering the United States under such authority to 200 persons in any single fiscal year. Makes the decision to grant or deny permanent resident status under this Act at the discretion of the Attorney General and not subject to judicial review.

Requires that the House and Senate Judiciary Committees be informed regarding all such requests for certification. (Current law authorizes the Director or his designee to request telephone toll and transactional records upon written certification to the provider that the information sought is relevant to an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation and there are specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe that the person is a foreign power or foreign agent.) Title VII: Sexual Violence, Child Abuse, and Victims' Rights - Subtitle A: Sexual Violence and Child Abuse - Amends the Federal criminal code to include within the definition of \"sexual act\" the intentional touching, not through the clothing, of the genitalia of another person who has not attained the age of 16 with intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person. Increases penalties for recidivist sex offenses. Authorizes the court to order a defendant convicted of a sex offense to pay restitution to the victim. Requires a judicial officer, at the time of the pretrial release determination, to include in any order a requirement that the defendant be tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and that follow-up tests for the virus be performed six and 12 months thereafter, unless the judicial officer determines that the defendant's conduct created no risk of transmission of the virus to the victim. Sets forth additional requirements with respect to HIV testing and disclosure of test results. Directs the Sentencing Commission to amend the sentencing guidelines to enhance the sentence of a sex offender if such offender knew or had reason to know that the offender was infected with HIV, except where the offender did not engage or attempt to engage in conduct creating a risk of transmission of the virus to the victim. Amends the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 to require the Attorney General or the head of another department or agency that conducts an investigation of a sexual assault to pay the cost of up to two tests of the victim for HIV during the 12 months following the assault.

Requires (current law authorizes) the court to order restitution payments for specified violations of the Federal criminal code and the FAA. Authorizes the court, in addition to ordering restitution of the victim for the offense of which a defendant is convicted, to order restitution of persons harmed physically, emotionally, or pecuniarily by the defendant's unlawful conduct during which the offense occurred or during the course of a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of unlawful activity related to the offense.

(Current law provides a complex formula for the distribution of funds depending on the amount deposited in the Fund.) Authorizes the Director of the Office for Victims of Crime to retain any amount in excess of 110 percent of the total deposited in the previous fiscal year as a reserve for those years in which there is a shortfall in the Fund, provided that the reserve does not exceed $20,000,000.

Makes biannual reports under such Act due on May 31 (currently, such reports are due December 31). Requires grantees to certify that no grant funds will be used to supplant State and local funds, but rather will supplement those otherwise available funds. Delays the effective date for specified provisions to make the allocations required by such provisions without reducing the funding levels of programs supported by the Victim Assistance Fund and the Victims Compensation Fund.

Directs that, in a criminal trial in any Federal or State court, on motion of the defense attorney or prosecutor: (1) the risk of racial prejudice or bias be examined on voir dire if there is a substantial likelihood in the circumstances of the case that such prejudice or bias will affect the jury either against or in favor of the defendant; and (2) a change of venue be granted if an impartial jury cannot be obtained in the original venue because of racial prejudice or bias. Bars the prosecutor or the defense attorney from making any appeal to racial prejudice or bias in statements before the jury. Requires: (1) the judge in a Federal capital case before a jury to instruct the jury not to be influenced by prejudice or bias relating to the race or color of the defendant or victim in considering whether a sentence of death is justified, and that the jury is not to recommend the imposition of such sentence unless it has concluded that it would recommend the same sentence for such crime regardless of the race or color of the defendant or victim; and (2) the jury, upon the return of a recommendation of a sentence of death, to also return a certificate, signed by each juror, that the juror's individual decision was not affected by prejudice or bias relating to the race or color of the defendant or victim and that the individual juror would have made the same recommendation regardless of the race or color of the defendant or victim.
