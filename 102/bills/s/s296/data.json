Limits the number of such annual admissions (not counting spouses and children) to: (1) 2,000 from treaty states (as defined by this Act); or (2) 100 from non-treaty states. Excludes from such numerical limitations those aliens meeting the requirements of this Act as of the date of enactment. Permits such aliens to adjust their status to permanent resident status. Delays until April 1, 1992, implementation of certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding the nonimmigrant admission of alien artists, athletes, entertainers, or fashion models (\"O\" and \"P\" visas). Admits such aliens as \"H\" visas (specialty occupation) during the interim period. Continues derivative status for alien spouses and children of preference aliens who are members of the professions holding advanced degrees, aliens of exceptional ability, or skilled workers. Deems an immigrant application based upon professional status or exceptional ability (pre-October 1, 1991, third preference) or skilled or unskilled labor (pre-October 1, 1991, sixth preference) filed prior to such date and approved at any date as an approved application based upon post-October 1, 1991, categories of professional advanced degree status, exceptional ability, or skilled workers, professionals, or other workers. Authorizes FY 1992 refugee resettlement appropriations."
