Declares that such prohibition shall not apply to products vital to U.S. national security. Prohibits U.S. nationals from investing in, or making loans to, a foreign joint venture involving the use of forced labor. Sets forth civil penalties for violating such prohibitions. Provides for the administrative review of orders imposing such penalties. Authorizes private persons to: (1) bring civil actions to enforce such prohibitions in an appropriate U.S. district court; and (2) sue for treble damages business competitors which violate such prohibitions if the plaintiff is injured as a result of such violation."
