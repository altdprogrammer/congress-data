    "text": "Civil Rights Act of 1991 - Title I: Federal Civil Rights Remedies - Amends Federal law to declare that: (1) for purposes of provisions relating to equal rights under the law, the right to make and enforce contracts includes the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship; and (2) the rights protected by the amended provisions are protected against impairment by nongovernmental discrimination and impairment under color of State law. Allows compensatory and punitive damages for intentional employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or disability, except when: (1) the practice is unlawful because of its disparate impact; (2) the complaining party may recover under provisions of Federal law relating to equal rights under the law; or (3) the covered entity, in a disability discrimination case, demonstrates good faith efforts to make a reasonable accommodation that would provide an equally effective opportunity and would not cause an undue hardship on the operation of the business. Allows such punitive damages under these provisions where: (1) the respondent is not a government, governmental agency, or political subdivision; and (2) there is malice or reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual. Prohibits compensatory damages under these provisions for back pay, interest on back pay, or any other type of relief authorized under specified provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 relating to injunctions, affirmative action, or other equitable relief. Limits to specified dollar amounts, varying depending on the number of employees employed by an employer, the sum of compensatory (for specified types of losses) and punitive damages.
