Extends from 1991 to 1992 the effective date for the requirement that all appraisers involved in federally related transactions must be licensed or certified. Prohibits the Appraisal Subcommittee from refusing to recognize a State's appraiser certification or licensing program solely because it does not include real estate appraisal experience as a license prerequisite."
