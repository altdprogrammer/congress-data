    "text": "Omnibus Eastern European Security Assistance Act of 1991 - Requires at least 20 percent of the funds made available each fiscal year to carry out the international military education and training program under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to be made available to train Central and Eastern European military personnel and civilian political leaders and their staffs. Requires trainees under such program to receive instruction designed to promote adherence to protecting civilians and prisoners from harm and intimidation, reporting to the proper authorities all human rights abuses by military forces, and accepting the authority of elected civilian officials. Directs the President, through the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, to ensure that a significant number of students from Central and Eastern Europe be included in the training offered by the National Academy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to furnish international criminal investigative training and administration of justice assistance to countries and organizations in Central and Eastern Europe. Outlines authorized activities and types of assistance. Prohibits any program or exchange from taking place with the authorities of a nonelected government or with a regime that carries out human rights violations or is negligent in the prosecution of hate crimes. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Director of the U.S. Information Agency to require the translation into the appropriate languages of books and other materials concerning transitions to democracy and civilian control over justice, military, and security forces for distribution to parliaments, relevant ministries, and institutions of higher learning throughout Central and Eastern Europe. Directs the Secretary, together with the Attorney General, to report to specified congressional committees on possible sites for the establishment of at least three legal attache posts at U.S. embassies in Central and Eastern Europe."
