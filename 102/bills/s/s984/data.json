    "text": "International Pollution Deterrence Act of 1991 - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to declare that a country's failure to impose and enforce effective pollution controls and environmental safeguards shall constitute the bestowal of a bounty or grant (subsidy) by such country on its manufactured products and require the imposition of countervailing duties on such products. Requires appropriation of 50 percent of the revenue attributable to the assessment of such duties to the Pollution Control Equipment Export Fund for use in assisting purchases of U.S. pollution control equipment by developing countries. Amends the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (Administrator) to establish a Pollution Control Research and Development Fund by using 50 percent of the revenues derived from such duties to provide assistance for U.S. companies in the research and development of pollution control technology and equipment. Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require the Administrator to prepare a pollution control index for each of the top 50 countries identified by the Office of Trade and Investment of the Department of Commerce based on the value of exports to the United States from that country's attainment of pollution control standards in the areas of air, water, and hazardous and solid waste as compared to the United States."
