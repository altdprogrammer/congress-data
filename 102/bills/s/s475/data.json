Prohibits subjecting graduates of foreign schools who underwent postgraduate training in the United States to different requirements than domestic graduates. Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from making a grant, loan guarantee, or interest subsidy payment to or for a medical school unless the application contains certain assurances. Requires a State to adopt medical licensure and reciprocity standards that provide equal opportunity to graduates of foreign schools who completed postgraduate training in the United States and have obtained a license to practice in any State."
