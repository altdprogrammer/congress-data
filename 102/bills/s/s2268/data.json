(RU-486 has been used outside the United States to abort pregnancies.) Prohibits the FDA from taking any action to bar the import of that drug unless the FDA finds that it is being imported for an illegal use. Requires the FDA to give consideration in accordance with provisions relating to new drug approval when an application is submitted under such provisions for RU-486."
