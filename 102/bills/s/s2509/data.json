Provides for solicitation of proposals from applicants to operate such centers, proposal criteria, management plans, selection of proposals, funding of the centers, and program coordination. Requires regular monitoring and evaluation of each center's activities, annual reports, discontinuation of funding in cases of failure to implement program activities, and solicitation of new proposals upon discontinuation of funding for any center. Requires the two Directors to: (1) establish a children's advocacy advisory board to develop identified goals and program objectives; and (2) review annually the solicitation and selection process and program activities of each center. Directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to send to the Congress an annual, detailed review of the progress of such program activities. Authorizes appropriations."
