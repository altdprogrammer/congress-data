    "text": "Authorizes the Attorney General, through the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, to make grants to appropriate State agencies for the purpose of establishing up to ten military-style boot camps for juvenile delinquents. Specifies that such camps shall be located on existing or closed military installations on sites to be chosen by the agencies in one or more States, or in other facilities designated by the agencies on such sites. Directs the Administrator to: (1) try to achieve equitable geographic distribution in approving camp sites; and (2) give priority to grants where more than one State enters into formal cooperative arrangements to jointly administer a camp. Specifies that such camps shall: (1) provide a highly regimented schedule of strict discipline, physical training, work, drill, and ceremony characteristic of military basic training, and remedial and vocational education and treatment for substance abuse (where appropriate); and (2) be designed to accommodate between 200 and 300 juveniles for such time as the agency deems appropriate. Makes a person eligible for assignment to a camp if he or she: (1) is considered to be a juvenile under the laws of the State of jurisdiction; and (2) has been adjudicated delinquent in such State or, upon court approval, voluntarily agrees to the assignment in lieu of an adjudication of delinquency. Specifies that, to the maximum extent possible, camps shall be operated and maintained by active or reserve military personnel, under the supervision of the agency. Requires a State that seeks to establish, or participate in the joint administration of, a camp to submit to the Administrator a plan setting forth the provisions that the State will make for the continued supervision of juveniles following release, and for educational and vocational training, drug or other counseling and treatment (where appropriate), and other support services. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to State and local law enforcement agencies to combat drug-related and other violent crimes, subject to specified limitations. Provides for the allocation of funds. Authorizes appropriations. Expresses the sense of the Congress that there should be appropriated for FY 1993 specified additional funds for carrying out the Head Start Act and the Follow Through Act. Bars the United States from obligating any funds for the superconducting super collider project until funds have been appropriated as specified in this Act, subject to specified requirements."
