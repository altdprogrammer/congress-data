    "text": "Radon Assessment and Mitigation Act of 1991 - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to extend the authorization of appropriations for: (1) grants and technical assistance to States for radon programs; (2) an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publication entitled \"A Citizen's Guide to Radon\"; and (3) model construction standards and techniques for controlling radon levels in new buildings. Limits the Federal share of grants to States for radon programs to 50 percent of a program's cost. Adds to the list of activities eligible for grant assistance: (1) technical assistance to public water supply systems concerning mitigation of radon in public water supplies and public education activities to assist homeowners in the assessment and mitigation of radon in water supplies; (2) activities to adopt new construction standards for reducing radon levels in new buildings; and (3) technical and financial assistance to public interest groups to encourage radon testing and mitigation at local levels. Requires the EPA Administrator to make available final radon control standards and techniques for new buildings by January 1, 1992. Directs the appropriate Federal official to require single family or multifamily housing constructed in a high risk radon area with Federal financial assistance to be constructed in accordance with such standards. Requires regional radon training centers to provide for the training of contractors and others in the building community in the implementation of such standards. Directs the Administrator to establish a radon design award program to provide for annual awards for the best residential design incorporating radon control or mitigation standards. Requires the Administrator to designate high risk radon areas on a biennial basis. Prohibits Federal officials, within one year of the date of designation of an area as a high risk radon area, from approving financing of a residence covered by Federal housing assistance programs, unless such officials have been provided with results of radon tests for the residence. Prescribes civil penalties for persons who knowingly act to reduce the accuracy of such tests. Directs the Administrator to submit to the Congress a plan describing activities to be undertaken by Federal agencies to mitigate radon in Federal buildings. Requires the Administrator to: (1) implement an outreach program to provide information about radon to the medical community; and (2) develop and distribute informational material concerning radon tailored to doctors in general practice and in specialties related to lung cancer. Directs the Administrator, in FY 1992 through 1994, to support at least five applications for regional radon training centers. Authorizes appropriations."
