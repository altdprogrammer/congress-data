    "text": "Enterprise for the Americas Act of 1992 - Title I: Foreign Assistance Act Debt Reduction - Supports improvement in the lives of the people of Latin America and the Caribbean through market-oriented reforms and economic growth with actions to promote debt reduction, investment reforms, community based conservation and sustainable use of the environment, and child survival and child development. Makes eligible for Enterprise for the Americas Facility (established pursuant to the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954) benefits Latin American or Caribbean countries that: (1) have democratically-elected governments; (2) have not provided support for international terrorism; (3) cooperate on international narcotics control matters; (4) are not engaging in a consistent pattern of human rights violations; (5) have in effect, received approval for, or are making progress toward, specified International Monetary Fund (IMF) arrangements and structural or sectoral adjustment loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development or the International Development Association; (6) have put in place major investment reforms in conjunction with an Inter-American Development Bank loan or are implementing or making progress toward an open investment regime; and (7) have agreed with commercial bank lenders on a financing program for debt or debt service reduction. Authorizes the President to reduce the amount owed to the United States (as a result of concessional loans made pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or predecessor foreign economic assistance legislation) by any country eligible for Facility benefits. Sets forth requirements with respect to the exchange of obligations, repayment of principal, and interest on new obligations issued by beneficiary countries. Requires beneficiary countries that enter into Americas Framework Agreements to establish Enterprise for the Americas Funds. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into Americas Framework Agreements concerning the operation and use of Americas Funds with countries eligible for Facility benefits. Directs administering bodies in each beneficiary country to administer the Americas Funds and to make grants. Requires grants from the Funds to be used for activities that link the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources with local community development and for child survival and development activities. Subjects grants of more than $100,000 to veto by the U.S. Government or the government of the beneficiary country. Redesignates the Environment for the Americas Board (established pursuant to the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954) as the Enterprise for the Americas Board. Requires the Board to: (1) advise the Secretary on the negotiations of Americas Framework Agreements; (2) ensure that a suitable administering body is identified for each Americas Fund; and (3) review the programs, operations, and fiscal audits of administering bodies. Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 to increase the number of representatives on the Board. Title II: Export-Import Bank Debt Reduction - Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to set forth provisions concerning the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative parallel to those set forth in title I of this Act. Makes eligible for Facility benefits Latin American or Caribbean countries that: (1) have in effect, received approval for, or are making progress toward, specified IMF arrangements and structural or sectoral adjustment loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development or the International Development Association; (2) have put in place major investment reforms in conjunction with an Inter-American Development Bank loan or are implementing or making progress toward an open investment regime; and (3) have agreed with commercial bank lenders on a financing program for debt or debt service reduction. Permits the President, for purposes of facilitating debt-for-equity, debt-for-development, or debt-for-nature swaps, to sell to any eligible purchaser any Export-Import Bank loan made to an eligible country before January 1, 1991. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Participation of the Inter-American Development Bank - Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to work closely with the management of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to ensure the full implementation of the IDB's proposed investment sector reform program and the coordination of U.S. bilateral assistance programs with IDB efforts to enhance liberalization efforts in countries served by the IDB. Amends the Inter-American Development Bank Act to authorize appropriations for a contribution to the Multilateral Investment Fund, provided that certain conditions are met. Requires U.S. assistance to the Fund to be disbursed only for the following purposes: (1) technical assistance for purposes of identifying and resolving domestic constraints to investment; (2) assistance to private enterprises; (3) assistance in building human capital, alleviating poverty, and reducing barriers to economic and social progress; and (4) assistance to support host country capacity for insuring the environmental soundness of investment activities. Limits the amount to be used for any of the preceding purposes. Requires the Secretary to instruct the U.S. representative to the Fund to vote against any action which may have an adverse environmental impact unless an environmental assessment is available at least 120 days before the vote. Makes Latin American or Caribbean countries eligible for Enterprise for the Americas Facility benefits eligible for Fund assistance. Title IV: International University for the Americas - Requires the Secretary of State to determine the most appropriate location for the International University for the Americas, an institution to be established for promoting economic integration and the strengthening of democratic institutions in the Western Hemisphere and for commemorating the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus. Authorizes a specified amount of development and economic support assistance for Latin America and the Caribbean to be made available for the University. Title V: Reports - Directs the President to report annually to the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate on the implementation of this Act."
