    "text": "Limits the maximum amount that may be expended by the Department of Defense for any fiscal year for the recruitment of individuals into the armed forces to a multiplier of $4,700 times the number of individuals successfully recruited. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to adjust such multiplier annually for each fiscal year after 1993 by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index. Outlines recruitment expenses covered under such limitation, including salaries, allowances, office space, and expenses of recruitment personnel, advertising, and recruit processing costs. Makes such limitation inapplicable to the recruitment of cadets and midshipmen into the military service academies. Requires documents submitted annually to the Congress in support of the defense budget to include items of programs, projects, and activities conducted for recruitment purposes, the amount provided for each such item in the budget, and the estimated cost of recruiting each individual into the armed forces."
