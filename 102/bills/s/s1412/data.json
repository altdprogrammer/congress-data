    "text": "Postage Rate Reform Act of 1990 - Amends Federal law to preclude the following types of mail from reduced postage rates: (1) certain advertising materials; (2) mail matters that attempt to influence legislation or a partisan election; and (3) a publication whose advertisement portion exceeds ten percent of the issue involved. Qualifies a nonprofit organization or association as \"educational\" for reduced postage rates only if its primary purpose is to administer a course of instruction through a teacher-student relationship in school. Repeals the requirement that publishers and distributors must be charged favored library mail rates. Establishes a policy that rates and fees paid by the Federal Government for any class of mail or type of service should not exceed: (1) the direct and indirect postal costs attributable to it; plus (2) the same percentage of other postal costs as is charged in the rates for comparable commercial mailings. Requires the U.S. Postal Service, until the next time postage rates are changed, to determine the equivalent of postage on penalty and franked mail by using the attributable cost data reflected in a specified postal rate case."
