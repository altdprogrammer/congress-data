    "text": "Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 1991 - Title I: Bank Reinsurance Program - Bank Reinsurance Act - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to direct the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to establish: (1) an interim risk-based assessment rate formula for specified large banks; and (2) a risk-based assessment rate formula for specified small banks within a low or normal risk category. Outlines formula contents. Allows small banks to elect reinsurance instead of paying assessments. Title II: Savings Association Reinsurance Program - Savings Association Reinsurance Act - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to direct the FDIC to establish: (1) an interim risk-based reinsurance assessment rate formula for specified large savings associations, and a risk-based assessment rate formula for specified small banks within a low or normal risk category. Outlines formula contents. Sets forth FDIC remedies upon failure of a savings association to obtain reinsurance. Allows savings associations to elect reinsurance instead of paying assessments. Title III: Bank Deposit Reinsurance Corporation - Deposit Reinsurance Corporation Act - Directs the FDIC to: (1) determine after a specified period whether the insurance industry is capable of offering reinsurance to all covered banks in accordance with a phase-in schedule established for the implementation of the interim risk-based formula; and (2) implement the incorporation of the Deposit Reinsurance Corporation if private reinsurance is not available to the requisite number of banks required to obtain it. Establishes the Deposit Reinsurance Corporation, contingent on a demonstration of need. Authorizes appropriations. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - Mandates annual bank examinations by certain Federal banking regulatory agencies. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to require the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to prohibit any secured loan or advance to a member depository institution that does not meet the basic capital standards prescribed by the appropriate Federal banking agency. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to prescribe payment procedures for uninsured bank deposits subsequent to bank closures and to bank reopening. Amends the Bank Holding Company Act to exempt from its prohibitions against the holding of interests in nonbanking organizations, the shares of any company whose activities are solely to provide reinsurance according to the Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 1991. Directs the FDIC to report to the Congress each calendar quarter during which the average assessment charged to large banks differs by more than five basis points from the average premium charged to large savings associations."
