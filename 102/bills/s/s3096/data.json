Specifies that the Administrator shall allow grantees to use wide discretion in designing programs that effectively promote increased bicycle helmet use. Permits such grants to be used to: (1) enforce a law that requires individuals under age 16 to wear approved bicycle helmets while riding bicycles; (2) assist individuals under age 16 to acquire such helmets; and (3) develop and administer a program to educate individuals under age 16 and their families on the importance of wearing helmets. Designates interim bicycle helmet standards. Requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to: (1) review the requirements of the interim standards and establish a final standard; and (2) include in the final standard provisions to protect against the risk of helmets coming off the heads of bicycle riders and provisions that address the risk of injury to children. Specifies that a bicycle helmet that does not conform to an interim or final standard shall be considered in violation of a consumer product safety standard promulgated under the Consumer Product Safety Act. Authorizes appropriations."
