Requires claims for compensation due to ill health to be included within such Registry. Requires the Registry's information to be collected and maintained so as to enable easy cross-reference with a Registry for the Department of Defense established under this Act. Directs the Secretary to notify individuals in the Registry from time to time on significant developments in research on the health consequences of such military service during such War. Directs the Secretary to provide a health examination, consultation, and counseling to any veterans eligible for listing or inclusion in the Registry. Authorizes the Secretary to provide such examination, consultation, and counseling to any veteran eligible for listing or inclusion in any other similar health-related registry administered by the Secretary. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 to direct the Secretary of Defense to establish a special record for members of the armed forces who served in Operation Desert Storm during the Persian Gulf War or who were exposed to the fumes of burning oil there. Requires such Secretary to establish such record with the advice of an independent scientific organization. Requires the Director of the Office of Technology Assessment to undertake a study making certain assessments with respect to the Registry and its utility and effectiveness in serving the needs of members serving in the Persian Gulf War. Directs each Secretary to provide the Director with access to required information in carying out such study. Requires reports to the Congress by the Director. Directs each Secretary to jointly seek to enter into an agreement with the Medical Follow-Up Agency (MFUA) of the National Academy of Sciences to review existing medical, scientific, and other information on the health consequences of military service in the Persian Gulf theater during such War. Permits MFUA, in conducting the review, to examine and evaluate the medical records of individuals included in the Registry and special record in order to identify illnesses. Requires such agreement to be entered into within 180 days after enactment of this Act. Requires the Academy to report to each Secretary and specified congressional committees on the results of the review carried out under the joint agreement. Requires each Secretary to provide amounts from their respective Department's FY 1993 funding to carry out the review. Provides that, if an agreement is reached with the Academy, each Secretary shall provide the Academy with funds in each of FY 1994 through 2003 for conducting epidemiological research with respect to military and veteran populations. Directs the President to designate (with authorized redesignation from time to time) the head of an appropriate Federal department or agency to coordinate all research activities undertaken by the executive branch on the health consequences of military service in the Persian Gulf theater of operations during such War. Requires the department or agency head so chosen to report annually to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees on the status and results of all such research activities during the previous year."
