    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-05-07", 
    "text": "Directs the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration (Administrator) to conduct a program to promote the implementation of Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS) as a component of the Federal-aid Highway System. Sets forth the goals of such program, including: (1) the widespread implementation of IVHS to enhance the capacity, efficiency, and safety of the Federal-aid Highway System; (2) the enhancement of the efforts of the States to attain air quality goals established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, pursuant to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990; (3) the development and promotion of IVHS and an IVHS industry in the United States; (4) the reduction of societal, economic, and environmental costs associated with traffic congestion; and (5) the enhancement of U.S. industrial and economic competitiveness. Directs the Administrator to: (1) lead and coordinate an IVHS program and foster its use as a key component of surface transportation systems in the United States; (2) strive to transfer federally owned or patented technology to State and local governments and to the U.S. private sector; (3) maximize the involvement of the private sector, colleges and universities, and State and local governments in aspects of such programs, as appropriate; and (4) develop and implement standards and protocols (to the extent practicable, promoting compatibility among IVHS technologies implemented throughout the States) to promote the widespread use and evaluation of IVHS technology as a component of the Federal-aid Highway System. Authorizes the Administrator to make use of standards-setting organizations as he deems appropriate. Directs the Administrator to establish: (1) guidelines and requirements for the evaluation of field and related operational tests; and (2) a repository for technical and safety data collected as a result of federally sponsored projects pursuant to this Act, and make such information available, upon request, at an appropriate cost to all users, except for proprietary information and data. Authorizes the Administrator to utilize one or more advisory committees in carrying out his responsibilities under this Act. Specifies that any such committee shall be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and funding provided for any such committee shall be available from monies appropriated for advisory committees as specified in relevant appropriations Acts and from funds allocated for activities in connection with the IVHS program under this Act. Requires the Administrator: (1) within 12 months, to formulate, and submit to the Congress, a strategic plan for the IVHS program; (2) within 24 months and annually thereafter, to submit implementation reports; and (3) within five years, to submit a report addressing the non-technical constraints and barriers to the program (such as antitrust, privacy, or staffing concerns). Authorizes the Administrator to provide planning and technical assistance and information to State and local governments seeking to demonstrate, use, and evaluate IVHS technologies. Directs the Administrator to assist State and local officials in developing provisions for implementing areawide traffic management control centers, necessary laws to advance such systems, the infrastructure for such existing and evolving systems, and other necessary activities to carry out the IVHS program under this Act. Authorizes the Administrator, subject to the availability of funds, to make grants for feasibility and planning studies to be conducted by State and local governments. Makes any interagency traffic and incident management entity contracted to a State department of transportation for the implementation of traffic management systems of designated corridors eligible to receive Federal transportation funds under this Act through the appropriate State department of transportation. Sets forth criteria for the Administrator to use in deciding which demonstrations or operational tests to fund. Authorizes each State and eligible local entity to use Federal-aid highway construction and maintenance funds for demonstration and implementation purposes in connection with the IVHS program. Directs the Administrator: (1) to designate transportation corridors in which application of IVHS will have particular benefit and, through financial and technical assistance, assist in the implementation of such systems; (2) in designating such corridors, to focus on automatic vehicle identification, electronic toll collection, highway advisory radio, variable message signage, advanced traveller information systems, and other steps that would reduce congestion and promote a smoother flow of traffic throughout the corridors; and (3) in designating and providing funding for such corridors, to allocate not less than 50 percent of the funds appropriated under the congested corridors program to eligible State or local entities for application in between three and ten corridors with specified characteristics (such as traffic density at least 1.5 times the national average, severe or extreme nonattainment for ozone, or potential contribution to the implementation of the Administrator's strategic plan), with the balance allocated for application in corridors with a significant number of such characteristics. Authorizes appropriations. Directs that not less than five percent of appropriated funds be reserved for innovative, high-risk operational or analytical tests that do not attract substantial non-Federal commitments but are determined by the Administrator as having significant potential to help accomplish long-term goals established by the strategic plan. Specifies the Federal share for activities authorized pursuant to this Act (80 percent of the cost, with exceptions)."
