    "text": "Children's and Communities' Mental Health Systems Improvement Act of 1991 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration, to make grants to States for comprehensive community mental health services to children with serious emotional disturbances. Prohibits the Secretary from making a grant to a State unless the State is receiving payments under alcohol and drug abuse and mental health services block grant provisions. Requires non-Federal contributions in specified percentages. Requires State grantees to: (1) establish and operate one or more systems, through grants or contracts, to provide specified types of mental health services to children under 22 years of age; (2) enter into a memorandum of understanding with providers of medical, educational, and vocational counseling, vocational rehabilitation, and protection and advocacy services to facilitate the provision of such services without use of grant funds or non-Federal contributions made with respect to the grant; (3) provide case management; (4) provide services in the cultural context that is most appropriate for the child and effectively communicate, either directly or through interpreters; and (5) establish, for each child, a multidisciplinary team providing services and ensuring the development and implementation of an Individualized Services Plan and either an Individualized Education Program, an Individualized Family Services Plan, or both. Describes additional services for which a State system may provide. Requires that parents of children with serious emotional disturbances be included as members of the mental health planning council established under existing provisions. Requires that, if a charge is imposed for services under a grant, the charge be made according to a public schedule, adjusted to reflect the income of the family of the child, and not imposed on any child whose family has income and resources at or below the poverty line. Limits grants to States to five years. Requires that a State, in order to receive grants for the third, fourth, and fifth years: (1) have a plan for achieving long-term financial support for systems for comprehensive care; and (2) be making satisfactory progress in expanding access to such systems in all areas of the State. Directs the Secretary to provide to a State, on request: (1) technical assistance regarding grant applications; and (2) training and technical assistance on the planning, development, and operation of the systems under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to provide the technical assistance directly or through grants or contracts. Authorizes appropriations, earmarking a specified sum for the technical assistance and training. Limits the number of grants to ten in FY 1992."
