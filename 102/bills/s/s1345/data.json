    "text": "National Film Preservation Act of 1991 - Repeals the National Film Preservation Act of 1988 and replaces it with this Act which modifies, with emphasis on film preservation and restoration, the duties of the Librarian of Congress, the functions of the National Film Registry, and the membership and powers of the National Film Preservation Board. Requires the National Film Registry (the Registry), as established by the Librarian under this Act (and the 1988 Act), to recognize and preserve films that are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. Directs the Librarian to establish a comprehensive national film preservation program in conjunction with other major film archives. Requires such program to: (1) coordinate activities of archivists, copyright owners, and others; (2) generate public awareness and support; (3) increase films' accessibility for educational purposes; and (4) improve nationwide activities in preserving works in other media such as videotapes. Directs the Librarian, in addition to duties similar to those in the 1988 Act relating to the Registry, to ensure that there is a Registry version of each film selected for it, to the extent practicable and subject to the rights of copyright owners. Allows only copyright owners or their duly authorized licensees, or the Library of Congress (the Library) when a work is no longer protected by copyright, to place a seal and specified language on a copy of a film indicating that the film is included in the Registry. Eliminates certain labeling requirements of the 1988 Act. Revises provisions for membership, procedures, functions, and powers of the National Film Preservation Board (the Board) (already established under the 1988 Act). Directs the Librarian to endeavor to obtain: (1) by gift from the owner, an archival quality copy of a Registry version of each film included in the Registry; (2) if possible, the best surviving materials, including preprint materials; and (3) for educational and research purposes, additional related materials. Requires that all such copies and materials be maintained in a special collection to be known as the National Film Registry Collection of the Library of Congress. Establishes restrictions on use of the seal of the Registry, and remedies for violations. Directs the Librarian: (1) to conduct a study of film preservation and restoration, including activities of the Library and other major film archives in the United States; and (2) report to the Congress. Authorizes appropriations. (Effectively reauthorizes major features of the 1988 Act, with the exception of its film labeling requirements.)"
