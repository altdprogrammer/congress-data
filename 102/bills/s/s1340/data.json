    "text": "National Dairy Act of 1991 - Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act, reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural Maketing Agreement Act of 1937 to establish a milk supply management program (program). Administers the program through county dairy committees, local milk marketing boards, and a national milk marketing board. Establishes a minimum milk price of $13.60 per hundredweight. Provides for annual production cost-based price adjustments. Establishes regionally-based individual producer marketing bases and penalties for over production. Provides for unrestricted base transfers between family members. Transfers the base of a retiring producer to a county pool for allocation according to specified priorities (family members, new producers). Includes food reserves and commodity distribution programs in national milk inventories determinations. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a program approval referendum among milk producers. Sets forth minimum solid content for beverage milk (whole, lowfat, and skim)."
