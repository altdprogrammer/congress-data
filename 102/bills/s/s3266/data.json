Grants the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System temporary authority to make exceptions to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act of 1987, or the Truth in Lending Act for transactions within such disaster areas in order to facilitate recovery upon presidential determination that an emergency or major disaster exists. Grants bank regulatory agencies temporary authority to take specified measures with respect to regulated entities whose principal place of business is within a declared emergency or national disaster area upon agency determination that the action is necessary to facilitate recovery."
