    "text": "Extends through March 31, 1994, the authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs to operate a regional office in the Philippines. Ratifies any action taken by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in maintaining such regional office during the period between October 1, 1991, and the date of enactment of this Act. Extends from January 31 to December 31, 1992: (1) a temporary program of trial work periods and voluntary vocational rehabilitation evaluations for veterans receiving disability compensation at the total disability rate; (2) a program of vocational training for non-service-disabled veterans who are awarded a needs-based pension through the Department; and (3) the protection of Department health-care eligibility for a veteran whose entitlement to pension is terminated due to the receipt of income from work or training. Makes such extensions effective as of January 31, 1992. Ratifies specified actions taken by the Secretary with respect to such programs during the period beginning on February 1, 1992, and ending on the date of enactment of this Act. Extends from three to four years after its establishment the period during which a nonprofit corporation established at a Department medical center for medical research purposes must achieve recognition as a tax-exempt entity under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Extends through December 31, 1992, the authorized period for establishing such nonprofit corporations. Ratifies certain actions taken by the Secretary with respect to dissolving or establishing such nonprofit corporations during the period between October 1, 1991, and the date of enactment of this Act. Amends the Veterans' Health-Care Amendments of 1986 to extend through FY 1992 a required annual report from the Secretary to the Congress on the furnishing of hospital care. Authorizes the Secretary to issue or approve the issuance of, and to guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on, certificates evidencing an interest in a pool of mortgages made in connection with the sale of properties acquired by the Department under the housing loan guaranty program. Prohibits the guarantee of payment with respect to certificates issued or approved after December 31, 1992."
