    "text": "Mathematics and Science Teacher Recruitment and Retention Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit of $1,000 for certain full-time, public elementary and secondary school teachers who complete at an institution of higher education six credit hours in mathematics, science, or any other subject area for which the Secretary of Education determines there is a critical national need for additional teachers. Allows qualified science, mathematics, and critical-need teachers a deduction for education expenses at institutions of higher education relating to their certification. Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants available to any State for the purpose of conducting a mathematics or science secondary school feasibility study (to examine the costs and benefits of establishing a secondary school dedicated to the instruction of mathematics or science) if such State provides funds or other support in an amount of at least twice the amount of grant funds. Authorizes appropriations."
