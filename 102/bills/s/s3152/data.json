    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-08-07", 
    "text": "Jobs Through Exports Act of 1992 - Title I: Overseas Private Investment Corporation - Overseas Private Investment Corporation Amendments Act of 1992 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to revise provisions concerning the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). Provides that a country or areas within a country may be eligible for OPIC assistance if: (1) the country has established diplomatic relations with the United States; (2) the country or area is a developing country or area, or a country in transition from a nonmarket to market economy; and (3) the country respects human rights. Raises the ceiling on the per capita income levels of countries established for purposes of granting preferential consideration for, or restricting, OPIC investment projects. Authorizes OPIC, in any case in which a country no longer meets eligibility criteria, to continue its programs in the country but prohibits the extension of new assistance with respect to projects involving the country's government. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to hold OPIC's capital stock. Authorizes OPIC to establish an equity finance program (currently, a four-year pilot program to be conducted only in Subsaharan African countries and Caribbean countries designated as beneficiary countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Program). Requires contracts with investors to include provisions requiring investors to observe specified labor laws and prohibiting the use of forced labor. Prescribes monetary and criminal penalties for fraudulent activities involving OPIC. Raises the ceiling on the maximum contingent liability allowed for OPIC insurance and outstanding guarantees. Authorizes OPIC to transfer amounts from a noncredit account revolving fund to pay subsidy costs of program levels for the loan guarantee and direct loan programs. Permits OPIC to draw specified amounts for FY 1993 through 1995 from such fund for administrative costs of such programs. Eliminates OPIC's exemption from Federal taxation. Title II: Trade and Development Agency - Redesignates the Trade and Development Program as the Trade and Development Agency. Requires the Agency to disseminate information about its activities to the private sector. Sets forth Agency auditing requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 and 1993. Declares that the Agency should increase the amount of funds it provides to multilateral development banks for technical assistance grants in FY 1992 and 1993. Title III: Aid, Trade, and Competitiveness - Aid, Trade, and Competitiveness Act of 1992 - Requires the Administrator of the Agency for International Development (AID) to establish a capital projects office to: (1) develop a program that would focus solely on developmentally sound capital projects; and (2) consider opportunities for U.S. high-technology firms in supporting capital projects for developing countries and countries making the transition from nonmarket to market economies. Sets forth the activities of the capital projects office. Directs the President to report annually to the Congress on the extent to which: (1) U.S. Government resources have been expended to support capital projects in such countries and the extent of interagency coordination; and (2) U.S. Government capital projects and tied-aid credit programs have affected U.S. exports. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury, if negotiations for the implementation of the December 16, 1991, agreement within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have not been completed by August 1, 1992, to report to the Congress on: (1) the status of negotiations; (2) the causes for the failure to reach an agreement by that date; and (3) the reasons the U.S. Government believes that continued negotiations will result in achieving such objective. Urges the President to use specified types and amounts of assistance for grants for capital projects. Directs the President to report to specified congressional committees on the feasibility of allowing AID to offer credit guarantees for the financing of capital projects. Authorizes additional appropriations for FY 1993 for the Trade and Development Agency. Title IV: United States Commercial Centers - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish, as a five-year pilot program, a United States Commercial Center in one of the independent states of the former Soviet Union or a Baltic State and in one country in Asia and Latin America to provide additional resources for the promotion of exports of U.S. goods and services to such countries. Requires the Centers to make business facilities and services and commercial law information services available on a user fee basis. Directs the Secretary to use the Market Development Cooperator Program to assist in carrying out the purposes of the Centers. Authorizes appropriations. Title V: Other Export Promotion Activities - Requires the Secretary of Commerce to appoint one or more procurement officers to promote exports of U.S. goods and services by: (1) acting as liaisons between the business community and multilateral development banks; and (2) assuring that U.S. businesses are fully informed of bidding opportunities for multilateral development bank projects and that they can focus on projects in which they have a particular interest or competitive advantage. Directs the Secretary to ensure that such officers make special efforts to disseminate information on proposed projects to small- and medium-sized businesses."
