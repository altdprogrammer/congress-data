    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-05-19", 
    "text": "Youth Skills Training and Education Partnerships Act - Title I: Standards of Excellence in Workforce Training - Amends the Wagner-Peyser Act to add a title II, Workforce Training, including: (1) subtitle A, Professional and Technical Standards for Workforce Training, to establish a voluntary system of occupational certification; and (2) subtitle B, Youth Skills Training and Education Programs, to encourage the formation of youth skills training and education partnerships by allowing certain business contributions to such programs to qualify for specified tax exemptions and augmented deductions. (Provides that the current provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act shall be under a title I, Federal Employment Service.) Establishes a National Board for Professional and Technical Standards (the National Board). Directs the National Board to establish advisory committees for each major industry and for major occupations that involve more than one industry. Requires the National Board to: (1) by December 1, 1993, identify at least 30 industrial or occupational categories and develop proficiency standards, curricula, and assessments for such industries or occupations; and (2) develop a program to ensure that proficiency standards, curricula, and assessments for all remaining identified industrial or occupational categories are completed by January 1, 1997. Requires that such proficiency standards be applied so that their attainment is likely to meet requirements for transferable credit and enable students to continue their education and training. Requires that such proficiency standards, curricula, and assessments for an industry or occupation be made available for voluntary use by postsecondary education institutions offering professional and technical education, labor organizations, trade and technical associations, employers and labor-management organizations providing formalized training, and other organizations. Authorizes appropriations for the National Board's activities. Sets forth requirements under which youth skills training and education programs, as defined under the Wagner-Peyser Act provisions added by this Act, shall qualify for purposes of specified tax exemptions and deductions for business contributions under the Internal Revenue Code. Requires such a program to: (1) give students in grades 11 and 12 the opportunity to voluntarily enter into such programs that integrate academic and workplace instruction leading to a high school diploma and qualifying the student for further education or an advanced technical or professional training program; (2) provide each student, upon program completion, with assistance in seeking post-program employment and further education and training in the student's program field; and (3) be certified by a State or local educational agency as meeting its educational standards; and (4) be certified by a State agency for occupational training as meeting specified requirements relating to training standards, school coordinator, written training agreement, review and evaluation, labor standards, nondiscrimination, nondisplacement, nonduplication, and qualified use of contributions. Title II: Youth Skills Training and Education Partnerships - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for: (1) a tax exemption for youth skills training and education partnerships (which meet program qualifications under the Wagner-Peyser Act); and (2) an augmented deduction for contributions by businesses to such partnerships. Title III: Study - Directs the Secretaries of Labor, of Education, and of the Treasury, or their delegates, to jointly study the effects of the amendments made by this Act and report results and recommendations to specified congressional committees."
