Establishes eight regional primaries to be held in each presidential election year. Sets the dates for such primaries. Directs the Federal Elections Commission to determine the order in which such primaries shall be held by lot. Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil suit in U.S. district court when there is reason to believe that a State is holding a primary in violation of this Act. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) reduce by 20 percent the payments for which a candidate is entitled from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund if the candidate is a candidate of a political party for which a presidential primary was conducted in any State in violation of this Act; and (2) make compliance with this Act a prerequisite for any entitlement by a political party to payments from such Fund. Authorizes appropriations."
