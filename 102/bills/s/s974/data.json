    "text": "Heinz Elder Life Program Act - Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to modify the definition of \"information and referral\" to include services for older individuals that: (1) assess their problems and capacities; (2) link older individuals to available opportunities and needed services; and (3) benefit the entire older community. Elevates the status of the Commissioner on Aging to Assistant Secretary. Directs the Assistant Secretary to establish a Commission to study existing reporting requirements and related programs and make legislative and regulatory recommendations to achieve specified objectives. Includes as functions of the Assistant Secretary the: (1) establishment of information and assistance services as priority services for the aged and aging; and (2) development of guidelines for choosing legal assistance providers and developers. Requires area agencies on aging: (1) to establish an informal grievance procedure for older individuals who are dissatisfied with, or denied, services with further appeal to the appropriate area agency on aging; and (2) in providing legal assistance, to give priority to legal problems related to income, health care, long-term care, nutrition, housing and utilities, defense of guardianship, abuse and neglect, and age discrimination. Requires State plans to also provide priority legal assistance in such areas. Requires technical assistance and training to State long-term care ombudsman programs to include assistance in recruiting and retaining volunteers for ombudsman programs by establishing a national program for recruitment efforts. Requires State agencies on aging to encourage adoption of memoranda of understanding between legal assistance providers and long-term care ombudsman providers that will ensure that the providers will coordinate services to the greatest extent possible. Requires the program for the prevention of abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older individuals to require that State agencies make all reasonable efforts to resolve any conflicts with other public agencies with respect to the confidentiality of information in complaints and other reports of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of older individuals by entering into memoranda of understanding that limit information disclosure according to current guidelines. Establishes a program to provide transportation services to older individuals. Authorizes appropriations. Makes legal assistance agencies eligible to participate in demonstration projects for developmental disabilities and mental illness established under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act and under the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986. Reauthorizes and extends such demonstration projects through FY 1993. Adds a new section to provide for demonstration projects to determine the feasibility of using the aging network as the infrastructure for a comprehensive long-term care system. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Assistant Secretary to establish a program of grants to State agencies to support and assist older individuals by providing legal assistance in areas such as living wills, durable powers of attorney, and other life planning areas. Authorizes appropriations."
