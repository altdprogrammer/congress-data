Title III: Eligibility for Assistance - Requires the Baltic States and Soviet republics, in order to be eligible for assistance under this Act (other than emergency or humanitarian assistance), to be: (1) in compliance with the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe; (2) making progress toward establishing democratic states and market-based economies; (3) in compliance with all applicable U.S. laws; and (4) certified by the President as meeting such requirements.
