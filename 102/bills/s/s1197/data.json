Removes provisions authorizing a reduction in grant amounts by the value of supplies or equipment furnished. Authorizes appropriations for the projects. Repeals provisions authorizing formula grants to States for family planning services. Replaces provisions authorizing grants and contracts for training personnel to carry out the family planning projects with provisions authorizing grants and contracts for technical assistance, clinical training for personnel, training for educators and counselors, and training of other personnel to carry out the family planning projects and information and education programs. Authorizes appropriations. Allows grants and contracts for research on contraceptive development to be used: (1) for contraceptive evaluation; and (2) to improve the clinical management and direct delivery of family planning services. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct, and make grants and contracts for the conduct of: (1) applied research into the development of new or improved contraceptive devices, drugs, and methods; and (2) evaluations of the acceptance, convenience, safety, efficacy, and cost of contraceptive devices, drugs, and methods. Authorizes appropriations. Replaces provisions authorizing grants and contracts for developing and making available family planning and population growth information to all persons desiring such information with provisions authorizing grants or contracts to establish community-based information and education programs to assist individuals in making responsible choices concerning human sexuality, pregnancy, and parenthood, and to enable individuals to prevent unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct, or make grants and contracts for the conduct of, training and technical assistance activities to assist in carrying out the information and education programs; and (2) make grants and contracts for the development, evaluation, and dissemination of educational and informational materials. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to annually collect data on: (1) the numbers of low- and moderate-income individuals and adolescents at risk of unintended pregnancies; (2) the sources of funding for family planning services; and (3) the number of individuals who receive family planning services from grantees and contractees under certain provisions amended by this Act and the types of services chosen by those individuals. Authorizes grants and contracts for the collection of the data. Requires the data to be: (1) made public; and (2) included in an annual report to the Congress, mandated by current law, on family planning and population research. Requires that all grantees under the title of the Public Health Service Act relating to population research and family planning provide education to patients concerning self breast examinations. Requires that projects receiving assistance under such title offer pregnant women information and counseling concerning all legal and medical options regarding their pregnancies. Requires that women requesting such information be provided with nondirective counseling, and referral on request, concerning alternative courses of action, including: (1) prenatal care and delivery; (2) infant care, foster care, or adoption services; and (3) pregnancy termination."
