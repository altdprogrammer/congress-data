    "text": "Food for Freedom Act - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to replace the food for progress program with a food for freedom program. Authorizes the President to enter into agricultural commodity assistance agreements with eligible countries (countries in transformation to representative democracies or free enterprise economies), private voluntary organizations, businesses, or cooperatives. Makes such commodities available either through Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) stocks or purchases. Sets forth eligible program expenses. Limits annual CCC expenditures. Sets forth program agreement requirements for private voluntary organizations, businesses, or cooperatives. Amends the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to permit such program to be used in conjunction with existing programs under such Act. Authorizes the waiver of U.S. currency repayment requirements under the direct credit program."
