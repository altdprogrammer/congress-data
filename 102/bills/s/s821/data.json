Authorizes the Secretary to acquire the lands and waters for inclusion in the refuge. Establishes the Silvio Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge when sufficient property has been acquired that can be effectively managed as a refuge. Directs the Secretary to: (1) identify additional areas outside the refuge but within the basin, the conservation of which would further the purposes of the refuge; (2) identify activities outside the refuge but related to the basin that may adversely affect those purposes; and (3) provide assistance to, education for or with, or enter into cooperative agreements with private and public entities with respect to the wise use and management of those additional areas and activities. Establishes the Silvio Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge Advisory Committee. Authorizes the Secretary to construct, administer, and maintain within the refuge up to four Silvio Conte National Fish and Wildlife Education Centers. Authorizes appropriations."
