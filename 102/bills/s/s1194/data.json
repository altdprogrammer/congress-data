    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1991-06-11", 
    "text": "Federal Transit Act of 1991 - Amends Federal law to rename the Urban Mass Transportation Administration of the Department of Transportation the Federal Transit Administration. Amends the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to rename it the Federal Transit Act (the Act). Amends the Act to declare as one of the findings of the Congress that significant improvements in public transportation are necessary to achieve national goals for improved air quality, energy conservation, international competitiveness, and mobility for elderly persons, persons with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged persons in urban and rural areas. Declares that one of the purposes of this Act is to provide financial assistance to State and local governments and their instrumentalities to help implement such national goals as they relate to the mobility of such persons. Declares congressional support for a Federal policy that promotes increased use of employer-provided commuter transit benefits. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to enter into: (1) full funding contracts with applicants for capital grants for mass transportation projects; and (2) early systems work agreements (which promote completion of such projects more rapidly and at less costs) with such applicants if specified conditions are met. Limits the total estimated amount of Federal contingent commitments to incur obligations covered by early systems work agreements and full funding contracts to no more than the amount authorized under this section or 50 percent of the uncommitted cash balance remaining in the mass transit account of the Highway Trust Fund, including amounts received from taxes and interest earned in excess of amounts previously obligated, whichever is greater, less an amount estimated by the Secretary to cover capital grants which are not covered by a letter of intent. Prohibits the total amount of contingent commitments included in such agreements and contracts from exceeding any limitation contained in law. Allocates funds from the amounts available for capital grants and loans for mass transportation projects for: (1) rail modernization; (2) construction of new fixed guideway systems and extensions; and (3) the replacement, rehabilitation, and purchase of buses and related equipment and the construction of bus-related facilities. Sets forth a formula for the allocation of funds for rail modernization: (1) of historic rail systems first; and (2) then new fixed guideway systems. Authorizes the remainder of project costs (local share) for mass transportation systems to include the cost of rolling stock previously purchased if certain requirements are met. Continues in force and effect all existing letters of intent, full funding agreements, and letters of commitment issued before enactment of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to make capital grants and loans to States and local public bodies for: (1) projects for the deployment of innovative techniques and methods in the management and operation of public transportation services; (2) mass transportation services for elderly persons and persons with disabilities; and (3) the development of corridors to support fixed guideway systems, including certain bus service improvements. Revises criteria for the making of capital grants or loans for construction of new fixed guideway systems of extensions to require the Secretary to consider the following factors when making such determinations: (1) direct and indirect costs of relevant alternatives; and (2) costs related to congestion relief, improved mobility, air and noise pollution, congestion, energy consumption, and associated ancillary and mitigation costs necessary to implement each alternative analyzed. Permits consideration also of existing land use policies, including the degree to which the project increases the mobility of the population or promotes economic development, and other appropriate factors. Directs the Secretary to issue guidelines for evaluating cost-effectiveness, local financial commitment, stability assessment, and project advancement. Exempts certain projects from such new starts criteria and the limitation of development to one corridor. Prohibits the amount of interest on bonds issued by a State or local public body for a mass transportation project that is considered part of the Federal share of such project's costs from being greater than the most favorable interest terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. Provides that the Federal share of project costs involved in the acquisition of bus-related equipment required by the Clean Air Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 shall be 90 percent. Requires the Secretary to give reasonable consideration to differences in the fiscal capacity of State and local governments whenever special consideration is given to mass transportation projects that include more than the minimum non-Federal share of such project's net cost. Declares it is in the national interest to promote the development of transportation systems that integrate various modes of transportation, maximize mobility of people and goods within urbanized areas, and minimize transportation-related fuel consumption and air pollution. Requires the designation by agreement among the Governor and units of general purpose local government representing at least 75 percent of the affected population of metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) for each urbanized area with a population of more than 50,000. Authorizes the designation of more than one MPO within a metropolitan statistical area if specified conditions are met. Includes within the boundaries of a metropolitan area any area that: (1) is a nonattainment area for any transportation-related pollutant under the Clean Air Act; or (2) is likely to be significantly affected by air pollution within a reasonable period of time. Directs the Secretary to establish requirements to encourage Governors and MPO's with responsibility for a portion of a multi-State Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) to provide coordinated transportation planning for the entire MSA or CMSA. Requires the Secretary to designate as transportation management areas any metropolitan areas that: (1) have populations of more than 250,000; or (2) are noncompliance areas under the Clean Air Act. Requires the Secretary to publish a list of such areas annually. Grants the consent of the Congress to any two or more States to enter into agreements or compacts: (1) for cooperation and mutual assistance in support of transportation activities; and (2) to establish agencies to make such agreements and compacts effective. Requires each MPO to prepare for its metropolitan area a metropolitan strategy that at a minimum: (1) identifies transportation facilities (including major roadways, mass transit, and multimodal and intermodal facilities) that should function as an integrated metropolitan transportation system, emphasizing those facilities that serve specified national and regional transportation functions; (2) assesses major demands on the metropolitan transportation system (projected over the subsequent 20-year period); (3) sets forth a long-range strategy for meeting metropolitan area personal mobility and goods transportation needs, including State and local actions to improve transportation efficiency and capacity; (4) explains how proposed transportation decisions will achieve compliance with specified environmental and resource conservation laws, further energy conservation programs, and affect other concerns of the metropolitan area such as housing, community development, and historic preservation; (5) includes a financial plan that demonstrates how such strategy can be implemented; (6) projects capital investment and other measures to ensure the preservation and most efficient use of existing transportation facilities; and (7) indicates proposed transportation enhancement activities. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for the development of abbreviated strategies for metropolitan areas not designated as a transportation management area. Requires States to develop a statewide transportation strategy that takes into account the transportation needs of areas that have no MPO. Directs the MPO to develop and submit to the Secretary for review a transportation improvement program for at least a three-year period and, to the extent practicable, for subsequent periods of at least three years. Requires States to develop and submit similar programs. Requires each MPO to submit to the Governor and the Secretary a list of highway and transit projects for its transportation management area. Prohibits any such projects that are funded under the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1991 or this Act from being approved unless they are included in the list of projects approved by an MPO. Sets forth specified projects that are exempted from such approval requirement. Authorizes the Secretary to contract for and make grants to States and local public bodies and agencies, or enter into agreements with other Federal departments and agencies, for the planning, engineering, design, and evaluation of public transportation projects, and for other specified technical studies. Encourages to the maximum extent feasible the participation of private enterprise with respect to such plans and programs. Requires the Secretary to ensure that capital and block transportation grants be used to support balanced and comprehensive transportation planning that takes account of the relationships among land use and all transportation modes, without regard to the programmatic source of such planning funds. Sets forth a formula for the allocation of planning funds to metropolitan areas and transportation management areas. Declares that the Federal share of costs for such transportation planning activities shall be 75 percent, except where the Secretary determines that it is in the Federal interest not to require a State or local matching share. Increases the amount allocated in each fiscal year for block grants for public transportation projects in urbanized areas with populations of less and more than 200,000. Authorizes grants for construction projects in designated transportation management areas to be made available for highway projects if specified requirements are met. Revises the formula for apportioning public transportation block grants for urbanized areas according to fixed guideway revenue vehicle or route miles, and bus revenue vehicle miles and bus passenger miles. (Repeals the \"incentive tier.\") Declares that a recipient's apportionment for such grants shall not be reduced because of a reduction in equipment use if such recipient demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that such actions would achieve energy or operating efficiencies and provide the same frequency of revenue service to the same number of riders. Applies specified safety provisions of the Act to public transportation block grants. Requires certain certifications that must be submitted annually by a public transportation block grantee to be consolidated into a single document as part of such grantees' application. Requires the Secretary to publish a list of all required certifications annually. Requires the Secretary to establish streamlined administrative procedures to govern compliance with certification requirements with respect to block grantee control over track and signal equipment used in ongoing operations. Revises certain requirements of block grantees with respect to the preparation of a proposed program of projects to require them to assure that such program provides for the maximum feasible coordination of public transportation services assisted under the Act with transportation services assisted by other Federal sources. Amends the Federal Mass Transportation Act of 1987 to repeal specified conditions relating to the construction of a certain segment of Interstate Route I-95 in Florida in order to permit continued Federal operating assistance for commuter rail service in southern Florida. Amends the Act to include research on transportation safety as a responsibility of each university transportation center established under it. Requires the Secretary to: (1) coordinate the research, education, training and technology transfer in such centers and the dissemination of the results of the research; and (2) provide for a clearinghouse between the centers and the transportation industry. Authorizes the Secretary to make funds appropriated to the Department of Transportation for transportation research available to one or more of such centers for research that is compatible with research conducted in them pursuant to authorizations under the Act or the Highway Trust Fund. Directs the Secretary to make grants to colleges or universities to establish three additional National Centers for Transportation Management, Research, and Development as a way to accelerate the involvement of minorities and women in transportation-related professions, particularly in the science, technology, and engineering disciplines. Prohibits the Secretary from using any method to propose or implement rulemaking under the Act other than formal rulemaking procedures. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer facilities and equipment acquired by a recipient of Federal transportation funds but no longer needed to any public body for any public use for at least five years after such transfer. Sets forth specified determinations to be made by the Secretary with respect to the transfer of such assets for purposes other than for mass transportation. Authorizes the Secretary to allow the solicitation for a turnkey system project (a vendor-specific project under which a recipient contracts with a vendor to build and operate a transit system that meets specific performance criteria) to be awarded before Federal requirements are met so long as such award is made without prejudice to their implementation as a means to advance new technologies and lower the cost of constructing new mass transportation systems. Authorizes the Secretary to approve no more than four projects for an initial demonstration phase. Authorizes a recipient that procures rolling stock with Federal transportation assistance to enter into multiyear agreements for the purchase of such stock and replacement parts in which the recipient may exercise an option to purchase additional stock or replacement parts for no more than a five-year period from the date of the original contract. Directs the Secretary to permit two or more recipients to form a consortium to purchase such stock. Changes the term \"elderly and handicapped persons\" to \"elderly persons and persons with disabilities\" with respect to the provision of mass transportation services that meet their special needs. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and loans to the Governor of each State for allocation to State-approved private nonprofit organizations and public bodies (currently, such assistance goes directly to private nonprofit corporations and associations) to assist them in providing transportation services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations to allow vehicles purchased with such assistance to be leased to local public bodies and agencies as a means of improving transportation services to such individuals. Authorizes States to transfer facilities and equipment acquired with Federal transportation assistance for nonurbanized areas or elderly persons and persons with disabilities to any recipient eligible to receive such assistance if such equipment or facilities continues to be used in accordance with its requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to retain and continue to use any funds returned in connection with grants or contracts for programs that address human resource needs with respect to public transportation activities. Authorizes appropriations from the Mass Transit Account and Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund and from the general fund of the Treasury for FY 1992 through 1996 for formula and capital grant programs for mass transportation projects. Earmarks a specified amount of such funds and funds appropriated under the National Capital Transportation Act of 1969 for: (1) metropolitan planning activities; (2) rural transit assistance programs; (3) State and national transportation planning and research programs; (4) administrative expenses of the Secretary; (5) transportation services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities; and (6) university transportation centers. Makes specified amounts of such funds available for: (1) completion of interstate transfer transit projects; and (2) block grants for transportation projects in urbanized areas. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on safety conditions in mass transportation. Prohibits the Secretary from using more than three-quarters of one percent (currently, one-half of one percent) of funds for mass transportation projects to contract with persons overseeing the construction of such projects. Makes funds available for: (1) State transit cooperative research programs; and (2) State transportation planning and research in urbanized areas. Requires the Secretary, as part of such program, to establish an independent governing board to recommend mass transportation research, development, and technology transfer activities. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to, and enter into cooperative agreements with, the National Academy of Sciences to implement such activities. Makes funds available to the Secretary for grants or contracts for national mass transportation programs. Earmarks a specified amount of such funds for: (1) transit-related technical assistance, demonstration programs, research, public education, and other appropriate activities to help transit providers to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; and (2) special urban transportation demonstration initiatives. Authorizes the Secretary to undertake a program of transit technology development. Requires the Secretary to establish an Industry Technical Panel to assist in identifying priority technology development areas and in setting guidelines for project development, project cost sharing, and project execution. Authorizes funds for mass transportation projects appropriated before October 1, 1983, and remaining available for expenditure after October 1, 1991, to be transferred to the most recent appropriation for such projects. Requires the Comptroller General to submit to the Congress specified reports evaluating: (1) the impact of existing charter service regulations; and (2) the extent to which the Nation's transit needs are being adequately addressed. Revises the formula for determining a State's apportionment for grants for urban mass transit programs, block grants for mass transportation projects in urbanized areas with populations of less than 200,000, and formula grants for mass transportation projects in nonurbanized areas. Requires the use of population estimates prepared by the Secretary of Commerce after the expiration of four and eight years after the most recent Federal census becomes available. Requires the Secretary for FY 1992 to use 1990 Federal census data to determine State allocations for mass transportation assistance: (1) to urbanized and nonurbanized areas; and (2) for providing transportation services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities."
