    "text": "Federal Resource Efficient Building Materials Act of 1992 - Requires the Administrator of General Services to establish a three-year pilot program to demonstrate the acquisition and use of resource efficient building materials in Federal facilities and buildings. Directs the Administrator, in selecting resource efficient building materials, to use the criteria of: (1) maximizing the conservation and preservation of natural resources; and (2) ensuring that the materials are similar in quality and durability to comparable, more conventional materials, are cost competitive with comparable, more conventional materials on a life cycle cost basis, and meet appropriate environmental, public health, and safety standards. Sets forth reporting requirements. Establishes the Resource Efficient Building Material Advisory Board to: (1) advise the Administrator on the latest developments in resource efficient building materials and design and on how such developments may be incorporated into the construction of Federal buildings; and (2) make recommendations to the Administrator on actions needed to further facilitate the acquisition and use of resource efficient materials in Federal construction and to minimize the generation of solid waste in the construction of Federal buildings and facilities. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations containing guidelines to Federal agencies on minimizing the creation of solid waste and on maximizing the use of resource efficient building materials in the construction of Federal buildings, after considering the Board's recommendations. Authorizes appropriations."
