Authorizes additional appropriations for the Secretary of Education to award grants to local educational agencies in each State to replicate the most successful programs assisted under such Act. Amends the Department of Education Organization Act of 1979 to increase by one (from four to five) the number of specified additional officers in the Department of Education who are to be appointed to carry out certain functions. Adds to such functions: (1) the evaluation, coordination, and dissemination of dropout prevention and reentry programs administered by the Department as well as federally funded dropout programs administered outside the Department; and (2) assistance in directing applicants to appropriate grant funding possibilities for local dropout prevention and reentry programs."
