    "as": "Indefinitely postponed in Senate", 
    "date": "1992-09-16", 
    "text": "Rail Safety Improvement Initiatives Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (the Act) to authorize appropriations for FY 1992 through 1994 for railroad research and development (except magnetic levitation) and general safety operations. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to request and use non-Federal funds for expenses incurred in training safety employees of private industry and of State and local authorities, except State rail safety inspectors. Declares that civil penalties with respect to the failure to comply with railroad safety rules, regulations, orders, and standards shall, to the same extent as they do to railroads, apply to: (1) any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or facilities; or (2) any independent contractor providing goods or services to a railroad. Directs the Secretary to establish operational procedures to ensure the effective use of civil enforcement authority. Directs the Secretary to establish a pilot project in at least one region of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to demonstrate the benefits that may accrue to the Federal railroad safety program from having legal counsel available in FRA regional offices. Amends Federal law to provide criminal penalties for the murder or attempted murder or manslaughter of any Federal Railroad Administration employee assigned to perform investigative, inspection, or law enforcement functions. Requires the Secretary to: (1) complete a rulemaking proceeding to consider prescribing regulations to improve the safety of locomotive cabs; and (2) conduct research in support of such rulemaking. Directs the Secretary to ensure that the Secretary of Labor is apprised of the extent to which the Secretary has exercised jurisdiction to prescribe or enforce regulations or orders affecting occupational safety or health or any other Federal railroad safety laws. Requires a report to the Congress. Requires the Secretary to transmit to specified congressional committees a report concerning any action taken by the Secretary and railroad industry to rectify problems associated with unsatisfactory work place environments in certain train dispatching offices identified in the National Train Dispatcher Safety Assessment for 1987-1988, published by the Federal Railroad Administration in July 1990. Requires the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees a report on voice communications and advanced train control systems. Amends the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 to require the Northeast Corridor Safety Committee to meet at least once every two years to consider safety matters on the main line of the Northeast Corridor. Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 to subject any final agency action taken under any Federal railroad safety laws to judicial review. Requires the Secretary to review the Department of Transportation's rules (and where applicable prescribe standards regarding dynamic braking equipment) with respect to railroad power brakes and to revise such rules based on safety data presented during such review. Requires the Secretary to promulgate rules requiring two-way end of train devices (or devices able to perform the same function) on road trains other than locals, road switchers, or work trains to enable the initiation of emergency braking from the rear of the train. Authorizes the Secretary to exclude from such rules any category of trains or railroad operations, in addition to certain ones specified, if he or she determines such exclusion is in the public interest and is consistent with railroad safety. Amends the Department of Transportation Act to authorize FY 1992 through 1994 appropriations for the local rail freight assistance program. Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 to require the General Accounting Office (GAO) to study: (1) the adequacy of the Secretary's rules, regulations, orders, and standards related to track safety; and (2) the effectiveness of the Secretary's enforcement of them, with particular attention to recent relevant railroad accident experience and data. Requires the GAO to report to the Secretary and the Congress the results of such study, together with, any recommendations. Requires the Secretary, upon receipt of such report, to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to revise such rules, regulations, orders, and standards, taking into account the report and recommendations. Requires a report to Congress on actions taken to implement the recommendations. Requires the Secretary to report to appropriate congressional committees on whether, based on data concerning train accidents in California, there are particular factors that make certain routes there inherently less safe than others for the rail transportation of hazardous materials, and, if so, what actions can be taken, without unreasonably burdening commerce, to ameliorate such factors or reduce hazardous materials traffic over any inherently unsafe routes. Requires the Secretary in preparing the report to consult with Federal agencies responsible for protecting the environment and public lands in California, and provide an opportunity for written comment by the public."
