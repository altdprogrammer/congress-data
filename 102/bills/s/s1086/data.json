Lists such sanctions as: (1) the withholding of payments out of the Hazardous Substance Superfund for remedial actions; and (2) withdrawal of authorizations of hazardous waste programs under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to make a conforming amendment regarding the withdrawal of authorization for such programs. Authorizes States in compliance with hazardous waste capacity assurance plans under CERCLA to: (1) deny permits to hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facilities if the capacity of such facilities is not needed; (2) place prohibitions or restrictions on the transportation into such States of hazardous waste generated in other States; and (3) impose fees on hazardous waste or hazardous waste transporters that differentiate rates of payment on the basis of waste origin."
