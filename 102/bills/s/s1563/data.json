Requires that the Program Director oversee the Office. Empowers the Secretary of Commerce to accept funds from other Federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities to pay for and add to (currently, to pay for) grants and contracts. Authorizes appropriations to carry out specified provisions of the Sea Grant Act. Repeals provisions of the Sea Grant Act authorizing grants and contracts for a sea grant strategic research plan. Amends the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (Aquatic Nuisance Act) to generally authorize appropriations for grants under the Sea Grant Act. (Currently, the provisions of the Aquatic Nuisance Act being amended here authorize appropriations only for grants for the sea grant research plan under the Sea Grant Act.)"
