    "text": "War Crimes Prevention Education Act of 1991 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit foreign assistance to any country whose government engages in a consistent pattern of violations of international humanitarian law in situations of armed conflict. Prohibits, unless the President certifies to specified congressional officials that extraordinary circumstances warrant provision of such assistance: (1) foreign assistance to such countries' law enforcement forces and the issuance of licenses for the export of crime control and detection equipment to such countries; and (2) international military education and training assistance to such countries. Prohibits foreign assistance to any country that refuses to provide assurances that its training programs for military officers will include instruction on compliance with international humanitarian law in situations of armed conflict or whose armed forces commit violations of such law during an armed conflict. Waives such prohibition if national security interests warrant such waiver. Directs the Secretary of State, as part of the presentation materials for foreign assistance programs, to report on the observance of guarantees of international humanitarian law in situations of armed conflict in each country proposed as a recipient of foreign assistance. Requires the Secretary, at the request of the Congress, to submit information concerning a country's observance of such guarantees. Prohibits the delivery of foreign assistance to a country if the requested information is not submitted. Makes available funding for countries that have improved their records in observing international humanitarian law. Exempts training relating to international humanitarian guarantees in situations of armed conflict from a prohibition on the provision of police training assistance to foreign countries."
