    "text": "Water Pollution Control and Estuary Restoration Financing Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to extend the authorization of appropriations for the State water pollution control revolving fund program through FY 1999. Requires a specified percentage (increasing with each succeeding fiscal year) of such appropriations to be used by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to make capitalization grants for estuary plans to qualified States. Requires States to submit estimates of the need for assistance for implementing and monitoring such plans. Prohibits the submission of such estimates unless the estimates are approved by the appropriate management conference under the National Estuary Program. Makes States that fail to submit approved estimates ineligible for assistance. Directs States to establish separate Estuary Accounts in their water pollution control revolving funds, to be used for implementing approved estuary plans. Permits loans made with amounts in such Accounts to be for terms of up to 40 years or for the useful life of a facility constructed with the loan, whichever is less, if the borrower demonstrates financial hardship. Allows States to use interest earned on amounts in such Accounts to subsidize up to 90 percent of the principal portion of debt service of certain entities that are financially unable to carry out a necessary project for an estuary plan. Establishes a State matching requirement for deposits into Accounts. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants for the implementation of estuary conservation and management plans. Limits the Federal share to 75 percent of the total cost of implementation. Authorizes appropriations. Permits certain grants under the National Estuary Program to be used for interim actions adopted by management conferences to protect the water and sediment quality of estuaries. Extends the authorization of appropriations for management conferences, grants, conservation and management plans, and research under the National Estuary Program through FY 1999. Revises provisions concerning the purposes of management conferences. Directs the Administrator to issue a guidance document that establishes requirements for: (1) management conferences to follow in developing, implementing, and monitoring conservation and management plans; and (2) approving and implementing interim actions to protect water quality of estuaries for which plans are developed. Requires management conferences to be convened for periods of at least five years (currently, up to five years). Permits the extension of a conference for an additional five years if the affected Governors concur in the extension and the extension is necessary to meet requirements. Revises approval and implementation procedures for estuary conservation and management plans and establishes such procedures for interim actions."
