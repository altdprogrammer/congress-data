    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-04-16", 
    "text": "Transportation Improvement Act of 1991 - Title I: Completion of Interstate System and Interstate Substitute Highway Projects - Amends Federal-aid highway provisions to approve the Federal interstate highway cost estimate for 1991. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to apportion funds for FY 1993 through 1998 for expenditure on the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the Interstate System through 1998. Makes States that have not completed construction of their portions of the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways by the end of FY 1995 ineligible to receive or apply for Federal-aid highway funds until such construction is completed. Extends the authorization of appropriations for Interstate Substitute highway projects through FY 1995. Title II: Obligation Authority - Limits total obligations for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs during FY 1992 through 1996. Exempts specified obligations (including discretionary interstate 4-R and bridge projects) from such limits. Sets forth provisions concerning the distribution, limitation, and redistribution of obligation authorities. Title III: Authorization of Appropriations Out of the Highway Trust Fund - Authorizes and allocates appropriations out of the Highway Trust Fund through FY 1996 for: (1) the Interstate 4R program; (2) the Federal-aid primary, secondary, and urban systems; (3) bridge replacement and rehabilitation; (4) space elimination of hazards; (5) railroad highway crossings; (6) forest, public lands, and park highways; (7) Indian reservation roads; (8) access highways to public recreation areas; (9) highway safety programs; (10) highway research projects; and (11) highway use tax evasion projects. Authorizes additional appropriations for Interstate 4R discretionary projects and for the discretionary bridge program. Subjects funds appropriated for FY 1991 through 1993 for off-system bridges to the existing limitation on expenditures for bridges on public roads. Authorizes appropriations for the following State apportionment bonuses: (1) the high level of effort bonus (based on a percentage of the amount by which State per capita highway spending exceeds the national average); (2) the adverse weather bonus (based on a percentage of the amount by which the number of days of temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit and non-frost free days exceeds the national average); (3) the Federal lands bonus (based on the amount of Federal lands within a State); and (4) the low density bonus (based on a State's population density). Limits total bonuses to a State to ten percent of the State's annual apportionment. Title IV: Program Flexibility - Authorizes States, upon notification of the Secretary, to transfer up to 30 percent of: (1) their apportionments for specified highway projects between project categories; and (2) their apportionments for Federal-aid urban systems to activities eligible for assistance under the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964. Subjects additional transfers to the Secretary's approval. Limits total transfers from a category to 50 percent of the apportionment. Permits States, subject to the Secretary's approval and under certain conditions, to transfer funds apportioned pursuant to this Act for the completion of the System of Interstate and Defense Highways to other specified categories. Title V: Additional Provisions - Continues the current Federal-aid primary apportionment formula through FY 1996. Revises provisions concerning Federal participation in toll facilities to remove limitations on the number and types of facilities in which the Federal Government may participate. Permits tolls on a facility to be continued indefinitely, without sanction imposed by the Secretary, if tolls are used for eligible purposes. Authorizes appropriations for the right-of-way revolving fund. Permits States, in any case where sufficient land exists within rights-of-way of a Federal-aid highway to accommodate rail or nonhighway public mass transit facilities and where such accommodation can be accomplished without impairing automotive safety or highway improvements, to make such lands available to a mass transit authority or company. Federal Rural Tourism and Recreational Development Act of 1991 - Declares it a national goal to provide and improve safe access to public lands to encourage the development of travel and tourism opportunities in support of rural area economic development. Authorizes the use of funds under the Federal lands highways program for purposes such as: (1) transportation planning for tourism and recreational travel; (2) interpretive signage and development of public road facilities for areas of historical, archeological, cultural, and scenic interests; (3) construction and reconstruction of roadside rest areas; and (4) other appropriate facilities as determined by the Secretary. Specifies that funds available for forest development roads and trails may be made available for such purposes, as well. Requires the Secretary to authorize Federal aid highway projects for pedestrian and bicycle facilities to encourage alternative modes of transportation for tourism and recreational purposes. Authorizes the motorized use of trails and walkways, subject to State and local regulations. (Under current law, motorized vehicles are prohibited except for maintenance purposes and, when snow conditions and State or local regulations permit, snowmobiles.) Directs the Secretary to: (1) annually allocate sums authorized to be appropriated for access highways to public recreation areas on certain lakes; and (2) establish and carry out a tourism and recreational travel technical assistance program in non-urbanized areas. Makes funds available from forest and public lands highways funds for recreational travel and tourism projects. Requires each State using funds provided in this Act to have a multipurpose land use statewide driving and recreation travel plan. Permits Federal participation in the construction, refurbishment, and operation (currently, construction) of ferry boats. Requires increases in the Federal share payable on highway projects if a State certifies to the Secretary that it has developed comprehensive plans with mandatory land use and transportation elements."
