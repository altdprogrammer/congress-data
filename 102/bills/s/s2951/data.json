    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-07-02", 
    "text": "Amends the Small Business Act to require the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of the Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set a goal of allocating a specified percentage of funds in FY 1993 through 1997 for contracts with small businesses owned and operated by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals for procurement related to DOE and EPA environmental cleanup and hazardous waste remediation activities. Requires the EPA Administrator and the Secretaries of Energy and the Interior to provide to such businesses: (1) technical assistance and advocacy; (2) technology transfer; (3) advanced payments; and (4) the use of less than full and open competitive procedures when entering into contracts, if the price paid to such businesses does not exceed the fair market value by more than ten percent per contract. Directs the Secretaries and the Administrator to enforce goals applicable to the award of a percentage of the total subcontracting expenditures by a prime contractor to such businesses. Provides for the payment of liquidated damages if a prime contractor has failed to make a good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting requirement. Grants prime contractors an opportunity to demonstrate good faith prior to the imposition of damages. Requires the Secretaries and the Administrator to: (1) regularly identify forthcoming procurements of significant size and duration with the potential for participation by such businesses; (2) work closely with representatives of such businesses to implement a plan to maximize their participation as subcontractors and suppliers; and (3) establish a mentor-protege program to promote the development, expansion, and technological sophistication of such businesses. Outlines the elements of the mentor program. Provides for reimbursements to a mentor firm for progress or advanced payments or assistance made to a protege firm. Permits unreimbursed costs incurred by a mentor firm in providing such assistance to be recognized as credit in lieu of subcontract awards for determining whether the firm attains a subcontracting participation goal. Considers business concerns that are 51 percent or more owned and operated by an Indian tribe to be small business concerns under this Act. Requires the Secretaries and the Administrator to ensure that business concerns benefitting from this Act employ, to the extent practicable, persons who reside in communities that have unemployment rates that are 50 or more percent above the national average. Directs the Administrator to adopt special standard industrial classifications for the environmental cleanup and hazardous waste remediation cleanup industries. Requires the Administrator and the Secretaries to jointly develop bonding mechanisms to enable small businesses under this Act to obtain bonding necessary to obtain contracts and subcontracts in such industries."
