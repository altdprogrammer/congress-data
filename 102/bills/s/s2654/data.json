    "text": "Land and Water Conservation Fund Amendments of 1992 - Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to require the submission with the annual budget of the United States of a comprehensive statement of the estimated requirements during the ensuing fiscal year for appropriation from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for land acquisition by eligible Federal agencies and by States and local governments. Sets forth requirements with respect to: (1) allocations from the Fund, including funds for Indian tribes and Alaska Native Village Corporations; and (2) multipurpose acquisition by States. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide financial assistance to States for outdoor recreation maintenance and security. Repeals a restriction on assistance available under the Act to enclose or shelter facilities normally used for outdoor recreation activities. Permits the use of such funds, subject to specified limitations, for: (1) maintenance of facilities acquired and developed with financial assistance provided pursuant to the Act; (2) costs of law enforcement and security personnel and other security measures; and (3) development of sheltered facilities for public health or safety in connection with projects otherwise eligible for assistance under the Act. Authorizes the transfer of funds by grant recipients to private nonprofit organizations, subject to specified requirements, to be used for projects approved in writing by the grantor of the funds in connection with the acquisition of lands (or interests in lands) and the development of recreation facilities, but not for administrative expenses. Sets forth requirements regarding maintenance of expenditures by State and Federal grant recipients."
