Authorizes the establishment of a program to significantly increase the numbers of African Americans and other minorities in the foreign service of the United States. Requires such academic and professional program to be established in the Institute for International Public Policy at Howard University (Washington, D.C.) (the Institute), created by this Act, and to be in consortium with specified institutions of higher education. Allows any institution of higher education that wishes to participate in any or all aspects of such program to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with Howard University. Sets forth the components of the academic program of the Institute, including a junior year abroad, academic year and summer internships, a masters degree program, and Ralph Bunche International Fellowships for graduate study at Howard University or other institutions for students who agree to serve two years in the U.S. foreign service for each year of the fellowship. Requires Howard University and institutions of higher education in consortium with it to delegate to a nonprofit institution in the District of Columbia the administration of the Foreign Service Examination preparative and the International Careers Program, which may include the Junior Year Abroad and the Academic Year and Summer Internship programs. Authorizes appropriations."
