    "text": "Court of Federal Claims Technical and Procedural Improvements Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal judicial code to change the name of the U.S. Claims Court to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (Claims Court). Specifies that: (1) if a judge of such court is not reappointed, such judge may continue in office until a successor is appointed and takes office; (2) the annuity of a Claims Court judge on senior status after age 65 shall be comparable to that of other senior status Federal trial judges insofar as social security taxes and payments are concerned; and (3) Claims Court judges are judicial officers eligible for coverage under specified annuity and insurance programs. Extends to Claims Court judges the same treatment afforded to other Federal trial judges with respect to earned military retirement pay. Makes technical and conforming amendments regarding the recall of a senior Claims Court judge. Authorizes: (1) Claims Court judges to hire the same number of law clerks as U.S. district court judges; (2) the Claims Court to hold court throughout the United States, including its territories and possessions (currently, court may only be held in the District of Columbia (DC) and in four locations outside DC); and (3) the chief judge of the Claims Court to issue an order authorizing a judge of such court to conduct proceedings in a foreign country whose laws do not prohibit such proceedings. Directs that the facilities of the Federal courts, as well as other comparable facilities administered by the General Services Administration, be made available for proceedings outside DC. Provides the Claims Court with declaratory judgment jurisdiction. Extends ancillary jurisdiction to a tort claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act when such claim is related to an action otherwise within the court's subject matter jurisdiction. Repeals a provision denying the Claims Court jurisdiction with respect to claims pending in other courts. Makes certification of claims under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 non-jurisdictional. Makes applicable to the Claims Court provisions pertaining to costs, witness fees, forma pauperis proceedings, and counsel's liability for excessive costs which are currently applicable to other Federal trial courts. Grants the Claims Court specified powers to punish contempt of its authority and to have such assistance in carrying out its orders as is available to other Federal courts. Specifies that the U.S. marshal for any district in which the Claims Court is sitting shall, when requested by the Chief Judge of such court, attend any session of the court in such district."
