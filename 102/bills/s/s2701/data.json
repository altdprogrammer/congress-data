Requires the Secretary of Transportation, prior to April 1, 1997, to dispose of all vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet unless: (1) assigned to the Ready Reserve Force; (2) specifically authorized or required by statute to be used for a particular purpose; (3) necessary for national defense purposes (requires annual recertification); or (4) needed for State or Federal agency use (requires annual recertification). Prohibits scrapping a vessel in a foreign market. Allows use of 15 vessels being disposed of for the artificial reef program under specified Federal law. Sets forth requirements and conditions on those States which have such ships transferred to them. Prohibits changing the Master Manual for the Missouri River Basin without the written approval of the Secretary. Amends the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 to read as though a specified provision had not been repealed. (The provision being restored authorized certain uses of vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet."
