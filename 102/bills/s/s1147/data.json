Requires the United States Trade Representative to enter into discussions with representatives from member nations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and to report to the Congress on the extent to which: (1) the Arab boycotts of Israel have distorted trade; (2) members of and observers to the GATT encourage actions, including the furnishing of information or entering into agreements, which support such boycotts; (3) the GATT should work to eliminate the boycotts; and (4) GATT articles can be used to eliminate compliance with such boycotts. Requires the President to report to the Congress on progress made to end such boycotts."
