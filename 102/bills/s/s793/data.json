    "text": "Patent and Trademark Office Authorization Act of 1991 - Authorizes appropriations to the Patent and Trademark Office for FY 1992. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 to mandate that certain statutory fees be made available to the Patent and Trademark Office (Office) in specified amounts for FY 1992 through 1995 by way of a separate account established in the Treasury and ascribed to Office activities. Repeals the current 69 percent surcharge on Office fees. Allows appropriations to remain available until expended. Amends Federal patent law to direct the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) to furnish certain congressional committees with an annual report about the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office activities, including fee collections. Directs the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks (Commissioner) fees. Postpones authority to adjust such fees until October 1, 1994. Permits adjustment of trademark fees. Requires the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks (the Commissioner) to maintain, for use by the public, collections of United States patents, foreign patent documents, and United States trademark registrations. Prohibits the imposition of fees directly for use of either the collections, or for use of the public patent or trademark search rooms or libraries. Authorizes the Commissioner to establish reasonable fees for access by the public to automated search systems of the Patent and Trademark Office. Requires the Commissioner to report annually to the Congress on the Office's automated search systems and public access to them. Prohibits the Commissioner from entering into exchange agreements with respect to automatic data processing resources during FY 1992. Exempts from such prohibition agreements relating to data for automation programs entered into with an international entity or foreign government. Authorizes the Commissioner to indemnify Patent and Trademark Office personnel who participated in the Law School Tuition Assistance Program of the Patent and Trademark Office, against tax liability incurred as a result of payments made to law schools under that program in specified tax years. Includes among the Commissioner's duties the authority to identify, assess and forecast the technology of patented inventions and their utility to industry. Requires the Comptroller General to report to certain congressional committees at least once every five years (currently annually) on the manner in which agencies implement certain patent rights in inventions made with Federal assistance. Directs the Commissioner to establish: (1) a test program to disseminate certain patent information; and (2) report to the Congress on its implementation within a certain deadline."
