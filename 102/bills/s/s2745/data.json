Establishes an interagency committee, composed of the Secretaries of Labor, of Education, and of Commerce, to: (1) establish procedures for submission and review of plans by States; and (2) determine if such plans meet the criteria. Directs the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) to perform specified functions under this Act in consultation with the committee, including providing for criteria and safeguards compliance determination procedures, monitoring data collection, evaluation, review of fund use, policy guidance, resources and technical assistance, recognition and dissemination of outstanding programs, and research and demonstration activities. Directs the Governor of a participating State to submit to the Secretary a biennial State plan for youth apprenticeship programs which meets specified requirements. Directs the Governor also to designate the appropriate State authority to: (1) develop certain program guidelines for designating local entities and for including long-term employment possibilities; (2) certify that local programs meet the criteria, safeguards, and other appropriate standards; (3) provide technical assistance and other support to local entities and employers; and (4) provide for data collection, monitoring, and program evaluation. Requires local entities to ensure programs meet the criteria, safeguards, and other applicable standards. Requires participating schools to provide for career exploration and academic development to meet program entry and participation requirements. Requires local employers (in collaboration with labor organizations where appropriate) to: (1) employ youth apprentices; (2) assist participating schools in ensuring that curriculum content is relevant to the workplace; (3) take primary responsibility for ensuring success of worksite learning and work experience; and (4) inform local schools of each youth apprentice's performance. Requires local private industry councils to review and approve local youth apprenticeship programs to ensure that such programs: (1) meet local labor market demands; and (2) provide apprentices with broad-based competencies and transferable skills that facilitate career progression within the industries or trades in which the student is trained and employed. Sets forth the national youth apprenticeship criteria for programs, including criteria with respect to: (1) academic instruction; (2) work-based learning; (3) worksite learning and experience; (4) agreement commitment by youth apprentices, parents or guardians, employers (in collaboration with labor organizations where appropriate), and local educational agencies; (5) agreement provisions for educational outcomes and for wages and hours; and (6) information and guidance. Allows local entities to design programs using alternative program components, including specified models for tech-prep education and vocational education, and providing for formal coordination with other tech-prep programs and postsecondary education and training.

Sets forth the relationship of youth apprenticeship programs under this Act to other laws, including: (1) special lower minimum wages and student-learner requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938; and (2) specified programs under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Act, the Job Training Partnership Act, and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Directs the Secretary to conduct studies to: (1) evaluate activities under this Act and other appropriate issues; and (2) examine State and local use, in support of this Act, of funds under specified Federal laws and of any other Federal, State, local, or private resources.
