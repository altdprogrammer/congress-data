    "text": "Tied Aid Credit Reduction Act of 1991 - Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to revise the purpose of the tied aid credit program to: (1) target the export markets of countries that, in the judgment of the Export-Import Bank, make extensive, unreasonable use of tied aid or partially untied aid credits for commercial advantage in order to support development of an international arrangement to eliminate such use of tied aid and partially untied credits; and (2) monitor observance of any such arrangement by extending tied aid credits to match those of other countries made in violation of the terms of such agreement, or other unreasonable use of such aid, as determined by the Bank. Directs the Bank to supplement, through grants made available from the Tied Aid Credit Fund, the financing of U.S. exports to foreign markets which are actual or potential export markets for any country which the Bank determines fails to observe provisions of such international arrangements or otherwise provides such credits in an unreasonable manner. Authorizes appropriations to the Tied Aid Credit Fund. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to define as an unreasonable act, policy, or practice under such Act any act, policy, or practice which constitutes an unreasonable use of tied aid or partially untied aid credits to subsidize exports."
