Directs the Secretary to administer the historic site in accordance with this Act and all laws generally applicable to units of the National Park System and to national historic sites. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into cooperative agreements with the State of New York, the Thomas Cole Foundation, and other public and private entities to facilitate public understanding and enjoyment of the lives and works of the Hudson River artists, and with the Greene County Historical Society to provide for the establishment of a library and research center at the historic site; and (2) display, and accept for the purposes of display, works of art associated with Thomas Cole and other Hudson River artists as may be necessary for the interpretation of this historic site. Directs the Secretary, within two complete fiscal years after the date of this Act's enactment, to develop a general management plan for the historic site (and, upon its completion, to submit such plan to specified congressional committees). Requires the plan to include recommendations for regional wayside exhibits, to be carried out through cooperative agreements with the State of New York and other public and private entities. Authorizes appropriations."
