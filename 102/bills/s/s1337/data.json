    "text": "Anti-Gang Violence Act of 1991 - Title I: Gang Violence - Declares that drug trafficking and related gang violence require coordinated and immediate Federal action. Requires the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) to establish direct liaison with State and local law enforcement agencies having responsibility for gang investigations and efforts to combat gang-related firearms violations. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 to: (1) the BATF for the creation of a new Anti-Gang Unit; and (2) the Attorney General to provide prosecutors and support staff to aid the Unit. Directs the head of the unit to work with Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate the resources necessary to fight gangs. Authorizes the seizure and forfeiture of personal property subject to forfeiture under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in connection with an investigation of a violation of such Act. Prohibits the transportation of a minor to assist in avoiding detection or apprehension with respect to drug-related activity. Directs the court, in addition to any other fines imposed pursuant to the CSA, to impose a civil fine of $100,000 on a defendant found guilty of such offense, to be transferred to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for distribution to State and local agencies for juvenile drug rehabilitation through existing programs. Sets penalties for the distribution of firearms to a minor. Subjects an individual who possesses (under current law, uses or carries) a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime to specified terms of imprisonment. Urges the President to direct the Attorney General to establish a National Commission on Gang Intervention. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) acquire data on the incidence of criminal acts that involve gang violence for calendar years 1990 through 1995; and (2) publish an annual summary of such data. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1997. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 to the Office of Justice Programs of the Department of Justice (DOJ) for anti-drug abuse grants. Specifies that such grants shall be allocated to State and local task forces that include law enforcement, educational systems, and community-based organizations and that have developed coordinated programs necessary to alleviate gang activity and drug trafficking. Encourages the States to separate in State and juvenile correctional institutions inmates who are identified as members of gangs to ease the violence in prisons between rival gang factions. Authorizes appropriations to the National Institute of Corrections of the Federal Bureau of Prisons to provide technical assistance to States to facilitate the separation of gang members in State prisons. Title II: Career Criminals - Declares that the intent of the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 was to enact a sentencing enhancement provision. Amends the Federal criminal code to bar imposition of specified repeat offender enhanced penalties based upon prior convictions obtained in violation of the Constitution. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 to the BATF for the Repeat Offender Program and anti-gang activities to hire additional special agent and support personnel. Requires: (1) the National Institute of Justice to conduct a study and to report on the profile and number of career criminals in America; and (2) the DOJ's Bureau of Justice Statistics to compile and maintain statistics for the number of arrests, prosecutions, and convictions nationwide and to publish and make available to the public annual reports. Title III: Narcotics Investigative Projects and Task Force Projects - Authorizes the payment of any expenses necessary for the implementation and execution of certain narcotics investigative and task force projects from the DOJ Assets Forfeiture Fund."
