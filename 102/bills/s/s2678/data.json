    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to award grants to communities to pay the operating expenses associated with the costs and salaries incurred in the assignment of individuals within such communities as drug abuse resistance officers. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) application requirements; (2) the allocation and distribution of grants; and (3) matching requirements (that the community provide one dollar for each three dollars of Federal funds provided). Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986 to provide that specified funds shall be used for grants to local educational agencies to provide drug abuse resistance education to students in grades kindergarten through 12 and to parent training programs. (Current law makes such funds available with respect to students in grades kindergarten through six.)"
