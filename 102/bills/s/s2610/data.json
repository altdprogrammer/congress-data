Makes it unlawful for any person to export an article from a foreign country into, or cause an article to be sold within, the United States at a price that is less than the average total cost of the article, if: (1) the exportation or sale has the effect of destroying or injuring commerce, preventing the establishment of a line of commerce, or substantially lessening competition or tending to create a monopoly in any part of trade and commerce in the article in the United States; and (2) the foreign country's market in the article lacks effective price competition among competitors or is substantially closed to effective international competition. Specifies that nothing shall prevent a defendant from rebutting a prima facie case by showing that such lack of effective price competition, substantial closure to effective international competition, or both, were not a factor in the price charged."
