Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, before such transfer is complete, to certify that cleanup and remedial actions required under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 have been completed. Directs the Secretary of the Army to retain jurisdiction and control over all real property at the Arsenal used for water treatment, the disposition of hazardous substances, and other purposes related to environmental cleanup and remediation.

Continues the validity of all leases related to real property at the Arsenal after such transfer. Requires the management by the Secretary of the Interior of the Arsenal as a wildlife refuge to be subject to any required environmental cleanup and remediation activities by the Secretary of the Army. Outlines provisions concerning U.S. liability for environmental hazards present at the Arsenal both before and after final transfer under this Act.

Requires such Secretary to publish a notice of such establishment in the Federal Register. Outlines provisions concerning administration of the Refuge.
