    "text": "Abused Military Dependents Protection Act of 1992 - Directs the Secretary of a military department, upon application, to pay an annuity to an eligible spouse or former spouse of a member of the armed forces under the jurisdiction of that Secretary (spouse). Provides that a spouse is eligible to receive an annuity if: (1) after the member becomes eligible to be retired on the basis of years of service, the member's eligibility to receive retired or retainer pay is terminated as a result of misconduct of the member or former member involving abuse of a dependent; and (2) the spouse was the victim of the abuse and was married to the member at the time of that abuse or is a natural or adopted parent of a dependent child of the member who was the victim of the abuse. Makes such provisions applicable with respect to terminations of eligibility to receive retired or retainer pay as a result of a conviction by a court-martial or an administrative separation from the armed forces. Sets forth: (1) a formula for determining the amount of the annuity payable to such spouse, based on the number of years of marriage to such member; and (2) provisions with respect to termination of entitlement to such annuity. Directs the Secretary of a military department concerned to pay indemnity compensation to an eligible dependent of a member of the armed forces under the jurisdiction of that Secretary who, before becoming eligible to be retired from the armed forces on the basis of years of service, is: (1) convicted by a court-martial for an offense involving abuse of a dependent if the court-martial convening authority or a higher competent authority approves a dishonorable discharge, bad-conduct discharge, or dismissal of the member as a result of that conviction; or (2) separated from the armed forces under adverse conditions, as a result of misconduct involving abuse of a dependent. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) eligibility determinations; (2) amount of compensation; (3) period of payment; (4) commencement of payment; (5) termination of payment; and (6) offset of payments. Entitles spouses, while receiving an annuity or indemnity compensation pursuant to this Act, to: (1) receive medical and dental care to the same extent as a dependent of a retired member of the armed forces; (2) use the commissary and exchange stores on the same basis as a dependent of a retired member of the armed forces; and (3) receive any other benefits that a dependent of a retired member is entitled to receive. Sets forth further limitations with respect to such annuities and indemnity compensation. Directs the Secretary of Defense to conduct a study to: (1) determine the number of persons who became eligible to receive an annuity pursuant to this Act as of each of FY 1980 through 1992; (2) estimate the number of persons who will become eligible to receive an annuity during each of FY 1993 through 2000; (3) determine, for each of FY 1980 through 1992, the number of members of the armed forces who, after having completed between one and 20 years of service, were approved in that fiscal year for discharge or dismissal from the armed forces as a result of abuse of a spouse or dependent child; and (4) estimate, for each of FY 1993 through 2000, the number of members of the armed forces who, after having completed between one and 20 years of service in that fiscal year, will be approved in such fiscal year for discharge or dismissal from the armed forces as a result of abuse of a spouse or dependent child."
