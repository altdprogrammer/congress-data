    "text": "Revises the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to reimburse persons for travel expenses in connection with examination, treatment, or care at a Department of Veterans Affairs medical facility. Lists as eligible: (1) a veteran or other person whose travel is in connection with treatment or care for a service-connected disability; (2) a veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 50 percent or more; or (3) a veteran whose annual income does not exceed two times the basic rate of a veteran's non-service-connected disability pension. Authorizes such payments only if the veteran or other person resides beyond a 50-mile radius of the health-care facility providing such care. Repeals current Federal provisions which: (1) deduct three dollars each way from such travel expenses paid; and (2) prohibit the payment of such travel expenses unless the veteran or person has been determined unable to defray such expenses, with specified exceptions."
