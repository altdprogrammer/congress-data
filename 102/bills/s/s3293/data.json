    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-10-01", 
    "text": "Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act of 1992 - Amends Federal law to require any person at or before tendering to an initial carrier any container or trailer for intermodal transportation with a projected gross cargo weight (including packing material and pallets) of more than 10,000 pounds, to certify to the carrier in writing the actual gross cargo weight and a reasonable description of the container's or trailer's contents. Requires prior notification to the carrier of projected gross cargo weight and the contents description. Makes it unlawful for a carrier or its agent, a customs broker, freight forwarder, warehouseman, or terminal operator to fail to forward such a certification to a subsequent carrier transporting the container or trailer in intermodal transportation. Makes it unlawful for any person: (1) to coerce or attempt to coerce a person providing such transportation to transport such loaded container or trailer before receiving the required certification; or (2) knowing that such weight limits are exceeded, to coerce or attempt to coerce any carrier to transport the container or trailer, or to operate the tractor-trailer combination in violation of such limits. Makes it unlawful for a motor carrier to transport such container or trailer before receiving such certification. Provides for State enforcement and for liens for posted bonds, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to assess and report to specified congressional committees on: (1) existing data and data collection needs (along with any recommendations for improving data collection) with respect to the movement in intermodal transportation of loaded containers and trailers (including those containing perishable agricultural commodities) in violation of this Act and State highway motor vehicle weight laws; and (2) the legal and practical impediments to such data collection."
