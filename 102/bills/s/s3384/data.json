    "text": "International Population Stabilization and Reproductive Choice Act of 1992 - Title I: United States Population Assistance - Sets forth congressional findings with respect to population assistance. Declares that it shall be a principal objective of U.S. foreign policy to achieve universal availability of high quality fertility control services. Requires all family planning activities receiving support under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide a broad range of fertility control methods permitted by individual country policy. Prohibits funds from being used to coerce any person to undergo sterilization or involuntary abortion or to accept any method of fertility control. Requires the U.S. Government to support the expansion of reproductive rights in countries receiving foreign assistance. Prohibits subjecting nongovernmental and multilateral organizations to requirements which are more restrictive than requirements applicable to foreign governments for such assistance. Requires population assistance to provide increased support for special programs to reach young adults before they begin childbearing. Provides that funds shall be allocated to countries meeting at least one of the following criteria: (1) countries accounting for a substantial proportion of the world's annual population increment; (2) countries having significant unmet needs for fertility control and that require foreign assistance to implement, expand, or sustain family planning services; and (3) countries which demonstrate a strong policy commitment to population stabilization through the expansion of reproductive choice. Makes funds available for: (1) the United Nations Population Fund; and (2) the Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction. Prohibits assistance for the United Nations Population Fund from being obligated if China is denied most-favored-nation trading status. Prohibits U.S. population assistance for programs in China. Applies prohibitions on funding for abortions or involuntary sterilization to assistance to assistance for the Fund. Requires the Fund to maintain such assistance in a separate account, without commingling with other funds. Requires agreements between the United States and the Fund to obligate such assistance to provide for a full refund to the United States if the Fund provides more than a specified amount for family planning programs in China. Prohibits the use of such funds to carry out any program that is disapproved by the U.S. representative to the United Nations. Requires the Administrator of the Agency for International Development (AID) to establish simplified procedures for the development and approval of programs to be carried out by nongovernmental organizations that have demonstrated a capacity to undertake effective population and family planning activities and a commitment to quality reproductive health care for women. Makes 50 percent of all U.S. population assistance available for nongovernmental organizations. Requires AID to encourage greater involvement in the delivery of family planning services by private health practitioners, employer-based health services, unions, and cooperative health organizations. Sets forth targets for global expenditures in developing countries for core population programs and for U.S. population assistance. Authorizes appropriations for U.S. population assistance. Prohibits individuals in programs assisted by the United States from being denied family planning services because of an inability to pay the cost of such services. Lists research programs to be supported by U.S. assistance. Requires the U.S. Government to support communications strategies to create public awareness about reproductive health needs and the problems associated with world population growth. Directs the AID Administrator to report annually to the Congress on world progress toward population stabilization and universal reproductive choice. Title II: Population Assistance Policy and Development - Declares that it is U.S. policy to promote universal access to basic education. Declares that it is U.S. foreign policy to assist efforts to: (1) reduce the infant mortality rate in all countries by the lower of one-third of the 1990 level or to 50 deaths per 1,000 live births; and (2) reduce the mortality rate of children under five years of age by the lower of 30 percent or 70 deaths per 1,000 live births. Title III: Organizational Provisions - Establishes within the Department of State an Under Secretary of State for Global Population, Environment, and Natural Resources to provide a focus for dialogue on global population growth, environmental degradation, and natural resources management. Declares that the multilateral development banks should increase their support for core population activities. Requires the U.S. executive directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the African Development Bank to submit annual reports to the Congress on allocations to core population activities and, if such allocations total less than $1,000,000, to report on actions taken to encourage increases in such allocations. Requires the President to establish a National Bipartisan Commission on World Population Stabilization and Reproductive Health to oversee U.S. preparations for, and participation in, the 1994 International Population Meeting. Directs the Commission to report on population trends and their impact on efforts to alleviate poverty and protect the environment. Authorizes appropriations."
