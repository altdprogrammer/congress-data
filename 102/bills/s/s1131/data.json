    "text": "American Leadership in Technology Act of 1991 - Title I: Articulation Consortia - Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) (the Director) to award competitive matching grants to eligible consortia for programs which: (1) enable greater numbers of students from two-year institutions of higher education to successfully transfer into science and engineering programs at four-year institutions of higher education; (2) maximize acceptance of credits of students who transfer from two-year to four-year institutions; (3) improve instruction in science, mathematics, and engineering programs through faculty development, including exchanges and symposia among consortium partners; and (4) strengthen career counseling services in two-year institutions for students who seek to major in science, mathematics, or pre-engineering. Limits eligible consortia to a four-year institution of higher education in partnership with two or more two-year institutions which serve the same intrastate region. Limits grant awards to eligible consortia: (1) engaging industries in job training programs at two-year institutions to meet the technical needs of the area; and (2) agreeing among the partners to facilitate the transfer of science and mathematics students from two-year to four-year institutions. Requires the Director: (1) to evaluate such program; and (2) to assist eligible consortia in submitting applications for such grants and in seeking assistance under other related NSF undergraduate programs. Allows applications to be for a period of one or three years. Sets Federal and non-Federal share requirements. Title II: Instructional Technologies - Requires the Director to establish a program to promote and support development and dissemination of innovative technologies, including computer hardware and software, for science and technological literacy instruction emphasizing worker training and retraining for technological skills. Requires the Director, under such program, to solicit proposals from associate-degree-granting institutions, in cooperation with local businesses, for the development and dissemination of innovative technologies to aid instruction of adults in literacy and technical skills relevant to the workplace. Requires the Director to award competitive matching grants to entities with ability or outstanding potential to produce innovative technologies materials. Requires the Director to establish a revolving loan fund to make loans for acquisition and use of innovative technologies to educational institutions and other entities (including on-site, workplace literacy initiatives) providing literacy instruction and technical training. Requires the Director to coordinate such program with analogous programs and policies of other Federal agencies, especially the Department of Education. Sets forth requirements for application for financial assistance and for the Federal and non-Federal share of grants. Title III: Technician Training - Requires the Director to carry out a national advance technician training program of: (1) awarding competitive matching grants to accredited associate-degree-granting colleges which can provide competency-based technical training in designated advanced-technology occupational fields; and (2) establishing and maintaining a readily accessible inventory of advanced technician training programs. Requires the Director to award competitive matching grants to ten centers of excellence among associate-degree-granting colleges: (1) five with exceptional programs of advanced technician training, to serve as national and regional technical education clearinghouses for other colleges; and (2) five that excel in undergraduate education in mathematics and science, to serve as national and regional mathematics and science education clearinghouses for both colleges and secondary schools. Requires the Director to make at least 20 competitive matching grants annually to associate-degree-granting colleges for partnerships in mathematics and science education with secondary schools in the community served by the college. Requires the Director to appoint a National Advisory Council on Advanced Technician Training. Requires the Director and the Council to report annually on the national advanced technician training program. Title IV: Authorization of Appropriations - Authorizes appropriations for: (1) articulation consortia for FY 1992 through 1994; (2) instruction technologies for FY 1991; and (3) technician training for FY 1992 through 1994."
