    "date": "1992-04-09", 
    "text": "Job Training and Basic Skills Act of 1992 - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to revise and extend employment and training assistance programs. Declares it to be the policy of the United States to: (1) provide financial assistance to States and local service delivery areas (SDAs) to meet the training needs of low-income adults and youth and assist them in obtaining unsubsidized employment; (2) increase funds available for programs of training services for the disadvantaged by at least ten percent of the baseline each fiscal year to provide for growth in the number of eligible adults and youth served beyond the current five percent of the eligible population in need of these services; and (3) encourage provision of longer and more comprehensive education, training, and employment services to the eligible population, with increased funding to maintain current service levels. Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to authorize appropriations for FY 1993 and succceeding fiscal years. Defines \"basic skills deficient\" as reading or computing skills at or below 8th grade level. Adds the Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs, literacy organizations, organizations serving older workers and organizations that provide service opportunities and youth corps programs to the list of community-based organizations. Revises the definition of \"economically disadvantaged\" to refer to the official poverty line. Revises the definition of \"supportive services\" to include: (1) drug and alcohol abuse counseling and referral; and (2) individual and family counseling. Includes representatives of public assistance agencies and local welfare agencies on private industry councils (PICs) under JTPA. Revises other provisions for PIC membership. Applies the requirement for a job training plan to training services for the disadvantaged only. Revises requirements for the contents of such plans to provide for linkages with appropriate agencies and for outreach to recruit locally determined target groups. Adds requirements for procedures for selecting service providers. Requires service delivery area (SDA) job training plans to include: (1) goals for the training of women in nontraditional employment and the training-related placement of women in nontraditional employment and apprenticeship; (2) a description of efforts to be undertaken to accomplish such goals, including efforts to increase awareness of such training and placement opportunities; and (3) procedures for annual reporting of the extent to which the SDA has met such goals and of a statistical breakdown of women trained and placed in nontraditional occupations, including specified types of information. Adds community-based organizations to those entities reviewing such job training plans. Revises requirements for training services for the disadvantaged performance standards to: (1) promote delivery of services to the hard-to-serve; and (2) add measurement of increased basic education attainment and occupational skills (as well as the current measurement of increased employment and earnings and reduced dependency). Provides for the following additional factors in performance standards for youth programs: (1) attainment of employability competencies; (2) dropout prevention and recovery: (3) secondary and postsecondary school completion or its equivalent; and (4) enrollment in other education, training, or employment programs or apprenticeship, or enlistment in the Armed Forces. Allows variations in standards to reflect differences between in-school and out-of-school programs. Requires the private industry council to determine levels for competency standards based on such factors as entry skill levels and other hiring requirements. Sets forth additional elements of performance standards. Retains the requirement that the Secretary prescribe performance measures, but states that such standards shall not be taken into consideration in the award of incentive grants. Provides that Governor's incentive grant awards shall be to service delivery areas (SDAs) conducting adult and youth programs which: (1) meet specified performance standards established by the the Secretary, serve more than a specified minimum percentage of out-service-school youth, and exceed performance standards for hard-to-serve- populations; (2) place participants in employment providing wages at placement exceeding the appropriate performance criteria, as well as employer-assisted employment benefits (including health benefits); (3) meet specified performance standards established by the Governor; and (4) establish linkages with other programs to avoid duplication and enhance delivery of services. Retains the requirement for the Secretary to prescribe performance standards for dislocated workers employment and training assistance based on placement and retention in unsubsidized employment. Retains the requirement that such standards make appropriate allowance for the difference in cost resulting from serving workers receiving cetain needs-related payments. Changes from discretionary to mandatory the authority of State Governors to prescribe, within certain parameters, variations in performance standards for training services for the disadvantaged and for dislocated workers employment and training assistance. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide information and technical assistance on performance standards adjustments; (2) collect data that identify hard-to-serve individuals and long-term welfare dependency; (3) provide guidance on setting performance goals at the service provider level that encourages increased service to the hard-to-serve, particularly long-term welfare recipients; and (4) review performance standards to ensure that they provide maximum incentive in serving the hard-to-serve, particularly long-term welfare recipients, including those receiving benefits under the aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) and supplemental security income (SSI) programs of the Social Security Act. Authorizes Governors to prescribe additional performance standards for these programs, which must be reported in the coordination and special services plan. Directs the Secretary to prescribe performance standards for: (1) employment and training programs for Native Americans and migrant and seasonal farm workers; (2) the Jobs Corps; and (3) the jobs for employable dependent individuals incentive bonus program. Directs the Secretary to prescribe a system for adjustments in JTPA performance standards for special populations to be served.

Allows SDAs to appeal to the Secretary for revision of such reorganization plans. Directs the Secretary, if the Governor does not impose a reorganization plan within a specified period, to impose such a plan on the SDA and to recapture or withhold a portion of State funds to provide technical assistance under such plan. Provides for appeals by: (1) SDAs subject to such plans; and (2) Governors of States subject to such recaptive or withholding of funds. Defines \"employment,\"for purposes of JTPA performance standards, as employment for more than 20 hours per week. Requires SDAs, in selecting service providers, to consider provision of support services, including child care. Requires selection of service providers to be made on a competitive basis and to include: (1) a determination of such provider's ability to meet program design specifications that take into account JTPA's purposes and the goals established in the Governor's coordination and special services plan; and (2) documentation of compliance with procurement standards established by the Secretary, including the reasons for selection.

Allows continued provisions of counseling and supportive services to a participant for up to one year after termination from the program.
