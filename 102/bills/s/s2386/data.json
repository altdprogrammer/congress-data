    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit owners or operators of landfills, incinerators, or other waste disposal facilities in a State from receiving municipal solid waste generated outside the State unless they obtain authorization from the affected local government. Requires only one authorization per facility. Exempts from such prohibition: (1) owners or operators of landfills that meet specified design, monitoring, and financial responsibility requirements; comply with specified regulations; and, before January 1, 1993, accepted waste generated outside the State or obtained authorization to accept it from a local government; (2) owners or operators of landfills under construction that have obtained the necessary permits and were the subject of authorization before January 1, 1993, and that meet specified design and financial responsibility requirements; (3) owners or operators of incinerators or other disposal facilities that accepted waste generated outside the State and obtained authorization before January 1, 1993, and that meet applicable new source performance standards and monitoring requirements under the Clean Air Act; and (4) persons who plan to own or operate an incinerator or other disposal facility who have obtained necessary permits and authorizations and meet such standards and monitoring requirements. Terminates such exemptions for landfills for noncompliance with specified laws and regulations. Considers expansions of landfills, incinerators, or waste disposal facilities to be separate facilities requiring authorization. Permits expansions without additional authorization if: (1) the owner or operator demonstrates that the proposed expansion will not result in an increase in the volume or tonnage of solid waste received by the facility; (2) the area of expansion was indicated in documents filed with the affected local government before obtaining authorization; or (3) one or more ancillary facilities to be used for the sole purpose of supporting the landfill are added. Prohibits the receipt of municipal solid waste generated in another State if the generating State does not have an approved solid waste management plan. Authorizes the receipt of such waste without local government authorization if the State in which the recipient facility is located does not have an approved plan. Permits a State Governor to impose certain conditions on the receipt of waste generated in another State by existing exempted facilities if: (1) all landfills within the State meet or exceed requirements for exemption; and (2) the limitations are applied on a uniform, facility-by-facility basis. Makes it unlawful to transport such waste through interstate commerce in a manner that violates this Act's requirements. Prescribes criminal and civil penalties for violations of this Act. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program that requires persons who transport more than 500 pounds annually of solid waste in interstate commerce to submit annual registration statements."
