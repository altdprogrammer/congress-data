    "text": "Health Freedom Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to define \"dietary supplement\" as an article that: (1) includes, and is intended to supplement the diet with, a vitamin, mineral, herb, or another similar nutritional substance; or (2) is intended for ingestion in tablet, capsule, or liquid form, or another similar form. Provides that a dietary supplement shall not be considered to be a drug solely because: (1) of the potency of a substance in such supplement; and (2) the labeling or advertising for the supplement contains a claim, or provides information, concerning the potency of a substance in the supplement, or contains a health claim of the type permitted under this Act. Specifies that: (1) a substance in a dietary supplement is not a food additive if the substance is identified in the labeling of the dietary supplement as a substance provided by the product to supplement the diet; and (2) an article that is a dietary supplement may be described as a dietary supplement in labeling or advertising. Permits labeling or advertising for such a supplement to include a claim or other information that characterizes the relationship of the supplement, or the presence or absence of one or more of the substances provided by the supplement, to a disease or health-related condition, if: (1) such claim or other information is truthful and not misleading; and (2) there is scientific evidence, whether published or unpublished, that provides a reasonable basis for such claim or other information. Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from establishing any requirement that such a claim or other information that meets the requirements of this Act be approved by or conform to a regulation issued by the Secretary before the claim or information may be used. Provides that, if the Secretary asserts that labeling or advertising for a dietary supplement includes a claim or other information that fails to comply with the Act, the manufacturer (or other specified parties) may bring an action to secure a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of the assertion and obtain any other means of judicial relief authorized by law."
