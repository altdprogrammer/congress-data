    "text": "Promotion of Democracy and Respect for Human Rights in Guatemala Act of 1991 - Prohibits the provision of unobligated military assistance and all military assistance for FY 1992 and 1993 to Guatemala until the President reports to the Congress that: (1) the Government of Guatemala has conducted investigations and prosecutions of those responsible for specified murders; (2) military harassment and assassinations with respect to human rights activists have ceased and such activists may freely carry out activities; (3) respect for rights of certain freedoms and political pluralism have increased; (4) internationally recognized workers' rights have been extended to Guatemalan workers; (5) the Guatemalan Government is prosecuting members of the police force who are responsible for murders and disappearances of street children; and (6) the Guatemalan Government has put an end to the practice of forced civil patrol duty. Provides that unobligated economic support fund (ESF) assistance and ESF assistance for FY 1992 and 1993, development assistance, and assistance under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 for Guatemala may be used only by civilian agencies and nongovernmental organizations and shall be limited to assistance for: (1) the Guatemalan human rights ombudsman; (2) programs that address poverty and basic human needs; (3) fiscal administration; (4) the National Reconciliation Commission; and (5) the improvement of the performance of democratic institutions or the promotion of political pluralism. Prohibits the use of such assistance for partisan political purposes or as an instrument of counterinsurgency. Makes restrictions on the use of such assistance inapplicable if the President reports to the Congress that the Guatemalan Government has: (1) conducted investigations and prosecutions of those responsible for the murders and mistreatment of named individuals; and (2) made substantial progress towards a fiscally responsible tax policy and improved fiscal administration. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should encourage other nations to cease the provision of military assistance to Guatemala until conditions under this Act have been met. Requires the President to report biennially to specified congressional committees on: (1) countries, companies, and individuals engaged in the sale or export of military equipment to the Guatemalan Government; and (2) the nature and type of such equipment."
