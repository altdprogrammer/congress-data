    "text": "Fish Safety Act of 1992 - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to create a new title setting forth a fish inspection program. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) to exempt from specific provisions of the title: (1) fish processing by an individual for use in that individual's household; (2) custom processing for use in the household of the product owner; (3) processing of products not intended for nor capable of use as human food; (4) warehousing of up to 50 pounds or of product caught for other than commercial purposes in waters outside the United States; and (5) operations of types traditionally and usually conducted at retail stores or restaurants.

Requires that fish products processed for intrastate commerce under a State program that are sold, transported, delivered, or offered for sale in interstate commerce be considered adulterated. Authorizes the Secretary to cooperate with State agencies concerning the State administration of the inspection and sampling components of the fish inspection program established under the title on behalf of the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to provide State agencies with advisory assistance, technical and laboratory assistance and training, and financial and other assistance for up to 50 percent of the cost of the cooperative program. Requires State program participants to submit operation plans to the Secretary annually. Directs the Secretary to establish standards for the efficient and effective administration of the sampling and inspection program by each approved State. Authorizes the Secretary to deputize specific State employees in approved States. Authorizes the Secretary to appoint advisory committees. Requires the appropriate State agency with which the Secretary may cooperate to be a single agency that is primarily responsible for the coordination of the State programs having objectives the same as the title. Directs the Secretary to develop and administer a comprehensive and efficient health-based inspection program for fish products designed to protect the consuming public from fish products that may be adulterated or misbranded. Sets forth program requirements. Directs the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to establish tolerances, except where tolerances are established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, that shall be applicable to poisonous or deleterious substances that may adulterate fish products. Requires the tolerances to be: (1) established at levels so that fish products are not injurious to health; and (2) based on a scientific analysis of health risks. Directs the Commissioner to establish tolerances, except where tolerances are established by the Administrator under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, for harmful chemicals, toxins, parasites, pathogenic microorganisms, viruses, bacteria, and other harmful agents that may render fish products adulterated. Allows the tolerances to include the use of indicators, including indicator organisms. Directs the Secretary of Commerce and appropriate State authorities, for waters under their jurisdiction, to establish a system for the identification and classification of growing and harvesting areas for fish in coastal areas and the Great Lakes. Directs the Secretary to sample and test fish products regarding any instance or trend that may pose a significant threat to consumers' health and safety. Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial and other assistance to States to prevent the entry of adulterated fish products into establishments, including annual grants to each State that is a member of the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, with regard to waters under the exclusive jurisdiction of that Secretary, to close waters or restrict harvesting of a species if fish of that species within the identified harvesting or growing areas are likely to be adulterated. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) periodically review the closure or restriction; and (2) establish procedures for review on petitions by affected persons. Requires reasonable public notice prior to closure or restriction, except in public health emergencies. Requires inspectors authorized by the Secretary to take actions as necessary to implement the title, including: (1) inspection of establishments, products, packages, equipment, procedures, and records; (2) sampling and testing of fish products; (3) detention and condemnation of adulterated or misbranded products; and (4) inspection, sampling, and testing of imports of fish products.

Directs the Secretary to establish regulations for the storage or handling of fish products by any person in the business of buying, selling, freezing, storing, transporting, or importing fish products. Authorizes the Secretary to establish guidelines for training persons employed by establishments involved in fish product sanitation and quality control. Authorizes the Secretary to exempt products from inspection requirements until a specified date if appropriated funds are insufficient or if the exemption will aid in the effective transition to the programs implemented under the title. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures for the annual certification of establishments and persons engaged in importing of fish and fish products. Prohibits importers from processing or handling any fish product for commercial purposes unless the establishment is certified. Authorizes the Secretary to refuse to certify or to decertify establishments or importers unfit to engage in any business as a result of Federal or State convictions for: (1) acquiring, handling, or distributing adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively packaged food, or fraud in food transactions; or (2) any felony involving a lack of the integrity needed for the conduct of operations affecting the public health.

Prohibits articles from being sold or offered for sale under any name, marking, or labeling that is false or misleading, or in any container of a misleading form or size. Permits established trade names and other marking and labeling that are not false or misleading and that are approved by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary, if any marking, labeling, size, or form of any container is false or misleading, to require that use be withheld unless modified as prescribed by the Secretary so that it will not be false or misleading. Prohibits a fish product from being entered, or withdrawn from warehouses, for consumption in the United States, unless the product: (1) is not adulterated or misbranded; (2) complies with all requirements of the title; and (3) is marked and labeled as required for imports. Treats all such products as domestic fish products under the title, except that its labeling must identify the country of origin. Directs the Secretary to enforce these provisions through inspections, sampling, and any other necessary procedures. Requires products refused entry or entered, or withdrawn from warehouses, in violation of these provisions to be destroyed unless exported or brought into compliance. Requires storage, cartage, labor, and other costs from denial of entry or withdrawal from warehouse to be paid by the owner or consignee. Declares that nonpayment constitutes a lien against the product and any other fish product thereafter entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption in the United States by such owner or consignee. Directs the Secretary, on request of a country desiring to export fish products to the United States, to review the inspection program of products offered for importation to determine whether the requirements and tolerances for the products are at least equal to those under the title and, if so, and if the country will permit the enforcement measures the Secretary determines necessary, to issue a certificate stating that the country meets the requirements. Requires all fish products imported from an uncertified country to be inspected by the Secretary to ensure compliance with these provisions. Directs the Secretary to enforce these provisions through inspections, sampling, testing, or other actions in the foreign country, during importation, or otherwise as necessary.

Provides civil monetary penalties and criminal penalties for violations. Prohibits a common or contract carrier, including carriers that are fish tender vessels, from being subject to penalties under the title unless the carrier: (1) had knowledge, or possessed facts that would cause a reasonable person to believe, that the products were adulterated or misbranded; or (2) refuses to furnish certain information and documents. Sets forth: (1) felony penalties for giving or receiving bribes; and (2) criminal penalties for forcibly assaulting, resisting, intimidating, or interfering with any inspector or other person while engaged in official duties under the title.
