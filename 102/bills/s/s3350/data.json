    "text": "National Organ Donor and Awareness Campaign Act of 1992 - Mandates a national campaign to increase public awareness of organ transplantation, including development of a national clearinghouse. Requires research on the process by which individuals listed in the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network are selected and other matters relating to public education and promotion regarding organ donation. Amends the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to establish a Network advisory committee. Increases the Network's annual funding cap. Modifies Network functions and its board of director's composition. Amends block grant provisions of the PHSA to mandate payments to health care facilities for the dispensing of immunosuppressive drugs to eligible transplant recipients. Authorizes appropriations. Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to remove the one-year limitation on coverage of immunosuppressive drugs. Amends the PHSA to require, in making grants and contracts to increase the number of organ donors, inclusion of projects encouraging procurement from minority communities (including cultural, racial, and language minorities) and from other communities with below average donation rates. Authorizes appropriations."
