    "text": "National and Community Service Technical Amendment Act of 1992 - Revises the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (the Act). Expands the authority of the Commission on National and Community Service (the Commission). Authorizes the Commission to make grants to States or local applicants and transfer funds to the Secretaries of Agriculture or of the Interior, or the Director of ACTION, to create or expand full-time, part-time, year-round or summer youth programs. (Current law requires the Commission to consult with the Secretary of Education in making grants, and sets forth different authorized uses of grant funds.) Lowers summer program minimum age eligibility from 15 to 14. Removes the minimum three years requirement for service in the Peace Corps or VISTA as a condition of eligibility for participation in training and educational benefits demonstration programs. Requires, instead, satisfactory completion of the individual's service in the Peace Corps or VISTA. Includes projects of a specified type under the Domestic Volunteer Service Act among eligible recipients of grants for assistance to Head Start. Revises requirements for confidentiality of information regarding individual participants. Includes the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy among ex-officio members of the Board of Directors of the Commission. Revises the Board's power to appoint, and fix compensation of its Director. Reduces the number of employees to administer the Commission and sets limits on their compensation. Authorizes the Director to appoint and compensate additional staff, at the Board's discretion. Provides for consultants, details of personnel, donations of volunteer services and property, contracts, use of mails, information from Federal agencies, and sources of supplies and services. Increases the portion of the authorization of appropriations for title I (National and Community Service Grant Program) of the Act which is earmarked for the Commission in FY 1993; but eliminates a general earmark for the Commission, and provides that certain remaining funds (after the earmarks for three other specified title I programs) may be expended for any title I activity."
