    "text": "Title I: Kaysville, Utah Communication Facilities - Amends Federal law to exempt from certain land use restrictions certain Kaysville, Utah, lands in the Wasatch National Forest upon which communications facilities were located as of November 1, 1991, as well as certain other lands in the same national forest (intended for recreational uses) which are not critical for watershed protection or the management of adjacent National Forest System lands. Title II: Authorization of Bureau of Land Management - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1996 to the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior. Title III: Targhee and Kaniksu National Forests - Targhe and Kaniksu Land Exchange Act of 1992 - Adjusts the boundaries of the Targhee National Forest in Idaho. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to convey to the Regents of the University of Idaho all right, title, and interest of the United States to the Clark Fork Ranger Station within the Kaniksu National Forest in exchange for the Regents' conveyance to the Secretary, by general warranty deed, of all right, title, and interest in the Clark Fork Land Exchange. Provides that if the lands exchanged between the United States and the University are not of equal value, the values shall be equalized in accordance with provisions of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, except that the value of the improvements made by the University on the Clark Fork Ranger Station under the Granger-Thye permit shall be excluded from consideration in such valuation. Adjusts the boundaries of the Kaniksu National Forest to include the Clark Fork Ranger Station. Title IV: Cameron Parish Land Conveyance - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey certain lands located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, to the West Cameron Port Commission for use as a public port facility or for other public purposes, subject to reversion to the United States if such lands cease to be operated for such purposes, a specified reservation of minerals, and retention of encumbrances. Title V: 'In Lieu' Land Claims - Disclaims all Federal right, title, and interest in specified base lands over which the United States holds record title. Prescribes guidelines under which the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture must prepare interim lists of such lands and identify those listed lands which are located wholly or partially within any conservation system unit (and all other listed lands which the Congress has designated for specific management or which the Secretary concerned finds should be retained for specific needs), which shall be excluded from the final lists of disclaimed lands. Prescribes guidelines for the preparation of final land lists. Establishes a deadline by which the appropriate Secretary must issue quitclaim deeds for the disclaimed lands. Authorizes claimants to make land claims against the United States in the U.S. Claims Court. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Wildfire Disaster Recovery Act of 1989 to postpone the due date for a report by the National Commission on Wildfire Disasters to December 1, 1992. Title VI: Bear River Exchange - Provides for the exchange of Utah State lands for Federal lands within the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge. Declares that lands transferred to the United States shall be administered as part of such refuge."
