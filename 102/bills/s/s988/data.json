Directs the Administrator to ensure that organizations responsible for developing national model building codes and authorities which regulate building construction within States or political subdivisions adopt such standards. Requires Federal agencies to assure that the construction of new Federal buildings or buildings built with Federal assistance meet or exceed the requirements of the recycling standards. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to assure that any newly constructed public housing units meet or exceed such requirements."
