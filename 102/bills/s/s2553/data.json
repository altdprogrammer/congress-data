Modifies requirements regarding payments made in the case of deceased persons. Requires that, when evidence regarding an individual's eligibility is equally balanced, the benefit of the doubt be given to the individual. Provides for judicial review of denial of compensation. Terminates the duties of the Attorney General a specified period after the Fund terminates (currently, when the Fund terminates). Excludes any payments made under such Act from consideration as income for purposes of eligibility for benefits under all laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, effective as of August 10, 1988. Includes non-Japanese spouses and parents of an individual of Japanese ancestry within the definition of the term \"of Japanese ancestry.\" Declares that any such payment to an individual who is not of Japanese ancestry and who is an eligible individual on the basis of this Act shall not be an entitlement and shall be made from discretionary appropriations. Authorizes appropriations for such discretionary payments."
