Provides that the records and information generated pursuant to such activities shall be for the sole use of the pertinent regulatory authority and coal operator. Mandates that the regulatory authority: (1) provide or assume the cost of training coal operators in permit preparation and program compliance; and (2) ensure that coal operators are aware of the assistance available under this Act. Mandates that a coal operator reimburse the program administrator for services rendered if the administrator finds that such operator's total actual and attributed annual coal production exceeds 300,000 tons."
