Allows a tax credit for interest paid or incurred on any qualified education loan during the first 48 months (whether or not consecutive) for which a payment is required to be made. Limits such credit to $300. Requires taxpayers to elect the tax deduction or the tax credit, but not both. Prohibits the use of such deduction if a deduction is allowed for residence interest which is allocable to indebtedness used to pay qualified higher education expenses. Allows such tax credit to parents only if the dependent is a student and a personal exemption is claimed for such dependent student."
