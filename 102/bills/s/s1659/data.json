Revises the formula for and increases the amount of an individual Pell Grant. Sets the maximum amount at $4,000 for award year 1992-1993. Provides, for academic years 1993-1994 through 1996-1997, for specified inflation adjustments for such specified maximum amounts. Raises to $400 the minimum amount which a student must be eligible for before a Pell Grant may be awarded. Removes from the computation of expected family contribution in the determination of need for assistance under the Pell Grant program the following assets: (1) the family's principal place of residence; or (2) a family farm on which the family resides."
