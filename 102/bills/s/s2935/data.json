    "text": "Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1992 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish birth defects prevention and research programs. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), to award grants to, enter into cooperative agreements with, or provide direct technical assistance in lieu of cash to, States, State health authorities, or health agencies of political subdivisions of a State for collection, analysis, and reporting of birth defects statistics from birth certificates, infant death certificates, hospital records, or other sources and to collect and disaggregate such statistics by gender and racial and ethnic group. Directs the Secretary to establish at least five regional birth defects monitoring and research programs to collect and analyze information on the number, incidence, correlation, and causes of birth defects, to include information regarding gender and different racial and ethnic groups, including Hispanics, non-Hispanic whites, African Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans. Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Director of CDC, to award grants or enter into cooperative agreements with specified entities to serve as Centers of Excellence for Birth Defects Prevention Research. Requires one of the Centers to focus on birth defects among ethnic minorities. Requires the CDC to establish a clearinghouse for the collection and storage of data and generated from birth defects monitoring programs developed under this Act. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Director of the CDC, to award grants to or enter into cooperative agreements with State departments of health, universities, or other private, or nonprofit entities to develop, evaluate, and implement prevention strategies designed to reduce the incidence and effects or birth defects. Directs the Secretary to establish an Advisory Committee for Birth Defects Prevention to provide advice and recommendations on prevention and amelioration of birth defects to the Secretary and the Director of the CDC. Requires the Secretary to report biennially to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources regarding the incidence of birth defects, the contribution of birth defects to infant mortality, the outcome of implementation of prevention strategies, and identified needs for research and policy development to include information regarding the various racial and ethnic groups, including Hispanic, non-Hispanic whites, African Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans. Authorizes appropriations."
