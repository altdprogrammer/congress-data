    "text": "Delaware River Wild and Scenic River Act of 1992 - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act by designating certain segments and tributaries (segments) of the Delaware River, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, for study for potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in: (1) preparing the comprehensive management plan for such segments, to work in conjunction with appropriate Federal, State, regional, and local agencies, including specified departments and commissions; and (2) preparing and implementing such plan, to consider existing State and local regulation and avoid creating duplicative regulatory authority, and consider public input from conservation organizations, watershed associations, and private landowners. Provides that such designation, and any subsequent management or development plan prepared to implement the designation, shall not be used for specified purposes, such as to preclude access to certain electric or gas transmission or distribution lines. Sets forth additional requirements with respect to the location of such lines. Specifies that such a segment shall be eligible for designation as a component of the System if the segment: (1) is free-flowing; (2) possesses, in conjunction with related adjacent land areas, at least one recreational, geologic, fish and wildlife, historic, cultural, or similar value that the Secretary determines to be outstanding; (3) is largely undeveloped; and (4) meets such other criteria as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Authorizes appropriations."
