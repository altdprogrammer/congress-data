Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to provide that any person who enters or imports (or attempts to enter or import) merchandise into the United States in violation of prohibitions on convict-made goods, who knows or should have known that such entry or importation (or attempted entry or importation) was in violation of such prohibitions, shall be liable to pay specified civil penalties to the United States. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe procedures for imposing such penalties, including prepenalty notice."
