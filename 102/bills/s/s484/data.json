    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-02-26", 
    "text": "Central Valley Project Improvement Act - Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from entering into any contract to sell or deliver water from the Central Valley Project (CVP), California (a Bureau of Reclamation facility) on any basis or for any purpose other than fish and wildlife before certain requirements have been met, including those enumerated later under this Act with respect to wetland habitats, anadromous fish populations, and fisheries and water of affected Indian entities. Provides for an exception to such prohibition for long-term contracts for the sale of a specified amount of CVP water to California water agencies for municipal and industrial purposes. Requires the revenues from such long-term contracts to be covered into the Restoration Fund established later by this Act. Prohibits the renewal of CVP water delivery contracts (other than contracts for fish and wildlife water supply purposes) for longer than one year until the requirements referenced above and enumerated later by this Act have been met. Provides an exception to such prohibition for long-term renewals if: (1) the contractor agrees to forego ten percent of the previous contract amount of water, plus an additional one percent for each year beyond ten years, for fish and wildlife purposes; and (2) the Secretary has analyzed such contract's impact pursuant to Federal environmental laws and complied with applicable State environmental laws. Requires the Secretary to prepare a programmatic environmental impact statement on CVP water contract renewals. Establishes the terms and conditions for all new and newly renewed or amended CVP water contracts for agricultural, municipal, or industrial purposes. Places restrictions on the transfer of water under contract to users in California. Requires contractors to meter ground and surface water and to take responsibility for ensuring that drainage discharges meet all applicable State and Federal water quality standards. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to operate CVP so as to: (1) protect, restore, and enhance affected fish, wildlife, and related habitat; and (2) treat them equitably with the other purposes for which CVP is authorized to operate. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide firm water supplies of suitable quality to maintain and improve wetland habitats on specified national wildlife refuges, wildlife management areas, and a certain grasslands resource conservation district in California; (2) develop and adopt a program for the mitigation of damage suffered by anadromous fish populations on specified rivers as a result of CVP contruction or operation; (3) develop, adopt, and implement a program to comply with specified provisions of the California Fish and Game Code; and (4) develop and report to the Congress a plan to fulfill U.S. trust obligations with respect to the fisheries and water of affected Indian entities. Sets forth determinations for the quantity and delivery schedules of water for the national wildlife refuges referenced above. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to investigate and report to the Congress on CVP's effects on anadromous fish populations and the fisheries, communities, tribes, businesses and other interests that have or had significant economic, social, or cultural association with those fishery resources. Establishes the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund (Restoration Fund) for the receipt of revenues and funds provided by this Act. Provides revenues for the Restoration Fund by directing the Secretary of the Interior to impose surcharges on CVP power and water sales to implement the fish and wildlife restoration goals of this Act. Requires the Secretary to contribute half of the surcharge revenues to a private, non-profit California-based Central Valley Project Restoration Trust (Restoration Trust) established by this Act. Sets forth requirements which the Restoration Trust must meet in order to be eligible to receive such contributions. Outlines additional uses of funds deposited in the Restoration Fund, with priority given to restoration and acquisition of lands and properties in the CVP area. Bars the Secretary from making any expenditures from the Restoration Fund, other than the contribution to the Restoration Trust, until California commits to implement specified fish and wildlife protection and restoration measures on the Sacramento River. Outlines additional authority granted to the Secretary by this Act with respect to CVP. Directs the Secretary to establish and administer an office on CVP water conservation best management practices to develop water conservation standards and criteria for CVP. Provides for review, improvement, and implementation of water contractors conservation plans required by the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982. Provides sanctions for failure to comply with such standards and criteria. Authorizes provision of Federal financial assistance to those CVP irrigation contractors who renewed their contracts on a long-term basis under provisions outlined above to cover up to half the costs of implementing the project involved, under certain conditions. Requires annual progress reports to the Congress from the Secretary on the implementation of this Act. Provides for citizen suits for alleged violations of the requirements of this Act. Establishes the Central Valley Project Transfer Advisory Committee to prepare and submit to the President and the Congress a report on all issues associated with CVP's transfer to California. Authorizes appropriations."
