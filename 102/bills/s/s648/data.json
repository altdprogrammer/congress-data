    "text": "Crime Control Act of 1991 - Title I: Drug Court Programs for States - Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to States and local governments for establishing narcotics divisions within their judicial systems with exclusive jurisdiction over cases in which the most serious charge involves narcotics. Requires such divisions to receive funding for: (1) operation of rehabilitation and drug treatment programs; (2) operation of alternative sentencing programs; and (3) enhanced data processing and court reporting systems. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Literacy and Marketable Job Skills Training for Inmates in State Prisons - Authorizes appropriations to the National Institute of Corrections of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBP) to make grants to States for educational programs for criminal offenders in State correctional institutions. Makes a State ineligible to receive assistance paid for with Federal antidrug funds unless the prison authority of the State provides to all prisoners who need and desire it: (1) training in a marketable job skill and basic literacy; and (2) treatment and rehabilitation for drug addiction. Provides that a State is not required to provide training or treatment to a prisoner: (1) for whom a reasonable good faith effort has been made to provide training or treatment, even though the result has been less than satisfactory; (2) who refuses training or treatment; or (3) for whom the provision of training or treatment would be unreasonably costly. Establishes the Correctional Literacy and Vocational Skills Advisory Council and the Correctional Drug Treatment Advisory Committee to advise specified Federal agencies on formulating regulations to carry out this Act. Title III: Prison Construction - Authorizes appropriations to the FBP for construction of Federal correctional institutions and for expansion projects and modernization and repair of existing facilities."
