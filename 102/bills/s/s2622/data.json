    "text": "Khmer Rouge Prosecution and Exclusion Act - Establishes an Office of Cambodian Genocide Investigation within the Department of State to: (1) investigate crimes against humanity committed by Khmer Rouge leaders between 1975 and 1979; (2) provide the people of Cambodia with access to evidence held as a result of such investigation; (3) submit relevant data to an international penal tribunal that may be convened to hear and judge the genocidal acts committed by the Khmer Rouge; and (4) develop the U.S. proposal for the establishment of an international criminal tribunal for the prosecution of those accused of genocide in Cambodia. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the President to report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee every six months on: (1) the activities of the Office and new facts learned about Khmer Rouge practices; and (2) the steps taken by the President to promote human rights, support efforts to bring to justice the leadership of the Khmer Rouge, and to prevent the recurrence of human rights abuses through actions that are unrelated to United Nations activities in Cambodia and are consistent with the Cambodian political settlement agreement signed in October 1991. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to exclude from admission into the United States any alien who was a member of the national Khmer Rouge military or political leadership between April 17, 1975, and January 7, 1979. Lists specified individuals to be excluded. Urges the President to encourage foreign governments to exclude from their countries former and present Khmer Rouge leaders described by this Act."
