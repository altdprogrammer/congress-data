    "text": "Community Environmental Response Facilities Act - Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to require Federal agencies that plan to terminate operations on real property owned by the United States to identify property on which neither hazardous substances nor petroleum products or derivatives were stored for one year or more, released, or disposed. Requires the identification to be based on an investigation of the property to determine the presence of hazardous substances or petroleum products. Sets forth minimum requirements for the identification. Requires identifications to be made: (1) at least six months before the termination of operations on the property; and (2) with the concurrence of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the appropriate State official. Provides that, in the case of the sale or transfer of an identified property, the deed entered into for the sale or transfer of the property by the United States to any other person shall contain: (1) a covenant warranting that any response or corrective action found to be necessary after the date of such sale or transfer shall be conducted by the United States; and (2) a clause granting the United States access to the property in any case in which a response or corrective action is necessary at the property or on adjoining property. Declares that, in the case of a covenant required in deeds for the transfer of U.S. property on which a hazardous substance was stored or released, remedial action has been taken if the construction and installation of an approved remedial design has been completed and the remedy is operating properly. Requires such covenants to contain a clause granting the United States access to the property in any case in which remedial action is found to be necessary after the date of such transfer. Directs Federal agencies that plan to terminate operations on U.S. property on which hazardous substances or petroleum products were stored for one year or more, released, or disposed of to notify the State in which the property is located of any lease that will encumber the property beyond the date of termination of operations."
