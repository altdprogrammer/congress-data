Specifies that: (1) all such operations shall continue to be subject to, at the minimum, all State statutes, regulations, limitations, and conditions, including routing specific designations and other operating restrictions (statutes and restrictions), in force on January 1, 1991; and (2) nothing in this Act shall prevent any State from further restricting or prohibiting the operation of LCVs otherwise authorized. Directs the Secretary, within 60 days, to publish in the Federal Register a complete list of such State statutes and restrictions, which shall become final 60 days after publication. Bars LCVs from operating except as provided in such list."
