Establishes a minimum $75,000 for each grant awarded for general assistance for a fiscal year. Prohibits such a grant from exceeding more than ten percent of the funds appropriated under this Act. Allows the term of any such grant to exceed one year. Authorizes an Indian tribal government or intertribal consortium to receive a general assistance grant for a maximum of four years in each specific media area. Declares that the award of such grant to an Indian tribal government or intertribal consortium under this Act shall not result in a reduction of EPA grants for environmental programs to such tribal government or consortium. Permits the receipt of individual media grants or cooperative agreements. Includes the development and implementation of solid and hazardous waste programs for Indian lands among the purposes of such assistance. Requires the EPA Administrator to promulgate regulations establishing procedures for an Indian tribal government or intertribal consortium to apply for such grants. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1996."
