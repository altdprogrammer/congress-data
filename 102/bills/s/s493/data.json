Provides for grants to MHCs and CHCs for the CPECHPs. Limits the amount of funds appropriated for CHCs which may be used to plan and develop CHCs. Authorizes appropriations for immunizing individuals without charge and for related research, demonstration projects, public information and education, and professional training. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), to provide vaccines to the health department of each State, spending a specified minimum amount. Amends the Vaccine and Immunization Amendments of 1990 to direct the Secretary, through the CDC, to: (1) make grants to States (currently, to public and nonprofit private entities) for demonstration projects to provide, without administrative charge (currently, without charge), immunizations to children not over two years old; and (2) provide immunizations related to certain programs under the Public Health Service Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966; and (3) maintain private physician participation in immunization services and to encourage private physicians to provide such services to infants and children enrolled under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Public Health Service Act to add substance abuse treatment and prevention services to the list of supplemental health services with regard to MHCs and CHCs. Replaces provisions mandating model drug and alcohol abuse projects for pregnant and postpartum women and their infants with provisions directing the Secretary, through the Director of the Office for Substance Abuse Prevention, to make demonstration grants for substance abuse prevention, education, and treatment projects serving pregnant and postpartum women and their infants. Includes in the services to be offered outreach, prenatal and postpartum health care, pediatric health care, support services such as child care and transportation, referrals, employment counseling, and case management. Requires that services covered by title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act be provided by an entity qualified to receive Medicaid payments. Requires non-Federal matching contributions in a specified ratio. Limits grants to five years; allows renewal. Directs the Secretary to assist the prenatal clinics in the United States in implementing smoking cessation programs to decrease rates of smoking during pregnancy. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to or contracts with public entities for programs and policies to prevent and encourage cessation of tobacco use during pregnancy. Authorizes appropriations."
