    "text": "John F. Kennedy Center Act Amendments of 1992 - Amends the John F. Kennedy Center Act (the Act) to extend the authorization of appropriations for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (the Center). Revises provisions for the Center's Board of Trustees (the Board). Provides for the appointment (as ex officio members of the Board) of: (1) the Secretary of State (to replace the Secretary of Health and Human Services); and (2) the Superintendent of Schools of the District of Columbia (to replace the Chairman of the District of Columbia Recreation Board). Shortens the length of terms of general trustees (who are appointed by the President) from ten to six years. Revises Board duties to include: (1) a leadership role in national performing arts policies and programs; (2) a comprehensive and broad program for national and community outreach; (3) joint initiatives with the affiliated Very Special Arts for model programs in the arts for disabled individuals; (4) ensuring excellence and cultural diversity in the Center's education and outreach programs and policies; and (5) annual comprehensive Center building needs planning. Authorizes the Board to enter into contracts and other arrangements and make payments to public agencies or private organizations or persons to carry out its functions under the Act. Authorizes the Board to negotiate any contract for any capital improvement to the Center with selected contractors, and to award the contract on the basis of contractor qualifications as well as price. Revises Board powers to provide for appointment of a Center chairperson (rather than a director and assistant director). Directs the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) and the Board to enter into a cooperative agreement regarding major capital projects for the Center. Requires that the Board or its designated representative plan, design, and construct all such projects, with the approval of the Secretary (or designee) before commencement of such activities. Requires the Secretary to transfer funds for such activities to the Board. Requires the Board to submit quarterly progress reports to the Secretary (or designee) on such activities. Requires the Board, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior, to designate the maintenance, repair, alteration, and other services to be performed for the Center, in order to ensure that such services will meet Board's requirements for high quality operations. Prohibits the Board from requiring the expenditure of funds in excess of those appropriated for such purposes. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the Center for: (1) capital projects and for maintenance, repair, and security services (these funds go to the Secretary of the Interior to cover the Board's expenses and their use is prohibited for performing arts related production expenses); and (2) education and outreach programs (these funds go to the Secretary of Education, to be granted to the Board to carry out these activities)."
