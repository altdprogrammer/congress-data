Requires such rulemaking to address, among other things: (1) the need to require uniform procedures and standards for deicing aircraft before takeoff, including the use of particular deicing agents; (2) limitations and improvements on elapsed time allowed between deicing and takeoff; (3) requirements for deicing facilities in close proximity to the point of takeoff at U.S. airports; (4) modifications to FAA procedures for certifying aircraft for operation in the United States to require notification to aircraft operators of safety recommendations made by aircraft manufacturers; (5) the implementation of recommendations issued by the National Transportation Safety Board; and (6) modifications to procedures for determining when aircraft require deicing and whether such aircraft can safely operate under conditions which compel the use of deicing agents. Sets deadlines for interim and final regulations."
