Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1976 to direct the Secretary to consider the protection of coastal resources through the placement on State beaches of beach quality sand which has been dredged in constructing and maintaining navigation inlets and channels adjacent to such beaches as being in the public interest whenever such sand would otherwise be disposed of offshore. Authorizes appropriations for developing such plans."
