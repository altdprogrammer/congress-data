Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to form a negotiating committee to advise on the possible land exchanges that would best serve the public interest. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to provide technical assistance to the Secretary of Agriculture, including identifying parcels that may be available for disposal and would be suitable to exchange for all or part of such property to be acquired. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a plan to: (1) acquire the land comprising the proposed Galena Resort through eminent domain if, after one year of negotiations, the Secretary is unable to acquire such lands; and (2) ensure the highest and best recreational use of the lands."
