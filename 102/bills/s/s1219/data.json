Authorizes the: (1) sale of captive exotic birds only if they are properly marked; and (2) marking of such birds if the owner can show that they have been legally acquired. Requires persons who sell such birds to retain sales records for a prescribed period and to provide copies of such records to the Secretary upon request. Exempts common canaries, cockatiels, budgerigars, or other qualifying species from such marking requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to issue licenses to persons who transfer or import wild exotic birds. Sets forth: (1) circumstances under which such birds can be imported; and (2) specified reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Makes it unlawful for any person to: (1) import, transfer, possess, or sell any exotic bird unless such person is properly licensed and such bird is properly marked; and (2) commit, attempt to commit, or solicit another to commit, a violation of such requirements. Authorizes a person to petition the Secretary with respect to any finding, determination, or other action authorized by this Act. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties. Sets forth provisions relating to: (1) inspections and seizures and dispositions of such birds; (2) suspension of licenses; and (3) imposition of fees."
