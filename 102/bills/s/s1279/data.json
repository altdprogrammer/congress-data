    "text": "Deletes a Federal provision which precludes the Department of Veterans Affairs from providing veterans with medical equipment and prosthetic devices as part of outpatient care furnished for, or to obviate the need of, hospital care. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish needed fitting and training in the use of any medical equipment that the Department furnishes to a veteran. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) furnish veterans eligible for medical services with special clothing made necessary by the wearing of a prosthetic appliance; (2) repair or replace any medical equipment or prosthetic appliance which was damaged or destroyed by a fall or other accident caused by a service-connected disability for which the veteran is entitled to disability compensation; and (3) furnish devices for assisting veterans entitled to compensation on account of hearing impairment in overcoming profound deafness."
