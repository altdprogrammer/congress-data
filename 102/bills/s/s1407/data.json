  "summary": {
    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-06-27", 
    "text": "Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1991 - Amends Federal law to declare that: (1) for purposes of provisions relating to equal rights under the law, the right to make and enforce contracts includes the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship; and (2) the rights protected by the amended provisions are protected against impairment by nongovernmental discrimination and impairment under color of State law. Amends title VII (Equal Employment Opportunities) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to declare that an unlawful employment practice is established when it is shown that a discriminatory basis was a motivating factor, even though other factors also motivated the practice. Allows, when such mixed motives have been proven and the respondent shows it would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor, declaratory relief, limited types of injunctive relief, and attorney's fees and costs demonstrated to be directly attributable only to the pursuit of a claim under the enforcement provisions of title VII. Prohibits, in such cases, awarding damages or issuing certain types of orders. Provides for the finality of litigated or consent judgments or orders resolving an employment discrimination claim, barring actions (challenging an order) by persons who had certain types of notice and opportunity. Declares that an unlawful employment practice occurs when: (1) a seniority system is adopted, an individual becomes subject to a system, or a person aggrieved is injured by the application of a system or a part of a system; and (2) the system has been adopted for an intentionally discriminatory purpose, in violation of title VII, whether or not that discriminatory purpose is apparent on the face of the system. Allows expert fees to be included in attorney's fees awarded to the prevailing party in an employment discrimination case. Extends the time limit for an aggrieved employee or employment applicant to file a civil action after notice of final action by a department, agency, or unit of the Federal Government. Requires the same interest to compensate for delay in payment by the Government as in cases involving non-public parties. Amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) to replace provisions providing for tolling of the statute of limitations for actions under the ADEA with provisions requiring the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to give certain notice if it dismisses a charge or otherwise terminates proceedings. Sets forth time limits for bringing a civil action. Amends title VII (Equal Employment Opportunities) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include U.S. citizens employed in a foreign country in the definition of \"employee.\" Declares that it is not unlawful to take an action, with respect to an employee in a foreign country, which would otherwise be prohibited by certain unlawful employment practice provisions of such title, if compliance with those provisions would violate the law of the foreign country. Declares that: (1) any practice prohibited by such provisions engaged in by an employer who controls a corporation incorporated in a foreign country is presumed to be engaged in by the employer; and (2) those provisions do not apply to the foreign operations of a foreign employer which is not controlled by an American employee. Requires the EEOC, with regard to rights and obligations under title VII or other laws, to carry out educational and outreach activities, including in languages other than English, targeted to: (1) individuals who have historically been victims of employment discrimination and who have not been equitably served by the EEOC; and (2) individuals on whose behalf the EEOC has authority to enforce any other law. Prohibits construing the amendments made by this Act to affect court-ordered remedies, affirmative action, or conciliation agreements that are in accordance with the law. Declares that: (1) the rights and protections provided under specified provisions of Federal law (relating to equal rights under the law) and the amendments made by this Act apply with respect to any employee in an employment position in the Senate and any employing authority of the Senate, with enforcement and adjudication within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Senate; and (2) provisions of this Act setting forth related requirements and procedures are enacted by the Senate as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and may be changed as any other rule of the Senate. Declares that: (1) the rights and protections under title VII (Equal Employment Opportunities) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), specified Federal law relating to equal rights under the law, and the amendments made by this Act shall apply with respect to any employee in an employment position in the House of Representatives and any employing authority of the House, with remedies and procedures as described in a specified House Resolution; and (2) the provisions of this Act relating to such Resolution are enacted as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House and may be changed as any other rule of the House. Declares that the rights and protections under title VII, the ADEA, such Federal law, and the amendments made by this Act shall apply with respect to any employee in an employment position in an instrumentality of the Congress and any chief official of such an instrumentality, with the chief official establishing the remedies and procedures to be used. Makes such remedies and procedures exclusive. Defines instrumentalities of the Congress to include the Architect of the Capitol, the Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting Office, the Government Printing Office, the Office of Technology Assessment, and the U.S. Botanic Garden. Encourages the use of alternative means of dispute resolution to resolve disputes arising under the Acts amended by this Act."
