    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-05-21", 
    "text": "HOV Facility Improvement Act of 1991 - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to approve Federal highway projects designed to: (1) demonstrate the capability of achieving a reduction in single occupant vehicle miles and a reduction in mobile source emissions, including projects for the construction of high occupancy vehicle (HOV) facilities; and (2) encourage the use of shared rides (currently, carpools and vanpools). Makes apportionments for metropolitan planning organization (MPOs) projects to MPOs responsible for a population in urban areas of more than one million inhabitants which are in nonattainment for either ozone or carbon monoxide according to a specified formula, based on population, severity of air quality nonattainment, and the number of freeway lanes and miles dedicated to the usage of HOV lanes during peak rush hours. Limits the Federal share payable for costs of such projects to 80 percent. Authorizes to be appropriated out of the Highway Trust Fund $1,000,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1992 through 1996. Requires the Federal Highway Administration, within six months, to issue minimum design criteria for HOV facilities which: (1) specify a standard lane width to accommodate automobiles and transit vehicles, including intercity buses; and (2) require that new HOV facilities contain ramps and interchanges, or the capability for such, for connection with existing or planned transit commuter parking and loading areas. Specifies that ramps, interchanges, and parking and loading areas which are part of an HOV facility project shall also qualify for any preferential match accorded to HOV facilties."
