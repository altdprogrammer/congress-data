    "text": "Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 - Title I: Safety and Soundness - Subtitle A: Deposit Insurance Funds - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to increase from $5,000,000,000 to $30,000,000,000 the amount of credit available from the Treasury to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Sets maximum limits upon the outstanding obligations of the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). Directs the Comptroller General to report quarterly to certain congressional committees regarding FDIC compliance with such obligation limitations. Mandates a repayment schedule as a prerequisite to any such borrowing. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a copy of such schedule to certain congressional committees and to consult with them regarding repayment terms. Authorizes the FDIC to impose special assessments upon insured depository institutions (in addition to existing assessments) if emergency assessments are required and if they are allocated between the BIF members and SAIF members according to their respective needs. Modifies recapitalization guidelines for the BIF. Sets forth borrowing guidelines the BIF must follow when borrowing from its members. Subtitle B: Supervisory Reforms - Requires annual on-site examinations of all insured depository institutions except certain Government-controlled institutions. Subjects certain small-sized, well-capitalized institutions to requirements for examinations every 18 months instead of every 12 months. Requires each Federal banking agency, acting through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, to establish an examination improvement program. Requires annual fiscal status reports from all insured depository institutions (except certain small-sized insured depository institutions). Prescribes guidelines for preparation of such reports. Sets forth guidelines for assessments to cover FDIC costs of conducting examinations of insured depository institutions and their affiliates. Sets forth an examination and supervisory fees schedule which may be imposed by Federal regulatory agencies upon national banks and savings associations. Outlines the application procedure for deposit insurance. Subtitle C: Accounting Reforms - Mandates that: (1) the accounting principles applicable to all insured depository institutions be uniform and consistent with generally accepted accounting principles; (2) each appropriate Federal banking agency implement certain accounting principles (maintaining uniform accounting standards to use in determining compliance with statutory requirements of insured depository institutions); and (3) each appropriate Federal banking agency report annually to certain congressional committees on any differences between its accounting or capital standards and those used by other agencies. Directs Federal regulatory agencies to prescribe regulations requiring insured depository institutions to submit information annually on small businesses and small farm lending in their reports of condition. Amends the FDIA to set forth property disposition standards for the FDIC in its corporate, conservator, or receiver capacity. Subtitle D: Prompt Regulatory Action - Mandates that each appropriate Federal banking agency: (1) take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions by prescribing or rescinding, as appropriate, specified capitalization measures established according to statutory guidelines (including capital restoration plan requirements); and (2) prescribe safety and soundness standards for operation and management of such institutions and depository institution holding companies. Provides additional grounds for appointing depository institution conservators and receivers to facilitate prompt regulatory action. Subtitle E: Least-Cost Resolution - Amends the FDIA to require the FDIC to implement a least-cost resolution approach according to designated guidelines to ensure that its obligations to insured depositors are honored using the least possible long-term cost to the deposit insurance fund. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to make emergency advances to the FDIC if it is determined that in certain circumstances such least-cost resolution approach would have serious adverse effects on economic conditions or financial stability. Outlines the emergency advance procedures. Mandates an annual General Accounting Office (GAO) audit of the FDIC and the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) to determine compliance with such least-cost approach. Sets forth procedural guidelines with respect to: (1) creditors' claims; (2) data collection; (3) financial services industry impact analyses before resolution of a troubled insured depository institution; and (4) financial assistance prior to appointment of a receiver or conservator. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to impose limitations upon advances by any Federal Reserve bank to an undercapitalized depository institution. Authorizes the Board to examine depository institutions and their affiliates regarding advances made to them. Expresses the sense of the Congress that Federal banking agencies should facilitate early resolution of troubled insured depository institutions if it would have the least possible long-term cost to the deposit insurance fund. Directs the FDIC to report to the Congress an analysis of the effect of early resolution on the deposit insurance funds.
