Amends Federal provisions concerning armed forces allowances to authorize allowances to dependents who reside under Federal Government orders in the vicinity of a station from which a departure is ordered and who move to an authorized safe haven. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to reimburse Federal civilian employees or members of the uniformed services who were employed in connection with, or assigned to, Homestead Air Force Base for losses of real property resulting from the damage of Hurricane Andrew. Sets forth reimbursement amounts. Requires owners receiving reimbursement to transfer all right, title, and interest in such property to the Secretary for disposal. Authorizes appropriations."
