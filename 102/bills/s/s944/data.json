    "text": "Airspace Protection Act of 1991 - Requires the Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), to provide written notice on any proposed designation of special use airspace to: (1) the Governor of any State over which airspace is sought to be designated as special use airspace; (2) the head of an Indian tribe on any Indian lands which are likely to be affected by such designation; (3) the Secretary of the Interior, if such designation includes airspace above any national park, national wildlife refuge, national wild and scenic river, national trail, or national wilderness administered by the Department of the Interior; and (4) each group of users of such airspace. Directs the Secretary of Transportation, upon the request of any Governor, to hold a public meeting and consider comments prior to making a determination with respect to such designation. Requires the Secretary (acting through the FAA) and the Secretary of Defense to adopt procedures for assuring that such designations comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Provides for the triennial review of each designation. Requires the termination or modification of any designation if it is determined that the use of such airspace cannot justify the continued designation of special use airspace."
