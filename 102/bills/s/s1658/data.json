Establishes requirements for wage determinations concerning helper classifications. Directs the Secretary to comply with specified criteria in determining whether the use of a particular helper classification prevails in the area involved, for purposes of issuing wage rates for semi-skilled helper classifications. Directs the contracting officer to: (1) require, if specified criteria have not been met, that any class of laborers or mechanics, including helpers, not listed in the wage determination be classified in conformance with such wage determination; or (2) if such specified criteria have been met, approve an additional classification and wage rate, and fringe benefits. Prohibits the ratio of helpers to journeymen employed by the contractor or subcontractor from being greater than two helpers for every three journeymen. Requires paying any helper performing work on the job site in excess of such permissible ratio at least the applicable journeyman's (or laborer's, where appropriate) wage rate based on the wage determination for the work actually performed. Requires paying any other worker at least the applicable wage rate based on the wage determination for the classification of work actually performed by such worker if such worker is listed on a payroll at a helper wage rate but is not a helper."
