    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-03-04", 
    "text": "Airline Competition Enhancement Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to allow an air carrier having less than 12 air carrier slots (a reservation for an instrument flight rule takeoff or landing of an aircraft) to carry out air carrier operations at a high density airport to also use commuter slots as air carrier slots to carry out such operations. Limits such carrier to the use of not more than 12 air carrier slots, including slots used as air carrier slots, at such airport in any 24-hour period. Prohibits vendors that operate a computer reservation system from: (1) making available to subscribers an integrated display in which information is ordered or emphasized based upon factors relating to air carrier identity, or supply information from its system to persons creating or attempting to create such an integrated display (if the vendor knows or has reason to know that such person intends to create or attempt to create such an integrated display); (2) making available to a subscriber any subscriber transaction capability which is more complete or efficient with respect to one participant than to any other, unless the vendor offers such participant the opportunity to participate in such capability at the same price as others, and the participant says no; (3) making available to a participant any participant transaction capability which is more complete or efficient with respect to one participant than to any other, or is provided through the use of telecommunications facilities, protocols, or procedures which discriminate against a participant or which are not comparable to those used for providing such capability to any other participant, with the aforementioned exception; (4) charging a participant fee which is above the fee found fair and reasonable by an arbitrator's decision with respect to such vendor unless a year has elapsed since the decision; or (5) prohibiting a subscriber from obtaining any other computer reservation system. Prohibits a vendor or air carrier from requiring, or providing any incentives to induce, any subscriber to use information from a computer reservation system to create an integrated display in which information is ordered or emphasized based upon factors relating to air carrier identity. Provides, as of three years from the date of enactment of this section, that: (1) no air carrier or its affiliate shall use a computer reservation system as an internal reservation system; and (2) each computer reservation system shall be managed separately and autonomously from the internal reservation system of an air carrier or an affiliate. Sets forth provisions relating to: (1) subscriber contract restraints; (2) arbitration of participant fees; and (3) treatment of certain reduced computer reservation system services. Directs the Secretary of Transportation not to give consideration to the availability of slots at high density airports in determining the provision of basic essential air service to small communities and selecting an air carrier to provide such service. Requires the Secretary to ensure that a sufficient number of such slots are available to the air carrier providing such service at such airports. Provides provisions for the transfer of slots at such airports."
