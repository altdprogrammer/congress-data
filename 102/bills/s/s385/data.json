Requires the Secretary to review such inventory and list the properties so designated in the Federal Register. Restricts the Corporation's power to dispose of properties so designated. Prescribes guidelines under which the RTC may transfer such designated properties to qualified land stewards (i.e., certain governmental or nonprofit organizations) for long-term preservation or use consistent with their special significance."
