Directs the Attorney General to establish guidelines for the reporting of such information. Specifies that such guidelines shall require that: (1) a reporting State ensure that reports of all convictions under the criminal child abuse law of the State are maintained by a State repository; and (2) a State repository maintain close liaison with the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for the exchange of information and technical assistance in cases of child abuse. Requires the Attorney General to publish an annual statistical summary of the child abuser information reported under this Act. Makes compliance with this Act a condition to the receipt by a State of any grant, cooperative agreement, or other assistance under the Victims of Crime Act and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act."
