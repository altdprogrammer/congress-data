    "text": "Child Support Recovery Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal criminal code to set penalties (a fine, imprisonment up to six months, or both for a first offense and a fine, imprisonment up to two years, or both, in any other case) for willfully failing to pay a past due support obligation with respect to a child who resides in another State. Directs the court, upon a conviction of such offense, to order restitution in an amount equal to the past due support obligation as it exists at the time of sentencing. Authorizes the court, as a condition of probation, to require a defendant to comply with the terms of any court order or order of an administrative process pursuant to the law of a State by making payments for the support and maintenance of a child or of a child and the parent with whom the child is living. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to make grants to States, for use by States and local entities in the States, to develop, implement, and enforce criminal interstate child support legislation and coordinate criminal interstate child support enforcement efforts. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) uses of grant funds; (2) State and local application requirements; (3) review of State applications; (4) the Federal share of funded project costs; and (5) an annual evaluation by grant recipients. Authorizes appropriations. Establishes the Commission on Child and Family Welfare to: (1) compile information and data on the issues that affect the best interests of children; (2) compile a report that lists the strengths and weaknesses of the child welfare system as it relates to placement, summarizes State laws and regulations relating to visitation, and makes recommendations for changing the system or developing a Federal role in strengthening the system; (3) study the strengths and weaknesses of the juvenile and family courts as they relate to visitation, custody, and child support enforcement, and suggest any recommendations for changing the systems; (4) study domestic issues that relate to the treatment and placement of children and suggest recommendations for any needed changes; and (5) submit a final report on its findings and recommendations to the President and the Congress by January 1, 1995. Authorizes appropriations."
