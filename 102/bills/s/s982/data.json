    "text": "Hazardous Waste Recycling Act of 1991 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate requirements for hazardous waste recycling facilities. Applies specified requirements for recyclable materials set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations to owners and operators of hazardous waste recycling facilities. Requires owners or operators of facilities using closed-loop or direct reuse manufacturing processes to certify to the Administrator that the facilities meet the requirements for such processes and are exempt from requirements for hazardous waste facilities. Defines a \"closed-loop process\" as a process through which materials are returned to the original process in which they were generated and reused in the production process in a specified manner. Requires owners or operators of new facilities using such processes to make such certification prior to commencing operations. Directs the Administrator to promulgate requirements to provide for permits for facilities which store and recycle hazardous waste in enclosed tanks or containers. Provides for: (1) public notice and comment prior to construction and commencement of operations at such facilities; (2) a demonstration by the facility owner or operator that the facility is in compliance with applicable requirements; (3) annual on-site inspections of such facilities by the permitting authority; and (4) the submission of information to verify compliance with the permit. Authorizes the Administrator to revoke permits if compliance cannot be verified."
