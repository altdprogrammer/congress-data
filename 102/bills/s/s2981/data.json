    "text": "Establishes the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area, Idaho. Requires the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to revise, and review at least once every four years, the comprehensive management plan developed for the conservation area. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a visitors center designed to interpret the history and the geological, ecological, natural, cultural, and other resources of the area as well as the multiple-use management of it, and the biology of the raptors and their relationships to man. Requires the Secretary to permit continued: (1) use of the conservation area's Orchard Training Area by the Idaho National Guard; and (2) grazing of domestic livestock within such area. Declares that: (1) nothing in this Act shall be construed as affecting recognized agricultural practices or other activities on private land adjacent to or within the conservation area boundary; and (2) the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall retain exclusive jurisdiction concerning all aspects of the continued and future operation of hydroelectric facilities (licensed or relicensed) under the Federal Power Act located within the boundaries of the area. Provides that: (1) lands acquired by the Secretary within the conservation area shall become a part of such area; (2) acquisition of private land will require a willing buyer and seller; and (3) no lands shall be condemned for the sole purpose of expanding the area. Requires the Secretary to study, identify, and initiate voluntary land exchanges which would resolve ownership-related land use conflicts within the conservation area. Releases lands within the Snake River Birds of Prey National Area that have been found unsuitable for wilderness designation from further management pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Declares that nothing in this Act nor any action taken pursuant to it shall constitute either an expressed or implied Federal reservation of water or water right for any purpose. Authorizes appropriations."
