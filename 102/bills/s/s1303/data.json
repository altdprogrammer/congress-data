    "text": "Outlaw Gang Control Act of 1991 - Title I: Enhanced Penalties for the Misuse of Firearms and Explosives - Amends the Federal criminal code to make it unlawful to possess stolen firearms, ammunition, or explosives, subject to certain conditions. (Current law makes it unlawful to ship, transport, or receive stolen firearms, or to receive, transport, ship, sell, or dispose of stolen explosives.) Makes it unlawful to transfer a firearm having reasonable cause to believe that such firearm will be used to commit a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. (Current law provides that the transferor must know that the firearm will be used to commit such crimes.) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the statute of limitations from three years to five years for specified violations of the National Firearms Act. Makes it unlawful for anyone other than a licensed manufacturer, dealer, or collector, who does not reside in any State, to receive a firearm. Specifies that whoever steals a firearm or explosive material that is moving in interstate or foreign commerce shall be fined, imprisoned for between five and ten years, or both. Establishes a mandatory minimum penalty of five years' imprisonment for possession of (current law specifies only using or carrying) a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. Provides that: (1) the penalty for conspiring to violate the Federal firearms or explosives laws shall be the same as for the substantive offense; and (2) whoever steals a firearm from a licensed importer, manufacturer, dealer, or collector, or explosive material from a licensed importer, manufacturer, dealer, or permittee, shall be fined or imprisoned for up to ten years, or both. Title II: Seizure and Forfeiture - Expands the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to seize and forfeit: (1) personal property in connection with the investigation of violations of Federal criminal code provisions relating to the use or carrying of firearms during and in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime; and (2) real or personal property that is involved, used, or intended to be used in connection with, or which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to, specified explosive materials violations. Prohibits the forfeiture of property to the extent of the interest of an owner or lienholder by reason of a violation committed without the knowledge of such owner or lienholder. Sets forth procedures with respect to the seizure and forfeiture of property under this title. Title III: Funds for Undercover Purchases - Requires that moneys expended from appropriations for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) for the purchase of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives for evidentiary purposes and subsequently recovered shall be reimbursed to the appropriation current at the time of deposit. Title IV: National Center for Outlaw Gang Analysis - Establishes within the BATF the National Center for Outlaw Gang Analysis to identify outlaw gangs that engage in drug-related and other violent crime, to gather and share intelligence on illegal drug activities undertaken by such gangs, to increase public awareness, to establish a national hotline for the public to report unlawful gang activity, to conduct seminars and conferences for law enforcement and correction agencies and community leaders, and to publish an annual report on gang identification, the incidence of gang use of explosives and firearms, and the results of Federal outlaw gang eradication efforts. Authorizes appropriations. Makes the Director of the BATF responsible for: (1) providing national oversight in the accumulation and dissemination of gang-related information; and (2) coordinating gang-related investigations by Federal law enforcement agencies."
