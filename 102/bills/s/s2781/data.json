    "text": "Rural Communities Hazardous Waste Information Act of 1992 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit the issuance of permits for off site hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facilities to be located in a rural community unless a rural community impact statement has been prepared. Makes such statements available for public review. Sets forth requirements concerning the selection of independent contractors to prepare such statements. Provides for the imposition of fees on permit applicants. Requires such fees to be in an amount necessary to cover the cost of preparing impact statements. Requires impact statements to describe: (1) the economic and social impacts of the proposed facility on each rural community which is within a 20-mile radius of the facility site, including effects on employment, recreational amenities, tourism, public safety and emergency preparedness, and transportation systems; and (2) the costs of mitigating such impacts."
