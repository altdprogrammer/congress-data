Makes eligible for such grants State or local educational agencies, individual schools, nonprofit private organizations, institutions of higher education, and businesses. Directs the Secretary to establish and operate, by grant or contract with a specified kind of nonprofit organization a National Advisory Center for Parents as Partners in Learning to provide technical assistance, staff training, and model materials for PPL programs. Directs the Secretary to evaluate such grants annually, and disseminate such information. Sets forth a gradually declining Federal share of program costs in grant payments.
