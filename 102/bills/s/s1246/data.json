    "text": "Higher Education Act Amendments of 1991 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to revise and reauthorize its programs. Title I: Access and Retention - Establishes a new HEA title I, Access and Retention, to provide special programs and projects: (1) to identify and encourage students from low-income or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds who have potential for postsecondary and graduate education; and (2) to prepare students from such backgrounds for such education. (Replaces the current title I, Postsecondary Programs for Nontraditional Students.) Establishes a new Precollege Outreach Program of grants to States (replacing the current part A program) to support outreach services for individuals from low-income and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in order to help them successfully complete secondary education and begin and succeed in postsecondary education. Authorizes States to make subgrants to eligible entities to carry out one or more of such services. Provides for a gradually declining Federal share of project costs, from 90 percent in the first year, with five percent reductions in succeeding years leveling off at 70 percent for the fifth year and thereafter. Includes among criteria to be used by the State agency in selecting projects the degree to which an applicant's service area include large numbers of low-income or first-generation college students. Prohibits an institution of higher education from using such grant funds for recruitment of students to enroll at that institution. Authorizes appropriations. Establishes a new Student Support Service Program of grants to institutions of higher education (replacing the current part B National Programs) to support individuals pursuing postsecondary education programs who are first-generation college students or from low-income or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. Directs the Secretary, in making such grant awards, to give highest priority to projects at institutions with the lowest educational and general expenditures per full-time equivalent student. Sets forth types of authorized services to assist in motivating and preparing students for postsecondary education. Authorizes appropriations. Establishes a new Ronald E. McNair Graduate Outreach Program of grants to institutions of higher education (combining and replacing certain current part C programs) for services to eligible individuals from low-income and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds to prepare them for graduate, professional, and doctoral study. Directs the Secretary not to make such a grant award without assurances that: (1) at least two-thirds of project participants will be first-generation college students from low-income families; (2) remaining participants will be from a group underrepresented in graduate education; (3) participants will be enrolled in a degree program at an institution of higher education; and (4) participants in summer research internships will have completed their sophomore year in postsecondary education. Sets forth authorized uses of grant funds, including opportunities for research or other scholarly activities, summer internships, and fellowships. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: National Graduate Fellowships Program - Repeals HEA titles II (Academic Library and Information Technology Enhancement) and IX (Graduate Programs). Establishes a new HEA title II, National Graduate Fellowships Program, for competitive grants to institutions of higher education to provide financial support to highly qualified individuals in graduate studies in areas of national need (including individuals from groups traditionally underrepresented in such studies in such areas). Designates each fellowship recipient a National Graduate Fellow. Limits the fellowship stipend to five years. Authorizes the Secretary to award continuation grants to institutions demonstrating satisfactory progress. Revises institutions receiving them to give preference in awarding fellowship stipends to students who have received National Graduate Fellowships and who demonstrate satisfactory progress in their studies. Sets forth reporting requirements. Directs the Secretary to make new grants under title II only to the extent that funds remain from continued prior funding under HEA to recipients of graduate fellowship assistance for: (1) the Foreign Language and Areas Studies Fellowship Program; (2) the Patricia Roberts Harris Fellowship Program; (3) the Jacob K. Javits Fellows Program; or (4) the Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need Program. Requires institutions receiving title II grants to give preference in awarding fellowships to students who previously received such assistance under a listed program. Allows a student who received such assistance to subsequently receive a National Graduate Fellowship, but limits the combined period of assistance to not more than five years. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Institutional Aid - Revises HEA title III, Institutional Aid. Eliminates provisions for special consideration for certain activities. (Deems these simply as allowable program activities.) Revises eligibility criteria for institutions to require that their average educational and general expenditures be lower, by a percentage determined annually, than the same expenditures per full-time equivalent undergraduate student of institutions that offer similar instruction. Eliminates as a requirement for such assistance that such institutions are to have been authorized for the preceding five years to offer a specified degree program, and accredited or making reasonable progress toward accreditation. Eliminates provisions for waivers of such requirement for institutions with specified percentages of minority students. Limits grant awards to only one such grant, with a maximum five-year duration, to any eligible institution, except that a one-year planning grant may be awarded for preparing plans and applications. Requires: (1) grant applications to describe measurable goals for the institution's management and academic programs, and a plan for achieving them; and (2) continuation applications to demonstrate progress toward achieving them. Revises the program of grants to strengthen Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Allows the use of grant funds to establish or improve a development office to strengthen or improve contributions from alumni and the private sector. Prohibits awarding to any one undergraduate institution: (1) more than two such grants for a period not to exceed ten years from September 30, 1987; or (2) any grant exceeding five years. Requires grant applications to describe measurable goals for the institution's financial management as well as academic goals, and plans to achieve them. Revises and renames a certain program Endowment Challenge Grants for Institutions Eligible for Assistance. Increases the amount (from $10,000,000 to $20,000,000) which appropriations for such grants must exceed before the Secretary may make a two-to-one matching endowment grant exceeding $1,000,000 to an institution. Gives priority for endowment grants to applicants that have received another title III grant within the preceding five years. Revises title III general provisions. Authorizes appropriations. Title IV: Student Assistance - Part A: Grants to Students - Amends HEA title IV (Student Assistance) with respect to the program of Grants to Students in Attendance at Institutions of Higher Education. Subpart 1: Pell Grants - Extends Pell Grant program authority through FY 1997. Eliminates a requirement that the Secretary make an advance payment to eligible institutions of at least 85 percent of the amount each institution requests as needed to pay Pell Grants to eligible students. Revises requirements for the amount of Pell Grants. Sets the amount of an award to a student at the lesser of: (1) the specified maximum award less the expected family contribution; or (2) the percentage (based on family-income level) of the amount of the student's need for financial assistance (i.e. cost of attendance minus expected family contribution). Increases the maximum award amount to $3,700 for 1992-3 and the four succeeding award years. Sets forth a table of percentages of student need for award computation. Increases the minimum allowable award from $200 to $400. Eliminates certain restrictions on the award of Pell Grants to students attending on a less than half-time basis. Revises the period of eligibility for Pell Grants. Limits such period to the full-time equivalent of three academic years in the aggregate in the case of all undergraduate degree or certificate programs normally requiring two years or less. Specifies that longer eligibility periods for longer programs are cumulative and include periods for which the student received a Pell Grant under shorter programs Revises requirements for adjustments for insufficient appropriations for the Pell Grant program. Provides for reduction of all awards by a percentage determined in accordance with a schedule of reductions by the Secretary. (Currently certain awards are held harmless.) Increases the minimumm allowable Pell Grant, under such reduction formula, from $100 to $200. Eliminates certain limitations on the availability of Pell Grant funds when excess amounts are available at the end of a fiscal year. Subpart 2: Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants - Extends the authorization of appropriations for the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG) program, but reduces the amount of funding. Reduces the Federal share of SEOG awards to not more to not more than 50 percent in FY 1992 and thereafter. (Current law provides for a maximum Federal share of 85 percent in FY 1991, and allows an even greater Federal share if the Secretary determines it warranted.) Subpart 3: Repeals - Repeals authority for the following programs: (1) Grants to States for State Student Incentives (SSI); (2) Special Programs for Students from Disadvantaged Backgrounds (TRIO programs); (3) Assistance to Institutions of Higher Education (including the Veterans Education Outreach Program); and (4) Special Child Care Services for Disadvantaged College Students. Subpart 4: Presidential Achievement Scholarship Program - Creates a Presidential Achievement Scholarship Program to award scholarships to Pell Grant recipients who demonstrate high levels of academic achievement. Authorizes appropriations. Allows Presidential Achievement Scholars to receive up to four scholarships, each for one academic year, for full-time undergraduate study (or five scholarships for full-time undergraduate study programs that require attendance for five academic years). Bases eligibility in the first year of postsecondary education on the student's receiving a Pell Grant and either: (1) ranking, or having ranked, in the top ten percent, by grade point average, of his or her high school graduating class; or (2) achieving at least the announced minimum score on one of the nationally administered, standardized tests identified by the Secretary. Bases eligibility after the first year on the student's receiving a Pell Grant and: (1) being enrolled in a program of study of at least two years that lead to a degree or certificate; and (2) ranking in the top 20 percent, by cumulative grade point average or equivalent, of his or her postsecondary education class as of the last academic year of study completed. Provides that a student's eligibility for such a scholarship does not depend on receipt of scholarship or Pell Grant in the previous academic year. Requires full-time attendance at the institution as a condition for receiving such a scholarship. Directs the Secretary to establish scholarship award procedures, including deadlines for consideration of students. Requires disbursement of scholarship proceeds to the institutions, but not until the student recipients are enrolled. Sets such scholarship award at $500 for any academic year. Reduces such amount by the amount it exceeds the student's cost of attendance by itself or when combined with other Federal or non-Federal grant or scholarship assistance in the the academic year. Provides for proportionate reductions in each award to adjust for insufficient appropriations. Subpart 5: National Science Scholars Program - Creates a National Science Scholars Program to award scholarships to outstanding students, selected by the President, for the study of physical, life, or computer sciences, mathematics, or engineering. Authorizes appropriations. Provides for an a initial award for the first year of undergraduate study and continuation award for the remaining three (or four) years, as appropriate. Allows National Science Scholars to use such award to attend any defined institution of higher education. Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF Director) and the Secretary to jointly establish criteria for selection of scholars for initial year awards. Requires such criteria to include potential to successfully complete a postsecondary program, and motivation to pursue a career, in such fields. Allows consideration to be given to individual financial need and to the nondiscriminatory promotion of participation by minorities and individus with disabilities. Requires States to establish a nominating committee, if they desire to qualify student residents for selection. Requires each State nominating committee to submit to the President nominations of from four to ten individuals from each congressional district. Requires priority ranking of such nominations. Requires the President to select and announce two such scholars for each academic year from each congressional district. Directs the Secretary to make continuation awards of additional scholarships to recipient of initial awards who meet specified requirements. Requires disbursement of scholarship proceeds to the institutions, but not until the student recipients are enrolled. Requires the NSF Director and the Secretary to encourage the support and assistance of civic groups, the business community, professional associations, institutions of higher education, and others in providing scholarship assistance to National Science Scholarship finalists. Sets forth eligibility requirements for initial and continuation awards. Allows the Secretary to waive full-time attendance requirements in unusual circumstances. Directs the Secretary to determine circumstances for eligibility reinstatement after an interruption of schooling for personal reasons. Requires the Secretary annually to notify all public and private secondary schools and all institutions of higher education in each State of the availability of such scholarships. Sets such a scholarship award at $6,000 for any academic year. Reduces such amount by the amount it exceeds the student's cost of attendance by itself or when combined with other Federal and non-Federal grant or scholarship assistance in the academic year. Provides for proportionate reductions in each award to adjust for insufficient appropriations. Requires priority consideration to be given students receiving such scholarships, to the extent they are otherwise qualified, for federally financed summer employment in federally funded research and development centers that complements and reinforces their educational program. Requires Federal agencies to participate actively in providing appropriate summer employment opportunities for such students. Repeals provisions of the Excellence in Mathematics, Science, and Engineering Education Act of 1990 which currently authorize the National Science Scholars Program. Subpart 6: Special Programs for Students Whose Families Are Engaged in Migrant and Seasonal Farmwork - Revises the Special Programs for Students Whose Families Are Engaged in Migrant and Seasonal Farmwork. Renames certain grants as grants to build the program capacity of educational agencies, institutions, and organizations to operate high school equivalency programs (HEP) and college assistance migrant programs (CAMP) for migrant students. Makes State and local educational agencies (as well as as institutions of higher education and private nonprofit organizations) eligible for such HEP grants. Allows provision of HEP services to individuals 16 years of age or older, or beyond the State age of compulsory school attendance, and not currently enrolled in school. (Current laws requires 17 years of age or over.) Limits authorized CAMP services, with specified exceptions, to those services necessary to assist migrant students in completing their first year of college. Requires CAMP grantees to provide follow-up services for migrant students after their first year of college. Authorizes use of up to ten percent of the CAMP grant for such follow-up services. Requires such follow-up services to include: (1) monitoring and reporting on student academic progress; and (2) referring students to providers of counseling services, academic assistance, or financial aid.

Extends the authorization for, and the amount of, new loan principal that may be made to students covered by Federal loan insurance. Increases the annual and aggregate loan limits under the Stafford loan and the Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) programs. Requires lenders to: (1) offer Stafford and SLS loan borrowers the option of repaying such loans on a graduated repayment schedule under specified conditions; (2) obtain the borrower's authorization for entry of judgment against the borrower in the event of default; and (3) obtain the borrower's driver's license number, if any, at the time of loan application (for the parent loan PLUS program, as well). Eliminates a provision which allowed an institution to refuse to certify a student's eligibility for a loan, or allowed it to certify a lesser amount, under specified conditions. Revises loan deferment provisions. Retains deferment while the borrower is in specified courses of study.

Revises provisions for eligibility limitations, suspensions, terminations, other hearing procedures, and fines for lenders or institutions that violate program requirements. Sets forth conflict-of-interest restrictions on guaranty agency officers and employers. Prohibits any guaranty agency from permitting any of its officers or employees, or any member of their immediate families, to have a direct financial interest in, or serve as an officer or employee of, any lender, secondary market, contractor, or service with which the guaranty agency does business. Includes financial information among the information the Secretary may reasonably require from a guaranty agency to carry out the student loan programs and protect the U.S. financial interest. Revises the administrative cost and collection retention allowances for guaranty agencies. Revises provisions for oversight of guaranty agencies. Authorizes the Secretary to require a guaranty agency to submit and implement a management plan if the ratio of its reserve funds to outstanding guarantees is less than a set level, or if its administrative or financial condition jeopardizes its continued ability to perform its responsibilities under its guaranty agreement. Authorizes the Secretary to terminate the guaranty agreement with any agency that fails to submit an acceptable management plan or fails to improve substantially its condition in accordance with such a plan. Authorizes the Secretary to assume guaranty agency functions of agencies whose agreements are terminated by the Secretary or themselves. Limits the Secretary's liability for any outstanding liabilities of a guaranty agency, the functions of which the Secretary has assumed, to the fair market value of assets assigned by the agency to the Secretary, minus any necessary liquidation or administrative costs. Requires State backing of designated guaranty agencies. Requires each State to guarantee, with its full faith and credit or the equivalent, all student loans guaranteed by the guaranty agency designated for that State for borrowers attending eligible institutions in that State. Provides that a State may elect to guarantee, in addition, student loans guaranteed by any other guarantee agency for borrowers who are attending eligible institutions in that State. Requires the State, if such a guaranty agency backed by the State is unable to discharge its insurance obligation, to be responsible for discharging them, as well as administrative costs associated with transferring the guaranty agency's operations to another entity. Directs the Secretary, if a State discharges such insurance obligations, to pay the State the amount the guaranty agency would otherwise have received as reimbursement. Directs the Secretary, unless a State demonstrates by January 1, 1994, that it is backing the designated guaranty agency, to assess institutions of higher education participating in the student loan program that are located in that State a fee based on the risk of financial loss to the Federal Government that the State would otherwise assume. Requires such fees to be deposited in the student loan insurance fund. Requires State to pay a share of default costs in specified circumstances. Allows a State to charge a fee to an institution of higher education in the State participating in the loan program, to an approved fee structure based on the institution's cohort default rates and the State's risk of loss under such requirement.

Requires Sallie Mae's annual report on its operations and activities: (1) to be submitted to the Secretary and the Congress (currently the President and the Congress); and (2) to include specific information regarding its investments and debts, the characteristics of its student loan portfolio, and other data which the Secretary may reasonably require. Part C: Work-Study Programs - Extends the authorization of appropriations for Work-Study Programs (but reduces the amount of such funding). Lowers the maximum Federal share of the the compensation of students employed in the work-study program to 50 percent for FY 1992 and succeeding fiscal years.

Eliminates special incentives (such as increased Federal administrative allowance and increased Federal share of student compensation for community service-learning jobs under the work-study program. Lowers the maximum Federal share of the cost of any job location and development program, under the work-study program from 80 percent to 50 percent. Prohibits students attending proprietary institutions of higher education from being employed by such institutions under the work-study program (but allows them to participate in work-study program employment by a government agency or a private nonprofit organization). Reduces from $200 to $100 the amount of work-study program compensation in excess of need that a student may receive. Eliminates provisions for private sector employment agreements under the work-study program. Part D: Income Contingent Loan Program - Extends through FY 1996 the authorization of appropriations for the Income Contingent Direct Loan Program (ICL program) (and increases the amount of such funding).

Makes consortia of institutions of higher educations (as well as single institutions) eligible to participate in the ICL program. Provides for an aggregate ICL loan limit of $50,000 for individual graduate and professional students, including any such loans made to such persons before they become graduate or professional students. Provides for an annual limit of $10,000 on ICL loans to graduate and professional students. (Retains current limits for undergraduates.) Requires ICL applicants to provide their driver license number, if any. Requires institutions to: (1) obtain a credit report on any ICL applicant over age 21; and (2) require any such applicant with an adverse credit history to obtain a cosigner and report to the Congress on the cost-effectiveness of the ICL program, its impact on participating institutions and students, and the feasibility of extending it to a loan program of general applicability. Part E: Perkins Loan Program - Authorizes appropriations for the Perkins Loan Program, but only for reimbursement of institutions for Perkins loans that are cancelled for certain public service. Terminates the authorization of appropriations for: (1) Federal contributions to student loan funds established under such program; and (2) continuation loans to certain students who have received earlier Perkins Loans. Revises provisions for terms of such loans and cancellation for public service. Extends provisions for distribution of assets from such student loan funds. Repeals provisions for allocation of funds. Part F: Need Analysis - Revises provisions for need analysis to apply them to all need-based student assistance programs, including Pell Grants (which currently have a separate need analysis system).

Includes as an institution of higher education for the student assistance programs any institution that provides programs of at least six months (or 600 clock hours) that prepare students for gainful employment in recognized occupations, and that has been in existence for at least two years. Makes ineligible for student assistance program participation for specified periods any institution whose cohort default rate equals or exceeds a specified threshold percentage. Revises provisions for proprietary institutions of higher education. Authorizes the Secretary, if a particular category of proprietary institution does not meet specified student assistance program requirements because there is no nationally recognized accrediting agency or association qualified to accredit such institutions, to: (1) appoint an advisory committee to recommend qualifying standards; and (2) determine whether the particular schools meet them. Provides for reduction of student assistance loan award maximums for short-term programs. Revises provisions relating to a master calendar.
