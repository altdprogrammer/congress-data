Prescribes agreement guidelines. Precludes the Secretary from entering into an agreement without prior submission to the Congress of a needs justification with respect to the engagement of a private contractor, and a demonstration that the proposed agreement is in the best economic interests of the United States. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress regarding the benefits of the agreements entered into, and recommendations for possible extension of the agreement authority."
