Sets forth copyright renewal terms and procedures. Provides that if an application is submitted for the renewed and extended term of a copyright and an original term registration has not been made, the Register of Copyrights may request information relating to the existence, ownership, or duration of such copyright for the original term. Increases the fee for registering a claim for renewal of a subsisting copyright in its first term. Title II: National Film Preservation - National Film Preservation Act of 1992 - Repeals the National Film Preservation Act of 1988 after reauthorizing the National Film Registry and the National Film Preservation Board in the Library of Congress for four more years. Changes the name of the Library's collection of films and related materials received for the Registry to the \"National Film Registry Collection of the Library of Congress.\" Directs the Librarian of Congress to: (1) study and report to the Congress on the current state of film preservation and restoration activities, including the activities of the Library of Congress and other major film archives in the United States; and (2) establish a comprehensive national film preservation program for motion pictures, in conjunction with other film archivists and copyright owners. Title III: Other Copyright Provisions - Repeals the requirement that the Register of Copyrights report every five years to the Congress regarding library and archives photocopying of copyrighted materials."
