Allows an individual employee to elect to enter into and administer an individual contract of employment with an employer without the intervention of a bargaining representative. Repeals the requirement that the National Labor Relations Board take a secret ballot of the employees in a bargaining unit upon the petition of at least 30 percent of them to rescind the authority of a union security agreement."
