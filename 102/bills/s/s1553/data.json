Authorizes the Secretary to provide marriage and family counseling services that the Secretary determines, based on an assessment by a mental-health professional, are necessary for the amelioration of psychological, marital, or familial difficulties resulting from such active-duty service. Outlines provisions concerning the manner in which such services will be furnished, as well as qualifications required of the marriage and family counselors performing such services. Outlines provisions concerning counseling services provided by mental health professionals pursuant to Department of Veterans Affairs contracts, including the length of marriage and counseling services to be performed under the program. Prohibits the same person who performs the counseling needs assessment from furnishing the marriage and counseling services under the program, with a waiver of such prohibition under specified circumstances. Directs the Secretary to reimburse the mental health professionals for the reasonable costs of such counseling services. Provides cost recovery provisions. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1994. Terminates the program at the end of FY 1994. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on such program, with recommendations."
