Requires such document to be made available by every originating mortgage institution to every person from whom it receives or for whom it prepares a written application for a mortgage loan. Prohibits federally-chartered secondary mortgage institutions from purchasing mortgage loans unless such institutions determine that the originating mortgage institution complied with requirements concerning such document. Prescribes monetary penalties for violations of such requirements. Prohibits persons from offering radon measurement devices or services to the public unless they have completed the EPA radon measurement proficiency program. Permits the Administrator to delegate authority for such program to States. Makes it unlawful to fail to comply with proficiency program requirements or to fail to keep records, submit reports, or permit access to facilities or records. Prescribes civil penalties for such violations."
