Provides that spring wheat shall not be considered as a winter wheat replacement crop for assistance eligibility purposes.

Makes disaster assistance available to all valencia oranges damaged by weather in 1990. Extends through 1991 emergency crop loss assistance for commercial orchards and forest crops. Extends existing administrative, including gross income limits, and authorization of appropriation provisions. Makes permanent farmworkers and packinghouse workers eligible for emergency grants. Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to establish an emergency aquaculture program to assist fresh water aquaculture operations to restore facilities damaged by weather or related conditions in 1991. Provides for 50 percent Federal cost sharing. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to consider, where appropriate, precipitation levels in making emergency livestock feed assistance determinations."
