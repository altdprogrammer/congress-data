Allows States to permit certain self-employment program participants a one-time election to purchase capital equipment for a small business. Treats: (1) such purchases as business expenses and prohibits their depreciation for income tax purposes; and (2) repayments of the principal portion of small business loans and cash retained by small businesses for future uses as business expenses for purposes of AFDC eligibility. Authorizes grants to States for public-private parterships for technical assistance for AFDC recipients seeking to become self-employed. Authorizes appropriations."
