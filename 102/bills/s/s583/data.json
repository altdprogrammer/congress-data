Describes such acquisition as one which occurred after November 10, 1988, and before January 1, 1989, and one which the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) provided assistance. Excludes Federal financial assistance from the determination of earnings and profits. Requires that, except in specified instances, certain Federal financial assistance be taken into account when determining losses or certain bad debts of savings and loans institutions (thus denying income tax deductions for losses or bad debts to the extent Federal assistance has compensated for them)."
