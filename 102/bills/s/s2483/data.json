    "date": "1992-03-25", 
    "text": "Department of Energy Defense Nuclear Facilities Adjustment Assistance Act - Directs the Secretary of Energy to require an environmental cleanup and waste management contractor (contractor) to: (1) offer retraining to an affected employee (an individual whose employment under a defense nuclear facility management and operating contract is or will be terminated or significantly and adversely affected as a result of reduction or modification in Department of Energy programs, projects, or activities at such facility) to qualify for a job under an environmental cleanup and waste management contract (contract); (2) give a qualified affected employee first preference when hiring to fill a job under the contract; and (3) provide each affected employee it hires with benefits, compensation, and sick leave and vacation credit comparable to that provided under their prior management and operating contract. Requires the Secretary, in evaluating a bid or proposal for a contract, to place a high priority on the extent and manner of subcontractor compliance with such requirements. Directs the Secretary to determine whether a reduction or modification in Department programs, projects, or activities at a defense nuclear facility is significant for purposes of this Act. Directs the Secretary to provide prompt notice to State and local officials, as well as labor representatives, of such a significant reduction or modification. Directs the Secretary, at least 60 days before a significant reduction or modification takes effect, to develop and make public a transition plan for the facility that: (1) minimizes involuntary employment termination by use of attrition and other means; and (2) assists affected employees and the local community affected when the reduction or modification has direct and significant adverse consequences in that community. Outlines the required assistance for affected employees, including retraining and educational programs, job placement assistance, priority hiring, financial compensation while retraining, continuation for specified periods of medical insurance coverage, or provision of such coverage for terminated employees in specified instances. Outlines the required assistance for affected local communities, including making grants and entering into cooperative agreements in planning and implementing community adjustments required by the reduction or modification. Authorizes the provision of assistance to local communities for strategic planning, public facilities or services improvements, business development, research, technical assistance, training, and relocation of individuals and businesses. Directs the Secretary, in developing and implementing the transitional plan, to make maximum use of programs administered by agencies other than the Department. Directs the Secretary to consult with various public officials and representatives in developing and implementing such plan. Requires assistance to Federal employees affected by a significant reduction or modification in Department programs at a defense nuclear facility to be furnished as provided in applicable law. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for FY 1993 through 1995 to carry out this Act."
