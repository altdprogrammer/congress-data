    "text": "Nondevelopmental Items Acquisition Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to require the Federal Acquisition Regulation issued under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Act to require that: (1) supply procurement requirements of Federal agencies are stated in terms of functions to be performed, performance required, or essential physical characteristics; (2) such requirements are defined so that nondevelopmental items (NDIs) (commercial items already available in the marketplace) may be procured to fulfill such requirements; (3) such requirements are fulfilled through the procurement of NDIs where practicable; and (4) prior to developing new specifications, executive agencies conduct market research to determine whether NDIs are available or could be modified to meet agency needs. Requires the Federal Acquisition Regulation to require simplified contracting procedures for commercial items. Specifies that such items must be items which are sold or traded to the general public in significant quantities in the course of normal business operations. Includes items which require only minor modifications to meet the needs of the procuring agency. Allows the Department of Defense to use procedures under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 in lieu of such simplified contracting procedures. Requires the Federal Acquisition Regulation to require that: (1) Federal agencies take advantage of warranties offered by commercial contractors and use such warranties for the repair and replacement of commercial items; and (2) agencies require offerors, where appropriate, to demonstrate that products being offered are suitable for agency use and meet required product specifications. Requires the Federal Acquisition Regulation to provide guidance to agencies on the use of past performance of products and sources as a factor in award decisions. Requires the Administrator of OFPP to issue guidelines for the training by executive agencies of appropriate personnel in the acquisition of NDIs. Amends the OFPP Act to make the advocate for competition for each procuring activity responsible for promoting full and open competition and the acquisition of NDIs and for challenging barriers to such acquisition. Directs the Comptroller General to report to specified congressional committees on the use of market research in support of procurement of NDIs."
