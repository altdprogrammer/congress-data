    "text": "Deposit Insurance Fairness Act of 1991 - Title I: FDIC Assessment Amendments - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to modify the definition of \"deposit\" to provide that obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or a Federal Home Loan Bank shall not be considered deposits for purposes of this Act, nor be included as part of the total deposits of an insured deposit. Revises assessment procedures to provide that assessment base additions shall be any deposits or other obligations which would constitute deposits under the Act's defined terms, and which are received in any office of the depository institution. Sets the annual assessment rate applicable to obligations and deposits at a minimum of 75 percent of the assessment rate applicable to domestic deposits. Modifies the definition of \"deposits\" to include non-deposit liabilities such as notes, bonds, and similar liabilities. Sets forth an assessment schedule based upon specified risk criteria. Title II: Financial Institution Early Intervention - Financial Institution Early Intervention Act of 1991 - Sets forth an early regulatory intervention procedure to ensure prompt corrective resolution of troubled undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Title III: Restriction of Brokered Deposits - Authorizes banking regulatory agencies to restrict the acceptance of brokered deposits by an insured depository institution."
