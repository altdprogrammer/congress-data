    "text": "Guaranteed Job Opportunity Act - Establishes a grant program to assist local job projects for unemployed individuals. Requires any eligible area (a county or comparable unit of local government) which desires to receive funds under this Act to establish a District Executive Council (District Council). Sets forth the responsibilities of the District Councils, which include: (1) selecting projects to be assisted (pursuant to prescribed criteria); (2) preparing project plans; and (3) preparing annual reports on District Council activities. Directs the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) to make grants to the District Councils for the purpose of assisting local job projects which meet the requirements of this Act. Sets forth requirements for participant eligibility, including that the individual: (1) have a high school diploma or its equivalent or be at least 18 years old; (2) have resided in the eligible area for at least 30 days; and (3) have been unemployed for 35 days prior to determination of employment for the assisted job project. Sets eligibility limitations on: (1) the number of eligible individuals in any household; (2) individual earned income or family income; (3) compensated hours per week at another job; and (4) retirement benefit recipients. Requires participants to demonstrate that they sought employment in the private sector during the 35 days prior to making application for the project and will continue to seek employment during the period of assisted employment. Requires each participant: (1) to be tested for basic reading and writing competence by the District Council prior to employment under the job project; (2) if they fail such test, to be furnished counseling and instruction; and (3) if they have not received a high school diploma or equivalent, to maintain satisfactory progress towards receiving it, in order to continue employment. Allows participants with limited English speaking ability to be furnished such instruction as the District Council considers appropriate. Sets forth requirements for local job projects. Prohibits selection of a project if an objection is filed by two specified representatives. Prohibits selection of participants on the basis of political affiliation. Limits: (1) transportation and equipment expenses; (2) number of supervisors; (3) hours per week employed; (4) project duration. Requires each job project manager to report on progress monthly to the District Council. Requires each eligible job project participant to receive: (1) the applicable minimum wage (or the amount such participant is eligible to receive in welfare benefits or unemployment compensation, plus ten percent); (2) benefits comparable to those received by employees in similar occupations; and (3) other specified support services. Requires each District Council to establish job clubs to assist eligible participants in preparing resumes, developing interviewing techniques, and evaluating job search activities. Sets forth certain labor standards for job projects with respect to: (1) conditions of employment and training; (2) health and safety standards; (3) displacement of those currently employed; (4) existing contracts and collective bargaining agreements; and (5) wages for participants involved in construction projects. Sets forth nondiscrimination provisions. Prohibits any participant from being employed in the construction, operation, or maintenance of any facility which is used, or is to be used, for sectarian instruction or religious worship. Requires the Secretary to provide any recipient who fails to comply with such provisions notice and an opportunity to comply before taking further action. Authorizes the Attorney General, under certain circumstances, to bring a civil action in district court for appropriate relief, including injunctive relief, in instances involving recipient violations of nondiscrimination provisions. Requires each District Council to maintain an evaluation file for each individual employed in a project assisted under this Act. Directs the Secretary to prepare and submit to the Congress an annual report on the administration of this Act. Grants the Comptroller General (and representatives of the General Accounting Office) access to the records of grant recipients. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1996."
