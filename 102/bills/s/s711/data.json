    "text": "Reclamation Drought Relief Act of 1991 - Conditions the Secretary of the Interior's authority under this Act on a State having completed the elements of a drought contingency plan. Authorizes the Secretary, in order to alleviate the adverse impacts of temporary drought conditions, to: (1) establish water banks through which the Secretary, State agencies, and water users may buy and sell water; (2) undertake water conservation and management activities to reduce temporary drought conditions; (3) allow temporary voluntary transfers of project water supplies from existing uses or users to other uses or users; (4) allow temporary use of project facilities to store and convey nonproject water for beneficial uses; (5) allow the use of water from dead or inactive reservoir storage or increased use of groundwater resources for temporary water supplies; (6) provide temporary water supplies to reduce adverse impacts to fish and wildlife caused by temporary drought conditions; and (7) make minor structural modifications to Federal project facilities to reduce adverse impacts of drought. Permits the Secretary to purchase or facilitate the purchase of water. Provides that purchased water shall: (1) be water that is made available (on a temporary basis) through conservation or other means by which a seller has reduced water consumption; and (2) exclude water that represents the excess of water in which the seller has rights over the water that the seller historically has consumed. Subjects agreements for the purchase of water supplies by a purchaser other than the Secretary to the Secretary's approval. Sets forth provisions concerning the price for delivery of temporary water supplies. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans for: (1) the purchase of interim water supplies; (2) the making of minor structural modifications or additions to facilities; and (3) other activities for the prevention or mitigation of the adverse effects of drought. Permits the Secretary to defer the payments on such loans or on obligations under a contract entered into under Federal reclamation law as necessary due to financial hardship caused by drought. Sets forth conditions concerning the repayment of deferments. Requires the Secretary to prepare cooperative drought contingency plans for the prevention or mitigation of adverse effects of drought. Permits the Secretary to work with other Federal and State agencies to improve hydrologic data collection systems and water supply forecasting techniques to provide more accurate warning of potential drought conditions and drought levels that would trigger the implementation of a contingency plan. Authorizes the Secretary, under a cooperative agreement with the State of California, to take actions to prevent salt water intrusion, or improve water levels and circulation conditions, in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Permits the Secretary to provide technical assistance for drought contingency planning in: (1) specified States and the District of Columbia; (2) Puerto Rico; (3) the Marshall Islands; (4) Micronesia; (5) the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; and (6) upon termination of the Trusteeship, the Republic of Palau. Requires funds for drought contingency planning activities to be advanced to the Secretary by those requesting assistance. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a precipitation management technology transfer program to alleviate problems caused by precipitation variability and droughts in the West. Establishes a Reclamation Drought Response Fund to pay expenses under this Act. Requires the Secretary to maintain a minimum of $10,000,000 in the Fund. Authorizes appropriations."
