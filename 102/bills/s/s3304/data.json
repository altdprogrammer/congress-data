    "text": "Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to include nitrogen stabilizers in the definition of \"pesticide.\" Defines a \"nitrogen stabilizer\" as a substance or mixture of substances that is intended, through action upon soil bacteria, to prevent or hinder the process of nitrification, denitrification, ammonia volatization, or urease production. Excludes from such definition any substance that: (1) was not registered pursuant to FIFRA prior to January 1, 1992; and (2) was used in a commercial agronomic use prior to such date, with respect to which after such date, the distributor or seller has made no specific claim relating to the prevention of hindering of the processes described in the definition. Exempts mixtures of nitrogen stabilizers and fertilizer products from registration, reregistration, experimental use permit, suspension, recordkeeping, indemnity, and export requirements if the mixture: (1) is accompanied by labeling required for nitrogen stabilizers; (2) is mixed or combined in accordance with such labeling; and (3) does not contain any active ingredient other than a nitrogen stabilizer."
