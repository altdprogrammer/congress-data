    "text": "Childhood Hunger Prevention Act of 1991 - Title I: Food Stamp Program - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to increase the basic food stamp program (program) benefit level by specified annual increments until it reaches 105 percent of the cost of the thrifty food plan. Excludes from consideration as program income the first $50 a month received as child support. Removes the excess shelter deduction cap for purposes of program eligibility. Increases annually the fair market value limit of vehicles that program recipients may own. Directs the Secretary to conduct, and authorizes States to conduct, pilot projects to study program participation barriers in rural areas. Authorizes the Secretary to use specified funds to improve program services for homeless persons. Title II: Nutrition Programs - Amends the National School Lunch Act to: (1) permit certain private residential day care organizations to participate in the child care and adult food program; (2) permit meal supplements (snacks) for children in after school care programs (by eliminating the child care food program requirement); and (3) increase specified funds for food assistance to homeless preschool children. Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to authorize specified appropriations for the supplemental food program for women, infants, and children (WIC) program. Title III: Effective Dates - Sets forth the effective dates for provisions of this Act."
