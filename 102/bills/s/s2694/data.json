    "text": "Prohibits the Secretary of the Army from soliciting a bid or proposal for the construction of an incinerator of lethal chemical agents at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, until: (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has monitored the incineration of mustard gas on Johnston Island in the Pacific Ocean continuously for a period sufficient to evaluate whether the emissions from such incineration meet applicable environmental standards and determines that the Aberdeen emissions meet such standards; and (2) the National Academy of Sciences has issued its report on alternative chemical demilitarization technologies that states that there is no viable alternative to incineration as a technology for disposing of lethal chemical agents. Directs the Secretary to terminate the development of the Aberdeen incinerator if such conditions are not met."
