    "text": "Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure, and Health Act of 1990 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require each State adjoining coastal waters to submit an inventory of coastal recreation waters to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Directs the Administrator to designate waters for States which fail to submit approved inventories. Requires the Administrator to publish regulations to protect the health and safety of persons swimming, bathing, or engaged in other body contact activities in such waters. Requires the regulations to establish numerical limits for water pollutants determined to pose a threat to public health and safety as a result of such activities. Directs the Administrator to establish uniform assessment and monitoring procedures for floatable materials in water and the conditions under which the presence of such materials constitutes a threat to public health and safety. Requires States to conduct monitoring of such waters and to notify local governments and the public of any violations of numerical limits or conditions concerning floatables. Directs the Administrator to reserve a specified amount of funds for States required to develop such inventories. Withholds such funds from States that are not complying with regulations. Requires the Administrator to study and report to the Congress on additional information regarding indicators for detecting the presence in coastal recreation waters of bacteria and viruses which are harmful to human health. Authorizes appropriations."
