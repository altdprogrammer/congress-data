Makes funds available for \"nation building\" training only in countries in which no individual could be expected to carry out such activities and in which a freely elected head of government has requested such training. Requires all trainees under such programs to receive instruction to promote adherence to: (1) protecting civilians and prisoners from harm and intimidation; (2) reporting to proper authorities all human rights abuses by military forces; and (3) accepting the authority of elected civilian officials."
