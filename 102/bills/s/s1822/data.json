    "text": "Hispanic Access to Higher Education Act of 1991 - Title I: Early Intervention - Part A: Early Outreach Program - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to establish an integrated early outreach program. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to make allotments to States on the basis of relative State population and relative number of students enrolled in institutions of higher education in each State. Requires States to use such allotments to make grants and contracts to specified types of entities for providing various educational services to develop the academic skills and self-confidence of program participants necessary for success in higher education. Requires that: (1) at least two-thirds of program participants be low-income, racial or ethnic minorities underrepresented in higher education who are first-generation college students; and (2) the remaining one-third of such participants be either low-income individuals or first-generation college students. Requires participants to have completed five years of elementary education, and be between ten and 19 years of age (unless such limitations would defeat program purposes). Requires annual program reports to include data on student academic progress, appropriate income measures, gender, English proficiency, and the racial and ethnic background of program participants and service providers. Authorizes appropriations. Part B: National Survey of Factors Associated with Participation - Directs the Secretary to conduct a biennial survey, through the National Center for Educational Statistics, of factors associated with participation of low-income and minority students in various types of postsecondary education. Sets forth requirements for development of such survey and types of data to be included. Part C: TRIO Programs - Revises provisions for special programs for students from disadvantaged backgrounds (TRIO programs). Directs the Secretary to reserve specified funds to provide assistance to current and new providers proposing programs that serve geographic areas or eligible populations which have been underserved by TRIO programs. Directs the Secretary to conduct outreach activities to ensure that entities eligible for TRIO programs assistance submit applications proposing such programs. Requires provision of assistance in developing applications and programs, as well as notice of the availability of such assistance. Directs the Secretary to ensure that readers of applications for TRIO program assistance represent diverse backgrounds reflecting the populations served by such program, including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, Native American Pacific Islanders (including Native Hawaiians), individuals with disabilities, and individuals from rural areas. Requires the Secretary to ensure that each such application is read by at least three reviewers not employed by the Department of Education. Title II: Teacher Recruitment and Training - Part A: Loan Forgiveness for Teachers - Establishes a demonstration program of Stafford student loan forgiveness for any borrower employed as a full-time teacher: (1) in a school which qualifies under HEA for loan cancellation for Perkins student loan recipients who teach at such schools; and (2) of mathematics, science, foreign languages, special education, bilingual education, or any other field where the State educational agency determines there is a shortage of qualified teachers. Directs the Secretary to assume the obligation to repay the following percentages of Stafford loans incurred during the borrower's last two undergraduate years: (1) 15 percent for the first or second academic year in which the borrower is a full-time teacher; (2) 20 percent for the third or fourth such years of teaching; and (3) 30 percent for the fifth year. Sets forth a special rule authorizing such repayments with respect to Stafford loans for a maximum of two years in returning to an institution of higher education after graduation to obtain a teaching certificate. Part B: Teacher Corps - Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to State educational agencies (SEAs) to conduct Teacher Corps activities. Bases the amount of such grants on relative school-age population. Directs the Secretary to use funds for such program to: (1) disseminate information nationally about the availability of Teacher Corps scholarships to individuals leaving the armed services; and (2) conduct activities, with SEA cooperation, which foster communications and meetings, including training, of Teacher Corps members. Authorizes each SEA receiving such a grant to use such funds for: (1) grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) for induction and mentor programs; (2) in-service and mentoring programs for Teacher Corps members at State and local levels; (3) technical assistance to LEAs for Teacher Corps and induction programs; (4) evaluation of Teacher Corps membership applications and awarding Teacher Corps scholarships; (5) Teacher Corps awards to individuals in training to become a school psychologist, school social worker, or a school counselor; (6) ensuring that members understand repayment obligations resulting from noncomplaince with scholarship conditions; (7) assistance for employment placement of Teacher Corps members; and (8) collection of scholarship repayments. Requires SEAs to give priority in awarding grants to LEAs with the greatest proportion of disadvantaged students, including racial and ethnic minorities. Allows each SEA to choose to administer such program through a preexisting experienced panel. Authorizes LEAs receiving grants to use such funds for: (1) induction programs for new Teacher Corps members and other new teachers; and (2) ensuring that Teacher Corps members participate in an induction program for at least one year, including working with a mentor teacher designated by the LEA. Allows such induction programs to be developed in cooperation with institutions of higher education. Requires the SEA, in cooperation with the State higher education agency, to select Teacher Corps members. Requires the SEA-established criteria to include specified factors. Requires special consideration for individuals who intend to teach limited English-proficient students, preschool age children, or students with disabilities (or to provide related services to students with disabilities). Requires priority consideration for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, including racial and ethnic minorities and individuals with disabilities, who are underrepresented in the teaching profession or the curricular areas in which they are preparing to teach. Sets forth application requirements for Teacher Corps membership, SEAs, and LEAs. Provides for Teacher Corps scholarships. Limits individual eligibility to a maximum of three years of specified types of programs of study. Limits individual scholarship amount and duration. Requires that such scholarships be considered in determining eligibility for HEA student assistance. Requires that total assistance not exceed need. Provides for continued eligibility. Sets forth scholarship conditions, including agreement to work as a teacher, upon completion of education, for five years in a school which qualifies for Perkins student loan cancellation under HEA, or to repay all or part of the scholarship, plus interest, if scholarship conditions are not complied with. Requires SEAs receiving Teacher Corps assistance to: (1) publicize availability of and application procedures for Teacher Corps scholarships, particularly among specified types of students and individuals; and (2) recruit minority students to participate in the Teacher Corps program. Authorizes appropriations. Prohibits any such funds from being appropriated unless the amount appropriated to carry out the Paul Douglas Congressional Teacher Scholarships program under HEA equals or exceeds a specified amount. Part C: Teacher Opportunity Corps - Amends HEA to establish the Teacher Opportunity Corps (TOC) program, to encourage institutions of higher education to offer educational programs and financial assistance to enable paraprofessionals working in shortage area schools serving disadvantaged students to become certified teachers. Directs the Secretary to allocate TOC program grant funds to States according to the same formula under which States receive funding for education of disadvantaged children. Requires TOC grant program agreements to include provisions for administration and recordkeeping by the State education or higher education agency. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States to support TOC programs at institutions of higher education. Sets forth State grant application requirements and general criteria for State grants, including: (1) involvement of institutions of higher education and shortage area schools or school districts; (2) full creditability to a baccalaurate program leading to teacher certification; (3) a program evaluation system; and (4) appropriate credit for paraprofessional classroom experience as practice or student teaching. Requires any paraprofessional who receives student financial assistance under the TOC program to agree to act as a paraprofessional in a shortage area school for at least one year for each year of such assistance, within ten years after completing postsecondary education. Requires repayment of all or part of such assistance, plus interest and reasonable collection costs, if the recipient fails to comply with his or her service requirements, except in specified circumstances. Requires that such student financial assistance supplement, but not supplant, other Federal or State assistance for which the student would otherwise qualify. Requires TOC program grants to be for a term of at least five years, subject to availability of appropriations. Allows States to use TOC program funds for: (1) student financial assistance to paraprofessionals to pay part or all of the costs of attendance (including child care) in postsecondary education programs required for teacher certification; (2) supportive services for such paraprofessionals during participation in such programs; and (3) payment of wage costs of substitute paraprofessionals to afford employed paraprofessionals release-time to attend postsecondary classes required for teacher certification. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Migrant Student Education - Part A: Amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965 - Revises HEA special programs for students whose families are engaged in migrant and seasonal farmwork. Expands eligibility for the high school equivalency program and the college assistance migrant program to include certain persons who have participated in specified programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 or the Job Training Partnership Act. Extends the grant period from three to five years. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the high school equivalency program and the college assistance migrant program. Part B: National Mini-Corps Program - Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a National Mini-Corps Program to: (1) provide certain migrant college students with training to help them serve as student or teacher role models, links to the community, and tutors and teachers of migrant children; (2) designate college coordinators at participating institutions to train, supervise, and assign migrant students in cooperation with the operating State agency in which migrant children with special needs have been identified; (3) provide academic assistance, home visits, parental involvement, parent-student advisement services, and family advocacy; (4) provide that the instructional services for migrant children are to be coordinated with the overall educational goals of the operating State agency; and (5) provide that migrant students participating in such programs work from ten to 15 hours per week and receive stipends for such services. Authorizes appropriations."
