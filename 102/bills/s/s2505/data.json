    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-04-01", 
    "text": "America the Beautiful Passport Act of 1992 - Title I: Recreation Admission Fees and Use Fees - Amends the Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to repeal provisions mandating charges for entrance or admission fees only at designated units of the National Park System or National Recreation Areas administered by the Departments of the Interior or of Agriculture (Departments). Authorizes the Secretaries of the Departments (Secretaries) to charge admission fees at any land and water area which they administer and designate for such charges. Limits the Secretary of Agriculture's authority to charge admission fees to only National Recreation Areas, National Monuments, National Volcanic Monuments, National Scenic Areas, and developed recreation complexes within the National Forest System. Replaces an annual admission permit known as the Golden Eagle Passport with an America the Beautiful Passport for admission into any such designated area. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, with the advice and consent of the Secretary of Agriculture, to set a $30 fee for such permit in lieu of the maximum $25 fee. Authorizes them to change such fee upon the recommendation of the Federal Recreation Fee Advisory Commission. Releases the holder of a permit under this Act from additional fees charged for specified Federal recreation areas, except for overnight camping fees or the use of group facilities. (Currently, a permit holder is prohibited from using the permit for such fees.) Repeals provisions that authorize the Secretary of the Interior to make an annual admission permit available for a reasonable fee for admission into specific designated units of the National Park System. Authorizes the Secretaries to make a $15 12-month admission permit available as an America the Beautiful Passport to only designated units in a particular geographic area. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, with the advice and consent of the Secretary of Agriculture, to permit State or local government units, individuals, organizations, businesses, or nonprofit entities to sell and collect fees for the America the Beautiful Passport for a maximum 12-month period and to withhold reasonable amounts up to, but not exceeding, ten percent of the gross fees collected from such sales as reimbursement for necessary expenses. Requires the sellers to provide information to America the Beautiful Passport purchasers about recreation activities on Federal lands. Requires all net receipts from the sales of permits under this Act to be deposited into a special account in the Treasury to be available at the end of each fiscal year for appropriation to any agency collecting fees under this Act to fund the agency's share of challenge cost-share agreements negotiated and implemented pursuant to this Act. Establishes the Federal Recreation Fee Advisory Commission to prepare biannually an advisory report for the Secretaries regarding the admission fee system, including: (1) the fee charged for the America the Beautiful Passport; (2) the designation of sites where admission fees are collected; (3) the amount of fees at designated and proposed sites; (4) whether the Passport should waive existing recreation fees; and (5) recommendations on projects to fund under challenge cost-share agreements. Authorizes the Secretaries to provide essential support staff and services to the Commission, upon request. Terminates the Commission upon its fourth biannual report to the Secretaries. Defines \"developed recreation complexes\" as areas administered by the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary). Authorizes the Secretary, under certain conditions, to charge an admission fee at other developed recreation complexes within the National Forest System in addition to those listed in this Act after providing notice to specified congressional committees. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, with the advice and consent of the Secretary of Agriculture, to change such fees upon the recommendation of the Commission. Provides that no admission fee may be charged under this Act of any person less than 16 years of age. (Currently, such fee is prohibited at a unit of a National Park System for admission of any person 16 years of age or less.) Repeals limitations on admission fees for single visits at the following parks: (1) Yellowstone National Park; (2) Grand Teton National Park; and (3) Grand Canyon National Park. Requires America the Beautiful Passport receipts and recreation use fees collected by the Secretary: (1) to be collected at the place of use or other location convenient to the user and the collector; and (2) not to be subject to a requirement that ten percent be earmarked for road construction and maintenance in national forests. Title II: Challenge Cost-Share Agreements - Authorizes the Secretaries to negotiate and enter into challenge cost-share agreements with cooperators to share costs or services in carrying out functions of land management agencies administered by the Secretaries. Authorizes the Secretaries to provide the Federal funding share from any funds available to such land management agencies."
