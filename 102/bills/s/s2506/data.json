    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Energy to develop, issue, and commence implementation of a plan for the restructuring of the employee work force of Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear facilities. Outlines plan requirements, including: (1) that any changes in functions or missions at such facilities be carried out so as to minimize the economic impact of such changes on such DOE employees, with prior notice of such changes at least 120 days before they take place, retraining, early retirement and attrition, and other similar means of minimization; (2) first preference for terminated DOE defense facility employees in any DOE hiring; (3) retraining of such employees for work in environmental restoration and waste management activities of DOE; (4) relocation assistance for appropriate employees; (5) retraining, education, and reemployment assistance for employment outside of DOE; and (6) local impact assistance to communities that are affected by any DOE defense facility restructuring plan. Directs the Secretary to issue yearly plan updates containing specified information. Requires appropriate consultation by the Secretary when developing such plans. Requires all plans and updates to be submitted to specified congressional committees. Directs the Secretary, when entering into a contract for the procurement of environmental restoration and waste management activities (contract) at a DOE nuclear defense facility, to require the contractor and any subcontractor to: (1) recognize any collective bargaining agreements in force at the facility and any labor organizations authorized to act on behalf of such employees; (2) employ employees of the collective bargaining units at such facility; (3) assume the liability and obligations of the pension programs of the preceding employer at such facility for employees retained under the contract; and (4) credit periods of employment with previous employers toward contract requirements relating to sick leave, vacations, health insurance, and other employment-related benefits, with limitations. Directs the Secretary to establish and carry out a program for the identification and ongoing medical evaluation of current and former DOE employees who are subject to significant health risks as a result of exposure to hazardous or radioactive substances during such employment. Outlines program implementation provisions, requiring the Secretary to: (1) carry out certain activities under the program in concurrence with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS); (2) permit the participation of specified organizations; (3) notify each employee identified and examined or tested of test results; (4) collect and assemble information relating to such examinations and tests; (5) carry out such program within one year after enactment of this Act; and (6) enter into an agreement with the Secretary of HHS under which each Secretary of Energy carries out required activities under the program. Directs the Secretary to carry out a program to provide for insurance to cover the reasonable health care costs for DOE employees who: (1) were defense nuclear facility employees; (2) through such employment, received a level of exposure to hazardous or radioactive substances that poses a significant risk to such employee's health; (3) as a result of such exposure, have developed a significant illness, disease, or clinical sensitivity; and (4) are not entitled to benefits under the Medicare or any other health insurance program. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe, with participation by specified organizations, standards for determining the eligibility of former employees for such insurance coverage. Requires establishment of the insurance program within six months after the enactment of this Act."
