    "text": "National Technology Agency Act of 1992 - Establishes in the executive branch the National Technology Agency to be headed by a Director (who shall also serve as the President's Adviser for Science and Technology). Sets forth as the responsibilities of the Agency to: (1) establish and coordinate a comprehensive Government technology, research, and development policy that will particularly assist the U.S. industries negatively affected by reductions in the national defense budget in the cultivation of new product markets; (2) expand the integration of military and commercial research and development; (3) conduct research into advanced, generic, precompetitive technologies to improve U.S. manufacturing and production processes; (4) enter into partnerships with private sector representatives to establish specific research, development, and technological policy goals; (5) plan and manage research and development with other appropriate Federal agencies; (6) plan and manage all Federal technology assistance programs for private businesses and State governments; (7) implement all Federal research, development, and technological policies in areas not under the jurisdiction of other departments and agencies; and (8) carry out functions transferred to the Agency by this Act. Authorizes the Agency to: (1) guarantee in whole or in part any public or private financing institution (including any Federal Reserve bank) against the loss of principal or interest on any loan, discount, or advance, or on any commitment in connection therewith, which may be made by such institution for the purpose of financing the conversion of businesses critical to the defense industrial base of the United States that are likely to be closed as a result of projected reductions in Government spending under the national security budget function (critical businesses) from the production of goods primarily for defense-related purposes to the production of goods for other commercial purposes, with priority given to commercially viable environmental technologies; (2) provide such a guarantee by commitment to purchase, share losses, or otherwise; (3) provide such guaranty authority only with respect to financing for critical businesses; and (4) extend direct cash grants consistent with such requirements. Sets forth reporting requirements. Transfers to the Agency all functions which were exercised previously by the Office of Science and Technology Policy within the Executive Office of the President, as determined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, involved in carrying out any function relating to the Agency's responsibilities, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Sets forth various administrative and transition provisions. Authorizes appropriations."
