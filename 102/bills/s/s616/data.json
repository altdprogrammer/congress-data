    "text": "United States Information Agency Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 - Authorizes appropriations for the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) for FY 1992 and 1993. Amends the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 to prohibit funds in excess of $500,000 (currently, $250,000) from being made available to USIA through a reprogramming unless the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations are notified. Adds to the authorities of the USIA Director the authority to purchase, rent, construct, improve, and operate facilities for television transmission and reception. Permits the USIA Director or other authorized Government agencies to pay to or for participants in programs under the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 the costs of: (1) emergency medical expenses; (2) the preparation and transportation of remains of participants' dependents who die while away from home during such participation; (3) health and accident insurance premiums; (4) per diem in lieu of subsistence; and (5) such other costs, as necessary. Authorizes the crediting of payments received in connection with USIA advisory services rendered to foreign students regarding study in the United States. Repeals a provision of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 concerning the closure of USIA posts and reductions of USIA personnel abroad. Requests the inclusion of a provision in this Act that permits USIA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, U.S.S.R., to establish and operate reciprocal cultural information centers in Moscow and Washington, D.C., in accordance with a specified agreement signed in Washington, D.C., on May 31, 1990. Amends the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 to permit the USIA Director or other authorized Government agencies to: (1) incur expenses authorized by the Foreign Service Act of 1980; and (2) furnish living quarters and provide specified allowances for Government employees in foreign countries. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize the issuance of up to 100 conditional immigrant visas per fiscal year to USIA employees. Limits admission to periods of up to four years. Permits spouses and dependents of such employees to be admitted as conditional permanent residents. Sets forth provisions governing the transition to permanent resident status and the termination of conditional status of such employees."
