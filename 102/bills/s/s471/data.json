Requires regulations: (1) allowing any consumer to block access to 900 numbers at his or her residence at no cost; (2) prohibiting television and radio advertisements directed at individuals under the age of 18 from including tones which dial a number by placing the receiver close to the television or radio; and (3) requiring radio and television advertisements directed at individuals under the age of 18 to include a notice that the individual must have permission of a parent or guardian to use the 900 telephone service."
