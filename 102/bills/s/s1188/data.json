Terminates the Panel five years after submission of its initial report. Provides for interim disability criteria, inclusive of medical conditions specific to women, children, and IV-drug users, for determining cases until Panel recommendations become law. Requires the Secretary, during the Panel's tenure, to establish and maintain a database on OASDI and SSI applicants with AIDS. Requires annual reports to the Congress containing such information. Authorizes appropriations."
