    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1992-09-25", 
    "text": "Aviation Noise Improvement and Capacity Act of 1992 - Title I: Airport and Airway Improvement Act Amendments - Amends the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 to declare that: (1) it is in the public interest to recognize the effects of airport capacity expansion projects on airport noise; and (2) noncompatible land uses around airports must be reduced, and efforts to mitigate noise must be given a high priority. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1995 for: (1) airport development and planning projects; (2) air navigation facilities; (3) weather reporting services for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); (4) aviation research, engineering and development, and demonstration projects; and (5) enhancing airport capacity. Directs the Administrator of the FAA and Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to establish a research program to develop improved technologies for reductions in aircraft engine and airframe noise and emissions. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require the Civil Aeromedical Institute to conduct civil aeromedical research related to, among other things, human factors specifically associated with general aviation. Amends Federal law to authorize appropriations for FY 1993 through 1995 for FAA operations. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to revise the minimum Federal appropriation levels which permit imposition of local airport passenger facility fees on airline passengers. Amends the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 to limit no more than 44 percent (currently, 49.5 percent) the apportionment of State funds for primary and cargo service airports in cases where such apportionment has been limited or reduced by an Act of Congress. Includes, for purposes of the apportionment of airport development and planning funds in the State of Alaska, public airports that received scheduled service as of September 3, 1982, but were not apportioned such funds in FY 1980 because such airports were not under the control of State or local public agencies. Extends the funding for the military airport set-aside program. Increases from eight to 12 the number of current or former military airports the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) must designate for participation in such set-aside program. Increases the noise set-aside apportionment for airport noise compatibility planning programs. Authorizes the increase by a specified percentage of the maximum obligation of the United States for airport development and planning projects for FY 1993 and thereafter for an airport other than a primary airport. Includes as an \"airport development\" activity the: (1) relocation, after December 31, 1991, of an air traffic control tower or any navigational air (including radar) if relocation is necessary to carry out an approved project; and (2) if funded by a grant under this title, construction, reconstruction, repair, or improvement of an airport (or any purchase of capital equipments for an airport) which is necessary for compliance with specified Federal laws, other than construction or purchase of capital equipment which would benefit a revenue-producing area of the airport used by a nonaeronautical business. Requires the Administrator of the FAA to report to specified congressional committees on the cost and feasibility of operating such navigational aids (including radar) for a two-year period at airports converting from military airports to civilian commercial or reliever airports. Requires as a condition precedent to the approval of an airport development project grant application that the Secretary receive assurances that a report of the airport budget will be available to the public at reasonable times and places. Prohibits a project grant application for airport development involving the location of an airport, an airport runway, or a major runway extension from being approved by the Secretary unless, among other things, the sponsor of the project certifies to the Secretary that the airport management board either has voting representation from the communities where the project is located or has advised such communities that they have the right to petition the Secretary concerning a proposed project. Directs the Administrator of the FAA to report to specified congressional committees on the effects of airport noise on populations within the 65, 60, and 55 LDN noise areas to determine the actual level at which noise creates an adverse impact on such populations. Requires the Administrator of the FAA to increase the employment of aviation safety inspectors by a specified ratio percentage. Extends the State block grant pilot program through FY 1995. Increases from three to eight the number of qualified States the Secretary may designate to assume administrative responsibility for airport grant funding under such program, other than funding which has been designated for use at primary airports. Requires the Secretary to review such program and report the results to the Congress not later than January 31, 1995. Authorizes the Secretary, with respect to commercial airports which annually have .05 percent or less of the total enplanments in the United States, to approve, as allowable project costs of an airport development project, terminal development in revenue-producing areas if the sponsor certifies that no project for needed airport development affecting safety, security, or capacity will be deferred by such approval. Authorizes the Administrator of the FAA to make grants to no more than four vocational institutions in order to construct facilities for the advanced training of maintenance technicians for air carrier aircraft. Authorizes appropriations. Repeals a provision requiring the Administrator of the FAA to submit to the Congress a national airways system plan. Redefines the term \"passengers enplaned\" to mean domestic and international passenger flights which transit airports located in the 48 contiguous States or Alaska or Hawaii for nontraffic purposes. Includes as an \"airport development\" activity the acquisition or installation at or by a public-use airport of interactive training systems. Title II: Federal Aviation Act Amendments - Amends Federal law to limit the term of the Administrator of the FAA appointed after March 1, 1993, to one five-year term. Requires the Administrator of the FAA to require, by regulation, procedures to improve safety of aircraft operations during winter conditions. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to authorize the Administrator of the FAA to enter into a contract with a State or political subdivision to permit it to operate a level I visual flight rules airport traffic control tower, provided certain safety and contract requirements are met. Requires all persons to give adequate public notice of the establishment or expansion, or the proposed establishment or expansion, of any structure or sanitary landfill where such notice will promote safety in air commerce and preserve the navigable airspace and airport traffic capacity at public-use airports. Requires the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on whether a municipal solid waste facility located within a five-mile radius of the end of a runway may have the potential for attracting bird movements that may pose a hazard across the runways or approach and departure patterns of aircraft. Requires the Administrator of the FAA to publish navigational routes through complex terminal airspace areas, and to and from airports located within such areas, in instances where such publication would promote air navigation safety. Requires the Administrator of the FAA to study and report specified congressional committees on the current and projected need for air traffic control and related services in the airspace in the vicinity of Tucson, Arizona. Directs the Administrator of the FAA to study and report to the Congress on the increased air traffic over Grand Canyon National Park. Title III: Airline Consumer Protection and Competition Emergency Commission - Airline Consumer Protection and Competition Emergency Commission Act of 1992 - Establishes the Emergency Commission on Airline Consumer Protection and Competition to: (1) assess and report to the President and the Congress on the state of the airline industry and the aircraft manufacturing industry, particularly the full implications of foreign ownership of U.S. carriers; and (2) recommend Government policies to improve the competitive environment for the U.S. airline industry and aircraft manufacturing industry, retard the flow of carrier bankruptcies and accompanying loss of jobs, assure continued ownership and control of U.S. carriers by U.S. citizens, promote adequate levels of competition and service with reasonable fares in all geographic areas of the Nation, stabilize the work environment of airline industry employees, and reduce noise for citizens around airports without damaging the economic or competitive positions of the air carriers. Requires the Commission to study the possibility of long-term loan guarantees and/or tax incentives for air carriers to expedite the conversion of the commercial airline fleet from Stage two to Stage three aircraft in advance of the deadlines established by the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990. Title IV: United States Supplemental Compensation Plan - Supplemental Compensation Plan Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to establish a U.S. Supplemental Compensation Plan to supplement the compensation payable to claimants under the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air (Warsaw Convention) with respect to death, or personal injury, of airline passengers. Prohibits air carriers required to participate in the Plan from engaging in any air transportation unless they comply with specified requirements. Requires each air carrier to submit to the Secretary of Transportation for approval an agreement to designate an agent as its attorney in fact in order to: (1) negotiate the Compensation Plan Contribution; (2) select and negotiate with the Plan Administrator; and (3) monitor the Plan Administrator's performance. Provides for: (1) liability of the Plan Administrator for covered damages to claimants; (2) collection and payment of the Compensation Plan Contribution; (3) notice to claimants and evaluation of their claims; (4) claimants' proof of claim for offer of settlement; and (5) negotiation with and selection of the Plan Administrator."
