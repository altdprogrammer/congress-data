    "text": "Amends the Federal judicial code to bar the exclusion as evidence by the hearsay rule, in any civil proceeding in a court of the United States, of a foreign record of regularly conducted activity if a foreign certification attests that: (1) such record was made at or near the time of the occurrence of the matters set forth, or from information transmitted, by a person with knowledge of those matters; (2) such record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity; (3) the business activity made such a record as a regular practice; and (4) if such record is not the original, it is a duplicate of the original. Allows exclusion of such records if the source of information or method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness. Provides that a foreign certification under this Act shall authenticate such record or duplicate. Specifies that: (1) a party intending to offer in evidence a foreign record of regularly conducted activity shall provide written notice of such intention to each other party as soon as practicable after a responsive pleading has been filed; (2) a motion opposing admission in evidence of such record shall be made by the opposing party and determined by the court before trial; and (3) failure by a party to file such motion before trial shall constitute a waiver of objection to such record or duplicate, but the court for cause shown may grant relief from such waiver."
