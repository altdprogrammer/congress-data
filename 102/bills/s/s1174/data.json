    "text": "Cache La Poudre River Basin Heritage Study Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to prepare a study of alternatives for the Cache La Poudre River Basin, Colorado, including: (1) an inventory and assessment of significant cultural, natural, recreational, and scenic resources throughout the Basin, using existing information where available; (2) an evaluation of properties to determine potential eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places; (3) the suitability and feasibility of designating the Basin as a National Heritage Area; (4) the identification of themes, resources, and events which illustrate how settlement of the West was dependent upon and dictated by the development and management of water; (5) the development of a Greenway Plan for the floodplain of the Cache La Poudre River; (6) an evaluation of the demonstration project undertaken by the Secretary (pursuant to this Act), including recommendations for the disposition of any lands acquired pursuant to such project; (7) the identification of interpretive opportunities and methods, and of preservation strategies for resources located within the Basin; and (8) management alternatives and funding options for the implementation of such preservation strategies. Specifies that such study shall be prepared in consultation with the Cache La Poudre River Basin Heritage Advisory Commission (Commission) (established pursuant to this Act), affected units of local governments, and other interested public and private entities. Requires: (1) the study to be completed within two years after the date funds are made available; and (2) the Secretary, upon completion, to transmit such report to specified congressional committees. Authorizes the Secretary to undertake a demonstration project to evaluate the potential of using voluntary land exchanges within the Cache La Poudre River floodplain as a means to provide for the long-term preservation and management of the lands within the floodplain. Authorizes the Secretary or the head of a Federal agency, during the period of the study, to acquire lands within the floodplain in Larimer and Weld Counties only through voluntary land exchanges. Directs that: (1) such lands be managed in a manner that does not preclude the implementation of any management alternative identified in the study of alternatives or in the Greenway Plan; and (2) the Secretary, where appropriate, seek to enter into memoranda of agreement with other Federal agencies to manage land administered by such agencies within the floodplain, consistent with the purposes of this Act. Establishes the Commission to advise the Secretary on the preparation of the study. Sets forth reporting and other administrative requirements. Authorizes appropriations."
