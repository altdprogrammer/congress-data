    "text": "National Archives and Records Administration Authorization Act of 1992 - Amends Federal law to authorize appropriations for the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the National Historical Publications and Records Commission. Declares that any rule affecting public access to records in the custody of the Archivist of the United States may be adopted or amended only after notice and comment as provided in the Administrative Procedure Act. Revises the definition of \"records\" with specific reference to computerized and electronic information. Establishes procedures for the review of former agency head records proposed for removal. Restricts removal to unclassified, extra copies of records maintained only for convenience of reference. Provides for Government reimbursement for record duplication and delivery costs. Authorizes the Archivist to establish standards for interpreting the definition of \"records.\" Provides increased authority with respect to inspection of agency records and for carrying out other existing responsibilities pertaining to records and records management. Restructures operations of the National Archives Trust Fund (the Fund). Requires the National Archives Trust Fund Board (the Board) to comply with all procurement rules applicable to NARA. Authorizes the Board to sell publications and charge a price for any publication and other item sold that shall not exceed the cost of producing the item, plus a profit of not more than 25 percent of that cost. Requires the Board to provide for the sale of reproductions of documents, motion pictures, and other records in the custody of the Archivist, at a price that does not exceed the cost of producing the reproductions. Requires reproductions to be provided without charge to requesters who qualify for a waiver of fees under the Freedom of Information Act. Requires the Board to establish a Visiting Scholars Program under which scholars may be provided travel and lodging support to visit NARA facilities. Provides for audits of the Fund. Requires excess profits in the Fund to be used for the Visiting Scholars Program and reproductions of NARA materials. Establishes in NARA an: (1) Advisory Committee on Electronic Records to advise the Archivist on matters pertaining to NARA acquisition, preservation, and documentation of electronic records; and (2) Advisory Committee on the National Archives to advise the Archivist on all NARA programs and activities and review NARA's role as a leader and resource for State and local archivists. Mandates a pilot program in each of three or more Federal agencies to make information in the Federal Register available without charge to the public through online access mechanisms. Establishes a term limit of seven years for the Archivist of the United States and subjects the Deputy Archivist to presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. Sets compensation for the Deputy Archivist at the rate provided for level IV of the Executive Schedule. Increases the endowment requirement for Presidential libraries."
