    "text": "Reclamation Waste Water and Ground Water Study Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting pursuant to the Reclamation Act of 1902 and other Federal reclamation laws, to investigate and identify opportunities for reclamation and reuse of municipal, industrial, domestic, and agricultural waste water, and naturally impaired ground and surface waters. Directs the Secretary to undertake appraisal investigations to identify opportunities and make recommendations for water reclamation and reuse. Authorizes the Secretary to participate with appropriate Federal, State, regional, and local authorities in studies to determine the feasibility of water reclamation and reuse projects recommended. Limits the Federal share of study costs to 50 percent, except when the Secretary determines that due to financial hardship the non-Federal participant in such study is unable to contribute at least 50 percent of such costs. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a study to assess the feasibility of a comprehensive water reclamation and reuse system for southern California. Requires such a study for southern Arizona. Directs the Secretary to conduct a feasibility study of the potential for development of demonstration and permanent facilities to reclaim and reuse water in the San Diego and San Jose metropolitan service areas. Directs the Secretary to conduct a feasibility study of the potential for development of facilities to utilize fully waste water from the regional waste water treatment plant for direct municipal, industrial, agricultural, and environmental purposes, groundwater recharge and direct potable reuse in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a study to assess and develop means of reclaiming the waters of Lake Cheraw, Colorado, or otherwise ameliorating, controlling, and mitigating potential negative impacts of pollution in the Lake waters on ground water resources or on the waters of the Arkansas River. Limits the Federal share of study costs to 50 percent. Authorizes the Secretary to participate with the City of Los Angeles, State of California, West Basin Municipal Water District, and other appropriate authorities, in the design, planning, and construction of water reclamation and reuse projects to treat a specified amount of effluent from the Hyperion Service Area, City of Los Angeles, in order to provide new water supplies for industrial, environmental, and other beneficial purposes, to reduce the demand for imported water, and to reduce sewage effluent discharge into Santa Monica Bay. Limits the Secretary's share of project costs to 25 percent. Authorizes appropriations. Requires congressional reports for such investigations and studies. Directs the Secretary: (1) acting through the Bureau of Reclamation and the Geological Survey, to conduct an investigation and analysis of the impacts of existing Bureau projects on the quality and quantity of groundwater resources; and (2) to prepare a reclamation groundwater management and technical assistance study concerning such resources. Requires the Secretary to consult with Governors of affected States in conducting such investigation, analysis, and study. Requires a congressional report concerning such study. Authorizes appropriations."
