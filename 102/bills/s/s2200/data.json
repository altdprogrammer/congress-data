    "text": "Jobs for Economic Growth Act of 1992 - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to establish a Jobs for Economic Growth program of demonstration projects to assist eligible persons in obtaining employment. Directs the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary), in carrying out such projects, to award grants to eligible entities to establish job training programs that include: (1) participant assessment; (2) education and training in new vocational skills; (3) employment in projects that benefit the community in which the program is established; and (4) job placement services for those who have successfully completed the rest of the program. Requires the program to provide individually designed, part-time education and training, both during and after participants' working hours, including courses in basic literacy skills, college courses for those who need to prepare for a first job, and courses designed for those who need to learn a new career after years of productive employment. Prohibits displacement of public employees by use of program participants. Requires eligible entities to provide participants: (1) an average wage of $6 per hour for job training program employment; (2) payment for participation, for up to five hours per week, in education and training programs; and (3) health care coverage. Requires participants to work a full day to receive full wages, or else be subject to reduction in pay and possible dismissal. Limits the duration of participant eligibility to two years, or until the participant acquires the skills to be placed in a stable employment situation, if sooner. Sets forth participant eligibility requirements. Requires that participants be unemployed currently and for at least the past two months. Requires that they: (1) have participated in job training in public assistance or other private or public programs, and have not found employment through such programs; (2) lack previous job histories; or (3) have multiple and serious handicaps to employment. Requires that they be: (1) public assistance recipients; (2) without stable income; (3) unemployed young adults; (4) probationers; or (5) dislocated workers. Requires eligible entities to submit applications and meet such other requirements as the Secretary may prescribe. Authorizes appropriations."
