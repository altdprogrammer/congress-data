    "text": "Comprehensive Services for Children and Youth Act of 1991 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to eligible entities to pay 80 percent of the costs for activities relating to school-based or community-based coordinated educational and social services programs to strengthen the educational performance and future potential of at-risk youth (both in-school and out-of-school). Requires such grants to be awarded only to programs designed to: (1) co-locate a range of educational and social services; (2) provide multi-year services to at-risk children and youth and their families; (3) serve the specified target population; and (4) be coordinated by the eligible entity with activities under other Federal, State, and local grants received by partnership members for purposes and target populations described in this Act, into an integrated service delivery system co-located at a school or other community-based site accessible to and used by at-risk youth. Gives priority to eligible entities providing comprehensive services extending beyond traditional school or service hours, that may include year-round programs providing evening and weekend services. Allows such grants to be made for up to five years, if recipients make satisfactory progress toward program objectives. Requires an equitable geographic distribution to both urban and rural areas with a high proportion of at-risk youth. Authorizes bonus awards to recipients demonstrating increases in coordination and level of services above those anticipated in the application or interim report. Makes eligible to receive such grants, to serve in-school children and youth, a partnership between a local educational agency (LEA) that is eligible for certain funds for education of disadvantaged children under chapter 1 title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (chapter 1 program), and at least one nonprofit community-based organization with a history of providing social services to low-income at-risk youth and their families, and which: (1) must also include public health, child welfare, social services, job training, public housing agencies or other public agencies providing services to such youth and families; and (2) may include private industry councils, or other relevant planning and program implementation boards providing services to such youth and families. Makes eligible for such grants, to serve out-of-school youth, a partnership between at least one public entity of the types described above, or an LEA eligible for chapter 1 program funds, and at least one nonprofit comunity-based organization described above. Requires the eligible entity, to receive such a grant, to serve the following target population: (1) students enrolled in schools participating in school-wide projects assisted under the chapter 1 program, and their families; (2) students enrolled in schools that are the most economically disadvantaged within the LEA; (3) out-of-school youth at-risk of having limited future options as a result of teenage pregnancy and parenting, substance abuse, recent immigration, disability, limited English proficiency, family migration, illiteracy, being a child of a teen parent, living in a single parent household, or being a high school dropout; or (4) any combination of in-school and out-of-school youth. Allows the eligible entity to serve the families of such students or youth. Includes among authorized activities: (1) one-stop shopping programs in schools or nearby community-based service centers to provide comprehensive educational and social services to the target population and families, support necessary costs (such as rentals, leases, open and lock-up fees, maintenance, security, and operation), and encourage participation of service providers necessary for comprehensive services delivery; (2) unified eligibility procedures, integrated data bases or administrative structures, and secure confidentiality procedures for information-sharing and interagency communications, including various technological developments to improve coordination; (3) integrated needs assessment, case planning, and case management services, through staff support for interagency teams of service providers or hiring school-based social services coordinators or neighborhood youth corps; and (4) integrated social services for at-risk students, for smooth transitions of preschool children to elementary school and of secondary or alternative school students to job training, higher education, or full employment. Sets forth application requirements and limitations for planning grants. Requires grant funds under this Act to be used to supplement but not supplant non-Federal funds. Sets forth grant application requirements. Requires each eligible entity desiring such a grant to establish a coordinated services planning council to develop such application. Directs the Secretaries of Education and of Health and Human Services to jointly review such applications, and to consult with the Secretaries of Labor and of Housing and Urban Development, as appropriate. Requires grant recipients to submit annual interim reports to the Secretary of Education. Amends the Augustus F. Hawkins Human Resources Reauthorization Act of 1990 to direct the Federal Council on Children, Youth, and Families to: (1) identify and eliminate program regulations or practices that impede coordination and collaboration; (2) develop and implement plans for creating jointly funded programs, unified assessments, eligibility, application procedures, and confidentiality regulations that facilitate information-sharing; and (3) make recommendations to the Congress on legislative action needed to facilitate coordination of educational and social services. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to study grants awarded under this Act to identify: (1) for elimination, regulatory and statutory obstacles encountered; and (2) for replication, appropriate innovative procedures and program designs. Directs the Secretary to evaluate the success of such grants in achieving outcome measures and coordinating services. Directs the Secretary to report, with recommendations, to specified congressional committees on such study. Sets forth requirements for grant payments, Federal and non-Federal shares, technical assistance, and dissemination of information on successful models through the National Diffusion Network. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1996 to carry out this Act."
