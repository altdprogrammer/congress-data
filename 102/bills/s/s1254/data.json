Repeals provisions that limit the acreage of non-Federal property on the Maryland mainland that may be accepted by the Secretary for the seashore in exchange for Federal property in Maryland or Virginia. Directs the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with local, State, and Federal agencies, educational institutions, and nonprofit entities to coordinate research designed to maximize protection for the seashore's natural and cultural resources and to implement recommendations arising from it. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance to such institutions and entities for such purposes.
