    "text": "Amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish the Eligible Dislocated Workers Educational Training Demonstration Program. Directs the Secretary of Education to award grants to States to pay the Federal share (50 percent) of the cost of establishing and operating eligible dislocated workers educational training demonstration programs. Requires that such programs: (1) be designed to provide such workers with new skills through a variety of educational opportunities offered by institutions of higher education which are suited to such workers' goals, educational background, aptitude, and skills; (2) lead to entry level job skills that assist such workers to return to the work force; (3) only pay program participation costs not paid by other Federal, State, or local grant programs; and (4) provide educational opportunities in programs that either do not provide academic credit and which include academic skills improvement, job skills, and career and personal development or provide academic credit in one-year certificate or two-year associate degree granting programs. Makes eligible dislocated workers (as defined under the Job Training Partnership Act) eligible to participate in such a program if they: (1) have applied for all Federal, State, and local grant assistance available to such workers; and (2) are eligible for unemployment compensation payments under Federal or State law. Makes individuals ineligible for such program participation if they: (1) complete their education goal; or (2) return to employment of at least 20 hours per week. Provides that the amount of such workers' unemployment insurance payments under Federal or State law shall not be increased or decreased as a result of assistance received under this Act. Sets forth State application requirements. Requires the Secretary to evaluate such program annually. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1995 to carry out this Act."
