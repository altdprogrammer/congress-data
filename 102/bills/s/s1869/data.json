Directs the Secretary to negotiate an agreement with GRIC, SCAT, and SCIDD for the transfer of associated assets and to distribute those assets in a manner that reflects the proportionate number of miles of distribution line to be transferred to GRIC, SCAT, and SCIDD. Requires the Secretary to retain ownership of the electric generating facilities located in the power house and switchyard at Coolidge Dam. Directs the Secretary to establish the Environmental Protection Account, to be administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in consultation with GRIC and SCAT, to fund the disposal of hazardous waste materials associated with the SCIP electrical system transferred to GRIC and SCAT and with those areas and components retained by the Secretary. Makes the Secretary responsible for unfunded disposals. Directs the Secretary of Energy, upon the request of the Secretary of the Interior, to enter into agreements to reallocate SCIP's allocation of Federal power resources. Directs the Secretary of Energy to treat GRIC, SCIDD, and SCAT as successors in interest to SCIP in reallocating SCIP's allocation of capacity and energy from the Parker Davis Project and the Colorado River Storage Project, including capacity and energy available pursuant to any agreement to provide preference power to SCIP prior to July 31, 1992. Assigns SCIP allocations of winter and summer capacity and energy to GRIC, SCIDD, and SCAT. Requires the BIA to assign its contract with the Arizona Power Authority for capacity and energy from the Boulder Canyon Project accordingly. Directs the Secretary to enter into an agreement with GRIC and SCIDD to provide a long-term power supply to the irrigation wells and pumps installed by SCIP to provide water to SCIP lands on and off GRIC lands. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to allocate all SCIP funds to GRIC, SCIDD, and SCAT for specified uses. Requires SCIP debt obligations owed by GRIC and SCIDD to the United States to be deposited in the Environmental Protection Account. Entitles any Federal employee at SCIP whose position is terminated by this Act to elect to continue receiving workers' compensation, retirement, and health and life insurance benefits for his or her period of employment with the tribal authority, provided such authority deposits employee deductions and agency contributions in the appropriate funds. Directs the Secretary to establish and maintain a Departmental Priority Placement Program for SCIP employees who are involuntarily separated as a result of the divestiture of the SCIP electrical system."
