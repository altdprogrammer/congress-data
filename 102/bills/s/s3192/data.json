    "text": "Shipbuilding Trade Reform Act of 1992 - Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 to direct the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) to make rules and regulations to offset the unfavorable effects that foreign shipbuilding subsidies or other anticompetitive practices have on U.S. shipbuilders. Authorizes U.S. shipbuilders to petition the FMC for relief from such subsidies or anticompetitive practices. Authorizes the FMC to take specified actions if it finds that such subsidies or practices exist. Requires the collector of customs, or the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, to refuse clearance or deny entry to foreign vessels benefiting from such subsidies or practices. Prohibits the FMC from taking action against: (1) foreign countries that are parties to and are in substantial compliance with trade agreements with the United States that provide for the elimination of shipbuilding subsidies; and (2) U.S. documented vessels. Requires the FMC to: (1) investigate such subsidies and anticompetitive practices of foreign countries, including but not limited to member countries of Working Party #6 of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; and (2) establish a list of foreign shipbuilders that receive benefits from such subsidies, anticompetitive practices, or other special conditions unfavorable to U.S. shipbuilders."
