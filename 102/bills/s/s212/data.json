    "text": "Domestic Violence Prevention Act of 1991 - Title I: Amendment of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act - Amends the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) to add increasing public awareness as a purpose of State demonstration grants. Authorizes grants for public information campaigns regarding domestic violence. Requires a State grant recipient to establish a Commission on Domestic Violence. Limits law enforcement training grants to private nonprofit organizations that have certain experience. Mandates grants or contracts for the establishment of one national and five regional resource centers to provide training and other assistance concerning domestic violence. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Act. Requires grants to States to assist in becoming model demonstration States and in improving State leadership regarding certain domestic violence matters. Sets forth requirements for being designated as a model State. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Law Enforcement, Prosecution Grants, and Interstate Enforcement - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize competitive grants to States for use by States and local governments to assist in developing effective law enforcement and prosecution strategies to combat domestic violence and to reduce the rate of domestic violence. Authorizes appropriations. Amends Federal law to establish criminal penalties for interstate travel to commit spousal abuse or to violate protection orders. Allows temporary protection orders pending final adjudication of charges under these provisions. Mandates victim restitution. Requires a protection order by a court of one State to be accorded full faith and credit by the court of another State. Amends the FVPSA to prohibit a State or locality from being awarded a grant under the Act if, as a matter of law, policy, or practice, it discriminated against victims of family violence. Requires certification that this condition has been met. Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to require a similar certification. Amends the FVPSA to authorize grants to State and local government entities to encourage them, and Indian tribes, to take specified actions in order to treat spousal violence as a serious violation of criminal law. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to transfer a specified sum each fiscal year to the Attorney General for such grants."
