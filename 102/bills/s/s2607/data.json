    "text": "Grants authority to either the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or a Board (the Board) composed of State regulatory commission members to approve regional integrated resource plans (electric power and energy resources and action implementation plans for the operating subsidiaries of a registered holding company to meet expected future customer demand). Grants congressional consent to interstate compacts to form such Board. Outlines the Board's administrative and enforcement parameters. Requires the operating subsidiaries to file Board-approved regional integrated resource plans with FERC. Denies FERC authority to modify such plans. Sets forth alternative ways to secure approval of regional integrated resource plans. Mandates compliance with an approved regional integrated resource plan by: (1) operating subsidiaries; (2) State commissions; and (3) FERC. Preserves existing legal authority of the States and FERC. Provides for judicial review of any final order by either FERC or the Board."
