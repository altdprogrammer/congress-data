    "text": "Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Amendments of 1991 - Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to repeal a function of the national clearinghouse for information relating to child abuse which relates to identifying effective programs and providing technical assistance under the program of challenge grants to States. Exempts contract review panels from the prohibition against appointment to peer review panels of officers or employees of the Office of Human Development Services. Repeals specified provisions for: (1) waivers of eligibility requirements for grants to States for child abuse and neglect prevention and treatment programs; and (2) reduction of funds in case of a State's failure to obligate funds awarded under such grants program. Requires an assisted State to maintain (as well as establish or designate) a State multidisciplinary task force on children's justice. Extends the authorization of appropriations for: (1) emergency child abuse prevention services; (2) grants to States for child abuse and neglect prevention and treatment programs; and (3) the challenge grant program to encourage States to maintain certain funding mechanisms. Revises requirements for State eligibility for such challenge grants to require State establishment or maintenance of a trust fund or dedicated appropriation available only for child abuse and neglect prevention activities. (Current law requires such a trust fund or other funding mechanism, including appropriations.) Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978 to extend the authorization of appropriations for the adoption opportunities program. Amends the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988 to extend the authorization of appropriations for the abandoned infants assistance program. Amends the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act to extend the authorization of appropriations for the family violence prevention and services program. Increases the maximum amount limitation on certain demonstration grants under such Act. Amends the Temporary Child Care for Children with Disabilities and Crisis Nurseries Act of 1986 to extend through FY 1994 the authorization of appropriations for the temporary child care for children with disabilities and crisis nurseries program. Makes various minor and technical amendments to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, the Child Abuse Prevention, Adoption, and Family Services Act of 1988, and the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act. Declares that title II of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978 may be cited as the Adoption Opportunities Act."
