    "text": "Department of Energy Laboratory Technology Partnership Act of 1992 - Establishes the Department of Energy (DOE) partnership program under which the Secretary of Energy must ensure that departmental laboratories enter into research partnerships with industry, educational institutions, and other Federal agencies. Authorizes the Secretary to establish Secretary of Energy Partnerships to develop research and demonstration activities listed in the biennial National Critical Technologies Report or in other specified areas. Grants such partnerships the same preference they would receive under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (whereby they agree that products embodying inventions made under a cooperative research and development agreement will be manufactured substantially in the United States). Directs the Secretary to encourage research partnerships with minority educational institutions, and private sector entities owned or controlled by disadvantaged individuals. Cites the technology research and demonstration areas which such partnerships may target. Directs the Secretary to: (1) encourage the exchange of scientists and engineers among departmental laboratories, educational institutions, industry, and other Federal agencies; (2) provide fellowships to facilitate personnel exchanges from such areas; (3) provide education and training; (4) develop evaluation mechanisms; (5) develop a management plan for implementation of this Act; and (6) report biennially to the Congress on its implementation. Directs the Secretary to establish the Laboratory Partnership Advisory Board to provide guidance on the implementation of this Act. Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to: (1) increase the number of DOE Under Secretaries from one to three and the number of Assistant Secretaries from eight to 11; and (2) establish the position of General Counsel. Requires the Secretary to make recommendations to the Congress regarding establishment of an Office of Technology Research within DOE. Directs the Secretary to solicit proposals for a commercial predeployment contractor to conduct specified activities to enable the Federal uranium enrichment enterprise to deploy a commercial uranium enrichment plant using the Atomic Vapor Isotope Separation (AVLIS) technology. Authorizes the Secretary to solicit additional proposals to complete attendant activities, based upon the AVLIS contract results. Requires the Secretary to submit AVLIS production plant status reports to specified congressional committees every 90 days. Requires the Secretary to submit to certain congressional committees a report addressing opportunities for minority educational institutions to participate in DOE activities, or those conducted by departmental laboratories. Directs the Secretary to establish an international fellowship program under which departmental laboratory staff will serve as visiting scientists and engineers in foreign research facilities. Directs the Secretary to establish a Laboratory Career Path Program to recruit employees of specified National Laboratories (Argonne, Brookhaven, Idaho Engineering, Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, Pacific Northwest, and Sandia) to serve in positions in DOE. (Currently such transfers are unlawful.) Amends the Federal criminal code and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to declare inapplicable to such National Laboratories certain communications and recusal restrictions (generally, postemployment restrictions) that conflict with the Laboratory Career Path Program. Limits such exemption to employees of such Laboratories who return to the Laboratories after an earlier transfer to DOE."
