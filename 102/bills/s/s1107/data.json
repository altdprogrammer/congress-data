Requires the Secretary, whenever a veteran is determined to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation and counseling services and is not interviewed by the Secretary within 60 days of such determination, to arrange for such services to be provided through an accredited agency on a fee basis. Sets forth provisions applying this Act to claims filed before this Act's enactment."
