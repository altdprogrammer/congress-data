Prohibits, if the Congress determines by joint resolution that a country has not made a good faith effort to reply to the President's request: (1) economic assistance to the country until it complies with this Act's requirements; (2) most-favored-nation treatment of the country's products; (3) participation by the country in any program under which the United States extends credit or credit or investment guarantees; and (4) any commercial agreement between the country and the United States from taking effect."
