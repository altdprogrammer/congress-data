    "text": "Native American Programs Act of 1974 Amendments Act - Amends the Native American Programs Act of 1974 to establish in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the Administration for Native Americans (Administration) and in the Office of the Secretary of HHS (Secretary) the Intra-Departmental Council on Native American Affairs (Council). Requires the Commissioner of the Administration (Commissioner) to: (1) administer HHS financial assistance programs; (2) coordinate HHS activities affecting Native Americans; (3) serve as advocate for Native Americans within HHS; and (4) compile and disseminate pertinent information, especially for the Secretary's annual report. Requires the Council to: (1) prepare a plan to allow tribal governments and other eligible Native American organizations to consolidate HHS grants; (2) designate a single office to oversee and audit such grants; and (3) recommend the plan to the Secretary. Makes Alaska Native organizations in urban or rural nonreservation areas as well as Indian organizations eligible for financial assistance. Makes the Office of Hawaiian Affairs of Hawaii (Office) the recipient of grants from the Secretary for a revolving loan fund for economic development in Hawaii. Repeals the termination of such loan fund after a five-year demonstration period (thus making the fund permanent). Requires the Office to provide matching non-Federal contributions to the fund for each grant. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1994. Repeals provisions of the Native American Programs Act Amendments of 1987 that require the deposit of certain funds into the U.S. Treasury. Directs the Commissioner (in place of the Secretary) to provide: (1) technical assistance to potential and denied grant applicants; and (2) short-term training for persons carrying out funded projects. Authorizes an organization whose grant application is denied on grounds of ineligibility to file an administrative appeal. Authorizes the Commissioner to extend employment preference to Native Americans, based on the requirement that the Administration staff have knowledge of social and economic conditions characteristic of Native Americans. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1996, including appropriations for FY 1992 to continue the development of a detailed plan, together with contributory research demonstration projects, to establish a National Center for Native American Studies and Indian Policy Development."
