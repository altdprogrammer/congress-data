Makes such coordinator responsible for a program of activities related to preventing and reducing the rate of traumatic brain injuries in the State. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, to establish standards for the reporting of data on traumatic brain injuries and the operation of registries of traumatic brain injuries for coordinator use.
