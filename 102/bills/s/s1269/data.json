    "text": "Renewable Hydrogen Energy Research and Development Act of 1991 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to solicit proposals and award contracts to conduct necessary research and development programs, including programs to: (1) develop, build, and test systems for generating hydrogen from renewable energy sources; (2) develop, build, and test catalytic hydrogen gas diffusion burners for residential furnaces and stoves, with a goal of greater than 95 percent combustion efficiency; (3) evaluate the ability of existing natural gas pipelines to carry hydrogen gas with a goal of determining components of the system that would have to be modified to carry more than 20 percent hydrogen mixed with natural gas and pure hydrogen gas; (4) develop, build, and test one hydrogen storage system suitable for electric vehicles powered by way of fuel cells; and (5) design, build, and test a fuel cell suitable to power an electric motor vehicle. Directs the Secretary to prepare a comprehensive research and development plan to facilitate the development of renewable hydrogen energy systems. Sets forth elements of the plan. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Technology Competitiveness Act of 1989 to require the Secretary of Energy to solicit proposals for and provide financial assistance to joint ventures for the demonstration of: (1) the production of hydrogen using renewable energy sources; (2) an electric utility load-leveling system with hydrogen as the storage medium; and (3) a renewable hydrogen zero emission transportation system. Authorizes appropriations."
