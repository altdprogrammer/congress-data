    "text": "Department of Energy Critical Technologies of 1991 - Title I: Department of Energy Critical Technologies Program - Directs the Secretary to establish the Critical Technologies Planning Council and the Critical Technologies Advisory Board within the Department of Energy (DOE). Requires the Secretary to develop biennially and implement a five-year DOE Critical Technologies Plan that: (1) coordinates the research and development activities of the DOE laboratories in support of DOE critical technologies; and (2) coordinates DOE Critical Technologies Partnerships. Sets forth required contents of the Plan. Directs the head of each DOE laboratory to report biennially to the Council and the Advisory Board on the core competencies of such laboratory. Requires the report to: (1) identify the national critical technologies listed in the most recent National Critical Technologies Report; (2) describe each laboratory program of research and development in the identified technologies; and (3) discuss the relevance of such technologies to the laboratory's strategic mission objectives. Directs the Secretary to ensure that core competencies reports are disseminated to the private sector. Requires the Secretary to ensure that the laboratory-directed research and development activities of each DOE laboratory include research and development that extends and maintains the vitality of the laboratory's core competencies. Title II: Department of Energy Critical Technologies Partnerships - Directs the Secretary to establish as many DOE Critical Technologies Partnerships as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this title. Requires Partnerships to be comprised of DOE laboratories and participants from U.S. firms and institutions of higher education and other participants, as appropriate. Provides for the designation of a lead institution for the Partnership to direct activities. Requires proposals for partnerships to be submitted to the Secretary by the lead institution. Sets forth proposal requirements. Requires Partnership proposals to demonstrate a financial commitment of the non-Federal participants to contribute 50 percent of the total cost of Partnership activities. Directs the Secretary to provide technical and other assistance to each Partnership. Requires Partnerships to be selected through a competitive process prescribed by the Secretary. Sets forth selection criteria. Prohibits the disclosure of confidential commercial or financial information obtained from a non-Federal participant as a result of Partnership activities. Title III: Authorization of Appropriations and Other Provisions - Authorizes appropriations for atomic energy defense and energy research activities under this Act. Provides that such funds are in addition to funds authorized to be appropriated for technology transfer in connection with such activities or funds appropriated for such purposes before this Act's enactment. Authorizes the Secretary to waive the applicability of this Act to DOE activities that are classified in the interest of U.S. national security or foreign policy."
