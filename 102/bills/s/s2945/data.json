Provides for: (1) liability of the Plan Administrator for covered damages to claimants; (2) collection and payment of the Compensation Plan Contribution; (3) notice to claimants and evaluation of their claims; (4) claimants' proof of claim for offer of settlement; and (5) negotiation with and selection of the Plan Administrator."
