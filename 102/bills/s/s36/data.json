    "text": "New York City Zebra Mussel Monitoring Act - Directs the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works to: (1) develop a prevention monitoring program for zebra mussels throughout the New York City water supply system; (2) develop zebra mussel prevention and removal technologies for such system; and (3) provide technical assistance to the State of New York and New York City on alternative design and maintenance practices for the system in the event of zebra mussel infestation. Requires appropriate non-Federal interests to pay 25 percent of the costs of such monitoring, prevention, and technical assistance. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 to direct the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, in issuing regulations to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species into the Great Lakes, to apply such regulations to vessels that carry ballast water and that, after operating on the waters beyond the exclusive economic zone, enter a U.S. port on the Hudson River where water is characterized as having a salinity less than 18 o/oo. Permits the Secretary to apply such regulations to vessels operating in other rivers, canals, lakes, and waterways where the discharge of ballast water could result in the introduction and spread of such species in the Great Lakes. Directs the Secretary to study the need for controls on vessels entering U.S. waters, including the Great Lakes (currently, waters other than the Great Lakes), to minimize the risk of the unintentional introduction and dispersal of aquatic nuisance species in those waters."
