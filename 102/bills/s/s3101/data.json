Authorizes participating conferees and other interested individuals and organizations to conduct conferences and other activities at the State and regional levels prior to the date of the Conference, subject to approval of the executive director of the Conference. Prohibits: (1) a person involved in administering State juvenile justice programs providing services to, or advocacy of, juvenile offenders from being denied admission to any State or regional conference; or (2) the imposition of fees on any person attending a Conference except for a maximum ten dollar registration fee. Directs all Federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities to provide necessary support and assistance to facilitate the planning and administration of the Conference. Requires the Executive Director of the Coalition of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Advisory Committees to: (1) provide necessary assistance for the organization and conduct of State and regional conferences; (2) enter into contracts and agreements with public agencies, private organizations, and academic institutions; and (3) prepare and provide background materials for use by participants in the Conference and in the State and regional conferences. Requires: (1) the Conference to submit a final report to the President and the Congress on its findings and recommendations along with proposals for any legislative action necessary to implement them; and (2) the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to report annually to the Congress on the status and implementation of such findings and recommendations during the three-year period following submission of the final report of the Conference. Authorizes appropriations. Prohibits the use of funds appropriated to the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act from being used to carry out this Act except for funds appropriated specifically to conduct the Conference."
