    "text": "Reduction of Metals in Packaging Act - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue regulations prohibiting the sale or promotion in the United States of any packaging that includes inks, dyes, pigments, adhesives, stabilizers, other additives, lead, cadmium, mercury, or hexavalent chromium intentionally introduced during manufacturing or distribution. Sets forth the maximum allowable concentration level of the sum of such elements in packaging. Makes such regulations inapplicable (for a specified period) for packaging: (1) that was manufactured prior to this Act's effective date; (2) to which lead, cadmium, mercury, or hexavalent chromium have been added to comply with Federal health or safety requirements or for which there is no feasible alternative, provided that the manufacturer petitions EPA for the exemption; or (3) that would not exceed the maximum contaminant levels set forth in this Act but for the addition of post-consumer materials. Requires packaging manufacturers or suppliers to furnish certificates of compliance (with respect to this Act's requirements) to purchasers. Authorizes the assessment of civil penalties for violations of this Act. Sets forth requirements with respect to public access to certificates of compliance."
