Prohibits the storage of such waste in a manner which will allow it to putrefy. Sets forth specific requirements for containment methods. Permits the transfer of such waste by generators only to registered transporters. Prohibits the transport of such waste in the same vehicle with other waste unless the medical waste is separately contained or all of the waste is to be treated or disposed of as regulated medical waste. Permits the delivery of such waste for treatment or disposal only to facilities with valid permits. Directs the Administrator to establish requirements for the handling of such waste by persons in contact with the waste during the transportation process.

Directs the Administrator to apply regulations for roadway transporters to transporters using railways, airways, and waterways. Requires the Administrator to establish standards for the treatment or disposal of regulated medical waste. Prohibits the disposal of such waste without treatment. Requires treatment to be completed by specified methods of incineration or decontamination by heating in steam sterilizers.

Prohibits the acceptance or transport of such waste unless accompanied by such papers. Authorizes the Administrator to promulgate alternative requirements for small generators. Requires operators of medical waste treatment, storage, or disposal facilities to have valid medical waste management permits issued by the Administrator and approved operation plans. Provides for the submission of new or revised plans when there is a projected increase of more than 25 percent in the quantity of waste received per year by the facility or when there are changes made in plans. Withdraws approval for acceptance of waste for noncompliance with plans or permits. Requires facility operators to provide evidence of financial assurance as a permit condition.
