    "text": "Private Defense Export Financing Act of 1991 - Amends the Arms Export Control Act to create a Private Defense Export Financing Board to guarantee eligible defense export loans. Makes eligible for guarantees loans made by entities doing business in the United States (other than Government agencies) for export projects that: (1) involve the acquisition of defense articles or services or design and construction services by friendly foreign countries or international organizations; (2) are financed by such entities; (3) are creditworthy; (4) will not involve procurement outside the United States, except as permitted under the Arms Export Control Act; and (5) satisfy other conditions of the Board. Requires a guaranty to guarantee a lender against political and credit risks of nonpayment. Directs the Board to notify specified congressional committees of all proposed guaranties. Requires the Export-Import Bank to: (1) determine the creditworthiness of each export project for which a loan is proposed to be guaranteed; and (2) provide the Board and specified congressional committees with a risk analysis for each project. Authorizes appropriations."
