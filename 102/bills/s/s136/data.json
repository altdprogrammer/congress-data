Revokes and nullifies the legal effect of any prior approval of the Secretary of the Interior on or before enactment of this Act to an application by the Secretary of Energy to: (1) make a land withdrawal relating to WIPP (other than a certain public land order); or (2) modify such order. Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from issuing, modifying, extending, or revoking any land withdrawal relating to WIPP without congressional consent. Includes in such prohibition any emergency withdrawal or other action permitted under certain provisions of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act."
