Requires the Corporation to be administered by an Executive Director who should be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Establishes a Professional Boxing Advisory Board. Sets forth the functions of the Corporation, which include: (1) providing a national computer source for certain boxing information; (2) licensing and certifying boxers, judges, referees, promoters, matchmakers, managers, trainers, cut men, and physicians; and (3) charging licensing and registration fees. Authorizes the Corporation to suspend or revoke any license or registration if it is in the public interest and there are reasonable grounds for believing: (1) prescribed standards are not being met; and (2) bribery, collusion, intentional losing, racketeering, extortion, or the use of unlawful threats, coercion, or intimidation have been used in connection with such licensing or registration. Authorizes the Corporation, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to prohibit the holding of a proposed boxing match if it is in the public interest and other specified conditions exist. Sets forth the powers of the Corporation. Declares that nothing in this Act shall prohibit a State agency from exercising its powers, duties, or functions with respect to the regulation of professional boxing matches. Authorizes the Corporation to secure assistance from other agencies. Establishes in the Treasury the Professional Boxing Corporation Trust Fund. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct annual audits of Corporation finances. Requires the Corporation to submit an annual report to the Congress. Authorizes State boxing authorities to submit to specified congressional committees a petition: (1) stating that this Act is unnecessary because it has established a similar organization; and (2) requesting a delay of the effective date or repeal of this Act."
