Provides that such scholarships shall be in the form of loans, with repayment to be forgiven: (1) entirely, upon the student's prompt return to the Soviet Union for a period at least one year longer than that of U.S. study; or (2) by one-half, if the student is granted asylum in or is admitted as a refugee to the United States. Sets forth scholarship program guidelines. Limits scholarship opportunities to fields that are critical to economic and political reforms in the Soviet Union, particularly business administration, economics, law, or public administration. Authorizes appropriations to the U.S. Information Agency for FY 1992 and 1993 to carry out this Act. Provides that any authority provided by this Act shall be effective only to the extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriations Acts."
