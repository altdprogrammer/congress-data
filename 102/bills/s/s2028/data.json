    "text": "Women Veterans' Health Equity Act of 1991 - Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish well-women care services to women veterans who: (1) have a service-connected disability; or (2) are eligible for veterans' hospital care and whose annual income does not exceed the maximum rate of pension that would be applicable if such a veteran were eligible for pension. Defines \"well-women care services\" as health care services provided outside the maternity cycle. Authorizes the Secretary to furnish such services, subject to certain conditions, to a woman veteran who is not eligible for services under the criteria of this Act, but who is otherwise eligible for hospital care. Sets forth requirements concerning personnel to provide such services. Directs the Secretary to initiate research and expand ongoing research into the health consequences for women veterans of the following matters: (1) breast cancer and cancer of the reproductive organs; (2) gynecological and hormonal matters; (3) Alzheimer's disease; (4) osteoporosis; and (5) post-traumatic stress disorder. Requires the Secretary to carry out a research study to determine: (1) the frequency of the diagnosis of psychotic illness as the basis for the admittance of female and male veterans to Department facilities; and (2) an explanation for the difference, if any, in such frequencies. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to conduct a ten-year study to determine the health-care needs of women veterans and, as part of such study, examine the medical, biopsychosocial, and demographic histories of women veterans and women members of the armed forces serving on active duty. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary, in carrying out any medical research based on population analyses, to ensure that: (1) the research reflects matters that are significant for the general population of women in the United States; and (2) the population analyzed in such research is representative of the incidence of the condition or illness in the general population of women in the United States."
