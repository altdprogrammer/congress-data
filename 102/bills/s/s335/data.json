    "text": "Gulf War Higher Education and Health Care Shortage Assistance Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to grant a six-month deferment on obligations to repay guaranteed student loans, under the Robert T. Stafford Student Loan Program, to borrowers who are Armed Services members serving in connection with Operation Desert Storm (members). Requires institutions of higher education or vocational schools (as defined under HEA student assistance program provisions) to provide substantial tuition refunds or credits to such members. Directs the Secretary of Education to: (1) facilitate use of such benefits under this Act; (2) minimize the administrative burden placed on institutions of higher education, lenders, and guarantee agencies; and (3) allow family members or other appropriate parties to certify the status of individuals applying for such benefits. Amends the Public Health Service Act to set forth provisions to address health care provider shortages resulting from military hostilities. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to declare such a shortage in a medically underserved population or a health professional shortage area, or in other areas under specified conditions. Directs the Secretary of HHS to make grants on an expedited basis to eligible entities serving such populations or areas to: (1) temporarily replace health care providers ordered to active duty; and (2) secure additional necessary professional liability coverage for such replacement providers. Gives preference to entities: (1) serving a predominantly indigent patient population; or (2) in areas with the greatest shortage. Authorizes the Secretary of HHS to take appropriate action to respond to such shortages, including: (1) detailing Public Health Service Employees to regions with such shortages; (2) coordinating and facilitating voluntary placement in such regions of private providers and faculty in the health professions; and (3) providing to the Secretary of Defense information about the scope and nature of such shortages in each region in order to assist in minimizing such disruptions. Authorizes appropriations. Provides that all direct or discretionary spending in this Act comprises emergency expenditures related to Operation Desert Storm, for purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act)."
