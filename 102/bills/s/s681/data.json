Applies such automatic inclusion to members on active duty at their time of death unless the member elects in writing not to be so insured. Establishes as the amount of such additional insurance the amount for which the veteran is already insured under SGLI. Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure that each eligible individual is notified and afforded the opportunity to increase his or her coverage."
