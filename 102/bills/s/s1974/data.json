    "text": "Inter-American Scientific Cooperation Act of 1991 - Directs the National Science Foundation to establish the Inter-American Scientific Cooperation Program aimed at increasing science and technology cooperation between the United States and Latin America. Requires the Program to identify and cooperate with private and governmental funding bodies. Requires the Program to encourage the use of debt-for-science exchanges to finance cooperative scientific research projects. Requires the Program Director to make funds available, in accordance with the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, to non-Federal organizations for such exchanges. Requires intent by a debtor nation to contribute at least 75 percent of the full face value of the discounted debt, or at least 20 percent over the current market purchase price of the debt. Requires the Director to appoint a Board of Governors for the U.S. side of a United States-Mexico Binational Science Endowment. Requires that the Endowment be an independent, nongovernmental, nonadvocacy, not-for-profit organization operated exclusively for scientific and educational purposes, receiving funds and supporting projects of potential benefit to both nations. Authorizes the use of a limited amount of funds authorized under specified Acts to carry out this Act. Authorizes and encourages the President to provide a specified amount from the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for certain purposes of this Act."
