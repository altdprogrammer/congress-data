    "text": "Small Town Environmental Planning Act of 1991 - Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a small community environmental compliance planning program for facilities that are owned or operated by, or under contract with, a small community, or with respect to which an environmental compliance activity is dependent. Provides for voluntary participation in such program. Requires the Administrator to publish a list of requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Toxic Substances Control Act to be addressed in small community environmental compliance plans. Provides for the annual review of such list. Directs the Administrator to: (1) publish guidelines for small communities or States responsible for the development of such plans; and (2) promulgate regulations setting forth the requirements for submission of such plans. Sets forth plan format requirements. Requires regulations, at a minimum, to: (1) identify areas of environmental regulation where there are significant problems in achieving compliance or noncompliance with implementation schedules under such Acts; and (2) estimate the amount of user fees necessary for the financing of environmental compliance activities at treatment or disposal facilities owned, operated, or under contract with small communities and assess the ability of residents to pay such fees. Directs small communities participating in the program to prepare plans. Authorizes State agencies to prepare plans for small communities without sufficient resources to do so. Sets forth provisions concerning plan approvals and modifications. Requires the Administrator to provide for a mechanism under which a small community may apply for a waiver with respect to regulations issued under the Acts identified by this Act. Permits the Administrator to waive requirements where the small community demonstrates that compliance with regulations is not necessary to protect human health and the environment. Requires the Administrator, as part of the program, to: (1) notify small communities of the regulations through methods providing information to the greatest number of small communities; and (2) implement a technical assistance program to aid small communities in the preparation of plans. Provides for waivers to plan requirements, as necessary, and for the assessment of administrative penalties against facilities failing to meet requirements."
