Applies such provisions to nationals of the People's Republic of China (PRC) described in a specified Executive Order who have resided continuously in the United States since April 11, 1990, and who were not present in the PRC for more than 90 days after such date and before the date of enactment of this Act. Makes such status adjustment provisions inapplicable if the President determines and certifies to the Congress before the application period that conditions in the PRC permit the aliens' safe return. Directs the Attorney General to disseminate status adjustment information to the aliens if the President does not make this determination. Reduces annual PRC immigrant visas to offset status adjustments under this Act (1,000 annually to be allocated between skilled workers (300) and investors (700) if annual entry ceilings are in effect with respect to the PRC.)."
