Authorizes such Court to award: (1) interest accrued from the date such lands were acquired by the United States; and (2) cost of suit and reasonable attorney's fees to any prevailing party, other than the United States. Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) jurisdictional limitations; (2) exhaustion of administrative remedies (not required); and (3) standards for determining reasonable attorney's fees. Specifies that any award made to other Indian tribes with respect to lands subject to such claims shall not be considered a defense, estoppel, or set-off to such claim or otherwise affect relief stemming from such claim."
