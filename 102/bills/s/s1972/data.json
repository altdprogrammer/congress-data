    "text": "State Care: State-Based Comprehensive Health Care Act of 1991 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish the Universal Health Care Advisory Board. Conditions demonstration grants under this Act on establishment by a State of a State Health Care Authority and approval by the State legislature of a State plan under this Act. Authorizes health care planning grants to no more than 15 States. Authorizes appropriations. Mandates demonstration grants to ten States for design and implementation of State Care projects to provide health coverage to individuals residing in such States. Mandates waiver of Federal laws in certain circumstances as necessary to conduct each project and transfers funds which would have been expended under those laws to the State project. Requires payment to each State of a specified percentage of costs not covered by those transfers, covering those payments by issuance of notes to the Secretary of the Treasury. Declares that: (1) it shall not be a violation of antitrust laws for a State grant recipient under this Act to implement a single-payer health care plan; and (2) provisions of State plans supersede the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974."
