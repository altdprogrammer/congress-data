Sets forth Cooperative duties, including issuing contracts and administering all aspects of coverage for all small employers within the district. Waives Federal and State antitrust laws. Authorizes appropriations. Establishes the National Health Board. Requires the Board to establish Coordinated Buying Program Precepts setting forth certain criteria, including regarding a uniform data system, collection of outcomes data, and determining minimum benefit requirements. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Board to establish minimum benefit requirements for plans offered through Cooperatives, including inpatient and outpatient hospital care and physician services, diagnostic tests, prenatal and well-baby care, preventive and early intervention services, and certain inpatient and outpatient mental disorder services.
