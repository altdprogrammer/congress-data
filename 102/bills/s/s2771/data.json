Requires the consent of the Secretary before the grantee or its successor can transfer the title of such conveyed lands. Reverts such transferred title to the United States in specified circumstances. Gives an individual with an existing valid mining claim or location, and who has met specified U.S. mining requirements, on certain public lands transferred by this Act: (1) protection in possessory rights for a seven-year period; and (2) an opportunity to patent such lands. Deems an abandonment of such claim or location by the individual if certain conditions are not met within the designated period. Withdraws specified public lands from U.S. mining and mineral leasing laws."
