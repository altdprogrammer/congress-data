Allows a provider who objects, on religious or moral grounds, to providing information on an option to refer the woman to another provider in the geographic area. Prohibits such assistance unless the recipient is in compliance with State law regarding parental notification of or consent for the performance of an abortion on a minor which is enforced in the State in which the entity is located. Authorizes appropriations for such assistance. Authorizes appropriations for grants and contracts concerning: (1) training to provide family planning services; and (2) informational and educational materials regarding family planning and population growth. Declares that it is the sense of the Congress that recipients of financial assistance under title X (Population Research and Voluntary Family Planning Programs) of the Public Health Service Act should, when purchasing equipment products with such assistance, purchase only American-made equipment and products."
