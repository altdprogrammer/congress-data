    "text": "Allows a person who elects to become a national of the United States, rather than a citizen, to be naturalized subsequently as a U.S. citizen if the requirements of U.S. naturalization law include residency and physical presence within the Northern Mariana Islands. Deems the Northern Mariana Islands as a State for purposes of the judicial naturalization requirements. Grants jurisdiction to the courts of records and the District Court of Northern Mariana Islands to naturalize eligible persons under this Act and those who reside within their jurisdiction. Amends Federal law to authorize the U.S. Resident Representative for the Northern Mariana Islands to nominate one cadet to attend the: (1) U.S. Military Academy; (2) U.S. Naval Academy; and (3) U.S. Air Force Academy. Permits the nomination of nine alternates for each available vacancy. Requires each nominated candidate for admission to be domiciled in the Northern Mariana Islands. Provides that a candidate must, at the time of admission and with specified exceptions: (1) be a U.S. citizen, or have initiated action to become a naturalized citizen; and (2) be eligible for naturalization within two years after admission to the Academy. Requires voluntary disenrollment if a candidate fails to become a naturalized citizen within two years after such admission. Requires the Secretary of the Army to include alternates from the Northern Mariana Islands in his selection of cadets to bring the Academy's class enrollment to full strength, if the number of cadets fall below the authorized number. Sets forth notification procedures to a Member of Congress, delegate, or resident representative by the Secretary of the Navy in the event of a vacancy at the Academy, in which case, each is entitled to nominate a candidate and nine alternates. Prohibits the displacement of any persons nominated for appointment to such Academies, with specified exceptions, and the exceeding of the authorized number of cadets for each of them. Provides that the territories, possessions, and U.S. commonwealths shall be considered part of the United States with respect to the Department of Commerce promoting fishing interests through its U.S. fishery trade officers, and the fostering of foreign and domestic commerce. Authorizes the competitive awards that the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, or any such insular area receives, under the Higher Education Act of 1965, to be incorporated into a consolidated grant."
