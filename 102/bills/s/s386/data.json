    "text": "Persian Gulf War Veterans' Assistance Act of 1991 - Includes the Persian Gulf War under the definition of \"period of war\" for purposes of eligibility for various veterans' benefits for war veterans, their spouses, and their dependents. Makes veterans of the Persian Gulf War and their spouses eligible for veterans' pension benefits. Deems Persian Gulf War veterans who develop an active psychosis within two years after termination of that war to have incurred such disability in active military service for purposes of medical care provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs. Makes veterans of the Persian Gulf War (the War) eligible for drugs and medicines required due to being permanently housebound or in need of regular aid and attendance. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish readjustment counseling to any veteran who served on active duty after May 7, 1975, in an area at a time during which hostilities occurred in such area. Defines \"hostilities\" as an armed conflict comparable to the danger members are subjected to in combat with enemy forces during a period of war. Allows the survivors of veterans of the War who die before the date of enactment of this Act to file a claim for reimbursement for burial and funeral expenses with the Department within two years after the enactment of this Act. Authorizes veteran representatives of the War to be included on the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Education. Makes each veteran who served on active duty for 90 days or more during the War eligible for housing loan benefits under the veterans' home loan program. Requires an employer to make reasonable efforts to requalify a servicemember returning to his or her employment position held before such service. Revises veterans reemployment rights to state that a person shall be considered qualified for an employment position if such person, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. States that \"reasonable accommodation\" shall include the same requirements of employers as stated under the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. Provides for the waiver of an annuity reduction for individuals reemployed as health-care specialists within the Veterans Health Services and Research Administration of the Department. Limits such waivers to only those individuals recruited to replace health-care specialists serving in the War or needed to serve members of the armed forces injured during the War. Includes as health-care specialists physicians, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, nurses, physician assistants, dental auxiliaries, medical technicians, and medical support personnel. Directs the Secretary to establish an information and referral system by means of a toll-free telephone number to provide information and referrals for counseling relating to readjustment counseling, general counseling, and other mental health services to veterans of the War, as well as their spouses and dependents, with regard to the psychological consequences of such War. Authorizes appropriations. States that all direct or discretionary spending contained in this Act is to be considered emergency expenditures for purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act)."
