Sets forth a formula for apportionment of highway funds for such projects. Specifies: (1) the period of availability of funds apportioned to a State for Interstate System capacity expansion; (2) conditions that must be met in order to use lapsed funds for discretionary projects; and (3) the Federal share (80 percent) of any such expansion projects. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1996."
