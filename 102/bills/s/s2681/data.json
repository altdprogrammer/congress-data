    "text": "Retitles the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988 as the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act and sets forth its provisions. Declares it to be the policy of the United States, in fulfillment of its special responsibilities and legal obligations to the indigenous people of Hawaii, to meet specified health objectives for Native Hawaiians by the year 2000. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to report annually to the Congress on progress made toward meeting these objectives. Makes Papa Ola Lokahi (the Statewide Native Hawaiian health coordinating agency) responsible for: (1) implementation and updating of the Native Hawaiian health care master plan; (2) training for specified health care practitioners, community outreach workers, counselors, and cultural educators; (3) identification of and research into the diseases that are most prevalent among Native Hawaiians; and (4) development of an action plan outlining the contributions that each member organization of Papa Ola Lokahi will make in carrying out this Act. Authorizes appropriations for implementing and updating the Native Hawaiian health care master plan. Permits Papa Ola Lokahi to receive special project funds that may be appropriated for the purpose of research on the health status of Native Hawaiians or for addressing the health care needs of Native Hawaiians. Requires Papa Ola Lokahi to serve as a clearinghouse for: (1) collection and maintenance of data associated with the health status of Native Hawaiians; (2) identification and research into diseases affecting Native Hawaiians; (3) availability of Native Hawaiian project funds, research projects, and publications; (4) collaboration of research in the area of Native Hawaiian health; and (5) dissemination of information pertinent to the Native Hawaiian health care system. Directs Papa Ola Lokahi to: (1) coordinate and assist the health care programs and services provided to Native Hawaiians; and (2) act as a statewide infrastructure to provide technical support and coordination of training and technical assistance to Native Hawaiian health care systems. Makes eligible for grants or contracts for providing health services to Native Hawaiian health care systems (currently, Native Hawaiian health centers or organizations or public or nonprofit private health providers). Limits to five (currently, nine) the number of grant or contract recipients. Revises matching fund requirements for such grants or contracts. Prohibits the awarding of grant or contract funds unless the recipient agrees that the funds will not be expended: (1) for purposes not listed under this Act; (2) to provide inpatient services; (3) to make cash payments to intended recipients of health services; or (4) to purchase or improve real property or to purchase major medical equipment. Authorizes appropriations through FY 2000. Authorizes related grants or contracts for planning Native Hawaiian health care systems on the islands of O'ahu, Moloka'i, Maui, Hawai'i, Lana'i, Kaua'i, and Ni'ithau in the State of Hawaii. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes appropriations through FY 2001 for administrative grants to Papa Ola Lokahi. Sets forth terms and conditions for grants or contracts made under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to assign Department of Health and Human Services to work with Native Hawaiian health care programs. Revises the Native Hawaiian health scholarships program to make scholarship grants available under the same terms as the National Health Service corps, provided that: (1) the types of practitioners for which grants are to be directed shall be based upon the needs of the Native Hawaiian health care systems, as identified by Papa Ola Lokahi; (2) priority shall be given to applicants identified by the Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate; and (3) service obligation shall be met by service in one of the Native Hawaiian health care systems, or in a health care shortage area. Authorizes appropriations through FY 2001. States that such scholarship program shall not be administered by or through the Indian Health Service. Requires the President to submit to the Congress an annual report on the progress made in meeting the objectives of this Act. Repeals a specified demonstration program authorized under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act."
