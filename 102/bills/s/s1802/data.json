Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to pay amounts to persons certified by the Secretary of State. Prohibits the Secretary of State from certifying any claim if the MV Iver Chaser was used for military or security operations by the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua. Limits the total amount of certified claims. Permits the filing of claims within the one-year period beginning on this Act's enactment date. Makes it unlawful for an amount that exceeds ten percent of the amount paid to a person under this Act to be paid to any agent or attorney for any service rendered in connection with the benefits provided by this Act. Prescribes fines for such violations."
