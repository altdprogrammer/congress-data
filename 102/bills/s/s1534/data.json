Directs the Administrator of the Agency for International Development (AID) to establish within AID a bureau for capital projects for developing nations and Eastern European countries. Establishes a tied aid credit program to authorize the President to use specified funds to leverage financing for capital projects in advanced developing countries and Eastern Europe. Establishes the Capital Projects Interagency Board.
