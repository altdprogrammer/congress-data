Requires that, after FY 1994, at least 50 percent of the amounts appropriated for such grants be awarded to institutions which meet requirements regarding the percentage of their graduates practicing in such communities. Mandates grants to health professions institutions to expand training programs targeted at individuals desiring to serve the needs of such communities. Authorizes appropriations. Mandates grants to regional consortia (comprised of at least one medical school and at least one health professions school that is not a medical school) to enhance and expand coordination among various health professions programs, particularly in medically underserved rural areas. Authorizes appropriations."
