    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1992-09-16", 
    "text": "Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal judicial code to reauthorize the independent counsel law (the Act) for an additional five years. Directs: (1) the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (Administrative Office) to provide administrative support and guidance to each independent counsel; and (2) the General Services Administration to provide office space within a Federal building for each independent counsel. Requires an independent counsel: (1) to conduct all activities with due regard for expense, to authorize only reasonable expenditures, and (promptly upon taking office) to assign to a specific employee the duty to ensure expenditures are made in accordance with such principles; and (2) to comply with the established policies of the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding expenditures of funds to conduct investigations and prosecutions, except where such compliance would violate the purposes of the Act. Prohibits an independent counsel and persons appointed under the Act from being entitled to the payment of travel and subsistence expenses with respect to duties performed in the District of Columbia (DC) after one year of service, without being approved by the Administrative Office as in the public interest to carry out the purposes of the Act. Grants DOJ and the Office of Government Ethics authority to enforce compliance of provisions of the Act regarding standards of conduct applicable to independent counsel, persons serving in the office of an independent counsel, and their law firms. Requires that: (1) employees of an independent counsel be paid salaries at levels not to exceed those paid for comparable positions in the Office of U.S. Attorney for DC; and (2) an independent counsel, except where inconsistent with the purposes of the Act (currently, except where not possible), comply with the written or other established policies of DOJ respecting criminal law enforcement. Directs an independent counsel to report annually to the Congress on activities, including a description of the progress of any investigation or prosecution. Specifies that such report may omit any confidential matter, but shall provide information adequate to justify expenditures. Specifies that, if the Attorney General has not made a request to terminate an office of independent counsel, the division of the court shall determine on its own motion whether termination is appropriate no later than every three years after appointment of the counsel. Authorizes the Attorney General, when it is in the public interest, to conduct a preliminary investigation upon the receipt of information sufficient to constitute grounds to investigate whether a Member of Congress may have violated any Federal criminal law."
