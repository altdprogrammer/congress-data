Directs the Secretary to establish a compensation fund for beef producers who sold beef during the period of March 31, 1986, through April 11, 1986, when prices were temporarily lowered. Transfers unused funds to the Department of State for migration and refugee assistance. Terminates program authority on December 31, 1991. Increases milk price support levels. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of dairy cow and heifer export programs."
