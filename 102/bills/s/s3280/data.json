    "text": "National Health Safety Net Infrastructure Act - Title I: Capital Financing Assistance for Safety Net Hospitals Providing Indigent Care - Amends the Social Security Act (SSA) to add a new title XXI, Capital Financing Assistance for Safety Net Hospitals. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make payments for capital financing assistance to eligible hospitals with approved applications. Sets forth general eligibility requirements for such assistance, including requirements that hospitals receive disproportionate share adjustments under Medicare (SSA title XVIII) and be owned or operated by a State or local government in order to be eligible for such assistance. Details application requirements and criteria for application approval. Imposes certain public service responsibilities on hospitals accepting capital financing assistance. Creates in the Treasury the Health Safety Net Infrastructure Trust Fund (Fund). Establishes a loan guarantee program under which the Trust Fund will provide a Federal guarantee of loan repayment to non-Federal lenders making loans to qualified hospitals for hospital replacement, modernization, and renovation projects. Sets forth eligibility criteria hospitals must meet in order to qualify for loan guarantees. Gives a preference for loan guarantees to certain projects in which State or local government entities participate. Sets forth special rules with respect to loan guarantees, including rules: (1) requiring at least 20 percent of the dollar value of loan guarantees to be allocated to eligible rural hospitals; (2) requiring at least $200 million of the annual dollar value of loan guarantees to be reserved for loans of under $50 million, if there are a sufficient number of applicants for loans of that size; and (3) allowing loan guarantees to be allocated for refinancing loans. Provides that hospitals will be charged a reasonable loan insurance premium. Sets forth procedures to be followed in the event of a loan default. Establishes an interest rate subsidy program that provides a partial Federal subsidy of debt service payment where State or local entities demonstrate a significant commitment to financing hospital replacement, modernization, and renovation projects by undertaking the issuance of bonds. Requires a hospital to receive assistance from non-Federal sources at least equal to the assistance received under such program in order to obtain an interest rate subsidy. Sets forth special rules with respect to interest rate subsidies, including rules: (1) reserving for rural hospitals at least 20 percent of the total value of all interest subsidies awarded in any given year; and (2) limiting the aggregate value of interest subsidies made to hospitals in any State in a given year. Requires the Secretary to provide direct matching loans to qualified hospitals unable otherwise to obtain essential financing. Sets forth special rules with respect to direct matching loans, including rules concerning the use of loans for refinancing. Requires the Secretary to make direct grants to qualified hospitals with urgent capital needs. Provides that direct grants shall be available to eligible hospitals for three types of projects: (1) emergency certification and licensure grants would be available to eligible hospitals that are threatened with closure or loss of accreditation or certification of a facility or of essential services as a result of life or safety code violations or similar facility or equipment failures; (2) emergency grants would be available for capital renovation, expansion, or replacement necessary to the maintenance or expansion of essential safety and health services; and (3) planning grants would be available to qualified hospitals which require pre-approval assistance to meet regulatory requirements related to management and finance in order to apply for loans, loan guarantees, and interest subsidies under this Act. Gives priority for direct grants to financially distressed hospitals. Sets forth special rules with respect to grants for capital expenditures and planning grants. Provides for adjustments to payments for capital-related costs under Medicare to take into account the extent to which capital-related costs incurred by a hospital are costs with respect to which the hospital received financial assistance under SSA title XXI. Title II: Amendment of the Tariff Act of 1930 - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require unobligated amounts remaining in the Customs Forfeiture Fund to be deposited in the Health Safety Net Infrastructure Trust Fund."
