Requires such awards to be on a competitive basis. Gives preference to States with demonstrated ability in computer-based technology education. Requires site selection and project implementation within nine months after funds are appropriated. Requires such projects to: (1) be provided in a continuous three-year form to two consecutive groups of sixth, seventh, and eighth graders; (2) be conducted in not more than seven public schools within the State; and (3) ensure each student in such classes participates and has access to a computer at school during the school year and at home during the school year and summer. Sets forth application requirements. Sets the Federal share at 50 percent of project costs. Requires the use of grant funds to provide: (1) hardware and software components to all sites; (2) training for classroom teachers as well as parents; and (3) a staff of administrators and technical personnel. Requires the Secretary to evaluate such demonstration program and report to the Congress. Authorizes appropriations."
