    "text": "Federal Technology Strategy Act of 1991 - Amends the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 to direct the President to develop Federal technology development plans for specified areas of technology and identify national needs in those areas. Requires that the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy serve as the lead Federal official for preparation of the plans. Designates the Department of Commerce as the lead civilian agency and the Department of Defense as the lead defense agency. Requires that the Director review the budget of each department and agency, in the context of the plans, before submission. Requires that the Director summarize Federal funding proposed for each of the critical technologies or groups of technologies identified in the most recent biennial critical technologies report. Requires Federal agencies, as appropriate, to support: (1) industry-led projects to develop new generic enabling technologies; and (2) collaboration with State and industry to accelerate commercialization and use of new advanced technologies. Requires each Federal research and development agency to provide funds to support activities under the Advanced Technology Program. Prohibits Federal departments and agencies and any organization in the United States which receives Federal research and development funding from participating in or assisting any technology development project that is operated by or receives funds from a foreign government with which the U.S. Government has a science and technology agreement unless the participation is approved in advance by the Director or the Secretary of Commerce. Authorizes banning violators from receiving Federal research assistance for two years. Requires, when such approval has been obtained, that any Federal department or agency channel funding through U.S.-based joint research and development ventures. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to report to the Congress on actions that can be taken by private industry, the States, and the Federal Government to increase private investment in: (1) the development and production of new commercial technologies; and (2) the use and application of advanced manufacturing and process technologies."
