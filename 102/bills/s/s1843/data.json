    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-10-22", 
    "text": "Clean Water Enforcement and Compliance Improvement Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require any person subject to the requirements of such Act (currently, owners or operators of point sources) to maintain records, make reports, submit to inspections, and allow access to information to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with respect to carrying out such Act. Provides for the imposition of civil, criminal, or administrative penalties for violations of requirements of pretreatment programs. Repeals a provision that treats a single operational upset that leads to simultaneous violations of more than one pollution parameter as a single violation. Raises the maximum amount of class II administrative penalties permitted to be assessed for violations. Authorizes courts to order civil penalties to be used for mitigation projects. States that civil penalties must be in an amount that is no less than the amount of the economic benefit or savings resulting from the violation plus interest accruing from the date of violation. Sets forth minimum civil penalties for discharges of pollutants (including hazardous pollutants) from point sources exceeding effluent limitations and from persons determined to be significant noncompliers. Requires the EPA Administrator to: (1) conduct inspections of facilities operated by significant noncompliers at which violations occurred; and (2) report annually to the Congress and to State Governors on persons classified as significant noncompliers. Prohibits the amount of civil penalties for discharges from sources exceeding effluent limitations from being compromised. Requires certain civil penalties to be adjusted for inflation. Adds to the list of requirements for State pollutant discharge permit programs that such programs ensure that the State will grant publicly owned treatment works the authority and responsibility to conduct inspections and to assess and collect civil and administrative penalties. Sets forth inspection and discharge reporting requirements. Authorizes the Administrator to renew expired State discharge permits under certain conditions. Makes the issuance of permits modifying certain effluent limitations for toxic pollutants subject to certain public hearing requirements."
