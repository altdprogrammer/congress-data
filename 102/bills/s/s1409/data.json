    "text": "Civil Rights and Remedies Act of 1991 - Amends Federal law to allow compensatory and punitive damages for intentional employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or disability, subject to certain exceptions, including when: (1) the complaining party may recover under provisions of Federal law relating to equal rights under the law; or (2) the covered entity, in a disability discrimination case, demonstrates good faith efforts to make a reasonable accommodation that would provide an equally effective opportunity and would not cause an undue hardship on the operation of the business. Allows such punitive damages under these provisions where there is malice or reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual. Prohibits compensatory damages under these provisions for back pay, interest on back pay, or any other type of relief authorized under specified provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 relating to injunctions, affirmative action, or other equitable relief. Limits to specified dollar amounts, varying depending on the number of employees employed by an employer, the sum of compensatory (for specified types of losses) and punitive damages. Allows any party to demand a jury trial if the complaining party seeks compensatory or punitive damages. Prohibits the court from informing the jury of the dollar amount limitations. Allows the awarding of attorney's fees in connection with an action or proceeding to enforce the damages provisions of this Act. Declares that: (1) the rights and protections under the amendment made by this Act shall apply with respect to any employee in an employment position in the Senate and any employing authority of the Senate, with enforcement and adjudication within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Senate; and (2) provisions of this Act setting forth related requirements and procedures are enacted by the Senate as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and may be changed as any other rule of the Senate. Declares that: (1) the rights and protections under the amendment made by this Act shall apply with respect to any employee in an employment position in the House of Representatives and any employing authority of the House, with remedies and procedures as described in a specified House Resolution; and (2) the provisions of this Act relating to such Resolution are enacted by the House as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House and may be changed as any other rule of the House. Declares that the rights and protections under the amendment made by this Act shall apply with respect to any employee in an employment position in an instrumentality of the Congress and any chief official of such instrumentality, with the chief official establishing the remedies and procedures to be used. Defines instrumentalities of the Congress to include the Architect of the Capitol, the Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting Office, the Government Printing Office, the Office of Technology Assessment, and the United States Botanic Garden."
