    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1991-11-07", 
    "text": "Telephone Advertising Consumer Rights Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit any person within the United States from: (1) making any unsolicited telephone solicitation in violation of regulations prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) pursuant to this Act; (2) sending an unsolicited advertisement by a facsimile (fax) machine; and (3) using an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice to make a call to any emergency telephone line or pager, to the telephone line of any patient room of a hospital, health care facility, elderly home, or similar establishment, or to any telephone number assigned to a paging service, cellular telephone service, specialized mobile radio service, or radio common carrier service, or any other service for which the called party is charged for the call. Directs the FCC to: (1) initiate a rulemaking proceeding concerning the need to protect residential telephone subscribers' privacy rights and to compare and evaluate alternative methods and procedures for protecting such rights; and (2) implement the most cost-effective methods and procedures for protecting such rights. Makes it unlawful for any person within the United States to: (1) initiate any communication using a fax machine or an automatic telephone dialing system that does not comply with technical and procedural standards prescribed by this Act or to use such devices to make any solicitation that does not comply with such standards; or (2) use a computer or other electronic device to send any message via fax machine unless such person clearly marks on the document the date and time it is sent and identifies the entity sending the message and the telephone number of the sending machine or entity. Requires the FCC to: (1) revise the regulations setting technical and procedural standards for fax machines to require any fax machine manufactured six months after the enactment of this Act that can be used for the distribution of unsolicited advertising to clearly mark on the document the date and time it is sent and identify the entity sending the message and the telephone number of the sending machine or entity. (Exempts for 18 months fax machines that do not have the capacity for automatic dialing and transmission and that are not capable of operation through an interface with a computer.) Directs the FCC to prescribe technical and procedural standards for systems transmitting any artificial or prerecorded voice message via telephone that require: (1) all artificial or prerecorded voice messages to clearly state the identity and telephone number or address of the business or other entity initiating the call; and (2) such systems to automatically release the called party's line within five seconds of the time the party has hung up. Authorizes persons who have received more than one telephone call from the same entity or the delivery of the same or a similar message in violation of this Act to bring a private right of action to enjoin such calls and recover monetary damages. Permits States to bring such actions when there is reason to believe that a person is engaging in calls that violate this Act. Grants U.S. district courts exclusive jurisdiction over all civil actions brought under this Act. Prohibits a State, whenever the FCC has instituted a civil action for violation of this Act, from bringing an action against any defendant named in the FCC's complaint."
