Requires the Director to: (1) conduct a review of past incidents of contamination; (2) evaluate current statutory, regulatory and voluntary safeguards; (3) compile a review of the previous research; (4) identify the role of Federal and State agencies' in responding to home contamination incidents; (5) submit a report to congressional committees and a Task Force; and (6) study and report on firefighters' special circumstances. Requires the Director to establish the Workers' Family Protection Task Force to: (1) review the Director's report; (2) determine if additional data and evaluation of scientific issues are needed; and (3) develop a recommended investigative strategy to obtain such information. Sets forth requirements relating to such proposed strategy's content, peer review, public comment, and development implementation of a final strategy for investigation of issues related to home contamination. Directs the Secretary of Labor, based on information developed under such strategy and other available information, to: (1) determine if additional education about, emphasis on, or enforcement of existing regulations or standards is needed and will be sufficient, or if additional regulations or standards are needed to protect workers and their families from employee transported releases of hazardous materials; (2) report to appropriate congressional committees; and (3) promulgate any additional necessary regulations or standards.
