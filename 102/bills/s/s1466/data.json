Requires cost analysis estimates of congressional legislation to include direct and indirect costs. Establishes a Congressional Budget Office Board to: (1) provide general oversight of Office operations; (2) approve in advance the undertaking of any studies and reports in addition to those required by law; and (3) provide general guidance to the Director in the formulation and implementation of procedures and policies. Directs the Office to establish an Economic Advisory Council to: (1) review and make recommendations to the Board on Office activities; (2) evaluate the quality and objectivity of Office research and reports; and (3) undertake additional tasks as the Board may direct.
