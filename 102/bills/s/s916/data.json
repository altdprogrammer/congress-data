Prohibits the Secretary from taking such actions regarding either type of office located at an airport without first conducting an air safety appraisal and certifying that the action will not result in a decrease in aircraft safety. Prohibits the Secretary from taking such actions regarding any National Weather Service Office which is the only office in a State without first evaluating the effect on weather services to in-State users and certifying that a comparable level of weather services will remain."
