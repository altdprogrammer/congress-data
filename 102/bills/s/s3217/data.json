    "text": "Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate certain segments of the Great Egg Harbor River and its tributaries in New Jersey as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to manage the designated segments and tributaries in consultation with the political jurisdictions through which the river and its tributaries pass through cooperative agreements, except that publicly-owned lands shall continue to be managed by the agency charged with the management of such lands. Deems local river management plans, if they meet protection standards, to be local zoning ordinances for purposes of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, thus restricting Federal acquisition authority granted by such Act. Requires: (1) the Secretary to review the local river management plans; and (2) an informal advisory group, comprised of representatives of political subdivisions of the State in the area of the Great Egg Harbor River and its tributaries and representatives of the State, to ensure that the proper implementation of the local river management plans will protect the values for which the river and its tributaries were designated. Authorizes the Secretary to provide, on request, planning assistance to political subdivisions of the State and to enter into a memorandum of understanding or a cooperative agreement with another Federal agency or with the State to ensure that Federal and State programs are carried out in a manner that is consistent with the local river management plans. Directs the Secretary to biennially review compliance with the local river management plans and to report to specified congressional committees on any deviation from those plans which causes or may result in any diminution of the values for which the segment concerned was designated. Requires the Secretary to report to such committees on alternatives to address issues to ensure protection of the segment concerned if issues related to river protection are not resolved by existing State and local or other Federal mechanisms. Authorizes appropriations"
