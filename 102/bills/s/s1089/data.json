    "text": "Metropolitan Washington, District of Columbia, Waste Management Study Act - Prohibits the expansion of the I-95 Sanitary Landfill, Lorton, Virginia, on lands owned by the U.S. Government unless: (1) an environmental impact statement regarding such expansion has been completed and approved by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; and (2) the costs incurred in completing such statement are paid from the landfill's enterprise fund or pursuant to a payment formula based on jurisdictional usage of the landfill. Requires the Administrator to establish a Metropolitan Area Regional Waste Management Authority Task Force to study the feasibility and desirability of establishing a regional waste management authority for the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Administrator of General Services to conduct a study to determine the feasibility and desirability of establishing a centrally administered solid waste management program for all General Services or Department of Defense facilities in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Requires the study to examine whether cost savings from current practices can be realized through the consolidation of Federal facility waste management programs in such area through the use of a General Services Administration unit for collection and disposal of waste and recovery of recyclable materials."
