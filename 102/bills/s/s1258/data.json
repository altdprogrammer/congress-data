    "text": "Security Officer Employment Standards Act of 1991 - Directs the Administrator of the General Services Administrator (GSA) to issue regulations to establish standards for the hiring of Federal and private security officers for employment under Federal contract to ensure that such officers are screened and trained in a manner similar to that required of other public law enforcement personnel. Outlines screening and basic training requirements to be established under such GSA regulations, including those mandating criminal background checks and first aid training. Requires completion of periodic refresher courses after basic training. Authorizes the GSA Administrator to establish a grant program to assist States in establishing a regulatory scheme which, at a minimum, incorporates GSA's hiring standards discussed above for non-Federal employers to use in hiring security officers. Requires States receiving grants to establish penalties for employers who do not abide by State hiring standards for security officers. Authorizes appropriations."
