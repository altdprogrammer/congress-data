    "text": "Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act - Authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to acquire the Elwha River and Glines Canyon Hydroelectric Projects in Clallam County, Washington. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on the plans for the full restoration of the Elwha River ecosystem and the native anadromous fisheries. Authorizes the owners of the Projects to tender title to the Projects to the United States upon payment of a specified sum. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to take actions necessary to implement: (1) the Elwha River ecosystem and fisheries restoration plan; (2) management of lands acquired pursuant to this Act which are located outside the exterior boundaries of the Olympic National Park (Glines Project lands are located within and without the boundaries of the Park); and (3) protection of the existing quality and availability of water from the River for municipal and industrial uses from adverse impacts of dam removal, breach, or bypass. Provides for the continuance of existing licenses or authorizations for the Projects until the Secretary has acquired title or has certified to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that the owner has refused to tender title. Directs the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration, following acquisition of the Projects, to deliver all project replacement power required by the operating facilities of the local industrial consumer through the local preference customer at a rate equal to the priority firm rate. Requires the Secretary to operate the Projects in accordance with the restoration plan and authorizes the reduction of electric power production to achieve restoration purposes. Requires the Secretary, if the Plan provides for removal, breach, or bypass of the Projects, to take actions to protect the continued availability of existing water quality for the city of Port Angeles, Dry Creek Water Association, and the industrial users of Elwha River water against adverse impacts. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to lease certain lands located on Ediz Hook in Clallam County to the city of Port Angeles and to the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe (for the construction of a tribal cultural facility). Authorizes and directs the Secretary to acquire and hold in trust reservation status for the Tribe certain lands in Clallam County for housing, economic development, and morrage for the tribal commercial fishing fleet. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
