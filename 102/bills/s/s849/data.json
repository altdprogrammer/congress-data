Exempts from such list chemicals used for purposes of cleaning, sanitizing, disinfecting, or painting or in construction or renovation. Makes listed chemicals subject to this Act's requirements. Provides for the periodic review and modification of the list. Requires commercial applicators, prior to the application of a covered substance, to enter into a written contract with the site owner. Provides that the contract shall specify the exact location of the application, the date of the application, the number of applications, and the total cost for the service provided. Requires copies of the contract to be made available to the site owner and to all occupants of the site. Prescribes civil or criminal penalties for making false representations that a covered substance has been approved by the EPA. Directs applicators to give notice to site owners and occupants if the dates of application are changed. Requires commercial applicators, prior to the application of a covered substance to or on the grounds of: (1) a daycare facility, preschool, or elementary or secondary school, to provide written notice to the parent or guardian of each child enrolled in the school; and (2) any post-secondary school, to notify all students enrolled in the school. Directs commercial applicators to affix posted notices along the perimeter of sites where covered substances are to be applied. Requires notices to be in place at least 72 hours prior to the application and to remain in place for at least 72 hours after the application."
