States that evidence obtained pursuant to and within the scope of a warrant constitutes prima facie evidence of such a reasonable belief (unless the warrant was obtained through intentional and material misrepresentation). States that, except as provided by statute or a rule of procedure, evidence which is otherwise admissible shall not be excluded on the ground that the evidence was obtained in violation of a law, rule, or regulation."
