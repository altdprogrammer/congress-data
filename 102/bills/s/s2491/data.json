Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States, substate grantees, employers, employer associations, and employee representatives to: (1) provide training, adjustment assistance, and employment service to such eligible individuals; and (2) make needs-related payments for completion of such training or education programs to such individuals if they do not qualify or have ceased to qualify for unemployment compensation, are enrolled and participating in such training, and have a total family income (exclusive of unemployment, child support, and welfare benefits) not in excess of the lower living standard income level. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Comptroller General to identify, assess, and report to the Congress on the effects on employment that are attributable to compliance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973."
