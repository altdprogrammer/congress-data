Directs the Secretary to prescribe the criteria for such awards, including: (1) whether U.S. scientists, engineers, and managers of defense and Department of Energy laboratories are permitted to participate in activities of such institutions or organizations at a level that is beneficial to the development and application of defense critical technologies by such laboratories; (2) whether such activities include the placement of U.S. scientists, engineers, and managers in Japanese government and industry laboratories; and (3) whether an appropriate share of the costs of such activities will be paid from non-Federal sources.
