    "text": "Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act - Title I: Food Stamp Program - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to permit related adults living in the same household to apply for separate food stamp program (program) benefits under specified conditions. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to adjust the basic benefit level upwards by specified increments at the begining of each fiscal year until it reaches 105 percent of the cost of the thrifty food plan. Excludes from consideration as program income: (1) child support payments to non-household members; and (2) the first $50 a month received as child support. Removes the excess shelter deduction cap for program eligibility purposes. Permits a participating family made up of, or including, an elderly or disabled member to own $3,000 in allowable financial resources. (Current law refers to a family member 60 years of age or older.) Increases annually the fair market value limit of vehicles that program recipients may own. Excludes third party payments for transitional housing for the homeless from consideration as program income. Directs the Secretary, and authorizes States, to conduct pilot projects to improve rural program participation. Authorizes grants for projects to improve homeless program participation. Title II: Nutrition Programs - Amends the National School Lunch Act to permit schools to offer fluid milk in any form as part of a school lunch. (Current law permits only whole or unflavored lowfat milk to be offered.) Expands child and adult care food program participation to include private residential day care centers that serve more than 25 percent low-income children. Permits schools to receive meal supplement (snack) reimbursements for after-hours child care. Establishes minimum funding amounts for each of FY 1992 through 1994 for assistance to homeless preschool children (in addition to amounts made available under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966). Title III: Effective Dates - Sets forth the effective dates for provisions of this Act."
