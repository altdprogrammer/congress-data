    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-01-14", 
    "text": "Title I: Wilderness Additions - Designates specified lands in California as additions to the National Wilderness Preservation System.

Designates certain lands within the CDCA as the White Mountains Wilderness Study Area. Permits wilderness area livestock grazing on lands where such practice existed prior to enactment of this Act. Reserves Federal water rights on wilderness area lands. Title II: Death Valley National Park - Establishes the Death Valley National Park which subsumes the Death Valley National Monument. Withdraws the additional lands from further exploitation under the mining laws. Requires the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to determine the validity of any unpatented mining claims within such additional lands and whether the United States should acquire any mineral rights in such lands. Title III: Joshua Tree National Park - Establishes the Joshua Tree National Park which subsumes the Joshua Tree National Monument. Withdraws the additional lands from further exploitation under the mining laws. Requires the Secretary to determine the validity of any unpatented mining claims within such additional lands and whether the United States should acquire any mineral rights in such lands. Title IV: Mojave National Park - Establishes the Mojave National Park which subsumes the East Mojave National Scenic Area. Withdraws Federal lands within the Park from further exploitation under the mining laws. Requires the Secretary to determine the validity of any unpatented mining claims within the Park and whether the United States should acquire any mineral rights in such lands. Authorizes the Secretary to regulate mining in such Park. Allows grazing only to the extent allowed in current permits. Continues the validity of existing rights-of-way for specified activities. Directs the Secretary to prepare a Park management plan. Designates the Granite Mountains Natural Reserve within the Park. Authorizes the Secretary to construct a visitors' center and acquire lands. Authorizes appropriations. Title V: National Park Wilderness - Designates as wilderness the Death Valley National Park Wilderness, the Joshua Tree National Park Wilderness Additions, and the Mojave National Park Wilderness. Title VI: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Secretary to transfer Red Rock Canyon State Park Additions in the CDCA to California. Establishes the Desert Lily Sanctuary within the CDCA. Establishes the Indian Canyons National Historic Site, which shall be cooperatively managed by the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians. Authorizes the Secretary to exchange Federal mineral interests in lands in California for private mineral interests in wilderness areas and national parks designated by this Act. Directs the Secretary to insure nonexclusive access to such wilderness areas and parks by Indian people for traditional cultural and religious purposes. Preserves existing rights of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Title VII: Military Activities - Provides that nothing in this Act shall preclude, limit, or otherwise affect low level overflights of military aircraft in the California desert in the same location and degree as existed prior to enactment of this Act. Withdraws from appropriation under the public land laws and reserves for military use by the Secretary of the Navy specified lands in California known as the China Lake Naval Weapons Center in Inyo, Kern, and San Bernardino Counties and Chocolate Mountain in Imperial and Riverside Counties. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to manage such lands' nonmilitary uses, subject to closure by the Secretary of the Navy for security or safety purposes. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to develop a management plan for such lands. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to prevent and suppress brush and range fires with reimbursable assistance from the Bureau of Land Management. Requires the Secretaries to enter into a memorandum of understanding concerning the management plan which includes the provision of fire control assistance upon request. Requires the Secretary of Defense to notify the Secretary of the Interior whenever withdrawn lands are being used for defense-related purposes other than those specified, including the effect of such different use. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to delegate management responsibilities for China Lake to the Secretary of the Navy. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to report annually to the Secretary of the Interior, who shall then report to the appropriate congressional committees on the status of natural and cultural resources on such withdrawn lands. Terminates land withdrawals under this Act 15 years after this Act's enactment. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to publish a draft environmental impact statement on the continued or renewed withdrawal of lands under this Act. Requires such Secretary to hold a public hearing in California before the withdrawal's termination. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to maintain a decontamination program for such lands during their withdrawal. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on decontamination efforts. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to notify the Secretary of the Interior, at least three years before the termination of the withdrawal, whether an extension is going to be requested and, if not, to what extent such lands are contaminated with hazardous materials. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to decontaminate relinquished lands, but if such decontamination is not practicable or economically feasible, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to refuse to accept such lands. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to then: (1) warn the public of risks of entry; (2) conduct only decontamination activities on such lands after the expiration of the withdrawal; and (3) report to the Secretary of the Interior and the Congress on the status of such lands. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to publish the acceptance of withdrawn lands, indicating when such lands will be open and under what conditions. Exempts the United States from liability for injuries or damages resulting from nonmilitary activity on withdrawn lands. Authorizes an extension of the Navy's use of the El Centro Ranges in Imperial County, California, through January 1, 1990, subject to resource protection requirements."
