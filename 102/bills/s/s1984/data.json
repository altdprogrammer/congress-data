Restricts such withdrawals to individuals whose adjusted gross income for 1991 does not exceed: (1) $100,000 in the case of married individuals filing a joint return; (2) $50,000 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return; and (3) $75,000 in the case of any other taxpayer. Limits the aggregate amount which may be treated as qualified withdrawals with respect to all plans of an individual to $10,000. Requires the inclusion of withdrawn amounts in gross income ratably over a four-year period. Provides for one-year extensions of the following: (1) rules governing the allocation of research and experimental expenditures; (2) the low-income housing credit; (3) the authority to issue mortgage revenue bonds and mortgage credit certificates; and (4) the targeted jobs credit."
