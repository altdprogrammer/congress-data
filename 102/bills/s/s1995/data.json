    "text": "Health Care Access and Affordability Act of 1991 - Title I: Access to Primary and Preventive Care - Amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize appropriations through FY 1996 for the following programs: (1) immunization programs; (2) tuberculosis prevention grants; (3) lead poisoning prevention; (4) prevention and control of sexually transmitted diseases; (5) migrant health centers; (6) community health centers; (7) health care services for the homeless; (8) substance abuse prevention program; (9) family planning project grants; (10) breast and cervical cancer prevention; (11) preventive health and health services block grant; and (12) HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) early intervention. Amends the Social Security Act to reauthorize appropriations for maternal and child health services block grants through FY 1997. Title II: Cost Containment - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to establish and implement a program for the conduct of clinical trials with respect to promising new drugs and disease treatments. Requires the Director to give priority to treatments targeted towards diseases determined: (1) to be the most costly to treat; (2) to have the highest mortality; or (3) to affect the greatest number of individuals. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1997. Extends through FY 1996 authorized appropriations for: (1) drug abuse demonstration projects of national significance; and (2) the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use excess appropriations over FY 1992 amounts to expand research to determine the most cost-effective methods of health care and for developing and disseminating new practice guidelines related to such methods. Requires that priority be given to diseases and disorders determined to be the most costly to the United States and that evidence a wide variation in current medical practice. Directs the Secretary, after considering the recommendations of the Health Care Cost Control Advisory Committee, to report to appropriate congressional committees on the establishment of national spending targets for health care and health care services. Establishes the Health Care Cost Control Advisory Committee."
