    "text": "Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal Act - Withdraws specified lands in the State of New Mexico from all forms of entry, appropriation, and disposal under the public land laws (including mineral and geothermal leasing, material sale, and mining laws). Transfers jurisdiction over the withdrawn lands to the Secretary of Energy (Secretary). Reserves their use by the Secretary for authorized activities associated with Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) project purposes set forth in the Department of Energy National Security and Military Applications of Nuclear Energy Authorization Act of 1980. Revokes specified public land orders made inconsistent by this Act. Confers management responsibility upon the Secretary for such lands' withdrawal, and directs the Secretary to: (1) consult with the Secretary of the Interior and the State of New Mexico in discharging such responsibility; and (2) develop and submit to the Congress and the State of New Mexico a management plan for the use of withdrawn lands until the end of the decommissioning phase. Gives WIPP-related uses of the withdrawn lands priority over non-WIPP-related uses. Prescribes guidelines for grazing, hunting and trapping, disposal of salt tailings, and oil and gas production. Proscribes any form of mining (including slant drilling from outside boundaries) on any withdrawn lands. Authorizes the Secretary to close withdrawn lands to the public for health and safety or common defense and security reasons. Requires the Secretary to prepare and submit to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for review a plan for: (1) conducting test phase activities at WIPP to demonstrate compliance with applicable disposal requirements; and (2) removing transuranic waste emplaced at WIPP during such testing should removal of such waste be required. Conditions plan approval by the EPA Administrator upon the meeting of specified standards. Sets forth requirements and limitations with respect to test phase activities at WIPP. Requires the Secretary to study remote-handled transuranic waste and its impact upon WIPP performance assessment. Requires the Secretary to publish biennially a performance assessment report on WIPP's performance during such testing. Requires such report to be provided to the State of New Mexico, the EPA Administrator, the National Academy of Sciences, and the WIPP Environmental Evaluation Group (EEG) for their review and comment. Sets forth requirements and limitations with respect to transuranic waste disposal operations at WIPP. Provides for the reinstatement of certain EPA disposal regulations. Requires the EPA Administrator to issue final disposal regulations and final criteria for the Administrator's certification of compliance with such regulations after the enactment of this Act. Requires the Secretary to comply at WIPP with such final disposal regulations within a specified period after WIPP's first receipt of transuranic waste. Requires the following if the EPA Administrator does not certify the WIPP facility's compliance with such regulations: (1) removal of transuranic waste emplaced underground at WIPP and the decommissioning of WIPP; and (2) termination of the land withdrawal. Provides for periodic recertification of WIPP compliance with such final disposal regulations until WIPP has been decommissioned. Requires the Secretary to use both engineered and natural barriers and waste form modifications at WIPP to isolate transuranic waste after disposal to the extent necessary to comply with final disposal regulations. Requires the Secretary to: (1) comply with all applicable environmental protection laws and regulations and public health and safety laws with respect to WIPP; and (2) submit biennially to the EPA Administrator and the State of New Mexico documentation of continued compliance with their regulatory requirements. Sets forth requirements with respect to the retrievability of transuranic waste emplaced underground at WIPP. Requires periodic inspections of WIPP by the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Requires the Administration to provide the results of its inspections to the Secretary for appropriate action. Requires the Bureau of Mines to prepare an annual evaluation of the safety of WIPP. Prohibits the Secretary from transporting high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel to WIPP or to emplace or dispose of such waste or fuel at WIPP.
