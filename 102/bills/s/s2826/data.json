Prohibits: (1) the United States from returning a national or habitual resident of a country who is outside the territorial boundaries of the United States or within the territorial waters of his or her country of residence or nationality to the territorial boundaries of such country; and (2) the expenditure of funds with respect to any such return unless the U.S. Government has determined that such an individual is not, due to a well-founded fear of persecution about returning to his or her country, a refugee under the Convention. Makes this Act inapplicable to an individual if: (1) such individual participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; (2) there are serious reasons for considering that the individual has committed a serious nonpolitical crime; or (3) there are reasonable grounds for regarding the individual as a danger to U.S. security. Provides that this Act does not apply to nationals and habitual residents of a country at U.S. diplomatic and consular missions in that country."
