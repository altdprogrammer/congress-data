    "text": "Indian Federal Recognition Administrative Procedures Act of 1991 - Establishes the Commission on Indian Recognition to process petitions from Indian tribes for Federal recognition. Authorizes any Indian group that is indigenous to petition the Commission for such recognition. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Commission all petitions pending before the Department that request the Secretary or the Federal Government to recognize or acknowledge an Indian group as an Indian tribe. Rescinds the authority of the Secretary and the Department to grant Federal recognition. Establishes guidelines for submitting such petitions. Directs the Commission to: (1) send an acknowledgement of receipt to the petitioner; and (2) publish a notice of receipt and a notice of opportunity for other parties to submit arguments in support of, or in opposition to, a petition. Provides the petitioner with an opportunity to respond to such submissions prior to a determination on a petition by the Commission. Sets forth review and appeal procedures. Provides for expedited review for petitions submitted by Indian groups whose relationship with the Federal Government was terminated by law or that were parties to treaties. Makes recognized Indian tribes eligible for Federal services and benefits that are available to other tribes. Directs the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register a current list of recognized Indian tribes receiving Bureau of Indian Affairs services within days of this Act's enactment and annually thereafter. Authorizes any petitioner to bring an action in the U.S. district court for the district in which the petitioner resides, or the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, to enforce the provisions of this Act. Directs the Commission to make available petition format guidelines and to provide advice to petitioners for their historical background and Indian identity research. Authorizes the Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans of the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to enable Indian groups seeking Federal recognition to both conduct and prepare research and documentation necessary to substantiate submit petitions under this Act."
