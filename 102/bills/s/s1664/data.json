Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire: (1) lands, or interests therein, within the boundaries of the park (such lands) by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, exchange, or transfer; and (2) property owned by the State of Michigan or any political subdivision of the State only by donation. Prohibits: (1) such lands from being acquired without the consent of the owner unless the Secretary determines that the land is being developed, or is proposed to be developed, in a manner which is detrimental to the natural, scenic, historic, and other values for which the park is established; and (2) the Secretary from acquiring any lands pursuant to this Act if such lands have become contaminated with hazardous substances. Provides for cooperation by Federal agencies conducting or supporting activities directly affecting the park, subject to specified requirements. Requires the Secretary, within three fiscal years, to prepare and submit to the Congress a general management plan for the park. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into cooperative agreements with owners of property within the park of nationally significant historic or other cultural resources to provide for interpretive exhibits or programs; and (2) provide to any such owner financial and technical assistance to mark, interpret, and restore non-Federal properties within the park as the Secretary determines appropriate, subject to specified requirements. Directs that funds authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for purposes of such financial and technical assistance be expended in the ratio of one dollar of Federal funds for each four dollar of funds contributed by non-Federal sources. Authorizes the Secretary to accept funds from non-Federal sources. Permits donations of land, or interests in land, by the State to be considered as a contribution from non-Federal sources for such purposes. Establishes the Keweenaw National Historical Park Advisory Commission. Sets forth provisions regarding the duties, membership, and administration of the Commission. Authorizes appropriations."
