    "text": "Global Clean Water Incentive Act - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to direct the Secretary of Commerce to implement a schedule of fees that would be: (1) imposed on any product imported into the United States that has been subject to processing, or manufactured from a process, that does not comply with water quality standards prescribed under the Clean Water Act; and (2) in an amount adjusted annually equal to the differential between the cost incurred by businesses located in the United States in meeting such water quality standards and any expenditures made by foreign businesses to reduce water-polluting discharges. Requires the Secretary to make revenues derived from such fees available to fund programs that enhance the export of U.S. products, the costs of which are increased by the Clean Water Act. Directs the U.S. Trade Representative to negotiate an amendment to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that would allow any country to impose additional duties on the importation of products of a foreign country that does not comply with water quality standards comparable to those prescribed under the Clean Water Act."
