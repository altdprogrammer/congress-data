Covers nursing care and home health aide services as home health services if such services are needed less than seven days each week or are needed for up to 38 consecutive days. Covers up to 80 hours of annual in-home respite care furnished to an individual who has incurred expenses equal to a specified Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) cost-sharing limit and, for the preceding three months, has been unable to perform at least two specified daily living activities without the assistance of an uncompensated primary caregiver with whom he or she resides. Covers home intravenous drug therapy services. Increases the Medicare part B premium. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to modify contracts with health maintenance organizations to take into account this Act's amendments."
