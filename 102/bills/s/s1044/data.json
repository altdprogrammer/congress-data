    "text": "Federal Information Resources Management Act - Title I: Information Resources Management of Federal Departments and Agencies - Amends the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (the Act) to require the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to be appointed with attention to the professional credentials required to administer OIRA. Directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to: (1) ensure that OMB gives balanced emphasis to its functions and that the development of information policies shall be coordinated with agencies with shared information management responsibilities; (2) coordinate the development and implementation of information policy through the establishment of interagency working groups; (3) ensure the development of formalized training programs on information resources management concepts by appropriate entities for government wide use; and (4) educate OMB employees on such concepts. Authorizes the Director to inform the President and the Congress of the findings and progress of such projects and activities. Requires Federal agencies to cooperate with such projects and activities. Revises provisions concerning paperwork control functions of the Director that relate to the reduction of Federal information collection request burdens to no longer require the setting of goals for such reduction but to instead require the promoting of the elimination of unnecessary burdens, with particular emphasis on those persons most heavily burdened, especially in the areas of Federal procurement, grant programs, Federal-State cooperative programs, Federal taxation, and international competitiveness. Repeals provisions relating to overseeing action on the recommendations of the Commission on Federal Paperwork. Requires coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to address unnecessary paperwork burdens associated with procurement and acquisition as a paperwork control function. Revises the functions of OMB with respect to statistical policy and privacy. Establishes new functions for OMB with respect to automatic data processing and information dissemination. Directs the Director to establish an interagency working group on statistical policy to coordinate agency statistical activities, headed by the chief statistician and consisting of the heads of agencies with major statistical programs. Requires OMB to provide long-term training in OIRA statistical policy functions to all Federal employees. Directs senior agency officials designated by Federal agency heads to carry out agency responsibilities with respect to information policy coordination to appoint a Chief Information Resources Management official well qualified to assist in agency information needs assessments and in the deployment of appropriate information technology to gather, process, use, and disseminate information that is critical to successful accomplishment of program goals and agency mission or essential for effective agency management. Directs Federal agencies to: (1) establish an agency-wide program of information resources management; (2) develop, implement, and evaluate formalized training programs on such management concepts, and educate program officials about such management; (3) develop information systems, processes, and procedures that enhance the sharing of common data across program and agency lines consistent with law and maximize the usefulness and timely release of Government information to all users within and outside the agency; (4) systematically inventory and maintain current, complete records of agency information resources for use in developing and updating management plans and for informing the public; (5) establish and maintain information dissemination systems that disseminate significant public information maintained in electronic files in useable electronic formats; (6) periodically evaluate and, as needed, improve the timeliness of data and records contained within Federal information systems and the capabilities of such systems for ensuring public access to public information and privacy, confidentiality, and security; (7) develop and annually update the agency's five-year information resources management plan in accordance with OMB guidelines for meeting information and information technology needs; (8) ensure coordination of such plan with the agency's strategic plan, budget, and financial management systems; and (9) implement applicable policies and standards for financial management systems in developing information systems. Restores the Act's five percent paperwork reduction goal for unnecessary paperwork burdens. Directs appropriate agency officials to establish a certification process to review such information before its submission to the Director for approval. Revises current provisions regarding public information collection activities to establish a self-certification process for Federal agencies for currently approved information collection requests. Provides for expedited OMB review of agency information requests with reduced paperwork burdens. Revises provisions establishing the Federal Information Locator System (FELS) to require the Director to: (1) maintain such System; (2) designate one or more Federal agencies to operate such System; (3) ensure that only public information is included in such System; (4) determine the optimal composition of such System in order to accomplish its purposes; (5) report to specified congressional committees on its development and implementation status; and (6) review its effectiveness on an ongoing basis. Requires such System to serve as a comprehensive inventory, as well as the authoritative register, of all information collection requests by the Federal Government and to assist agencies and the public in locating Government information. Includes in the system records maintained on individuals and information collection requirements approved by the Director. Requires the Director, on an ongoing basis, to: (1) review agency audit standards and requirements for all major information systems and assign responsibility for conducting certain government wide or multiagency audits; (2) establish and review a schedule and a management control system to ensure that practices and programs of information handling disciplines are properly integrated with the information policies mandated by this Act; (3) identify initiatives to improve productivity in Federal operations using information processing technology; (4) develop and review a program to enforce Federal information processing standards at all Federal installations and revitalize the standards development program established under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949; and (5) develop and revise annually a five-year plan for information resources management with plans for managing information meeting automatic data processing equipment needs of the Federal Government, and enhancing public access to information collection request information via electronic media. Requires the Director to include in any report to the Congress: (1) a summary of actions with respect to dissemination functions and of the results of selective reviews of agency activities; (2) reports with respect to the Privacy Act of 1974 and matching programs when required by provisions relating to records maintained on individuals; and (3) an evaluation of the feasibility and means of enhancing public access to Government information. Directs the Director to report to the Congress on: (1) the Federal demonstration project in federally sponsored research; (2) the progress of information processing technology initiatives to improve productivity in Federal operations; (3) the results of burden elimination reviews; and (4) the feasibility and means of establishing a comprehensive inventory and register of all information products and services disseminated by the Government. Requires advisory committees on information and statistical policy for the Director to consult with others in developing such policies. Authorizes appropriations to OIRA. Title II: Review of Federal Departments and Agency Regulations- Outlines guidelines for OIRA review of agency rulemaking. Title III: Management of Public Records - Directs the Archivist of the United States to promulgate binding regulations establishing standards for interpreting the definition of records and for the establishment and maintenance of adequate and proper documentation organization, functions, policies, and essential transactions of the agency for incorporation in recordkeeping requirements to be issued by agency heads. Requires agency records management programs to comply with provisions governing records disposal. Authorizes the Archivist to inspect any record to determine if: (1) an agency is in compliance with the binding guidelines; and (2) such record has sufficient historical value to warrant continued Government preservation. Revises provisions governing inspections of agency records to: (1) no longer require the approval of the agency head concerned for inspections of records the use of which is restricted by law; (2) no longer require that regulations promulgated by the Administrator of the General Services Administration and the Archivist be identical; and (3) provide that regulations authorizing and restricting the examination and use of such records applicable to the head of the custodial agency or to employees of that agency are applied in the same manner to the Archivist, the Administrator, and their respective employees. Authorizes the Archivist to examine any Federal record on lists and schedules of records lacking historical preservation value. Requires OMB review of routine uses for agency record systems for submission in a report to the Congress. Amends the Privacy Act of 1974 to require advanced congressional notification of proposed changes in a routine use of agency records which are significant."
