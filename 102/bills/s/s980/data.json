    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-04-25", 
    "text": "Advanced Materials Synthesis, Processing, and Commercialization Act of 1991 - Title I: National Advanced Materials Processing Plan and Program - Amends the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 to direct the President, through the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology, at least once every two years, to develop and implement a five-year National Advanced Materials Processing Plan. Requires that the Council: (1) serve as the lead Federal entity responsible for the development of the Plan and for facilitating interagency coordination; and (2) annually review the Federal budget regarding consistency with the Plan. Establishes the Advanced Materials Processing Advisory Panel. Title II: Advanced Materials Processing, Synthesis, and Commercialization Partnerships - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish four or more Advanced Materials Processing, Synthesis, and Commercialization Partnerships, comprised of one or more Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories, U.S. firms, and U.S. higher education institutions, with additional participants allowed. Mandates establishment of specified numbers of similarly-structured Partnerships associated with the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Department of Commerce (through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)), in each case using laboratories of that department or agency instead of DOE laboratories. Requires that each proposal for the establishment of a Partnership be submitted by the lead institution, selected by the proposed participants in the Partnership. Sets forth required contents of proposals. Requires non-Federal cost sharing. Requires Partnerships to be selected through a competitive process. Regulates disclosure of information. Title III: Other Advanced Materials Programs - Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish a competitive grants program known as the Advanced Materials Synthesis and Processing Principal Investigator Awards Program. Allows grant funds to be used for research and development related to advanced materials processing sciences conducted by the recipient within colleges and research institutions in the United States using, to the extent feasible, existing capital equipment, instrumentation, and facilities of U.S. firms and Federal laboratories. Requires the National Science Board of the NSF to establish a fellowship program for graduate and post-doctoral studies and research in advanced materials synthesis and processing, with grants awarded on the basis of academic merit. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, through the NIST Director, to: (1) establish and administer a comprehensive national data base for advanced materials, to be the central repository in the Federal Government for such information; and (2) provide for the collection, evaluation, and dissemination of standard reference data for advanced materials. Title IV: Authorization of Appropriations and Other Provisions - Authorizes appropriations, to carry out responsibilities under this Act, for the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Commerce, the National Science Foundation, and the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology. Allows the head of a department or agency of the Federal Government to waive the application of this Act to any program or activity that is classified in the interest of the national security or foreign policy of the United States."
