    "date": "1991-07-29", 
    "text": "Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 - Title I: Department of State - Part A: Authorization of Appropriations - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 and 1993 for the Department of State for: (1) the administration of foreign affairs; (2) the diplomatic security program; (3) international organizations and conferences; (4) international commissions; (5) migration and refugee assistance; (6) assistance for refugees resettling in Israel; (7) assistance to displaced ethnic Armenians resettling in Armenia; (8) assistance to unaccompanied minor children and other cases of special humanitarian concern that have been referred to special committees pursuant to the Comprehensive Plan of Action for Indochinese Refugees in first asylum countries in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong; (9) humanitarian assistance to displaced Burmese; (10) bilateral science and technology agreements; (11) Soviet-East European research and training; (12) Near and Middle East research and training; and (13) the Asia Foundation. Prohibits the disbursement of funds to the United Nations or any affiliated organization until the President reports to the Congress the elements of the plan by which the entity intends to use such funds. Part B: Department of State Authorities and Activities - Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to authorize the Secretary of State to use funds to pay obligations arising under international agreements, conventions, and binational contracts. Requires Federal agencies that obtain administrative services from the Department of State to make full and prompt payment for such services through an advance of funds or reimbursement. Directs the Secretary to terminate services to agencies that have not made payment within a specified deadline. Waives such suspension or termination as necessary to protect life and Government property. Authorizes the transfer into the Buying Power Maintenance account of unobligated balances from accounts for the administration of foreign affairs. Prohibits the balance of such account from exceeding $100 million. Permits funds appropriated for the Department of State in any account funded in the Department of State Appropriations Act to be transferred to any other appropriations account in an emergency situation (provided the annual budget deficit is not increased and the transfer does not violate the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990). Prohibits an account from being increased by more than 15 percent (five percent for the salaries and expenses account and the acquisition and maintenance of buildings abroad account). Exempts transfers to the emergencies in the consular and diplomatic service appropriation for evacuation purposes from such limitation. Prohibits an account from being increased by more than ten percent. Treats such transfers as a reprogramming of funds. Prohibits, unless the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are notified, the reprogramming of Department of State funds in excess of $500,000 (currently, $250,000). Extends the authorization of appropriations for grants to child care facilities at certain posts abroad. Redesignates the Office of Munitions Control of the Department of State as the Office of Defense Trade Controls and increases the amount of registration fees collected by the Office that is required to be credited to a Department of State account. Permits funds received by the Department of State in connection with Blair House (currently, funds received during FY 1990 and 1991) to be credited to the appropriate Department of State account. Prohibits the denial of, or limitations on, a passport because of any belief or activity which, if held or conducted in the United States, would be protected by the first amendment to the Constitution. Authorizes the Secretary to pay the expenses of any international meeting or conference in the United States that is hosted by the U.S. Government. Amends the Foreign Service Buildings Act, 1926 to raise the limit on the amount of a lease authorized to be entered into by the Secretary for Foreign Service buildings abroad. Permits the Secretary to make advance payments for long term leases and lease-purchase agreements. Amends the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987 to increase the amount authorized to be made available for the construction of Foreign Service Institute training facilities. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to classify as a nonimmigrant an alien coming to the United States at the request of a Government agency for employment, subject to certain conditions and numerical limitations. Directs the Secretary to notify the appropriate congressional committees each time a visa is denied to an alien for security reasons. Prohibits the Secretary from including in the Automated Visa Lookout System or in any system that maintains information about the excludability of aliens the name of any alien who is not excludable under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Requires the Secretary to correct such systems by deleting the names of aliens who are not excludable under such Act. Authorizes the Secretary to add to or retain in such system the names of aliens who are not excludable only if they are included for law enforcement purposes or lawful purposes of the Department of State. Permits the Secretary, subject to certain conditions, to enter into a multiyear (not to exceed five years) contract for the acquisition of property and construction of diplomatic facilities in Moscow. Sets forth contract provisions. Requires Department of State employees to whom a question is addressed by a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to respond to such question within 15 days unless the Secretary explains why a timely response cannot be made. Directs the Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs to report to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Speaker of the House on criteria for international loans by which the United States can determine the likelihood of repayment by another nation or organization seeking to receive U.S. loans or guarantees.

Requires the President to report to the Congress on progress made to end such boycotts. Title XII: United States Law and Business Training Program for Soviet Graduate Students - United States Law and Business Training Program for Soviet Graduate Students Act - Directs the President, acting through the U.S. Information Agency, to provide scholarships for study at U.S. institutions of higher education, coupled with private and public internships, by nationals of the Soviet Union who have completed their undergraduate education and could not otherwise study in the United States. Provides that such scholarships shall be in the form of loans, with repayment to be forgiven: (1) entirely, upon the student's prompt return to the Soviet Union for a period at least one year longer than that of U.S. study; or (2) by one-half, if the student is granted asylum in or is admitted as a refugee to the United States. Sets forth scholarship program guidelines. Limits scholarship opportunities to fields that are critical to economic and political reforms in the Soviet Union, particularly business administration, economics, law, or public administration. Authorizes appropriations."
