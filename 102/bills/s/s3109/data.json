    "text": "Persian Gulf Registry Act - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to examine and determine the current health status of veterans who served in the armed forces in southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf war and to identify possible disabilities which may result from such service. Specifies that individuals eligible to participate in the program are veterans who served on active duty in the armed forces in the Persian Gulf area during the period beginning on August 2, 1990, and ending on the date that the President proclaims as the end of such war. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) provide a comprehensive mental and physical examination of eligible individuals and subsequent mental and physical examinations if determined necessary by a physician or other health care official of the Department of Veterans Affairs; (2) provide follow-up consultation with any individual who received an examination under the program to explain the results of the examination; and (3) undertake outreach efforts to further the purposes of the program. Specifies that: (1) nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorizing the Secretary to provide individuals participating in the registry with hospital or nursing home care or outpatient medical services for the treatment of diseases or disabilities identified in such an examination; and (2) application for such an examination shall not be construed as an application for any other benefit."
