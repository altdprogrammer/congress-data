Provides that a notice of appeal to the Court by an appellant of an adverse decision of the Board of Veterans Appeals shall be considered timely if such notice is postmarked or received by the Court within 120 days after the date on which the notice of decision of the Board is mailed to the appellant. Authorizes review and action by the Judicial Conference of the United States or judicial conduct or disability actions taken by the Court with respect to judges of the Court. (Currently, the Court is not subject to the administrative authority of the Judicial Conference.) Amends the Veterans' Judicial Review Act (VJRA) to provide that the Court's jurisdiction shall include all cases in which a notice of disagreement was filed before November 18, 1988, and the Board issued a final decision after such date. (Currently, the Court's jurisdiction extends only to cases in which such a notice was filed on or after the date of enactment of the VJRA, November 18, 1988.) Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to notify each person eligible to file a notice of appeal with the Court due to such jurisdictional change."
