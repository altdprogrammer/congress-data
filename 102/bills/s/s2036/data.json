    "text": "Access to Health Care for All Americans Act of 1991 - Title I: Access and Affordability of Health Insurance for Small Employers - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a deduction of 100 percent (currently, 25 percent) of the health insurance costs of self-employed individuals and to remove provisions terminating on a specified date the deductibility of such costs. Imposes a tax on insurers who fail to meet certain requirements regarding accident and health contracts for eligible small employers. Includes in those requirements issuance of contracts providing benefits identical to Medplan core benefits and contracts providing benefits identical to Medplan standard benefits. Sets forth pricing and marketing requirements. Requires that the contracts be guaranteed issue. Requires core and standard benefits to include: (1) inpatient and outpatient hospital services; (2) inpatient and outpatient surgical services; (3) inpatient and outpatient physicians' services; (4) diagnostic and screening services; (5) prenatal care; (6) ambulance services; and (7) durable medical equipment.

Prohibits any such agreement from waiving the requirement of offering contracts with benefits identical to Medplan core benefits and contracts with benefits identical to Medplan standard benefits. Defines \"eligible small employer\" to mean those with between one and 50 employees. Preempts any provision of State law: (1) requiring any employer member of a qualified small employer purchasing group to offer any services, category of care, or services of any class or type of provider; (2) requiring any provider of insurance to pay a tax on premiums received from members of such a group; or (3) restricting certain aspects of managed care.

Makes approval of a drug or device by the Food and Drug Administration an absolute defense to a claim of strict liability.
