    "date": "1992-01-28", 
    "text": "Amends the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991 (EUCA) (Public Law 102-164) to add 13 weeks to the number of weeks of benefits payable under the emergency unemployment compensation program. Provides for a total number of weeks of such emergency benefits as follows: (1) 33 weeks (currently 20) in higher unemployment States (with a total unemployment rate of nine percent or higher or an adjusted insured unemployment rate of five percent or higher, for specified periods); and (2) 26 weeks (currently 13) for all other States. (Increases also the number of weeks of unemployment benefits payable to certain railroad workers under EUCA.) Extends to October 3, 1992, the expiration date of the emergency unemployment program (currently June 13, 1992). Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer to the extended unemployment account of the Unemployment Trust Fund an amount equal to the amount of deficit reduction resulting from specified provisions of EUCA. Requires that the provisions of (and amendments made by) this Act be treated as emergency requirements designated by the President and the Congress under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act). Requires that any amount of new budget authority, outlays, or receipts resulting from the provisions of (and amendments made by) this Act not be considered for any purpose under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
