Requires the Office to: (1) monitor research and development (R&D) activities of the military departments and defense agencies with respect to advanced and nuclear weapons and programs; (2) identify all such R&D activities that use technologies having potential nondefense commercial applications; (3) serve as a clearinghouse for the transition of such technologies from the Departments of Defense or Energy to the private sector; and (4) provide private firms with assistance to resolve problems associated with security clearances, proprietary rights, and other legal considerations associated with the transition of such technology. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the Senate and House Armed Services and Appropriations Committees on the establishment of the Office and on Office activities."
