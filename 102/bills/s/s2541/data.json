    "text": "Rural Health Care Improvement Act of 1992 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish a program of grants for residency or service by primary care or general practice physicians in rural medically underserved areas. Authorizes appropriations. Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to phase out incentive payments for physicians' services furnished in areas previously designated as health professional shortage areas which no longer meet the requirements to be so designated. Requires that any individual receiving assistance under any Federal educational loan program who enters a medical residency program and provides primary care in a rural area receive a deferment on loan repayment until completion of the residency. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax deduction for interest on educational loans under certain provisions of the Social Security Act which accrues while a physician is serving in a health professional shortage area. Amends the Social Security Act to extend the termination date of provisions regulating Medicare payments to small, rural, Medicare-dependent hospitals. Modifies requirements for qualifying as such a hospital during the extended period."
