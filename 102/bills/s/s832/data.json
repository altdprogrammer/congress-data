    "text": "Recycled Paper National Market Enhancement Act of 1991 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to conduct a study for purposes of: (1) determining in what manner and to what extent recycled paper can be better utilized by the United States; (2) determining the costs likely to be incurred in recycling and the most effective way of minimizing such costs; and (3) conducting a domestic market analysis of recycled paper. Requires the Secretary to establish a program requiring Federal departments to purchase and use a certain percentage of recycled paper and paper products in their operations. Directs Federal departments to assure that recycled paper is purchased under each contract for the procurement of 10,000 pounds or more of paper. Provides that any decision not to use recycled paper shall be based on a determination that such items: (1) are not reasonably available within a reasonable period of time; (2) fail to meet performance standards; or (3) are available only at an unreasonable price (one which exceeds by more than ten percent the price of nonrecycled paper). Phases in the recycled paper procurement requirement to require 50 percent of all paper procured by Federal departments to be recycled paper after FY 1996."
