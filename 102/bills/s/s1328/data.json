    "text": "Advanced Manufacturing Technology Act of 1991 - Title I: Advanced Manufacturing Technology Management - Amends the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 to direct the President, through the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology, to develop and submit to the Congress, at least once every two years, a strategic road map, covering at least four years after the year in which it is issued, for advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). Establishes the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Advisory Committee. Requires that the Council serve as the lead Federal entity for the development of the map and interagency coordination of Federal AMT activities. Title II: Advanced Manufacturing Technology Development - Part A: Department of Defense - Directs the Secretary of Defense to: (1) refine and implement the National Defense Manufacturing Technology Plan; and (2) encourage AMT research and development of the U.S. public and private sectors. Directs the Secretary to establish one or more Advanced Manufacturing Technology Partnerships to encourage the development and use of generic, precompetitive AMT. Requires each Partnership to be composed of at least two eligible firms. Allows other participants. Authorizes appropriations. Part B: Department of Commerce - Amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to establish, in the Advanced Technology Program, the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Component to provide financial support for activities to identify and solve generic problems associated with research and development in AMT and with the establishment of technical standards in AMT. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish one or more such Partnerships. Authorizes appropriations. Part C: Other Departments and Agencies - Directs the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Director of the National Science Foundation each to establish such Partnerships. Authorizes appropriations. Part D: Administrative and Other Provisions for Partnerships - Requires the participants in each Partnership to designate a lead institution to direct the Partnership. Provides for submission and contents of Partnership proposals, cost-sharing requirements, competitive selection of Partnerships, and protection of information. Part E: Additional Definitions - Sets forth definitions for purposes of this title. Title III: Manufacturing Extension Programs - Amends Federal law to direct the Secretary of Defense to promote the improvement of defense foundation firms (currently, of the subtier defense industry) through the use of manufacturing extension programs (currently, the use of manufacturing extension programs and other organizations). Requires the extension programs to be carried out under existing provisions relating to regional centers for the transfer of manufacturing technology or provisions added by this Act relating to a National Manufacturing Extension Program. Revises the definition of \"manufacturing extension programs\" to mean public and private nonprofit programs (currently, publicly-chartered organizations and services) for certain purposes aimed at small and medium-sized (currently, small) manufacturing firms. Amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to direct the Secretary of Commerce to conduct the National Manufacturing Extension Program to: (1) encourage efforts to improve manufacturing quality, productivity, and performance; (2) promote development of a broad range of AMT programs; and (3) increase the involvement of appropriate private sector segments. Authorizes: (1) assistance through contracts, cooperative agreements, or other financial arrangements; and (2) technical assistance. Authorizes one-time grants to States which, due to chronic economic disadvantages, lack the resources to establish and sustain AMT programs. Declares that there is an Interagency Council on Manufacturing Extension to take such actions as advising the Secretary of Commerce and providing for coordinated implementation regarding the Extension Program. Authorizes appropriations for: (1) the Department of Commerce to carry out provisions of this Act relating to the Extension Program and the Council; and (2) the Department of Defense to carry out provisions relating to the Program and the Council and for transfer to the Department of Commerce for the conduct of the Extension Program. Title IV: Manufacturing Education and Training - Part A: Defense Manufacturing Engineering Education - Establishes a program of grants to higher education institutions for enhancement of existing and establishment of new manufacturing engineering education programs. Requires that at least ten grants be awarded within one year after enactment of this Act. Requires that a supported program be: (1) conducted at the undergraduate or graduate levels, or both; (2) a consolidated and integrated multidisciplinary program including multidisciplinary instruction, work experience opportunities, faculty and student research, and significant private sector involvement. Authorizes appropriations. Part B: Manufacturing Managers in the Classroom - Directs the Secretary of Defense to conduct the Manufacturing Managers in the Classroom Program to support employment of experienced manufacturing managers and experts as teachers in higher education institutions. Authorizes appropriations to: (1) the Department of Defense to carry out the Program and for transfer to the Department of Commerce for the conduct of the Program; and (2) the Department of Commerce to carry out this part. Title V: International Activities in Advanced Manufacturing - Earmarks certain funds, authorized to be appropriated to the Departments of Defense and Energy under title II of this Act, for AMT activities under the authority of technology agreements entered into by the United States and other nations."
