    "text": "Fish and Wildlife Law Enforcement Clarification Act of 1992 - Authorizes law enforcement officers of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Interior, to: (1) carry firearms; (2) execute and serve any order, warrant, subpoena, summons, or other process issued by a court or officer of competent jurisdiction for the enforcement of any Federal law; (3) make an arrest without a warrant for any offense under Federal law committed within the officer's presence, or for any felony under Federal law if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person arrested has committed or is committing the felony; (4) cooperate with any State or political subdivision of a State in the enforcement of the laws of the State; and (5) perform any other law enforcement duty specified by the Secretary. Permits such officers, for purposes of law enforcement within any area that is part of the National Wildlife Refuge System or any other area owned or controlled by the Service, and in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, to: (1) perform acts to maintain law and order and protect persons and property; and (2) conduct an investigation of any offense under Federal law committed within the area in the absence of investigation of the offense by any other Federal law enforcement agency having investigative jurisdiction over the offense committed or with the concurrence of the other agency. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) designate any law enforcement officer of any Federal agency or State to act as a special police officer in areas of the System and to exercise authority established by this Act, subject to specified conditions; (2) cooperate with any State in the enforcement, within the System, of the laws or ordinances of the State; and (3) provide reimbursement to a State for expenditures incurred in connection with activities of the State pursuant to such designation. Sets forth provisions regarding the treatment of special police officers under this Act (in general, not as Federal employees or subject to Federal employment laws) and with respect to tort claims, workers' compensation, and specified provisions of the Federal criminal code."
