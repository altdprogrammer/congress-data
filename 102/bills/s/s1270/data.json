Requires the Secretary of Defense to also make available to the public a complete list of U.S. personnel classified as prisoners of war, missing in action, or killed in action (body not returned) after 1940, including: (1) the current classification of each person; and (2) each change in the listed person's classification that has occurred since the original classification. Provides exceptions to such disclosure requirements, including where disclosure would compromise the safety of personnel known or thought to be held as prisoners of war. Requires the agency head, in such an instance, to notify the President and the congressional intelligence committees of such a determination."
