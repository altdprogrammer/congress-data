    "date": "1991-05-23", 
    "text": "Comprehensive Violent Crime Control Act of 1991 - Title I: Death Penalty - Capital Punishment Procedures Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criteria for the imposition of the death penalty for Federal crimes. Requires the Government, for any offense punishable by death, to serve notice upon the defendant a reasonable time before trial or acceptance of a plea, that it intends to seek the death penalty and the aggravating factors upon which it will rely. Requires a separate sentencing hearing before a jury, or the court upon motion by the defendant, when the defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense punishable by death. Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, without regard to the rules of evidence, but permits evidence to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury. Specifies mitigating factors which the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the information and aggravating factors which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Sets forth special aggravating factors for: (1) espionage, treason, homicide, the attempted murder of the President; and (2) drug offenses punishable by the death penalty (such factors include previous serious drug felony convictions, use of a firearm in committing or furthering certain continuing criminal enterprises, use of minors in trafficking, and lethal adulteration of controlled substances). Directs the court, or the jury by unanimous vote, to impose the death penalty upon a finding of at least one aggravating and no mitigating factor, or one or more aggravating factors which outweigh any mitigating factors. States that no person who was under 18 years of age at the time of the offense may be sentenced to death. Requires the court to instruct the jury not to consider the race, color, religion, national origin, or sex of the defendant or victim in its consideration of the sentence. Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence. Requires the court of appeals, upon consideration of the record and the information and procedures of the sentencing hearing, to affirm the decision if: (1) the sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; (2) the information supports the finding of aggravating factors; and (3) the proceedings did not involve any other prejudicial error requiring reversal of the sentence that was properly preserved for and raised on appeal. Requires the court to provide a written explanation of its determination. Sets forth procedures for the implementation of the sentence of death. Limits the circumstances under which the offense of delivering defense information to aid foreign governments is punishable by death. Provides for the imposition of the death penalty for: (1) murder committed by prisoners in Federal prisons; (2) kidnapping which result in the death of any person; (3) hostage takings which result in the death of any person; (4) attempting to kill the President of the United States (if such attempt results in bodily injury or comes dangerously close to causing the President's death); (5) \"murder for hire\"; (6) murder in the aid of a racketeering activity; (7) international terrorism (where the killing is a first-degree murder); (8) engaging in a criminal enterprise activity which results in death; (9) specified violations of the Controlled Substances Act, the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, and the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act; and (10) genocide. Increases the minimum sentence to life imprisonment for the crime of bank robbery which results in death. Provides for appointment of counsel in Federal cases where a defendant is charged with a crime with respect to which a sentence of death is sought and is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation. Sets forth additional provisions with respect to: (1) representation before and after review of judgement; (2) standards for competence of counsel; and (3) claims of ineffectiveness of counsel. Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) deadlines for collateral attacks on judgements imposing a sentence of death; and (2) stays of execution. Title II: Habeas Corpus Reform - Subtitle A: General Habeas Corpus Reform - Habeas Corpus Reform Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal judicial code to establish a one-year statute of limitations for habeas corpus actions brought by State prisoners. Vests authority to issue certificates for probable cause for appeal of habeas corpus orders exclusively in the courts of appeals. Permits denial on the merits of a habeas corpus writ notwithstanding the failure to exhaust State remedies. Prohibits the granting of a writ of habeas corpus with respect to any claim which has been fully and fairly adjudicated in State proceedings. Sets forth provisions with respect to the appointment of counsel. Subtitle B: Death Penalty Litigation Procedures - Death Penalty Litigation Procedures Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal judicial code to set forth special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases. Applies such procedures to Federal habeas corpus cases brought by prisoners in State custody who are subject to a capital sentence. Makes the applicability of such procedures contingent upon a State establishing a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings brought by indigent prisoners whose capital convictions and sentences have been upheld on direct appeal to the court of last resort in the State or have otherwise become final for State law purposes. States that the rule of court on statutes establishing such mechanism must provide standards of competency for the appointment of such counsel. Directs that any such mechanism must offer counsel to all State prisoners under capital sentence and must provide for the entry of an order by a court of record: (1) appointing counsel to represent the prisoner upon a specified finding; (2) finding that the prisoner has rejected the offer of counsel and made the decision with an understanding of its legal consequences; or (3) denying the appointment of counsel upon a finding that the prisoner is not indigent. Provides for a mandatory stay of execution during the post-conviction review initiated pursuant to this Act. Details conditions which will cause such stay to expire. Prohibits a Federal court, if one of such conditions has occurred, from entering a stay of execution or granting relief in a capital case unless: (1) the basis for the stay and request for relief is a claim not previously presented in the State or Federal courts; (2) the failure to raise the claim was the result of State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, was the result of a recognition by the Supreme Court of a new Federal right that is retroactively applicable, or is due to the fact that the claim is based on facts that could not have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence in time to present the claim for State or Federal post-conviction review; and (3) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient, if proven, to undermine the court's confidence in the jury's determination of guilt on the offense for which the death penalty was imposed. Imposes time limits on filing for habeas corpus relief. Requires such time limits to be tolled under specified conditions. Requires the district court, upon the development of a complete evidentiary record, to rule on the merits of the claims properly before it. Makes the requirement for a certificate of probable cause inapplicable, with exceptions, where: (1) a second or successive petition is filed; and (2) certain requirements under a unitary review procedure (i.e., a State procedure that authorizes a person under sentence of death to raise, in the course of direct review of judgment, such claims as could be raised on collateral attack) are met. Sets forth time limits for determining petitions. Specifies that the adjudication of petitions or motions involving habeas corpus in capital cases shall be granted priority by the district court and court of appeals over all noncapital matters. Title III: Exclusionary Rule - Amends the Federal criminal code to bar the exclusion of evidence obtained as a result of a search or seizure carried out under circumstances justifying an objectively reasonable belief that it was in conformity with the fourth amendment. Specifies that: (1) Federal law does not require the exclusion of evidence in a proceeding in any court under circumstances in which the evidence would be admissible in a proceeding in a Federal court pursuant to this title; and (2) firearms seized by Federal law enforcement officers for use as evidence against a defendant who is being prosecuted for a crime of violence or serious drug offense, or who is ineligible to possess such firearm under the Federal criminal code, shall not be excluded in U.S. court proceedings on the ground that the search or seizure was in violation of the fourth amendment. Directs the Attorney General to promulgate rules and regulations relating to compliance by law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice with the fourth amendment, including: (1) the training of such officers in the law of search and seizure; (2) procedures and standards of conduct to be observed in carrying out searches and seizures; (3) procedures for reporting and investigating incidents involving possible violations of legal or administrative requirements relating to searches and seizures; (4) sanctions to be imposed when such violations are determined to have occurred; and (5) standards and procedures for settling claims for damages by victims of unlawful searches and seizures. Authorizes the head of any other Federal department or agency to promulgate rules and regulations relating to compliance with the fourth amendment by law enforcement officers of such department or agency. Directs the Attorney General, and any other Federal department or agency head that promulgates such rules or regulations, to: (1) establish a review board to consider all allegations of fourth amendment violations by law enforcement officers of such department or agency and to recommend or impose appropriate sanctions in cases where violations are determined to have occurred; and (2) report annually to the Congress concerning allegations and claims relating to search and seizure violations by law enforcement officers of such department or agency, the actions taken on such allegations and claims, and the bases for such actions. Authorizes charging such a review board with recommending the settlement of claims for damages by victims of unlawful searches and seizures. Specifies that evidence shall not be excluded on the ground that it was obtained in violation of a statute, an administrative rule or regulation, or a rule of procedure unless exclusion is expressly authorized by statute or by a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. Title IV: Firearms - Subtitle A: Firearms and Related Amendments - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the transfer of firearms to non-residents of the State in which the transferor resides. Specifies that if a conviction was for a violent felony involving the threatened or actual use of a firearm or explosives, or was for a serious drug offense, such person shall be considered convicted for purposes of this Act irrespective of any pardon, setting aside, expunction, or restoration of civil rights. Permits the judicial officer to consider pretrial detention with respect to certain firearms and explosives offenses. Provides for enhanced penalties for: (1) the use of a semiautomatic firearm during a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense, with exceptions; and (2) possession of a firearm or explosive during the commission of such offenses. Sets forth penalties for smuggling firearms in aid of drug trafficking and for theft of firearms and explosives. Provides for the mandatory revocation of the supervised release of an individual for possession of a firearm. Increases penalties for: (1) making knowingly false, material statements in connection with the acquisition of a firearm from a licensed dealer; and (2) a second offense of using an explosive to commit a Federal felony. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) change from six to five years the statute of limitations for certain firearms offenses; and (2) provide for the summary forfeiture of unregistered National Firearms Act weapons, with provision for reimbursement for innocent owners. Makes it unlawful for felons and others to possess explosives. Authorizes the summary destruction of explosives subject to forfeiture under specified circumstances. Sets forth requirements for reimbursement of the value of destroyed property. Makes it unlawful to knowingly possess stolen firearms, ammunition, or explosives. Adds using a firearm in the commission of counterfeiting or forgery (current law specifies only \"whoever, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime\") among offenses which, if the offender uses or carries a firearm, will subject such person to an enhanced sentence. Provides for a mandatory five year penalty for firearms possession by violent felons and serious drug offenders. Modifies provisions regarding the reporting of multiple firearms sales to: (1) cover sales during any 30 consecutive days (currently, during any five consecutive business days); and (2) require each licensee to forward a copy of the report to the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the unlicensed person not later than the close of business on the date that the multiple sale or disposition occurs. Subjects individuals who conspire to commit a firearms or explosives offense to the same penalties as those prescribed for the underlying offense. Provides for a fine or up to ten years imprisonment, or both, for stealing a firearm or explosive from specified individuals, such as a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer. Makes it unlawful for any person (current law specifies licensee) to distribute explosive materials to specified classes of individuals. Title V: Obstruction of Justice - Increases penalties for obstruction of justice offenses against court officers and jurors and for retaliatory killings of witnesses, victims, and informants. Includes State and local law enforcement officers assisting Federal officers or employees in the performance of their official duties within the scope of provisions setting penalties for individuals who kill or attempt to kill any U.S. judge, U.S. Attorney, or specified other classes of individuals. Title VI: Gangs and Juvenile Offenders - Requires that juveniles found guilty of specified serious crimes be fingerprinted and photographed and that such information and records of the adjudication be sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Authorizes reporting, retention, disclosure, and availability of juvenile records permitted under the law of the State in which a Federal juvenile proceeding takes place. Repeals provisions that authorize prejudgement probation for certain drug offenders convicted of possession of a controlled substance and requires expungement of records for such offenders under 21 years of age at the time of the offense. Adds certain cocaine and drug conspiracy and attempt offenses committed by juveniles to the list of crimes authorizing prosecution as an adult if the Attorney General certifies that there is a substantial Federal interest in the case that justifies adult prosecution. Sets forth criteria for determining whether a juvenile should be prosecuted as an adult. Defines \"serious drug offense\" under the Federal criminal code to include any act of juvenile delinquency that if committed by an adult would be a serious drug offense under such provisions. Increases the penalty for: (1) interstate and foreign travel or transportation in aid of racketeering enterprises; and (2) conspiracy to commit murder for hire. Title VII: Terrorism - Subtitle A: Aviation Terrorism - Amends the Federal criminal code to set forth penalties for performing or attempting an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation which causes or is likely to cause serious injury or death; destroying or seriously damaging the facilities of, or a civil aircraft not in service at, such airport, or disrupting the services of such airport, if such an act endangers or is likely to endanger safety. Amends the Federal Aviation Act to delete a limitation on the applicability of aircraft piracy provisions to situations where the place of takeoff or of actual landing of the aircraft on board which the offense is committed is situated outside the territory of the State of registration of such aircraft. Subtitle B: Maritime Terrorism - Act for the Prevention and Punishment of Violence Against Maritime Navigation and Fixed Platforms - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties for acts of violence against maritime navigation, such as seizing control of a ship by force, threat, or intimidation, performing acts of violence against persons on board a ship that are likely to endanger safe navigation, and destroying or seriously damaging maritime navigational facilities that are likely to endanger safe navigation. Sets forth analogous provisions with respect to maritime fixed platforms. Declares that all the territorial sea of the United States, as defined by Presidential Proclamation 5928 of December 27, 1988: (1) is part of the United States, subject to its sovereignty; and (2) for purposes of Federal criminal jurisdiction, is within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Sets forth additional provisions with respect to U.S. jurisdiction over the territorial sea and over crimes against U.S. jurisdiction over the territorial sea and over crimes against U.S. nationals on foreign vessels. Subtitle C: Terrorist Alien Removal - Terrorist Alien Removal Act of 1991 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make terrorist activity (as defined by this Act) grounds for deportation. Establishes removal procedures for alien terrorists, including a special removal hearing which shall be open to the public. Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) the introduction of evidence, including a provision restricting the public from being fully informed of such evidence or its source unless the Department of Justice elects to introduce such evidence in open session; (2) the burden of proof; and (3) appeals. Specifies that an alien subject to removal under provisions of this title shall have no right of discovery of information derived from electronic surveillance authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or otherwise for national security purposes, nor shall such alien have the right to seek suppression of such evidence. Authorizes the Government to use, in the removal proceeding, the fruits of electronic surveillance authorized under such Act. Specifies that no order of removal shall be stayed pending disposition of a writ of certiorari except as provided by the Court of Appeals or a Justice of the Supreme Court. Directs the Chief Justice of the United States to: (1) designate five district court judges from five of the U.S. judicial circuits, to serve five-year terms, who shall constitute a court with jurisdiction to conduct all matters and proceedings authorized under this title; and (2) provide for the maintenance of appropriate security measures for applications for ex parte orders to conduct the special removal hearing, the orders themselves, evidence received in camera and ex parte, and other matters as necessary to protect information concerning matters before the court from harming the national security of the United States, adversely affecting foreign relations, revealing investigative techniques, or disclosing confidential sources of information. Sets forth provisions with respect to the retention of an alien in custody (including affording a reasonable opportunity for such alien to communicate with and receive visits from family members, to communicate with an attorney, and to contact an appropriate diplomatic or consular official of the alien's country), the deportation of such alien to the alien's or a third country, and the transfer of such alien to the custody of State authorities, as appropriate. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to: (1) grant exclusive jurisdiction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review excludability orders; (2) provide for a ten year prison sentence, to run concurrently with any other sentence, and a fine, for entering (or attempting to enter) the United States subsequent to exclusion or removal; and (3) delete a provision authorizing an alien held in custody pursuant to a deportation order to obtain judicial review by habeas corpus proceedings. Subtitle D: Terrorism Offenses and Sanctions - Establishes criminal penalties for: (1) committing, or attempting to commit, torture outside the United States (with jurisdiction over the prohibited activity if the alleged offender is a U.S. national or is present in the United States, irrespective of the nationality of the victim or the alleged offender); (2) using weapons of mass destruction against a U.S. national outside of the United States, any person within the United States, or any property that is owned, leased, or used by the United States or any U.S. department or agency; (3) committing certain homicides and attempted homicides involving firearms in Federal facilities; and (4) providing material support to terrorists. Makes specified terrorist offenses predicates to a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization statute. Authorizes the civil and criminal forfeiture of property used to commit specified terrorist and violent acts. Provides for enhanced penalties for specified offenses, such as fraud and misuse of visas, permits, and other entry documents. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend its sentencing guidelines to provide an increase of not less than three levels in the base offense level for any felony that involves or is intended to promote international terrorism, with exceptions. Subtitle E: Antiterrorism Enforcement Provisions - Authorizes the Attorney General to award permanent residence or other status to an alien and his immediate family who is already present in the United States under specified circumstances, such as where necessary to protect the life of an individual who has cooperated with Federal law enforcement authorities, subject to certain numerical limitations. Amends the Alien Enemies Act to authorize the President, whenever invoking the authority contained in such Act as to aliens of a hostile nation or government and upon further determining that the United States may also be subject to actual, attempted, or threatened predatory incursions by aliens of other nations, to include within the terms of such Act (which provides for the apprehension, restraint, and removal of alien enemies) any or all other aliens within the United States as the President may designate. Authorizes the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to obtain (after submitting a written request) from a wire or electronic communications service provider subscriber information regarding a person or entity which is relevant to an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation, where information available to the FBI indicates that there is reason to believe that communications facilities registered in the name of such person or entity have been used, through the services of such provider, in communication with a foreign agent or power. Establishes penalties for the disclosure by such a provider, or an officer, employee, or agent of such provider, that the FBI has sought or obtained access to such information. Amends the Consumer Credit Protection Act to require a consumer reporting agency to furnish a consumer report or other information requested in connection with an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation to the FBI under specified conditions. Makes it a misdemeanor for such agency, or an officer, employee, or agent of such institution, to disclose to any person that the FBI has sought or obtained a consumer report or identifying information respecting any consumer. Authorizes: (1) interceptions of communications (subject to approval by the appropriate Federal judge) under specified Federal provisions, such as where such interception may provide evidence related to terrorist acts abroad, use of weapons of mass destruction, and violence at airports; (2) participation of foreign and State government personnel in interceptions; and (3) disclosure of intercepted communications, under specified circumstances, to foreign law enforcement officials. Extends the statute of limitations for specified terrorism offenses. Title VIII: Sexual Violence and Child Abuse - Amends the Federal Rules of Evidence to allow evidence of similar offenses in criminal or civil sexual assault and child molestation cases. Amends the Controlled Substances Act to provide for increased penalties for distribution of a controlled substance to a woman while she is pregnant. Amends Federal criminal code provisions relating to sexual abuse to double the maximum imprisonment for violation of such provisions after a prior conviction under Federal or State law for such an offense. Adds to such provisions a special definition of \"sexual act\" applicable to individuals under the age of 16. Authorizes the court to order the payment of restitution for victims of sex offenses. Amends the Federal criminal code to require that a person charged with an offense under provisions relating to sexual abuse be tested for the human immunodeficiency virus: (1) before release pending trial; and (2) six months and 12 months after the initial test. Requires results to be provided to the judicial officer or court and disclosed only to the victim, the attorney for the Government, and the person tested. Requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to enhance the sentence guidelines if the offender had reason to know that he was infected, except where the offender did not engage or attempt to engage in conduct creating a risk of transmission. Amends the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 to require a governmental department or agency to pay for up to two tests for a sexual assault victim in the 12 months following the assault. Title IX: Drug Testing - Requires: (1) the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to establish a program of drug testing of criminal defendants on post-conviction release; and (2) the chief probation officer in each district to arrange for the drug testing of such defendants. Requires, as an explicit condition of probation, parole, or supervised release of a defendant involving a felony or a specified violent or drug offense, that the defendant refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance and submit to periodic drug tests. Sets limitations on the authority to require such tests and to take action against a defendant based on test results. Requires the revocation of probation, supervised release, or parole if a prisoner unlawfully uses a controlled substance or refuses to cooperate in drug testing imposed as a condition of such probation, supervised release, or parole. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to condition State eligibility for justice system improvement grants on State implementation of a drug testing program for targeted classes of persons subject to charges, confinement, or supervision in the criminal justice systems of such State. Specifies that: (1) such program must meet criteria specified by the Attorney General; and (2) no State shall be required to expend an amount for drug testing in excess of ten percent of the minimum amount which such State is eligible to receive under such Act. Directs the Attorney General to promulgate regulations to implement such requirements which: (1) incorporate scientific and technical standards determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure reliability and accuracy of drug test results; and (2) include such other guidelines for drug testing programs in State criminal justice systems as the Attorney General determines are appropriate, as well as provisions by which a State may apply for a waiver of such requirements on the grounds that compliance would impose excessive financial or other burdens on such State or would otherwise be impractical or contrary to State policy. Title X: Equal Justice Act - Equal Justice Act - Requires that: (1) the death penalty and all other penalties be administered by the United States and by every State without regard to the race or color of the defendant or victim; and (2) neither the United States nor any State prescribe any racial quota or statistical test for the imposition or execution of the death penalty or any other penalty. Directs that, in a criminal trial in any Federal or State court, on motion of the defense attorney or prosecutor: (1) the risk of racial prejudice or bias be examined on voir dire if there is a substantial likelihood in the circumstances of the case that such prejudice or bias will affect the jury either against or in favor of the defendant; and (2) a change of venue be granted if an impartial jury cannot be obtained in the original venue because of racial prejudice or bias. Bars the prosecutor or the defense attorney from making any appeal to racial prejudice or bias in statements before the jury. Requires: (1) the judge in a Federal capital case before a jury to instruct the jury not to be influenced by prejudice or bias relating to the race or color of the defendant or victim in considering whether a sentence of death is justified, and that the jury is not to recommend the imposition of such sentence unless it has concluded that it would recommend the same sentence for such crime regardless of the race or color of the defendant or victim; and (2) the jury, upon the return of a recommendation of a sentence of death, to also return a certificate, signed by each juror, that the juror's individual decision was not affected by prejudice or bias relating to the race or color of the defendant or victim and that the individual juror would have made the same recommendation regardless of the race or color of the defendant or victim. Makes the fact that the killing of a victim was motivated by racial prejudice or bias an aggravating factor whose existence permits consideration of the death penalty, in a prosecution for an offense against the United States for which a sentence of death is authorized. Authorizes imposition of the death penalty for violation of specified civil rights provisions, if death results. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize drug control and system improvement grants to States to provide in all appropriate cases, particularly in collateral and other post-conviction proceedings, adequate resources and expertise to ensure that the death penalty is expeditiously carried out.
