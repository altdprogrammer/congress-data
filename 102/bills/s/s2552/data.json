Requires the project to be conducted: (1) through a cost-sharing arrangement between Federal, State, and local governmental entities by which at least 20 percent of the total remediation costs shall be borne by State and local governments; and (2) at a specified site where mines are threatening to contaminate local water supplies with excessive loadings of toxic metals.
