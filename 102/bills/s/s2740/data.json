Requires the Center to report annually on the programs, activities, and findings of the Department on preventive health services to health-care professionals and organizations that have an interest in the provisions of such services. Authorizes appropriations for the Center. Directs the Secretary to establish a Preventive Health Services Advisory Committee to: (1) advise and make recommendations to the Secretary on means of enhancing and continuing preventive health services by the Department; and (2) identify appropriate preventive health services for particular groups of veterans and areas of inquiry regarding such services that are suitable for additional research by the Department. Requires the Secretary to report annually to specified congressional committees on: (1) a description of the programs and activities of the Department with respect to preventive health services during the preceding 12-month period; (2) a specific description of research activities on preventive health services carried out during that period using employees and various support services of the Department; (3) the work and recommendations of the Advisory Committee and a description of any activities of the Department to carry out such recommendations; and (4) expenditures of the Center."
