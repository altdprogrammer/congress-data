    "text": "Child Nutrition Amendments of 1992 - Title I: Nutrition Improvement for Homeless Children - Amends the National School Lunch Act (NSLA) to revise provisions for demonstration projects for food service for homeless children under the age of six in emergency shelters. Includes State, city, local, or county governments, and other public bodies (as well as private nonprofit organizations) among the entities which may participate in such projects. Provides that such projects shall receive reimbursement payments for meals and supplements served on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays (in addition to payments for weekdays) at the request of the project sponsor. Allows specified meal pattern requirements to be modified as necessary by the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) to take into account the needs of infants. Increases the minimum amounts which the Secretary is required to expend for such projects in FY 1993 and 1994. Directs the Secretary to advise each State of: (1) the availability of such projects for States, cities, counties, local governments, and other public bodies; and (2) application procedures for project participation. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct other demonstration projects to identify other effective means of providing food assistance to homeless children residing in temporary shelters. Prohibits using specified funds (which are to be used to provide food service for homeless children under age six in emergency shelters) for such demonstration projects. Title II: Breastfeeding Promotion and Improvement of Other Child Nutrition Programs - Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (CNA) to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a breastfeeding promotion program. Amends NSLA to allow, for purposes of determining a for-profit child care center's eligibility under the Child and Adult Care Food Program, consideration of such center's licensed capacity (if that capacity is less than its total of enrolled children) in the formula for determining whether it reaches the threshold eligibility status where at least 25 percent of the children served are children for whom the title XX Social Security Act funds are received by the center (thus not penalizing a center for part-time enrollees). Amends NSLA to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to continue until September 30, 1994, (a two-year extension), to the extent provided for in advance in appropriations Acts, the demonstration projects which allow for-profit child care centers in two States to be eligible for the Child and Adult Care Food Program if at least 25 percent of the children are eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches. Amends CNA to provide that homelessness and migrancy are nutritional risk factors to be considered in determining eligibility for benefits under the special supplemental food program for women, infants, and children (WIC program). Title III: Reauthorization of Pilot Program - Amends NSLA to extend through FY 1994 the eligibility of certain school districts to receive, under a pilot project, all cash payments or all commodity letters of credit in lieu of entitlement commodities for school lunch programs. Title IV: Reauthorization of the Advisory Council on the Distribution of Donated Commodities - Amends the Commodity Distribution Reform Act and WIC Amendments of 1987 to reauthorize through FY 1996 the advisory council on the distribution of donated commodities to recipient agencies."
