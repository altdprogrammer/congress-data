    "text": "Mike Mansfield Fellowship Act - Establishes the Mike Mansfield Fellowship Program. Directs the Secretary of State (Secretary) to make grants to the Mansfield Center for Pacific Affairs (Center) to award two-year fellowships to eligible Federal employees. Requires fellowship recipients (Mansfield Fellows): (1) during their first year, to study, in Washington, D.C., the Japanese language and political economy; and (2) during their second year, to serve as a Fellow in a parliamentary office, ministry, or other agency of the Government of Japan, or, subject to Center approval, a nongovernmental Japanese institution associated with the recipient's interests. Requires the Center to comply with specified program requirements in order to be eligible for such grants. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into an arrangement with the Government of Japan to place Fellows in that Government. Authorizes the Foreign Service Institute to assist in carrying out Japanese language training by the Center through providing classroom space, teaching materials, and facilities, insofar as this is not detrimental to the Institute's other responsibilities. Authorizes the Center to accept and use gifts from private sources for such program, subject to review and approval of the Mansfield Fellowship Review Board. Provides that specified amounts from Department of State funds shall be available to the Secretary to make program grants to the Center for FY 1993 through 1996. Sets forth program requirements. Requires that the Federal employees eligible for such fellowships have: (1) at least two years experience in any branch of the U.S. Government; and (2) a strong career interest in U.S.-Japan relations and a commitment to further Federal service. Requires that at least ten such fellowships be awarded annually. Prohibits Mansfield Fellows from engaging in any intelligence or intelligence-related activity on behalf of the U.S. Government. Allows Federal agencies to separate from service such Fellows for a specified period, but requires that: (1) Fellows be reemployed or reinstated in an appropriate position and with all attendant rights and benefits as they would have acquired if they had not been so separated; and (2) they continue to participate during the fellowship period, as if they were not separated, in specified programs for health and life insurance, workers' compensation leave, and retirement (with employer contributions to be made by the Center, and employee deductions to be taken from fellowship stipends). Establishes the Mansfield Fellowship Review Board to review program administration and submit annual reports. Authorizes appropriations for the Board."
