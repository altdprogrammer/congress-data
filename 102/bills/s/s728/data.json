    "text": "Upper Sacramento River Fishery Resources Restoration Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a ten-year program to restore natural salmon and steelhead trout populations of the Sacramento River (and its California tributaries and its drainage basin above the confluence with the Feather River) to the optimum carrying capacity of the habitat in a restored condition and to provide sufficient hatchery-produced fish to meet fishery restoration and mitigation requirements. Requires memoranda of agreement with Federal, State, and local agencies having jurisdiction over certain necessary activities. Establishes the Upper Sacramento River Fisheries Task Force to assist the Secretary and coordinate activities with governmental and private anadromous fish restoration projects within the basin. Authorizes appropriations for formulation, establishment, implementation, and maintenance of the program. Requires cost-sharing from California and the electric utilities, water districts, and other direct purchasers of water and power from the Central Valley Project. Prohibits appropriations under these provisions from being used to protect fisheries from chronic or acute toxicity caused by heavy metals or acid mine drainage."
