    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-04-29", 
    "text": "Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1993 - Title I: Procurement - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 for the Army, Navy and Marine Corps, and Air Force for aircraft, missiles, weapons, tracked combat vehicles, ammunition, shipbuilding and conversion, and other procurement.

Empowers the Defense Inspector General with the authority to provide for any emergency or extraordinary expenses which cannot be anticipated or classified. Repeals the Federal ceiling on the number of employees in headquarters and nonmanagement headquarters activities and support activities. Repeals a Federal provision requiring the Secretary of Defense to reduce the number of civilian Department of Defense (DOD) employees employed by industrial- or commercial-type activities. Repeals specified provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 which: (1) limit the authority of the National Defense Stockpile (NDS) Manager to dispose of materials in the NDS; and (2) require the Manager to obligate specified sums for the acquisition of materials in the NDS during FY 1992 and 1993. Provides that during FY 1992 and thereafter, sales of stockpiled material in the NDS Transaction Fund may not exceed $1,000,000,000. Authorizes the Secretary to impose a moratorium on the acquisition of new material for the NDS in order to reduce existing excess material in the stockpile. Prohibits, except to the extent authorized in appropriation Acts, the use of funds available in the NDS Transaction Fund from being obligated or expended to finance the conduct of R&D activities for the development or production of advanced materials. National Defense Sealift Improvement Act - Establishes in the Treasury the National Defense Sealift Fund. Requires the Secretary to administer the Fund, obligating and expending Fund sums for: (1) R&D relating to national defense sealift; (2) construction, purchase, lease, alteration, conversion, or operation and maintenance of sealift vessels for national defense purposes; and (3) such other purposes authorized by law relating to national defense sealift. Authorizes appropriations. States that proceeds from the sale or lease of certain vessels shall be deposited into the Fund. Transfers certain prior unobligated balances into the Fund from Navy shipbuilding and conversion funds. Title IV: Personnel Authorizations for Fiscal Year 1993 - Part A: Active Forces - Authorizes end strengths for active-duty forces for FY 1993. Part B: Reserve Forces - Authorizes end strengths for reserve components of the armed forces for FY 1993. Permits such end strengths to vary no more than two percent.

Increases the number of certain enlisted and officer personnel authorized to be on active duty in support of the reserves. Part C: Military Training Student Loads - Authorizes and specifies the average military training student loads for FY 1993. Provides for the adjustment of such student loads consistent with manpower strengths authorized under this Act. Title V: General Provisions - Increases from four to every five years the physical examination requirement for members of the Ready Reserve. National Guard Amendments of 1992 - Adds warrant officers and enlisted members of the National Guard to those females authorized to be in the U.S. militia. Repeals Federal provisions requiring each member of the Army or Air National Guard called into Federal service to undergo a physical examination. Requires all parts of a National Guard unit to be included in a drill and instruction within 90 consecutive days (currently, 30) in order to be credited as an assembly for drill and instruction for purposes of National Guard duty requirements. Waives a required 30-day prior notification of termination for a National Guard technician when such technician: (1) is serving under a temporary appointment; (2) is serving in a trial or probationary period; or (3) has voluntarily ceased to be a member of the National Guard when such membership is a condition of employment. Repeals a current ceiling on the number of such technicians who may be employed at any one time. Includes commissioned officers of the Army or Air National Guard with those officers empowered to declare National Guard property as unserviceable through fair wear and tear. Waives a required increase in the pay and allowances of member of the armed forces in conformity with annual GS-level increases. Provides, in lieu thereof, effective on January 1, 1993, an increase of 3.7 percent in the rates of basic pay, basic allowance for subsistence, and basis allowance for quarters. Repeals a provision of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1985 requiring the Secretary to report annually to the Congress on U.S. expenditures in support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Revises the annual date for the report of the Secretary to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees (defense committees) with respect to special access programs. Provides lease terms and conditions to be followed by the Secretary when leasing defense property for display or demonstration at international shows or trade expositions or to foreign governments, when the lessee is the manufacturer of the defense equipment. Allows the Secretary to acquire from NATO and its subsidiary bodies logistic support, supplies, and services for elements of the armed forces (currently, only for elements of the armed forces deployed in Europe or adjacent waters). Provides that limitations on the amounts that may be obligated or accrued by the United States for the acquisition of defense supplies shall not apply to a period of active hostilities involving U.S. armed forces (currently, involving NATO). Amends the Arms Export Control Act and similar armed forces provisions to require participants in cooperative R&D projects with friendly foreign countries to share equitably the overhead and administrative costs as well as the costs of claims (currently, only the first two costs are shared). Extends through: (1) FY 1995 the aviation officer retention bonus; (2) FY 1994 the provision of special pay to enlisted members of the Selected Reserve assigned to certain high priority units; (3) FY 1995 provisions determining the computation of creditable service as commissioned officers before mandatory transfer to the Retired Reserve; (4) FY 1995 the grade determination authority for certain reserve medical officers; (5) FY 1995 the promotion authority for certain reserve officers serving on active duty; (6) FY 1995 the provision of education loans for certain health professionals who serve in the Selected Reserve; (7) FY 1994 the accession bonus for registered nurses serving in military medical facilities; (8) FY 1994 the special pay for nurse anesthetists; (9) FY 1997 the special pay for military enlistment and reenlistment bonuses for active duty forces; (10) FY 1995 the special pay for enlistment and reenlistment bonuses for reserve forces; (11) FY 1993 the provision of special pay for enlisted members of the Selected Reserve assigned to high priority units; (12) FY 1995 the authority for special pay for critically short wartime health specialists in the Selected Reserve; and (13) FY 2001 the major defense acquisition pilot program authorized under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991. Repeals the authority for the temporary promotion of certain critically-skilled Navy lieutenants. Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Revision Act of 1992 - Amends the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act to state as a purpose of such Act the identification of stocks of certain strategic and critical materials. States that the quantity of materials to be stockpiled under the Act should be sufficient to meet the needs of the United States during a national emergency requiring significant (currently, total) mobilization of the economy. Removes a provision prohibiting the National Defense Stockpile (NDS) from being used for budgetary purposes. Requires the handling, storage, security, maintenance, and disposal of materials in the NDS to be done in an environmentally sound manner. Allows materials in the NDS to be replaced by better materials when necessary to prevent deterioration. Allows materials to be timely disposed when becoming obsolete. Removes a current requirement limiting the President's acquisition of interests in real or personal property for storage, security, and maintenance of materials in the NDS to a 20-year period. Authorizes the President to loan NDS materials to Federal agencies when in the interest of national defense. Removes a prohibition against the obligation or appropriation of funds for the acquisition of materials in the NDS unless such funds have been authorized by law. Allows a disposal from the NDS (other than certain excepted disposals) to be made only if it has been included in the materials plan report currently required under Federal law, or the Congress has been properly notified. Removes a requirement prohibiting any disposal the effect of which would be an unobligated balance in the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund (NDS Fund) in excess of $100,000,000. Prohibits disposals from the NDS in any one fiscal year in excess of $1,000,000,000. Allows any proposed or new expenditures or disposals detailed in a materials plan for a fiscal year to be carried over to the materials plans for subsequent fiscal years. Allows money received from the sale and rotation of materials in the NDS to be used for general purposes of the NDS Fund. (Currently, moneys received from the sale of rotated materials may only be used for the acquisition of replacement material.) Adds to the authorized uses of the NDS Fund: (1) the contracting for materials development and research; (2) the purchase or purchase commitment of strategic and critical materials of domestic origin when needed for the NDS; and (3) the contracting or commitment to contract with domestic facilities for the upgrading, refining, or processing of materials in the NDS when necessary to convert such materials into a form more suitable for storage and subsequent disposition or use in a national emergency. Authorizes the President (currently, the NDS Manager) to barter materials in the stockpile in order to acquire, upgrade, refine, or process other materials. Repeals a Federal provision prohibiting the President from delegating his authority to dispose of stockpiled materials and to import strategic and critical materials from non-Communist countries. Adds the definition of \"significant change\" for purposes of a significant change proposed by the President to the Congress in the required annual materials plans. Repeals provisions of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1987 and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987 which require the President, during FY 1987 through 1933, to award contracts for the conversion of chromium and manganese ores held in the NDS into high carbon ferrochromium and high carbon ferromanganese. Authorizes the NDS Manager to: (1) revise quantities of materials to be stockpiled; and (2) dispose of such materials as authorized by law or as determined by the Manager to be in excess of current stockpile requirements."
