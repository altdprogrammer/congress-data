Requires each State which receives such a grant to report annually to the Congress on the number of individuals served by the program and the savings to the State and to such individuals resulting from implementation of the program. Directs the Secretary to evaluate such projects annually in a report to the Congress on project efficacy in meeting the health and retirement needs of participants. Requires such report to determine whether retirement and health planning could decrease Federal costs of health and assistance programs and improve the quality of life. Details the criteria for issuing such grants, as well as procedures for applying for them."
