    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-01-14", 
    "text": "Fairness in Politics Act of 1991 - Title I: Ban on Political Action Committees - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to declare that only an individual or a political committee may make contributions or expenditures for the purpose of influencing an election for Federal office. Declares that any political committee established, financed, maintained, or controlled by a candidate or Federal officeholder shall be deemed to be an authorized committee of such individual. Prohibits Federal election activities by any multicandidate political committee (PAC), except a political party national committee when designated by its presidential nominee, or a committee established solely for joint fundraising by several candidates. Limits to an aggregate of $1,000 any contribution to a candidate by a committee otherwise banned by this Act at any time the ban no longer has effect. Title II: Seed Money - Subtitle A: Challengers - States the maximum contributions which may be made by the congressional or senatorial campaign committee of a national political party. Subtitle B: Research - Permits national party congressional or senatorial campaign committees to make certain additional maximum contributions to an opposition research fund for the sole purpose of conducting research into the voting and other public records of the candidate's (incumbent) opponent. Title III: Truth in Incumbency - Provides that certain radio and television expenditures by a State or local committee of a political party made for the purpose of publicizing, before a primary election, the voting or other public record of an incumbent who is not a member of such party will not be considered an expenditure in connection with the general election campaign of a candidate. Title IV: Ban on Rollover of Campaign Funds - Provides that surplus campaign funds received as contributions by a candidate for either House of the Congress may be: (1) transferred to certain tax-exempt organizations; (2) refunded to contributors on a pro rata basis; or (3) paid into the Treasury to reduce the public debt. Requires that the disposition of surplus campaign funds be included on a specified semiannual post-election report. Prohibits a candidate for Federal office from transferring to the Federal office campaign funds raised in connection with a former State or local office campaign. Exempts specified maximum amounts from such proscription. Title V: Broadcast Provisions - Subtitle A: Free Time - Mandates that broadcast licensees make free broadcast time available to Senate candidates during a two-year Senate election cycle. Sets forth procedural guidelines. Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to report to the Congress on the effects of such free broadcast time. Subtitle B: Broadcast Discount - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to: (1) prohibit a broadcast licensee from denying or preempting use of the broadcast station to a candidate during certain periods preceding a primary or general election; and (2) require such licensee to certify under penalty of perjury that the charges made for such broadcast station use are at the lowest unit charge for the same amount of time for the same period. Title VI: Congressional Mass Mailings - Amends Federal postal law to set forth procedural guidelines under which Members of Congress shall receive a statement of costs and related expenses of congressional mass mailings. Requires quarterly publication of such expenses in the Congressional Record. Prohibits Members from sending franked mass mailings which exceed appropriated funds. Prohibits Members or Members-elect from mailing any mass mailing as franked mail: (1) during the calendar year of any primary or general election in which the Member is a candidate for reelection; or (2) in the case of a House Member or Member-elect who is a candidate for any other public office if the mailing is postmarked during the year (currently, fewer than 60 days before the election). Prohibits a congressional office from transferring any of its allocated official mail costs (franking privileges) to the office of a Member who is a candidate for Federal office. Title VII: Gerrymandering - Amends Federal law to prescribe guidelines for the reapportionment of Representatives and the establishment of congressional districts. Title VIII: Miscellaneous Provisions - Provides for the severability of this Act if any provision is declared invalid."
