Directs the Administrator, no later than October 1, 1992, to issue model rules under which competitions for such services will be conducted. Requires such rules to: (1) establish no fewer than three different model competition procedure formats; (2) require the submission of the competition program for each project to the Commission of Fine Arts for review and comment; (3) provide for appointment of a project competition adviser and appointment of a project competition jury by the National Endowment for the Arts, in consultation with the American Institute of Architects and the Administrator; (4) provide that each jury shall include a representative of the General Services Administration, the principal Federal agency that will occupy the project, and the American Institute of Architects; and (5) require the project jury to report its recommendations in writing with reasons for such recommendations. Increases from six percent to no more than eight percent of total contract costs that can be allocated for architectural and engineering services."
