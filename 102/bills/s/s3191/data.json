    "text": "Medicaid Coordinated Care Improvement Act of 1992 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to revise Medicaid requirements to provide States with more flexibility to use coordinated care programs. Adds new provisions to Medicaid respecting State use of coordinated care programs, including those that: (1) permit States to mandate enrollment of Medicaid-eligible individuals with program providers only if at least two risk contacting entities are available, or one such entity and a primary care case management entity, or two such case management entities; (2) mandate quality care reviews; and (3) provide for participation of federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics. Makes technical amendments to Medicaid respecting case management services and home- and community-based waivers. Provides that in the case of certain plan services prescribed under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act for children who are eligible for medical assistance under such plan, the State or local agency administering such plan is not required to take measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties under Medicaid for such services. Sets forth miscellaneous congressional reporting requirements respecting coordinated care programs and: (1) services for children with special needs; (2) public health services; (3) payments for hospital services; and (4) payments to risk contracting entities."
