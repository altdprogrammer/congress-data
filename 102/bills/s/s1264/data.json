Limits the number of Presidential appointees who may be of one political party. Requires that the Chairperson and Vice Chairperson: (1) be selected by the members of the Commission rather than designated by the President; and (2) serve three-year terms, with successive terms allowed. Mandates a fine or imprisonment for a person compensated by the Federal Government or a volunteer under provisions relating to Commission advisory committees who releases or uses in public evidence or testimony taken in executive session. Requires Commission members to receive compensation on an hourly rather than daily basis and limits their total annual compensation. Modifies the duties of the Commission. Mandates an annual report by the Commission to the Congress and the President. Authorizes the Commission to submit amicus curiae briefs to the Supreme Court. Removes provisions requiring the Commission to appraise Federal laws and policies with respect to equal protection of the laws involving Americans who are members of eastern- and southern-European ethnic groups. Requires the Executive Director (currently, staff director) of the Commission to be selected by the Commission rather than appointed by the President. Makes the Executive Director the chief operating officer of the Commission and sets the Executive Director's compensation. Provides for acceptance and use by the Commission of voluntary services, gifts, or donations. Authorizes cooperative agreements with Federal, State, and local agencies for public information programs and other activities. Sets forth the powers of Commission advisory committees.
