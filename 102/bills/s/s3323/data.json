Requires the Secretary of State to review all international commodity organizations to which the United States is a party. Directs the President to report to the Congress about international commodity organizations that are anticonsumer and to submit a plan to withdraw from such organizations. Requires the President, for each organization reviewed by the Secretary that is not covered in the congressional report, to certify to the Congress that U.S. membership in the organization would not result in: (1) prices which are artificially higher for American consumers than they would be in a free market; and (2) restraining the supply and availability of products to American consumers."
