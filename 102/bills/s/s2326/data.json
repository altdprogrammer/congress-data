Requires the head of such agency to dispose of the surface and subsurface estate to land in the same county as the land to be acquired, or if that is not feasible, in the same State. Subjects acquisition of land within a State to this Act if 25 percent or more of the land within the State is federally-owned. Excludes specified lands and properties from this Act. Authorizes the head of an agency to waive such land acquisition requirements during a declaration of war or national emergency."
