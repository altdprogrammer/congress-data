Prohibits such spoils of war from being transferred to any nation whose government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism. Requires the President to report to the appropriate congressional committees on spoils of war obtained during Operation Desert Shield or Operation Desert Storm that were transferred to any party."
