Requires rail carriers listing a railroad line for abandonment or discontinuance to make specified records and justifications available to government agencies or local governments. Grants lessees of property or facilities owned by a rail carrier proposing an abandonment or discontinuance elsewhere the right of first refusal to buy a facility served by the line to be abandoned or discontinued."
