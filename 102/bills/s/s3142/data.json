Earmarks specified FY 1993 funding for the defense inertial confinement fusion program. Prohibits the obligation of FY 1993 DOE funds for: (1) the design, purchase, or installation of any fire protection, cooling, or refrigeration system that utilizes class I chlorofluorocarbons unless the Secretary of Energy determines that an alternate system is not commercially available; or (2) the implementation of the reconfiguration of any nonnuclear DOE activities until the Secretary reports the results of certain analyses and certifications to the defense committees. Prohibits the use of FY 1993 new production reactor funding to close out the new production reactor program until 30 days after the Secretary has submitted to the defense committees a plan with respect to the completion of certain work in connection with such program. Subtitle B: Recurring General Provisions - Prohibits the use of funds appropriated pursuant to this title for the costs of a program exceeding 105 percent of the program authorization or $10,000,000 more than the amount authorized, whichever is less, or for programs which have not been presented to, or requested of, the Congress, unless the Secretary transmits to the defense committees a full and complete statement of the action proposed and 30 days have elapsed.

Allows for the transfer of funds from specified projects to other government agencies for the performance of work for which the funds were appropriated. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out advance planning and construction design services in connection with any proposed construction project if the total estimated cost for such services does not exceed $2,000,000.
