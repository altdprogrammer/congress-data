Designates an existing Treasury fund for real estate management activities as the Federal Buildings Fund. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) receive and deposit into the Fund amounts from rebates or other cash incentives related to energy savings; (2) accept goods or services provided in lieu of such cash incentives; (3) assign energy rebates to lessors of space to encourage installation of energy conservation technologies; and (4) obligate such deposited amounts and such accepted goods and services to promote energy management improvement programs and to encourage employees to participate in such programs by providing funding for employee benefit programs. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) receive and deposit into the Fund amounts from the sale of recycled materials; and (2) obligate such amounts to promote further source reduction and recycling programs and to encourage employee participation in such programs by providing funding for employee benefit programs. Requires funds to be distributed to agencies under this Act in proportion to recycling savings achieved or projected."
