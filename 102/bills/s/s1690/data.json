    "text": "Fire Administration Authorization Act of 1992 - Title I: United States Fire Administration - Amends the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 to authorize appropriations for FY 1992 through 1994. Sets forth priority activities for the United States Fire Administration in expending such funds. Requires the Administration to report to: (1) the Congress on such activities taken; and (2) specified congressional committees on its progress in implementing the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990, including amendments made by such Act. Revises provisions regarding listings of places (currently, certified places) of public accommodation to require each State, through its Governor or the Governor's designee, to submit to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency a list of those places of public accommodation affecting commerce located in the State which meet specified requirements. Makes an exception to the requirement that an automatic sprinkler system be installed in accordance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 13 or 13-R, as appropriate, in each place of public accommodation affecting commerce except those that are three stories or lower, with respect to those with an automatic sprinkler system installed before October 25, 1992, if such system is installed in compliance with an applicable standard (adopted by the governmental authority having jurisdiction, and in effect, at the time of installation) that required the placement of a sprinkler head in the sleeping area of each guest room. Specifies that such requirement shall not apply to a place of public accommodation affecting commerce to the extent that such place is subject to a standard that prevents compliance with a provision of NFPA Standard 13 or 13-R (in which case such place is exempt only from that specific provision). Prohibits the use of Federal funds for the construction or purchase of: (1) a federal employee office building of six or more stories unless during the period of occupancy by Federal employees the building is protected by an automatic sprinkler system or equivalent level of safety; and (2) any other Federal employee office building unless during the period of occupancy by Federal employees the hazardous areas of the building are protected by such a system. Bars the use of Federal funds (with exceptions) for the lease of: (1) a Federal employee office building of six or more stories, where at least some portion of the federally leased space is on the sixth floor or above and at least 35,000 square feet of space is federally occupied, unless during the period of occupancy by Federal employees the entire building is protected by an automatic sprinkler system or equivalent level of safety; and (2) any other Federal office building unless during the period of occupancy by Federal employees the hazardous areas of the entire building are protected by an automatic sprinkler system. Makes certain exceptions with respect to the lease of a building the construction of which is completed before the date of enactment where the leasing agency certifies that no suitable building with such systems is available at an affordable cost. Directs the Comptroller General to periodically audit a selection of such certifications and report to the Congress the results of such audit. Prohibits the use of Federal funds for the renovation of: (1) a Federal employee office building of six or more stories that is owned by the Government unless after that renovation such building is protected by an automatic sprinkler system; and (2) any other Federal employee office building owned by the Government unless after that renovation the hazardous areas of the building are protected by such systems. Bars the use of Federal funds for entering into or renewing a lease of: (1) a Federal employee office building of six or more stories that is renovated after the date of enactment, where at least some portion of the federally leased space is on the sixth floor or above and at least 35,000 square feet of space is federally occupied, unless after that renovation such building is protected by such a system; and (2) any other Federal employee office building that is renovated after such date, unless after that renovation the hazardous areas of the building are protected by such a system. Prohibits (with exceptions) the use of Federal funds for the construction, purchase, lease, or operation by the Government of housing in the United States for Federal employees or their dependents unless, in the case of: (1) a multifamily property acquired or rebuilt by the Government after the date of enactment, the housing is protected, before occupancy by Federal employees or their dependents, by such systems and hard-wired smoke detectors; and (2) in the case of any other housing, the housing, before occupancy by the first Federal employees (or their dependents) who do not occupy such housing as of such date or the expiration of three years after such date, whichever occurs first, is protected by hard-wired smoke detectors. Specifies that housing assistance may not be used in connection with any newly constructed multifamily property unless after the new construction such property is protected by an automatic sprinkler system and hard-wired smoke detectors. Prohibits housing assistance from being used in connection with any rebuilt multifamily property unless, after the rebuilding, such property complies with the chapter on existing apartment buildings of NFPA Standard 101 (Life Safety Code), as in effect at the earlier of the time of approval by the Department of Housing and Urban Development of the specific plan or budget for rebuilding or the time that a binding commitment is made to provide housing assistance for the rebuilt property. Specifies that if any rebuilt multifamily property is subject to, and in compliance with, any provision of a State or local fire safety standard or code that prevents compliance with a specific provision of NFPA Standard 101, such requirement shall not apply with respect to such specific provision. Bars housing assistance, after the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on the date of enactment, from being used in connection with any other dwelling unit, unless the unit is protected by a hard-wired or battery-operated smoke detector. Directs: (1) the head of any Federal agency that owns, leases, or operates a building or housing unit with Federal funds to invite the local agency or voluntary organization having responsibility for fire protection in the jurisdiction where the building or housing unit is located to prepare, and biennially review, a pre-fire plan for the building or housing unit; (2) the Administrator of General Services, within three years, to report to the Congress on the level of fire safety in Federal employee office buildings subject to fire safety requirements under the Act; and (3) each Federal agency providing housing to Federal employees or housing assistance, within ten years, to report to the Congress on the progress of that agency in implementing provisions prohibiting the use of Federal funds for the construction, purchase, lease or operation by the Government of housing in the United States for Federal employees or their dependents, and on plans for continuing such implementation. Requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to: (1) conduct a study and report to the Congress on the use, in combination, of fire detection systems, fire suppression systems, and compartmentation; and (2) obtain funding from non-Federal sources in an amount equal to 25 percent of the cost of the study. Sets forth additional funding requirements. Title II: National Fallen Firefighters Foundation - National Fallen Firefighters Foundation Act - Establishes the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation, as a charitable, nonprofit corporation to be organized under the laws of the State of Maryland, to: (1) encourage, accept, and administer private gifts of property for the benefit of the National Fallen Firefighters' Memorial and the annual memorial service associated with it; (2) provide financial assistance to families of fallen firefighters for transportation to and lodging at non-Federal facilities during the annual memorial service; (3) assist State and local efforts to recognize firefighters who die in the line of duty; and (4) provide scholarships and other financial assistance for educational purposes and job training for the spouses and children of fallen firefighters. Sets forth administrative, audit, and reporting requirements. Authorizes the Attorney General to petition in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for equitable relief if the Foundation: (1) engages in, or threatens to engage in, any act, practice, or policy that is inconsistent with the purposes of the Act; or (2) refuses, fails, or neglects to discharge its obligations under this title, or threatens to do so. Specifies that the United States shall not be liable for any debts, defaults, acts, or omissions of the Foundation nor shall the full faith and credit of the United States extend to any obligation of the Foundation. Workers' Family Protection Act - Requires the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to conduct a study to evaluate the potential for, the prevalence of, and the issues related to the contamination of workers' homes with hazardous chemicals and substances, including infectious agents, transported from the workplace of such workers. Directs the Director, in conducting such study and evaluation, to: (1) conduct a review of past incidents of home contamination; (2) evaluate current statutory, regulatory, and voluntary industrial hygiene or other measures used by small, medium, and large employers to prevent or remediate home contamination; (3) compile a summary of the existing research and case histories conducted on incidents of employee transported contaminant releases; (4) identify the role of Federal and State agencies in responding to incidents of home contamination; (5) prepare and submit to the Workers' Family Protection Task Force (established by this Act) and to the appropriate congressional committees a report concerning the results of the matters studied or evaluated; and (6) study home contamination incidents and issues and worker and family protection policies and practices related to the special circumstances or firefighters, and report on the findings to the appropriate congressional committees. Requires the Director to establish the Task Force. Sets forth provisions regarding the Task Force's composition, duties, investigative strategy, and peer review. Directs each Federal agency or department, upon completion of the investigative strategy, to fulfill the role assigned to it by the strategy. Requires the Secretary of Labor, within four years, to: (1) determine if additional education about, emphasis on, or enforcement of existing regulations or standards is needed and will be sufficient, or if additional regulations or standards are needed to protect workers and their families from employee transported releases of hazardous materials; and (2) prepare and submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report concerning the results of such determination. Directs such Secretary, upon a determination that additional regulations or standards are needed, to promulgate such regulations or standards within three years of that determination. Authorizes appropriations."
