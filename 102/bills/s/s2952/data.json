    "text": "Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1992 - Authorizes the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to make grants to States and political subdivisions for programs that require or encourage individuals under age 16 to wear approved bicycle helmets. Directs the Administrator to allow grantees to use wide discretion in designing programs that effectively promote increased bicycle helmet use. Specifies that such grants may be used to: (1) enforce a law that requires such individuals to wear approved bicycle helmets; (2) assist individuals in acquiring helmets; and (3) develop and administer a program to educate bicycle riders and their families on the importance of wearing helmets to improve safety. Designates interim standards for bicycle helmets. Provides that: (1) a helmet that does not conform to an interim standard shall be considered in violation of a consumer product safety (CPS) standard promulgated under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA); and (2) the final standard shall be considered a CPS standard. Directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to begin a proceeding to review the requirements of the interim standards and establish a final standard that includes provisions to protect against the risk of helmets coming off the heads of bicycle riders and to address the risk of injury to children. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Fastener Quality Act to provide that a manufacturer shall be deemed to have demonstrated that the chemical characteristics of a lot conform to the standards and specifications to which the manufacturer represents such lot has been manufactured if: (1) the coil or heat number of metal from which such lot was fabricated has been inspected and tested with respect to its chemical characteristics by a laboratory accredited in accordance with the procedures and conditions specified by the Secretary of Commerce under such Act; (2) such laboratory has provided to the manufacturer, either directly or through the metal manufacturer, a written inspection and testing report in a form prescribed by the Secretary listing the chemical characteristics of such coil or heat number; (3) such report indicates that the chemical characteristics of such coil or heat number conform to those required by the standards and specifications to which the manufacturer represents such lot has been manufactured; and (4) the manufacturer demonstrates that such lot has been fabricated from the coil or heat number of metal to which such report relates. Directs the Secretary, in prescribing the form of report required, to provide for an alternative to a statement pertaining to chemical characteristics required under such Act (as to whether, based on the samples provided as representative of the lot, such lot has been found after inspection and testing to conform to such standards and specifications)."
