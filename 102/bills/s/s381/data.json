    "text": "Economic Growth and Jobs Creation Act of 1991 - Title I: Reducing the Cost of Labor by Reducing Social Security Taxes - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI) tax on employees and employers, and on self-employment income. Amends the Social Security Act to remove the required increase in appropriations to the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund beginning after 1999. Requires the Board of Trustees of the Social Security trust funds (the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund) to include in its annual report to the Congress the expected operation and status of such trust funds during the next ten fiscal years (currently, the next five fiscal years). Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to modify procedures in the House of Representatives and the Senate relating to changing OASDI taxes and benefits during the ten-year period. Amends the Social Security Act to provide that if any annual report of the Board of Trustees projects that the trust funds will not be in the close actuarial balance on average for the succeeding ten fiscal years, then the Congress may not adjourn before enactment of legislation to restore such close actuarial balance. Requires the first Advisory Council on Social Security appointed after the date of enactment of this Act to: (1) evaluate the expected operation and status of the trust funds after FY 2015; and (2) conduct a review of alternative approaches to preserving a close actuarial balance of such trust funds. Title II: Reducing the Cost of Capital by Reducing Capital Gains Tax Rates, Indexing the Basis of Certain Assets, and Adjusting Depreciation Rates to Reflect Inflation - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce the individual and corporate capital gains rate from 34 percent to 15 percent. Reduces such tax to 7.5 percent for low- and middle-income taxpayers. Provides for the phaseout of personal exemptions and the overall limitation on itemized deductions to take into account adjusted gross income which has been reduced by net capital gain. Requires indexing, based on the gross national product deflator, of the adjusted basis of certain assets (corporate stock and tangible property that is a capital asset of property used in a trade or business) that have been held for more than one year at the time of sale or other transfer, solely for the purpose of determining gain or loss. Provides for indexing the limitation on capital losses of noncorporate taxpayers. Provides a depreciation deduction adjustment for tangible property (other than residential rental property and nonresidential real property) placed in service after 1990. Allows phase-in deductions for such property placed in service after 1996. Title III: Increasing National Savings Through Individual Retirement Plus Accounts, Indexing for Inflation the Income Thresholds for Taxing Social Security Benefits, Inc. - Allows individuals to establish individual retirement plus accounts with tax treatment similar to that for individual retirement plans. Makes contributions to such accounts nondeductible. Provides for qualified distributions from such accounts, other than for general retirement purposes, including special purposes distributions made for the purchase of a first home and for medical or educational purposes. Prohibits special purpose distributions from being made during the first five years of the account. Provides an inflation adjustment after 1996 for income thresholds in determining the taxation of social security benefits. Excludes income from individual retirement plans when determining modified adjusted gross income. Provides an inflation adjustment after 1996 for the maximum amount allowable as a deduction for retirement savings."
