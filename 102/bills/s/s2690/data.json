    "text": "Defense Workers' Benefits Protection Act of 1992 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Public Health Service Act to mandate health plan continuation coverage when there is a termination or reduction in hours as a result of the termination or curtailment of a defense contract. Regulates premiums for the continuation coverage. Terminates continuation coverage when coverage exists through a spouse. Allows the employee to elect lower cost benefit coverage if such coverage is offered by the employer to its other employees. Requires that related subsidies under the Acts be paid out of amounts appropriated under the Defense Economic Adjustment, Diversification, Conversion, and Stabilization Act of 1990."
