    "text": "Fair Lending Enforcement Act of 1991 - Amends the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to require that, upon the loan applicant's written request, each creditor shall furnish a copy of the appraisal report used in connection with the application for a loan secured by a lien on residential real property. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Federal Credit Union Act to mandate that each appropriate Federal banking agency: (1) establish a separate consumer compliance program the head of which shall report directly to the head of the agency; and (2) conduct a separate on-site consumer compliance examination of each insured depository. Authorizes such banking agency to consider the size of the depository institution and the complexity of the consumer compliance examination issues presented when it determines whether to assign an examiner who exclusively conducts such examinations or an examiner who has only received specialized training in such examinations. Requires the head of the consumer compliance program to furnish the Congress with an annual status report. Amends the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to require specified regulatory agencies to refer cases to the Attorney General or at least notify the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development concerning violations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Amends the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act to authorize the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to exempt certain depository institutions from home mortgage disclosure requirements."
