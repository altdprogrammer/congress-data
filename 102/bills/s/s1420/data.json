    "date": "1991-06-28", 
    "text": "Small Bank Paperwork Reduction Act - Title I: Community Reinvestment Act Amendments - Amends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to modify evaluations for small and mid-sized banking institutions. Sets forth limited reporting requirements for small institutions. Authorizes mid-sized institutions to elect to adhere to a community reinvestment plan approved by the appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency. Prohibits such an agency from requiring a regulated financial institution to collect, prepare, file, or maintain data on lending or deposit patterns according to geographic location in order to assess such institution's compliance with this Act. Amends the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978 to establish an Appeals Panel to consider appeals brought by aggrieved institutions. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to specify a maximum period of time which may elapse between the submission of an application to borrow money for residential real estate and the provision of a special information booklet. (Current provisions require such booklet to be provided at the time of receipt or preparation of the application.) Amends the Truth in Lending Act to remove the condition for modifying or waiving the right of rescission in certain consumer credit transactions that such modification or waiver be necessary to permit homeowners to meet bona fide personal financial emergencies. Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 to remove the required 45-day period to notify a homeowner of loan delinquency. Amends the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 to modify the mortgage disclosure requirement for branch offices in primary metropolitan statistical areas. Provides that insured depository institutions shall not be required to fulfill reporting requirements other than those required under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975. Restricts a bank holding company with limited assets to semiannual filing or consolidated or parent-company-only financial statements. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to exclude certain institutions from requirements to aggregate daily deposits to one account for currency transaction reports. Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 to provide that the services of certified and licensed real estate appraisers shall not be required for federally-related transactions having a value less than $100,000. Requires each appropriate Federal banking agency to complete an evaluation of its respective rules and regulations to determine whether any paperwork or reporting requirements are duplicative, obsolete, or unnecessarily burdensome for the purpose of reducing such requirements."
