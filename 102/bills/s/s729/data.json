Makes such funds available to small communities for the construction of wastewater treatment works, public water systems, and solid waste management facilities and for assuring that underground storage tanks are in compliance with the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Sets forth provisions concerning grant payment schedules and allotment and reallotment requirements. Requires States to establish revolving funds to receive such grants. Sets forth specific requirements for the use of such funds and for the loans and grants to be provided to small communities. Permits States to provide assistance only to community wastewater treatment and solid waste management facilities and public water systems that are in compliance with plans under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as appropriate. Requires States to submit plans to the Administrator that identify the intended use of the revolving funds. Directs States to reserve the greater of one percent of fund sums or $100,000 to carry out planning. Provides for the withholding of grant payments if a State is not in compliance with this Act's requirements. Requires the Administrator to establish an Office of Small Community Environmental Infrastructure Assistance to: (1) oversee and manage the grants and funds made under this title; and (2) provide specified environmental and financial information to small communities. Authorizes the Office to provide grants to States and not-for-profit organizations to assist small communities in assessing issues related to the financing of environmental facilities, compliance with environmental laws, and the construction, operation, and rehabilitation of environmental infrastructure facilities. Requires such grants to be matched by non-Federal funds. Authorizes and allocates appropriations. Title II: Environmental Infrastructure Facilities for Economically Distressed Areas - Establishes an Office of Community Environmental Infrastructure Assistance within the Directorate of Civil Works of the Office of the Chief of Engineers to implement this title. Makes funds provided under this title available for the construction of wastewater treatment works, public water systems, and solid waste management facilities. Provides that such funds shall be available only for environmental infrastructure projects serving less than 25,000 persons that are located in economically distressed areas. Authorizes State Governors to submit State Priority Project Plans to the Secretary of the Army. Directs the Secretary to submit annual Economically Distressed Area Environmental Infrastructure Assistance Plans to the Congress. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into local cooperation agreements to provide for the planning, design, and construction of environmental infrastructure projects. Requires the Secretary to assure that local cooperation agreements are signed for a project from each State submitting a Priority Project Plan. Requires the Administrator to publish guidelines for the design of wastewater treatment, public water supply, and solid waste disposal facilities pursuant to this title. Provides for the review and revision of such guidelines at least every five years. Directs the Secretary to establish an Office of Environmental Infrastructure Assistance. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Financing of Public Owned Treatment Works - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize owners of publicly owned treatment works to issue debt with respect to any treatment works that has received financial assistance under such Act and to pledge, as security for repayment of such debt obligation, revenues realized from the operation of the treatment works, subject to the prior payment of the costs of proper operation and maintenance. Permits such financing only if at least 95 percent of the proceeds of the debt issuance will be used for: (1) the construction portion of a program for the rehabilitation or expansion of the treatment works; or (2) the establishment of financial mechanisms to subsidize or stabilize rates, provide for equipment repair or replacement, or provide for other uses that benefit the ratepayers of the treatment works. Authorizes such financing only if the owner of the treatment works obtains a prior determination from the State agency responsible for administering the State water pollution control revolving fund that the proceeds will be used for such purposes. Permits State water pollution control revolving funds to be used to guarantee, or purchase insurance or letters of credit for, local obligations for equipment, facilities, or plants to be used in conjunction with treatment works."
