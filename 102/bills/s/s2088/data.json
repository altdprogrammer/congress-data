    "text": "Beringian Heritage International Park Act of 1991 - Establishes the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve in Alaska as part of an international park to be known as the Beringian Heritage International Park upon: (1) enactment by the proper authority of the Soviet Union of a similar provision respecting its Far East portion of Beringia; and (2) proclamation of the President of the United States, which is authorized by this Act. Establishes a Beringian Heritage International Park Advisory Commission, effective upon issuance of such presidential proclamation, to advise the Secretary of the Interior and the Park's Soviet administrative authority on matters pertaining to the identification, protection, and preservation of the Park's natural and cultural heritage. Terminates the Commission ten years after the date of the presidential proclamation establishing the Park. Authorizes the Secretary and the Park's Soviet administrative authority to extend it for an additional five-year period if both parties determine that there is a continuing need for the Commission's advisory services. Authorizes appropriations."
