    "text": "Child Abuse, Domestic Violence, Adoption and Family Services Act of 1992 - Title I: Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act - Subtitle A: General Provisions - Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (the Act, for purposes of this title) to set forth findings with respect to prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect. Subtitle B: General Program - Revises title I (General Program) provisions of the Act for the Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect (the Board). Requires the Board, within 24 months after enactment of this Act, to submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the appropriate congressional committees a report containing the Board's recommendations with respect to: (1) a national policy to reduce and ultimately prevent child and youth maltreatment-related deaths, detailing appropriate roles and responsibilities for State and local governments and the private sector; (2) specific changes needed in Federal laws and programs to achieve an effective Federal role in implementing such policy; and (3) specific changes needed to improve national data collection with respect to such deaths. Authorizes appropriations for the Board for FY 1992 through 1995. Revises provisions for research and assistance activities of the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect. Requires such research to include: (1) cultural distinctions relating to child abuse and neglect; (2) culturally sensitive procedures with respect to child abuse cases; and (3) the relationship of child abuse and neglect to cultural diversity. Requires that State child abuse and neglect reporting information, for purposes of such research, be: (1) universal and case specific, to the extent practical; and (2) integrated with other case-based foster care and adoption data collected by the Secretary. Requires that peer review panels, for such research grants and contracts, be composed of members who are: (1) experts in the field of child abuse and neglect or related disciplines, with appropriate expertise in the application to be reviewed; and (2) not officers or employees of the Office of Human Development. Requires such panels to meet as often as necessary, but not less than once a year. Requires such panels to make recommendations on application approval. Directs the Secretary to select projects to be awarded such grants and contracts from among those determined to have merit by such panels. Revises provisions for grants and contracts to public agencies and nonprofit private organizations for demonstration or service programs and projects. Requires all such demonstration projects to be evaluated for their effectiveness (with evaluation funding to be provided as a stated percentage of the grant or contract or as a separate grant or contract to evaluate a particular project or group of projects). Includes under discretionary grant training programs projects to improve recruitment, selection, and training of volunteers. Revises provisions for development and operation grants to require the Secretary of HHS to make grants to States, based on relative population of children under age 18 in applicant States, for improving each such State's child protective service system in carrying out specified activities. (Replaces provisions which authorized the Secretary to make grants to States for developing, strengthening, and carrying out child abuse and neglect prevention and treatment programs.) Requires, as a condition for State eligibility for such grants, annual submission to the Secretary of a State program plan which specifies the child protective service system area or areas (from among the specified activities) that the State intends to address with such grant funds. Sets forth required plan contents with respect to the specified areas and activities of: (1) intake and screening; (2) investigation of reports; (3) case management and delivery of ongoing family services; (4) general system enhancement; and/or (5) innovative approaches for developing, strengthening, and carrying out child abuse and neglect prevention, treatment, and research programs (limits to 15 percent of such funds the amount that may be used for innovative approaches). Requires, with respect to some of such areas of activity, information on staffing, training, public education, response time, interagency coordination, legal representation, automation, assessment tools, and information and referral services. (Replaces provisions for waivers of State eligibility requirements.) Delays the effective date of such new requirements until the earlier of October 1, 1993, or October 1 of the first fiscal year for which a specified minimum amount is appropriated for: (1) grants to States for child abuse and neglect prevention and treatment programs (the development and operations grants); and (2) technical assistance to States for such programs. Extends through FY 1995 the authorization of appropriations for the emergency child abuse prevention services grant program. Revises provisions for grants to States for programs relating to the investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases to include cases of: (1) neglect; (2) sexual exploitation; and (3) suspected child abuse or neglect related fatalities. Requires annual reports on such grant expenditures. Revises requirements for State eligibility and for State task forces. Extends through FY 1995 the authorization of appropriations for title I (General Program) of the Act (except the emergency grant program which has a separate authorization). Reserves one-third of such funds for: (1) the national clearinghouse for information relating to child abuse; (2) research and assistance activities of the Center; and (3) grants to public and private nonprofit entities for demonstration or service programs or projects (including grants for resource centers and discretionary grants). Reserves two-thirds of such funds for: (1) grants to States for child abuse and neglect prevention and treatment programs (development and operation grants); and (2) technical assistance to States for such programs.
