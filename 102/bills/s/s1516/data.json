Title II: Preservation of Disability Ratings - Provides that a current Federal provision protecting from reduction a veteran's total (100 percent) disability rating after it has been in effect for 20 years or more shall not apply when: (1) such rating is combined with any other disability rating to provide a higher total rate of compensation; and (2) such total disability rating was based on the unemployability of the individual and the individual has engaged in gainful employment during the period when such rating was in force. Title III: Renouncement of Right to Benefits - Provides that a new application for pension or parents' dependency and indemnity compensation filed within one year after a renouncement of the right to such benefits shall not be treated as an original application (for income-computation purposes) and benefits will be payable as if the renouncement had not occurred. Title IV: Communications Concerning Benefits - Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to suspend benefit payments to payees who fail or refuse to: (1) provide a current mailing address; or (2) cooperate in the establishment of another appropriate method of communication for the provision of notices concerning benefits and verification of continued eligibility for such benefits."
