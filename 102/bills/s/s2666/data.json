    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Education (Secretary), for purposes of computing the amount which a local educational agency (LEA) is entitled to receive from the Government for military-connected children in each fiscal year, to determine: (1) for each LEA receiving assistance, the number of children who reside on military installations, have parents employed on such installations, and had a parent who was on active duty in the uniformed services; and (2) the total amount of payments all LEAs are entitled to receive. Requires the Secretary of Defense to transfer (from any amounts available to him) to the Secretary in each fiscal year the total amount of funds necessary for the Secretary to make all required payments to LEAs for such fiscal year, subject to specified limitations (including that funds distributed to such LEAs be consistent with shifting only the funding responsibility for such military-connected children from the Department of Education to the Department of Defense). Sets forth formulas for determining the amount of the entitlement of an LEA for a fiscal year with respect to: (1) children with disabilities (currently, and children with specific learning disabilities for whom a determination is made under provisions related to children who had a parent who was on active duty in the uniformed services); and (2) military-connected children with disabilities and for whom such LEA is providing a program designed to meet the special and related needs of such children."
