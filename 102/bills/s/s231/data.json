    "text": "Prohibits the following actions until the President makes a specified certification to the Congress under this Act: (1) the financing of exports to the Soviet Union by the Export-Import Bank; (2) the financing of agricultural commodities to the Soviet Union contracted for or approved after January 16, 1991, by the Commodity Credit Corporation; (3) the granting of most-favored-nation treatment to the Soviet Union and the effectuation of any commercial agreement with the Soviet Union; (4) the approval for export to the Soviet Union of any item controlled for national security purposes under any agreement reached after January 16, 1991, with the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) which liberalizes such controls; and (5) the waiver or modification of restrictions contained in the Charter of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) applicable to loans to the Soviet Union and the support of EBRD loans to the Soviet Union. Suspends the U.S.-Soviet energy working group and technical assistance in energy, science, and technology to the Soviet Union until the certification is made. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the President should not attend the summit meeting with the President of the Soviet Union scheduled for February 1991; (2) the President should extend recognition to the democratically-elected governments of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia and should exchange ambassadors with such governments; and (3) the Secretary of the Treasury should instruct the U.S. executive directors of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to oppose the granting of special association status to the Soviet Union. Describes the certification referred to in this Act as a certification that: (1) the Soviet Union has ceased the threat and use of force against the Baltic States; (2) the central Soviet Government has entered into negotiations with the Baltic governments leading to the formal recognition of independence of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia; and (3) all Soviet-controlled troops have been withdrawn from such nations."
