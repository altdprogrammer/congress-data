Directs the Secretary to contract with non-Department facilities in order to continue such care to such eligible persons at the same level. Requires the Secretary of Defense to reimburse the Secretary for the difference, if any, between the cost of providing such care and services by contract and the cost of providing such care or services in medical facilities of the Department. States that all direct or discretionary spending contained in this Act is to be considered an emergency expenditure related to Operation Desert Shield for purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act)."
