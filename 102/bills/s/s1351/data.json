Authorizes such partnerships with colleges and universities, industry, and other Federal agencies. Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to establish a career path program for the recruitment of promising and gifted employees of DOE's national laboratories to serve in critical and other positions as a stage in realizing the full potential that such employees contribute to the strategic defense and energy security posture of the United States. Increases the number of Under Secretaries in DOE from one to three, and the number of Assistant Secretaries from eight to 11."
