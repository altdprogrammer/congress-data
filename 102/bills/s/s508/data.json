Requires payment for the screening costs for such women to be made from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund under part A. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to implement procedures to: (1) regularly notify all eligible individuals of this new benefit and other Medicare-covered preventative services; (2) annually compile and make available directories of certified screening providers in each State; and (3) promote the appropriate use of mammography screening services."
