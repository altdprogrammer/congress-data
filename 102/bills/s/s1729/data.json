Defines \"drug\" to include a drug as defined under the Social Security Act and any over-the-counter drug, birth control device, or vaccine dispensed through certain entities. Provides for negotiation of certain drug purchase contracts. Mandates development and implementation of: (1) a process for certification of entities as eligible to receive the discounts; and (2) a bid process to establish a prime vendor program under which covered entities compensate wholesalers for distribution and related services to facilitate drug purchases to which discounts will apply. Prohibits requiring a manufacturer to pay a rebate under specified provisions of the Social Security Act or other Government program if the manufacturer has provided a discount under these provisions. Prohibits an entity from reselling a drug or biological for which it has received a discount. Requires waiver of these provisions if the number of manufacturers that have entered into agreements under this Act is comparable to the number of manufacturers providing rebates under certain provisions of the Social Security Act. Sets forth dispute resolution procedures."
