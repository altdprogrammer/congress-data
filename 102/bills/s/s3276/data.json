    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-09-25", 
    "text": "Anti-Auto Theft Act - Title I: Motor Vehicle Theft Resistance - Motor Vehicle Theft Resistance Act - Prohibits any person from knowingly manufacturing for sale, selling, leasing, offering for sale or lease, delivering for introduction in interstate commerce, or importing into the United States for sale any new motor vehicle which incorporates: (1) any steering column that is not shielded in a manner that adequately prevents theft, in accordance with regulations promulgated under this title; or (2) any other component or design feature specifically identified in such regulations that, if included as a part of a motor vehicle, would physically facilitate the vehicle's theft and create an unreasonable risk of such theft. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to waive such requirements for any lines of motor vehicles which are equipped as standard equipment with an antitheft device which the Secretary determines is likely to be equally effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft, subject to specified limitations. Prohibits the import of any motor vehicle not in compliance with such provisions, with exceptions. Establishes civil penalties for violations. Sets forth provisions regarding the assessment, collection, and compromise of penalties, deductions from sums owed by the United States to the person charged, and separate violations for each vehicle unlawfully sold, leased, offered for sale or lease, delivered, or imported. Directs the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to promulgate regulations to implement this title, including the establishment of effective dates that provide affected persons with sufficient time to comply. Makes such regulations inapplicable to any vehicle which is intended solely for export and which is exported. Title II: Tougher Law Enforcement Against Automobile Theft - Amends the Federal criminal code to impose (carjacking) penalties upon whoever: (1) by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes or attempts to take from the person or presence of another a motor vehicle that has been transported, shipped, or received in interstate or foreign commerce; and (2) in committing such an offense, assaults or jeopardizes the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device. Increases penalties for: (1) the importation or exportation of stolen motor vehicles, off-highway mobile equipment, vessels, or aircraft; and (2) trafficking in stolen vehicles. Title III: Export of Stolen Motor Vehicles - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the Commissioner of Customs to direct customs officers to conduct random inspections of motor vehicles and shipping containers that may contain motor vehicles that are being exported, to determine whether such vehicles were stolen. Directs the Commissioner to: (1) require all persons or entities exporting used motor vehicles by air or ship, including motor vehicles exported for personal use, to provide to the Customs Service, at least 72 hours before the export, the vehicle identification number (VIN) of each such motor vehicle and proof of ownership; (2) check all such VINs against the information in the National Crime Information Center to determine whether any motor vehicle intended for export has been reported stolen; and (3) make available to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, at the Director's request, all such VINs. Title IV: Auto Theft Task Force Grants - Requires the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to make grants to Auto Theft Task Forces submitting applications in compliance with this title. Sets forth application requirements. Requires the Director to select grantees on a competitive basis, based on the quality of the applicant's plan for addressing motor vehicle theft and the severity of the problem in the geographical areas to be covered in the plan. Provides for grant renewal. Authorizes appropriations. Title V: Reducing Juvenile Auto Theft Through Mentoring Programs - Amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to add a new title, the Juvenile Mentoring Program (JUMP) Act of 1992, to require the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to make grants to local educational agencies and nonprofit organizations to implement mentoring programs. Specifies that a mentoring program funded under such title shall be a program providing to eligible children assistance: (1) designed to link children in high crime areas with adult law enforcement officers and other responsible adults; and (2) intended to achieve specified goals, such as to provide general guidance to eligible children, promote personal and social responsibility among such children, discourage criminal activity, and encourage eligible children's participation in community service. Directs the Administrator to develop and distribute to program participants specific model guidelines for the screening of prospective program mentors. Sets forth: (1) application requirements and selection criteria; (2) eligible and prohibited uses of grant funds; and (3) reporting, auditing, and monitoring requirements. Authorizes appropriations. Title VI: Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention - Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Act - Directs the Attorney General to develop a national voluntary motor vehicle theft prevention program under which: (1) the owner of a motor vehicle may voluntarily sign a consent form with a participating State or locality in which the motor vehicle owner states that the vehicle is not normally operated under specified conditions and agrees to display program decals or devices on the owner's vehicle and permit law enforcement officials in any State to stop the vehicle and take reasonable steps to determine whether such vehicle is being operated by the owner or with the owner's permission, if the vehicle is being operated under such conditions; and (2) participating States and localities authorize law enforcement officials in the State or locality to stop motor vehicles displaying program decals or devices under such conditions and take reasonable steps to determine whether the vehicle is being operated by or with the permission of the owner. Requires such program to include a uniform design or designs for decals or other devices to be displayed by motor vehicles participating in the program which shall: (1) be highly visible; and (2) explicitly state that the motor vehicle to which it is affixed may be stopped under the specified conditions without additional grounds for establishing a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle is being operated unlawfully. Sets forth requirements with respect to the voluntary consent form. Directs the Attorney General to promulgate rules establishing the conditions under which participating motor vehicles may be authorized to be stopped under this Act, such as the operation of the vehicle during certain hours of the day or under circumstances that would provide a sufficient basis for establishing a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle was not being operated by, or with the consent of, the owner. Prohibits such conditions from being based on race, creed, color, national origin, gender, or age. Sets forth provisions with respect to the establishment of more than one set of conditions under which participating motor vehicles may be stopped. Requires the notification of lessees of motor vehicles for hire of participation in the program, as specified. Sets penalties for failure to comply with such notice provisions. Specifies that, as a condition of participation, a State or locality must agree to take reasonable steps to ensure that law enforcement officials throughout the State or locality are familiar with the program and with the conditions under which motor vehicles may be stopped under the program. Authorizes appropriations. Includes within the scope of a provision setting penalties for removing or tampering with an identification number for a motor vehicle, a motor vehicle part, or a decal or device affixed pursuant to this Act, with exceptions. Sets forth penalties for the unauthorized application of a theft prevention decal or device, or a replica thereof."
