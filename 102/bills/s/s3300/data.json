Requires such State to provide a mechanism for the enrollment of individuals entitled to health benefits purchased through a HIPC, as well as the issuance of a State health insurance card for use in identification and claims processing. States that each State HIPC program: (1) shall not impose a minimum residency requirement for entitlement in excess of three months; (2) shall provide continuation of services for individuals moving to another State until a minimum period of residency is established in the latter State; and (3) shall provide for the payment of health care services to individuals temporarily absent from the State.

Provides funding to the Benefits Board through an annual AHP registration fee. Requires the Board to provide for the initial organization of a Health Insurance Standards Board (Insurance Board) to make recommendations to the Board concerning the standards for AHPs and HIPCs, and the treatment of uniform effective health benefits and expenses in excess of accountable health plan costs. Requires the Insurance Board to also ensure the financial viability of AHPs and resolve conflicts between AHPs and consumers in the delivery of the uniform set of effective benefits. Provides funding to the Insurance Board through an annual AHP registration fee.

Outlines HIPC requirements. Requires each HIPC to be governed by a Board of Directors to oversee the functioning of all HIPCs within such State, provide expertise, coordinate HIPC activities among districts, and resolve disputes arising in the implementation of this Act. Requires each HIPC to: (1) enter into agreements with AHPs and employers; (2) enroll individuals under AHPs; (3) receive and forward adjusted premiums for plan enrollment; (4) coordinate with other HIPCs; (5) engage in education and outreach efforts to inform the public about the HIPC coordinated buying program; (6) solicit bids and negotiate with AHPs to make available health benefit plans through the coordinated buying program and one or more HIPCs; and (7) prepare and disseminate the documentation required by Federal agencies to certify participation in the coordinated program.

Prohibits an AHP from denying, limiting, or conditioning the coverage under its plan based on the health status, claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, or lack of evidence of insurability of an individual. Allows an AHP to exclude coverage for a previous condition, but limits such exclusion to six months.

Part 2: Preemption from State Laws for Accountable Health Plans - Preempts any State law which is different from the uniform set of effective benefits established by the Board under this Act, as well as any State law restricting network plans or utilization review programs. Subtitle D: Treatment of Areas of Ineffective Competition - Requires the Board, if it determines that there is ineffective price competition in the provision of health services within the uniform set of effective benefits in an area of a State, to authorize the State HIPC to establish reimbursement benchmarks to be used in the determination of rates to be charged by providers of services in such area until the Board finds that effective price competition exists. Subtitle E: Definitions - Provides definitions. Title III: Uniform Effective Health Benefits - Requires the Board to annually specify the uniform set of effective benefits for the next fiscal year to apply in all States.

Requires specific treatments, procedures, and care to be left up to the individual AHP. Provides for the inclusion and exclusion of specified services within the uniform set of effective benefits. Requires the Board to entitle every eligible individual under an AHP to payment for such covered services. Title IV: Application of Antitrust Laws - Exempts from the antitrust laws the action of two or more hospitals negotiating a proposed agreement to share expensive medical services or high technology equipment. Requires, for such exemption, such hospitals to submit an application to the Board describing the particulars of such agreement, Board approval, and Board issuance of a waiver from the antitrust laws for such agreement. Allows the revocation of such waiver in specified circumstances. Title V: Cost Control and Financing - Subtitle A: Health Budgets - Requires the Board to: (1) establish an annual fiscal year budget of expenditures; (2) compute the national average per capita cost for each of the health care services included in the expenditures; (3) designate a series of risk groups, by age, sex, and other factors, for health care services and costs; (4) develop for each State HIPC a factor to adjust the national average per capita costs for each risk group; (5) determine total projected expenditures for each State HIPC for each covered health service; (6) determine the appropriate Federal contribution for each State for total projected expenditures; and (7) make appropriate subsequent calculations to adjust the budgets, estimates, and contributions. Requires each State to raise the revenues necessary to cover its share specified in the national health budget established by the Board. Subtitle B: Funding - Directs the Board to develop a mechanism for determining and collecting revenues to fund Federal contributions, which shall be approved or disapproved under congressional joint resolution procedures. Amends the Public Health Service Act to impose on any employer a civil penalty equal to 34 percent of the excess health plan expenses of such employer. Defines the excess health plan expenses as those not covered under an AHP or paid to a HIPC for coverage under an AHP. Prohibits the amount of employer contribution from varying based on the AHP selected. Outlines employer obligations with respect to the enrollment of eligible individuals in an AHP through a State HIPC. Provides civil penalties for failing to meet such obligations.
