    "text": "Technical Amendments to Various Indian Laws Act of 1991 - Amends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to extend the grace period for one year for the operation of any class II gaming (electronic or electromechanical facsimiles of any game of chance or slot machines) in Montana and Wisconsin, if the tribe with jurisdiction over the lands on which the gaming was operated requested the State government, by November 16, 1988, to negotiate a tribal-State compact. Requires such gaming on Indian land in Montana or Wisconsin to cease if the State's highest court decides it is illegal in that State. Authorizes appropriations for the National Indian Gaming Commission for FY 1992 through 1993. Amends the Indian Land Consolidation Act to authorize the Cherokee Nation to accept less than ten percent of the appraised market value in the sale of their lands used as homesites. Amends the Crow Allotment Act of 1920 to require that the leases for competent Crow Indian land contain proper conservation and land use provisions. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to enforce such provisions. Amends the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (Secretary) (HUD) to provide assistance to Hawaii for use by the State in meeting responsibilities with which it has been charged under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (the Act). Authorizes the Secretary to provide mortgage insurance covering any property on set-aside lands upon which there is or will be located a multifamily residence, for which the Department of the Hawaiian Home Lands (Department): (1) is the mortgagor or co-mortgagor; (2) guarantees reimbursement to the Secretary for any mortgage insurance claim paid in connection with such property; or (3) offers other security acceptable to the Secretary. Authorizes the Department to sell a defaulted HUD insured mortgage on property or a housing unit to an eligible beneficiary. Repeals certain provisions of the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act to conform with this Act. Makes funds appropriated in specified Acts for FY 1989 through 1991 for infrastructure development on Hawaiian Home Lands available for such purpose without any fiscal year limitation. Amends the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 to extend the deadline for completing such settlement from December 31, 1991, to June 30, 1992."
