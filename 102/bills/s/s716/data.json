    "text": "Replacement and Alternative Fuels Act of 1991 - Requires the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to: (1) promote the development and use of domestic-produced replacement and alternative fuels to replace conventional petroleum motor fuels; and (2) ensure the availability of those replacement and alternative motor fuels which will have the greatest impact in improving air quality. Prescribes development plan and production goals. Sets a timetable by which the Secretary must prescribe the minimum percentage of domestic-produced replacement and alternative fuels on an energy equivalent basis to be sold in specified calendar years by any refiner for use as a motor fuel. Prescribes minimum percentages of domestically produced replacement fuel to be sold in specified calendar years. Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations for the exchange of marketable credits among: (1) refiners; (2) distributors of alternative motor fuels sold in commerce for transportation purposes; and (3) manufacturers of electricity-powered automobiles. Requires each refiner to report annually to the Secretary the percentage of domestic-produced replacement fuel, on an energy equivalent basis, contained in the total quantity of motor fuel sold during the preceding calendar year, and the amount of alternative motor fuels, sold or credited to such refiner during such year. Requires each distributor of alternative fuel to report annually to the Secretary the amount of alternative fuel sold into commerce for transportation purposes, and the amount of credits sold to refiners. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to report annually to the Secretary of Energy the number of dual fuel and dedicated alternative fuel vehicles manufactured and sold into commerce by each manufacturer each year. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to report to the Congress on the environmental impact potential of developing replacement fuels and alternative motor fuels. Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to provide that if the average fuel economy standard applicable to passenger automobiles is increased above a specified level for any model year, the Secretary of Transportation may increase the maximum increase in average fuel economy for a manufacturer attributable to dual energy and natural gas dual energy automobiles to the extent that alternative and replacement motor fuel sales indicate that such fuels are being used to displace the use of conventional petroleum as a motor fuel. Establishes civil penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations requiring certain gasoline retailers to have available for sale, in addition to replacement motor fuels, other alternative motor fuels."
