    "text": "Contractor Licensing Reform Act of 1992 - Establishes the Office of Contractor Licensing within the Department of the Treasury. Requires the Office to establish and maintain a licensing system for the registation, issuance, and review of a license for any person seeking to enter a contract for services. Specifies the information each applicant for a license must provide the Office. Requires the Office to establish standards for the issuance and maintenance of a valid license. Requires such standards to require that the license applicant or holder comply with all applicable Federal laws relating to procurement, contracting, and ethics. Requires a license holder to give written notification to the Office of: (1) the registration of the license holder as a registered foreign agent; (2) the criminal indictment of the license holder; or (3) any change in the status of the license holder which the Office may reasonably require. Provides for suspension and revocation of such licenses. Provides for penalties for false or misleading information submitted for purposes of obtaining or renewing a license. Requires the Office to charge a fee for the issuance or renewal of a license. Prohibits Federal agencies and Members of Congress from entering into a contract for services unless the person contracting to perform such services has a valid license from the Office. Requires any person seeking to enter a contract for services with a Federal agency or Member of Congress to submit a copy of a valid license from the Office with a bid proposal or other offer to perform such contract. Requires contracting officers considering bid proposals of licensed contractors to review material submitted by the license holder or ensure against conflicts of interest and that a contract award is not contrary to the best interests of the United States. Requires the President's annual budget proposal to: (1) contain separate categories for requests for agency authority to procure consulting services; and (2) identify within each such category such requests according to certain procurement classifications. Provides for annual audits of certain portions of agency contracts by the agency's Inspector General to determine if: (1) contractors are performing inherently governmental functions; (2) there is any conflict of interest in the performance of such contracts; and (3) contracts for services are unauthorized personal services contracts. Requires the head of each agency to review all functions of the agency performed by employees or performed pursuant to contracts for services, and take such actions as necessary to ensure that all functions which are inherently governmental functions are performed only by officers and employees of the agency. Amends Federal law to prohibit an officer or employee of the Federal Government or of the District of Columbia government from involving either government in a contract or obligation for any service to perform an inherently governmental function. Requires the Office of Management and Budget to promulgate regulations requiring all Federal agencies to review all contracts for services for cost-effectiveness. Prohibits service contracts entered into by Federal agencies or Members of Congress from authorizing any expenditure for entertainment, maintenance or improvement of morale, or alcoholic beverages. Provides that any contract for services entered into by a Federal agency or Member of Congress shall contain a provision requiring that civil service provisions concerning travel and subsistence expenses and mileage allowances apply to the travel of any person performing services under such contract, to the greatest extent practicable."
