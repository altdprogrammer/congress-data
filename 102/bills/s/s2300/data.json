Sets forth allocation guidelines for State and local governments, and for school districts. Prescribes loan qualifications, limits, and repayment terms for such entities. Requires any unit of government applying for a loan to hold a public hearing on the application. Prescribes anti-discrimination guidelines for local governments receiving loans under this Act. Provides for supervision or termination of loan payments for violation of such guidelines, as well as compliance agreements. Authorizes the Attorney General to enforce such guidelines. Permits any person adversely affected by a prohibited pratice to bring a civil action in Federal court. Provides for judicial review of loan payment suspensions. Requires periodic independent audits of any governmental entity expecting to receive a loan under this Act.

Terminates the loan-making authority under this Act on December 31, 1992. Directs the Secretary to study and report to certain congressional committees on the economic impact of the 1990-92 recession upon the ability of State and local governments to maintain their economic stability, provide essential public services, and provide for the human and capital infrastructure to maintain and expand commerce and industry within their jurisdictions."
