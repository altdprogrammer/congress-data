    "text": "Head Start Training Improvement Act of 1992 - Amends the Head Start Act to revise Head Start program requirements for technical assistance, training, and staff qualifications. Provides for use of Head Start programs funds to support an organization to administer a centralized child development and national assessment program leading to recognized credentials for personnel working in early child development and child care programs. (Current law allows administration of such program at the State or local level and limits such credentialing to specialized or other personnel needed in connection with Head Start programs.) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) develop a systematic approach to training Head Start personnel, including specific goals and objectives for program improvement and professional development, a process for continuing input from the Head Start community, and a strategy for delivering training and technical assistance; and (2) report on such approach to specified congressional committees. Authorizes the Secretary of HHS to provide (either directly or through grants) training for Head Start personnel in the use of the performing and visual arts and interactive programs using electronic media to enhance the learning experience of Head Start children."
