    "text": "Peace Corps Act Amendments of 1991 - Amends the Peace Corps Act to: (1) extend authorizations of appropriations for the Peace Corps through FY 1993; (2) establish the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Peace Corps, Account to pay expenses for Peace Corps operations which exceed appropriations for such expenses as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Authorizes appropriations for such Account. Permits former Peace Corps employees (who later become Federal employees) to contribute specified percentages of readjustment allowances received for Peace Corps service to their employing agencies in order to retain credit for such service in the computation of Federal retirement benefits. Reduces civil service retirement benefits for former Peace Corps volunteers who receive social security benefits and whose entitlement to an annuity is based on a separation from Federal service before this Act's enactment date. Requires the Director of the Peace Corps to contract with an eligible organization to conduct three evaluations of the health care needs of Peace Corps volunteers and the adequacy of the Peace Corps health care system. Provides for the submission of such evaluations to the Director, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Requires the Director and the Secretary of Labor to report to such committees on: (1) the information provided by the Peace Corps to its volunteers and applicants on the benefits and services to which volunteers or trainees may be entitled in the event they sustain injuries or become disabled during their Peace Corps service or training; (2) the efforts by the Peace Corps and the Department of Labor to coordinate the provision of such information to Peace Corps volunteers and applicants and the processing of claims by volunteers under the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA); (3) the number of Peace Corps volunteers and applicants who have filed claims under FECA and the percentage of claims that have been approved; and (4) the timeliness of approvals or denials of such claims. Encourages the Director to continue to develop, assist, and implement education-related programs which enable volunteers to share their volunteer experiences with primary and secondary school students and communities in the United States."
