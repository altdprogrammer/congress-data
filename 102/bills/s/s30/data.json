    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enter into arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study and investigation of the effectiveness in reducing drug addiction of the various components of the Federal anti-drug program, including: (1) crop eradication; (2) crop substitution; (3) support for local and foreign law enforcement; (4) interdiction; (5) education; (6) treatment; (7) criminal justice system reforms; and (8) research. Requires that such study: (1) control for the effects of broad societal changes unrelated to specific anti-drug initiatives, such as changing demographic patterns; (2) separate the effects of each component of the Federal anti-drug program from the effects of other anti-drug initiatives; (3) consider the extent to which the expenditure of Federal funds on job training, education, and other health, education, and welfare programs contributes to reducing epidemic drug addiction; (4) examine the cost of each component of the Federal anti-drug program, as well as such other programs which reduce drug addiction; and (5) take into account social and demographic factors which influence rates and forms of epidemic drug addiction and provide information on the effectiveness of the various components of the Federal anti-drug program on various demographic subgroups within the population. Requires the General Accounting Office to provide to the Congress annual audit reports concerning the management and expenditures of the component parts of the Federal anti-drug program."
