Retains such exemption for conduct involving the making of a contract, or engaging in a combination or conspiracy, to: (1) collect or disseminate historical loss data; (2) determine a loss development factor applicable to such data; or (3) perform actuarial services if such contract, combination, or conspiracy does not involve restraint of trade."
