    "text": "National Telecommunications and Information Administration Authorization Act of 1992 - Authorizes appropriations for: (1) the National Telecommunications and Information Administration; (2) the acquisition of ATS-1 satellite space segment capacity and equipment; (3) the management of the operation of satellite communications services of the Pan-Pacific Educational and Cultural Experiments Satellite Program; (4) establishment of an advisory panel to develop recommendations for improvement of rural health care through improved information services; and (5) the National Endowment for Children's Educational Television. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to promote efficient and cost-effective use of the spectrum to the maximum extent feasible in awarding assignments for mobile radio services. Authorizes the Secretary to withhold or refuse to award an assignment for mobile radio service in order to make efficient and cost-effectiveness use of the spectrum. Requires the Secretary, by June 1, 1993, to adopt a plan for Federal agencies with existing mobile radio systems to use technologies that are at least as spectrum-efficient and cost-effective as readily available commercial mobile radio systems."
