    "text": "National Institutes of Health Revitalization Amendments of 1992 - Title I: General Provisions Regarding title IV of Public Health Service Act - Subtitle A: Research Freedom - Part I: Review of Proposals for Biomedical and Behavioral Research - Amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human Services from approving certain research or financial assistance to conduct research unless specified review has taken place and the review entity has recommended approval. Prohibits the Secretary from withholding, on ethical grounds, funding for research that has received such review approval unless: (1) an ethics advisory board recommends the withholding; or (2) such a board recommends against withholding, but the Secretary finds that the recommendation is arbitrary and capricious. Part II: Research on Transplantation of Fetal Tissue - Permits the Secretary to conduct or support research on the transplantation of human fetal tissue for therapeutic purposes regardless of whether the tissue is obtained from a spontaneous or induced abortion or a stillbirth, in accordance with State and local law. Requires the researcher, if the tissue bank established under a specified executive order is in operation, to obtain the tissue from that bank, unless the bank does not provide requested tissue within a specified time of a request. Requires certain statements by the woman providing the tissue, the researcher, and the donee. Imposes criminal penalties for certain commercial transactions involving the transfer or directed donation of human fetal tissue. Prohibits: (1) any official of the executive branch from imposing a policy prohibiting the Department of Health and Human Services from conducting or supporting any research on the transplantation of human fetal tissue for therapeutic purposes; and (2) the Secretary from withholding funds for research which is in accordance with this Act. Deems a specified report of the Human Fetal Tissue Transplantation Research Panel to be a report issued by an ethics advisory board finding, on a basis that is neither arbitrary nor capricious, that there are no ethical grounds for withholding funds for such research. Part III: Miscellaneous Repeals - Removes certain provisions of the Public Health Service Act relating to: (1) biomedical ethics; (2) a study by the Biomedical Ethics Advisory Committee on waiver of a specified risk standard; and (3) the construction of title IV (National Research Institutes) of the Act. Subtitle B: Clinical Research Equity Regarding Women and Minorities - Part I: Women and Minorities as Subjects in Clinical Research - Requires that women and minorities be included as subjects in each clinical research project under such title IV. Requires projects to be designed and carried out so as to provide for an analysis of whether the variables being studied affect women or minorities differently than other subjects. Requires the establishment of inclusion guidelines. Requires that technical and scientific peer review conducted under existing provisions include an evaluation of the merit of the proposal regarding women and minorities. Part II: Office of Research on Women's Health - Establishes in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) the Office of Research on Women's Health. Requires the Director of the Office to establish: (1) the Coordinating Committee on Research on Women's Health; and (2) the Advisory Committee on Research on Women's Health. Mandates: (1) a determination of the extent to which women are represented among senior physicians and scientists of the national research institutes and among those conducting research supported by the institutes; and (2) as appropriate, activities to increase the extent of such representation. Requires establishment of: (1) a data system, available to the public, for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information regarding research on women's health conducted or supported by the institutes; and (2) a program to provide information on research and prevention activities of the institutes relating to women's health research. Part III: Office of Research on Minority Health - Establishes in NIH the Office of Research on Minority Health to take specified actions, including identifying and encouraging research, promoting coordination and collaboration, and promoting sufficient allocation of resources. Subtitle C: Scientific Integrity - Replaces provisions relating to protection against scientific fraud with provisions establishing as an independent entity in the Department of Health and Human Services the Office of Scientific Integrity. Requires: (1) applicants for a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement under the Act for biomedical or behavioral research to have an administrative process to review reports of scientific misconduct and agree to report any investigation of such reports; and (2) a response process for the Office. Establishes the Commission on Scientific Integrity. Provides for employee whistle blower protection. Mandates measures for identifying, responding to, and reporting the existence of a financial interest that will or may create a bias in favor of obtaining results, in a project to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a drug, medical device, or treatment, that are consistent with the interest. Title II: Protection of Health Facilities - Prohibits stealing or otherwise converting personal property or damaging real property of a health facility assisted under the Public Health Service Act, or deterring, through physical restraint, any individual from entering or exiting the facility. Includes in the prohibitions various acts interfering with the use of animals for research. Provides for fines, imprisonment, and restitution. Title III: National Institutes of Health in General - Modifies the duties of the NIH's Associate Director for Prevention. Establishes a program to enhance the competitiveness of research entities in States which have historically had low success in obtaining funds from the national research institutes for biomedical and behavioral research. Mandates activities, consistent with the global Children's Vaccine Initiative, to develop affordable new and improved vaccines. Authorizes appropriations. Requires a plan regarding research methods that do not require the use of animals, reduce the number of animals used, and produce less distress in the animals. Establishes the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Use of Animals in Research. Repeals similar provisions. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct and support research, research training, recruitment, and other activities to increase the number of women and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds in biomedical and behavioral research. Requires that any survey of human sexual behavior conducted or supported through NIH: (1) undergo review in accordance with specified provisions; and (2) have been determined by the Secretary to assist in reducing the incidence of infectious disease or improve health conditions. Establishes a fund for use by the NIH Director to carry out NIH activities. Authorizes appropriations. Modifies the term of office of members of advisory councils of the national research institutes.
