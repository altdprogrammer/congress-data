    "text": "Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1991 - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide for the burdens of proof which must be met by the various parties when an allegation of an unlawful employment practice is based on an assertion that a particular employment practice or particular employment practices result in disparate impact. Declares it an unlawful employment practice for a respondent, in connection with employment or promotion selection or referral, to adjust the scores of, use different cutoff scores for, or otherwise alter the results of, employment related tests on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Defines \"required by business necessity\" to mean that the challenged practice must: (1) in the case of practices used as job qualifications or to measure the ability to perform the job, bear a manifest relationship to the employment; and (2) in the case of other practices, bear a manifest relationship to a legitimate business objective of the employer. Declares that: (1) the rights and protections under the amendments made by this Act shall apply with respect to any employee in an employment position in the Senate and any employing authority of the Senate, with enforcement and adjudication within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Senate; and (2) provisions of this Act setting forth related requirements and procedures are enacted by the Senate as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and may be changed as any other rule of the Senate. Declares that: (1) the rights and protections under title VII (Equal Employment Opportunities) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the amendments made by this Act shall apply with respect to any employee in an employment position in the House of Representatives and any employing authority of the House, with remedies and procedures as described in a specified House Resolution; and (2) the provisions of this Act relating to such Resolution are enacted by the House as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House and may be changed as any other rule of the House. Declares that the rights and protections under such title VII and the amendments made by this Act shall apply with respect to any employee in an employment position in an instrumentality of the Congress and any chief official of the instrumentality, with the chief official establishing the remedies and procedures to be used. Defines instrumentalities of the Congress to include the Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting Office, and the Office of Technology Assessment."
