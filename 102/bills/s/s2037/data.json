Repeals the prohibition against limiting Federal payments under Medicaid to disproportionate share hospitals. Limits aggregate payment adjustments for disproportionate share hospitals to 12 percent of the total Medicaid expenditures for a fiscal year. Prohibits the use of disproportionate share payment adjustments to hold health care providers harmless for taxes. Limits the authority to restrict disproportionate share hospital designations. Sets forth reporting requirements."
