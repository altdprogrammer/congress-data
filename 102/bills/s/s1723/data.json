Adds music, art, and dance therapy to the list of services under the definition of \"preventive health services\" and to the list of demonstration projects which will improve or expand supportive services or otherwise promote the well-being of older individuals. Requires the Commissioner of the Administration on Aging, in making contracts or entering into grants for such projects, to give special consideration to education, training, and information dissemination projects that assist older individuals through music therapy."
