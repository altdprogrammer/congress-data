    "text": "Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), in cooperation with the Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Health and Human Services, or Secretary of Education (Secretaries), to authorize a tribal government to consolidate federally-funded employment, training, and related services programs. Sets forth plan requirement and agency review provisions. Directs the Secretary to inform the tribal government of a plan's approval or disapproval within 90 days of its receipt. Requires that the tribal government be given an opportunity to amend, or to petition the Secretary to reconsider, a disapproved plan. Authorizes the plan to involve expenditures for the creation of employment opportunities and for the development of the economic resources of the tribal government or of individual Indian people, under specified conditions. Authorizes the tribal government, under specified conditions, to use available funds to: (1) place participants in training positions with private employers; and (2) pay such participants a training allowance or wage for a maximum 12-month period. Directs the Secretaries to enter into an interdepartmental memorandum of agreement providing for the implementation of demonstration projects under this Act. Makes the Bureau of Indian Affairs the lead agency for such projects. Prohibits the enactment of this Act from reducing the amount of Federal funds available to a tribal government involved in any demonstration project. Authorizes the Secretaries to provide for an interagency transfer of available funds to a tribal government if needed. Directs the Secretary to submit to the appropriate congressional committees: (1) a preliminary project report within two years of enactment of this Act; and (2) a final report within five years of enactment which shall include an identification of statutory barriers to program integration. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop, maintain, and publish at least biennially a gender-based report on the population eligible for the services which the Secretary provides to Indian people; and (2) report to specified congressional committees on the need for comprehensive, accurate, and periodically updated information on the size and characteristics of the American Indian and Alaska Native population throughout the entire United States. Makes any State with an economic development program targeted to Indian tribes eligible to receive, at no cost to the State, such Federal personnel assignments as the Secretary deems appropriate to help ensure the success of such program."
