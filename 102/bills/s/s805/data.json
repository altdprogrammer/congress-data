    "text": "Newsprint Recycling Act of 1991 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program to require consumers of newsprint to use a certain percentage of recycled fiber in printing or publishing operations. Defines \"consumer\" as a person who uses 1000 tons or more annually of newsprint in a commercial printing or publishing operation. Provides for graduated increases in such percentage, to require the average percentage of recycled fiber content in newsprint used by consumers to be at least 40 percent by the year 2000. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress, prior to 1999, on whether the recycling program should be modified or expanded. Directs the Administrator to establish regulations to allow newsprint consumers to purchase or sell credits to meet the requirements of this Act. Requires consumers to maintain and make available to the Administrator certain records and to report annually to the Administrator on the amount of newsprint and the percentage of recycled fiber content in newsprint used and the number of credits purchased and sold. Directs the Administrator to require consumers owning more than one commercial printing or publishing operation to consider such operations as a single operation for purposes of this Act. Prescribes civil penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
