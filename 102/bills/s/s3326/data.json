Cites circumstances under which the FDIC may, in its sole discretion, waive its right to repudiate such agreement. Shields the FDIC from liability for its waiver action. Sets forth an interim definition of undercapitalized insured depository institution to signify one that does not comply with any currently applicable minimum capital standard prescribed by the appropriate Federal banking agency."
