    "as": "Reported to Senate amended",

    "text": "Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1992 - Authorizes appropriations for the Coast Guard for: (1) operation and maintenance; (2) acquisition, construction, rebuilding, and improvement of aids to navigation, shore and offshore facilities, vessels, and aircraft; (3) research, development, test, and evaluation; (4) retirement pay and benefits; (5) alteration or removal of bridges; and (6) environmental compliance and restoration. Authorizes the Coast Guard end-of-year strength for active duty personnel and the average military training student loads. Amends Federal law to authorize denial or revocation of a trade or recreational endorsement on a certificate of documentation if the vessel's owner has not paid an assessment of a civil penalty after final agency action. Makes the vessel and its equipment liable to seizure and forfeiture if it is operated after denial or revocation. Authorizes designation of a limited percentage of officers of an armed force in the pay grade of O-6 or below (currently, grades O-3 through O-6) as having unusual responsibility, resulting in additional pay. Subjects foreign vessels certified by countries with inspection laws similar to those of the United States to (currently, only to) an inspection to ensure that the condition of the vessel is (currently, the condition of the vessel's propulsion and lifesaving equipment are) as stated in its certificate. Prohibits a foreign vessel (currently, a foreign or domestic vessel of more than a specified size) from departing from a U.S. port with passengers who embarked at that port if the vessel does not comply with the standards stated in the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. Requires that, when an inspection or examination of a documented or foreign vessel (currently, of a documented vessel) is conducted under part B (currently, under chapter 33) at a foreign place at the request of the owner or operator of the vessel, the owner or operator reimburse the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating for the travel and subsistence of the personnel involved. (Chapter 33 (Inspection Generally) is one of the chapters in Part B (Inspection and Regulation of Vessels).) Modifies the applicable period and other requirements regarding a recreational boat fee. Requires common carriers and conferences to file electronically with the Federal Maritime Commission all tariffs and essential terms of service contracts required to be filed by specified provisions of the Shipping Act, 1916 and the Intercoastal Shipping Act, 1933. Requires the Commission to: (1) make available electronically to any person all tariff information and essential terms of service contracts filed in the Automated Tariff Filing and Information System database and all tariff information in the System enhanced electronically by the Commission at any time; and (2) charge fees for such access and copies. Exempts Federal agencies from such fees. Provides for civil monetary penalties for failure to pay the fees. Sets forth procedures for implementation of automatic filing, including directing the Secretary of the Treasury, on the date of enactment of this Act, to make available a specified sum as a repayable advance, to be repaid from the fees collected. Deposits fees, after repayment of that advance, in the general fund Treasury as offsetting receipts."
