    "text": "Supportive Services in Housing Act of 1992 - Title I: General Improvements to Programs Providing Housing for the Elderly - Amends the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act to establish in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) an office of Assistant Secretary for Supportive Housing to administer HUD supportive housing programs for the elderly and persons with disabilities. Requires the Secretary (Secretary) of HUD to: (1) review each HUD multifamily housing project for the elderly at least once every four years; and (2) review annually the adequacy of such projects' funding levels and geographic targeting of resources. Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements with local housing agencies to provide one-stop housing assistance application centers for elderly and disabled persons. Title II: Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly - Directs the Secretary to carry out a mixed-income demonstration project of housing for the elderly, including the provision of supportive services. Funds such project from assistance available under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959. Requires: (1) the selection of at least ten project applicants; and (2) annual program reports to the Congress. Title III: Revised Congregate Housing Services - Amends the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act to redefine \"frail elderly\" for purposes of congregate housing services to mean an elderly person with any functional disability which may impair the person's ability to live independently. Gives assistance priority to persons with the greatest economic need and the greatest risk of being institutionalized. Title IV: Service Coordinators in Federally Assisted Housing - Amends the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act to require congregate housing service coordinators to receive training in the aging process and related concerns. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to provide service coordinators for section 8 projects serving elderly persons. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to provide service coordinators for frail elderly persons in certain multifamily housing. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Housing Act of 1949 to authorize rural rental housing grants to provide service coordinators for frail persons. Authorizes appropriations. Makes related service coordinator revisions to the Housing Act of 1959 (section 202) and the United States Housing Act of 1937 (public housing). Title V: Mortgage Insurance for Assissted Living Facilities - Amends the National Housing Act to make assisted living facilities (as defined by this Act) for frail elderly persons eligible for mortgage insurance."
