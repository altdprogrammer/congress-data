Directs the Secretary of Energy to use funds available for national security programs of the Department of Energy to develop and demonstrate by October 1, 1995, technical capabilities for the verifiable dismantling of nuclear warheads at existing facilities and for the disposal of nuclear weapons materials. Outlines techniques and procedures to be included in such technical capabilities development. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for FY 1992 through 1994 for such program. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress the program's plan, budget, and schedule."
