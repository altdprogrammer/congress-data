Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of Commerce should attempt to modify any agreement provision in a bilateral agreement with a foreign government that precludes or severely limits the dissemination of patent information in accordance with this Act. Directs the Commission to: (1) establish fees to recover certain estimated average marginal costs of CD-ROM purchases; and (2) report to the Congress on the implementation of this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
