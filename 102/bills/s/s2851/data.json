    "text": "Pacific Yew Act - Directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and of the Interior to pursue a conservation-management policy with respect to National Forest System and other public lands containing Pacific yew (yew) that will combine long-term conservation with sustainable yew harvests for the manufacture of taxol (a cancer treatment drug derived from the yew). Requires such policy to ensure that: (1) a specified yew harvest priority is followed; (2) trees are used with little or no waste; (3) to the extent that timber harvesters' health and safety will not be jeopardized, yew bark is harvested before other timber resources are harvested; and (4) yews are harvested to permit resprouting or replanted when necessary. Requires timber sales to be conducted in accord with such policy. Requires consultation under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 if yews are to be harvested in an area where a jeopardy opinion under such Act has been issued. Directs the Secretaries to: (1) complete within six months of enactment of this Act the ongoing inventory of yew on lands under their jurisdiction; (2) encourage and assist in research regarding the ecology of the yew, development of alternative methods of procuring taxol and, propagation of Pacific yew and other yew species in agricultural or commercial settings; and (3) ensure collection of yew resources in a fashion that minimizes illegal harvests and maintains the yew's taxol properties. Authorizes the Secretaries to sell yew to qualifying persons for human use manufacture of taxol in the United States in accord with specified provisions of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Sets forth recordkeeping requirements. Authorizes the nonresearch use of taxol derived from yew harvested prior to enactment of this Act if the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies to the appropriate Secretary that such use will increase patient access to taxol without adversely affecting research supplies of such drug. Requires each of the Secretaries to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees with regard to: (1) whether sufficient amounts of yew have been harvested for manufacture of medical supplies of taxol; and (2) the yew inventory. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine and notify the appropriate Secretaries when sufficient medical quantities of taxol are available from sources other than Pacific yew harvested from Federal lands. Terminates the requirements of this Act upon the concurrence of such Secretaries, after notification of the appropriate congressional committees."
