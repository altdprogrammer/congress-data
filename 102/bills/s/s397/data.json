    "text": "Newsprint Recycling Incentives Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require producers or importers of newsprint to recycle, through methods specified under this Act, an amount of newsprint equal to at least the amount determined by multiplying the amount of newsprint produced or imported annually by such individuals by the recycling percentage established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Authorizes such individuals to comply with this Act by: (1) recycling (through deinking) newsprint; (2) purchasing recycled newsprint to combine with shipments of virgin newsprint; or (3) purchasing recycling credits under this Act. Requires the recycling percentage to be at least 20 percent. Provides for increases in such percentage of two points annually for the next ten years. Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations to allow newsprint producers or importers to create or purchase recycling credits. Provides that such regulations shall require: (1) producers and importers to keep specified records; (2) producers of recycled newsprint to notify EPA of capacity to recycle old newsprint; (3) importers of recycled newsprint to notify the U.S. Customs Service of the amount of newsprint being imported and to have certifications of the accuracy of such amount from the trade representative of the country shipping such newsprint to the United States; and (4) producers and importers to report to the Administrator on the amount of recycled newsprint produced or imported annually and the number of credits purchased from, or sold to, other producers or importers. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress on such regulations and to include: (1) a discussion of the effects of such regulations on the newsprint and newspaper industry and the environment; and (2) an evaluation of the level of the recycling percentage and whether such percentage should be increased in future years. Requires an updated report to be submitted within ten years of this Act's enactment. Applies recycling requirements to persons who produce or import more than ten tons of newsprint annually. Sets the recycling percentage at 20 percent if the Administrator fails to promulgate such regulations. Prescribes civil penalties for violations of this Act. Directs the Administrator to submit to the Congress and implement a plan for the recycling of post-consumer high grade paper. Authorizes appropriations."
