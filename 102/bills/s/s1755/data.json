    "text": "National Park Service Concessions Policy Reform Act of 1991 - Repeals the Concessions Policy Act of 1965. Provides that such repeal shall not affect the validity of any contract entered into under such Act. Applies the provisions of this Act to such contract to the extent such provisions are inconsistent with the express terms and conditions of it. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to authorize, under specified conditions, private persons, corporations, or other entities to provide and operate such facilities and services in the National Park System. Requires a concessions contract to be awarded only through competitive bid procedures. Allows the Secretary to waive such procedures and award a temporary one in order to avoid interruption of services to the public at a park area. Establishes procedures with respect to processing such competitive bids. Prohibits the Secretary from granting a preferential right to a concessioner to: (1) provide new or additional services at a park area; or (2) renew concessions contracts under this Act. Sets forth a formula for determining franchise fees. Requires the Secretary to review and possibly to readjust the franchise fee at least every five years for concessions contracts with a duration in excess of seven years. Requires all franchise fees to be deposited in a special account in the Treasury for specified uses. Establishes a maximum: (1) ten-year duration for a concessions contract, with exceptions; and (2) two-year duration for a temporary one. Requires the approval of the Secretary before a concessions contract can be transferred, assigned, sold, or conveyed. Protects the possessory interest of concessioners: (1) who have commenced acquisition or construction of any structure on Federal land within a park area before the enactment of this Act, under certain circumstances; and (2) whose contract was entered into on or after the enactment of this Act, except that the actual value of such structure shall be that of the possessory interests as of the termination date of the previous concessions contract. Requires all concessions contracts entered into under this Act to make concessioners responsible for all utility costs incurred by them. Amends Federal law that authorizes the Secretary to provide utility services to concessioners on a reimbursement of appropriation basis. Places limitations on a concessioner's rates and charges to the public. Directs the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register regulations establishing standards and criteria for evaluating the performance of concessioners operating within park areas. Requires the Secretary to evaluate annually each concessioner operating under such contract to determine whether such concessioner has performed satisfactorily. Exempts contracts awarded by the Secretary under this Act from certain provisions of Federal law with respect to leasing of U.S. buildings and properties. Amends the Historical Sites, Buildings and Antiquities Act to repeal provisions authorizing the Secretary to grant concessioner contracts, leases, or permits without advertising and securing competitive bids."
