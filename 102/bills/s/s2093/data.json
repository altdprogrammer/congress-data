Requires an adjustment in such spending limits under such circumstances. Prohibits Senate consideration of legislation that would reduce defense spending below the spending limit for the defense category if such legislation does not allocate the total amount of reduced new budget authority or outlays between deficit reduction and increases in the personal income tax exemption."
