    "text": "Adoption Assistance and Maternal Certificates Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to mandate grants to ten States to establish demonstration programs to provide maternal health certificates to low-income pregnant females residing or awaiting residence in, or receiving outpatient services from, a maternity home. Requires eligible maternity homes to provide a range of services in accordance with standards promulgated under this Act, including regarding room and board, medical care, and counseling and services concerning health, adoption, education, vocation, or employment. Limits the time period covered and the dollar amounts paid per day. Requires matching funds from a State agency, the home, or both. Prohibits requiring a woman, in order to be eligible for this program, to participate in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program under title IV of the Social Security Act. Authorizes appropriations. Requires that adoption data from private agencies that receive Federal assistance (and voluntarily-released data from private agencies that receive no Federal assistance) be included in an existing system of data collection, under the Social Security Act, relating to adoption and foster care Requires an adoption or foster care agency that receives Federal assistance to disclose, to prospective adoptive and foster parents, information about the history of the child, including: (1) medical history; (2) social background; (3) information about the placement of the child; and (4) any record of abuse or neglect. Makes it unlawful to discriminate against an individual in the making, performance, modification, or termination of an insurance contract (defined as a health or life insurance contract which provides family coverage) on the basis of the fact that a son or daughter of the individual is not a biological child of the individual. Declares it an unlawful employment practice to discriminate against an employee with respect to a term or condition of any leave benefit on the basis of the fact that a son or daughter is not a biological child of the employee. Defines \"son or daughter,\" for both such insurance and such employment discrimination, to mean a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, a child placed for adoption, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is: (1) under 18 years old; or (2) 18 years old or older and incapable of self care. Allows any person to bring a civil action for equitable relief, damages and interest, and attorney's fees. Amends the Social Security Act to add to the formula, used for determining the amount of payments to States for foster care and adoption assistance, provisions relating to expenditures for recruitment of adoptive parents for a child with special needs. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 to remove provisions terminating, on a specified date, a program for reimbursement for adoption expenses incurred by a member of the armed forces."
