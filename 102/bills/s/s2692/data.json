    "date": "1992-05-12", 
    "text": "Defense Worker Dislocation Act - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to revise eligibility requirements for the Defense Conversion Adjustment Program (program). Authorizes the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) to make program grants to specified types of eligible entities in any State in which: (1) the Governor has received a notification regarding a closure, cancellation, or reduction under the Defense Economic Adjustment, Diversification, Conversion, and Stabilization Act of 1990; and (2) eligible employees have received a notification of warning from their employer regarding such closure, cancellation, or reduction. Requires grant applications to contained specified information. Requires the Secretary to approve or deny the application by the later of: (1) 15 days after the date on which the eligible employees will lose employment; or (2) 30 days after submission of the application. Allows program grant funds to be used to provide specified retraining or to update existing skills with respect to an eligible dislocated worker, including an employee of an eligible defense contractor or subcontractor, who has been terminated or laid off, or received notice of termination or layoff, as a consequence of reductions in U.S. expenditures for defense or by closures of U.S. military facilities. Allows program grant funds also to be used to pay for the Federal share (75 percent) of such retraining with respect to an employee of eligible defense contractors or subcontractors if: (1) the employee is currently involved in defense work; (2) the retraining is designed to enable the employee to achieve placement and retention in unsubsidized employment that involves nondefense work and in which the employee has not been previously engaged; and (3) the employer certifies that the employee would have become an eligible dislocated worker without such retraining. Revises program administration provisions to require the Secretary to make available 50 percent of the grant amount to the entity within 15 days after application approval and the remainder upon submission of a report on eligible employees participating in the program and their current education skill levels and occupational abilities. Allows program grants to be used to reimburse an entity for funds expended under title III (Employment and Training Assistance for Dislocated Workers) of JTPA. Provides that program grants shall be: (1) in addition to assistance under any other title III provision; and (2) made without regard to whether the entity has expended funds available under such other provision. Deems to be an eligible employee (for purposes of JTPA title I general program requirements) a person who can benefit from, and is most in need of, program services. Directs the Secretary to prescribe program performance standards solely on the basis of placement and retention in unsubsidized employment (notwithstanding other JTPA provisions for performance standards). Presumes program services provided to eligible employees to be in compliance with such standards unless any person demonstrates their noncompliance."
