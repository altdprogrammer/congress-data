    "text": "Mature and Older Workers Act of 1992 - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to authorize appropriations for programs under title II (Training Services for the Disadvantaged) and title IV (Federally Administered Programs). Defines a mature or older worker as one who is 40 years of age or older. Defines a younger worker as one who is age 22 through 39. Requires that private industry councils and State councils each include at least one representative of an agency or organization that by its organizational mission represents the interests of mature or older workers. Requires award of incentive grants to service delivery areas conducting Younger Workers programs and Youth Opportunity programs which exceed certain performance standards. Directs the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) to include in the annual report to the Congress an analysis, for each State and on a nationwide basis, of the number of participants served under JTPA (and the type of services they received) who are in various age groups. Revises and renames title II part A as the Younger Workers Program (currently Adult and Youth Programs). Sets forth allotment and allocation requirements. Defines an economically disadvantaged younger worker. Sets forth requirements for individual eligibility, program design, authorized services, linkages to other Federal and other appropriate programs, and transfer of funds to other title II programs. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report on the number and percentage of assisted younger workers that remain employed for at least nine months after receiving such assistance. Revises and renames title II part B as the Mature or Older Workers Program. Sets forth allotment allocation (as well as recapture and reallotment) requirements. Defines an economically disadvantaged mature or older worker. Sets forth requirements for individual eligibility, program design, authorized services, job training plans, linkages to other Federal and other approprate programs, and transfer of funds to other title II programs. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report on the number and percentage of assisted adults who remain employed for at least nine months after receiving such assistance. Revises title II part C (currently part B) Summer Youth Employment and Training Programs, for economically disadvantaged youth. Adds enhancement of the citizenship skills of youth to the purposes of such programs. Provides for allotment and allocation, authorized uses of funds, limitations, comparable functions of agencies and officials, and program goals and objectives. Establishes a new part D, the Youth Opportunity Program, under title II of JTPA, for economically disadvantaged youth aged 16 through 21. Requires that least 50 percent of the participants in such program in each service delivery area be out-of-school youth. Requires that at least 70 percent of both the in-school and out-of-school participants be from specified targeted groups. Allows in-school participants to be age 14 through 21, if this is provided in the job training plan. Makes in-school youth also eligible if they participate in a compensatory education program under chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (even if they do not qualify as economically disadvantaged). Allows up to ten percent of program participants to be individuals who do not meet the economically disadvantaged (or compensatory education) eligibility requirement, but who face serious barriers to employment. Allows all students to participate in schoolwide projects for certain low-income schools. Requires Youth Opportunity programs to be operated on a year-round basis. Sets forth requirements for program design, authorized services, linkages with educational programs and with other Federal and other appropriate education and training programs, and transfer of funds to other title II programs."
