    "as": "Indefinitely postponed in Senate", 
    "date": "1992-09-23", 
    "text": "Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 - Title I: Intelligence Activities - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 for the conduct of intelligence activities of the following elements of the U.S. Government: (1) the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); (2) the Department of Defense (DOD); (3) the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA); (4) the National Security Agency (NSA); (5) the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; (6) the Department of State; (7) the Department of the Treasury; (8) the Department of Energy; and (9) the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Specifies that the amounts authorized to be appropriated and the authorized personnel ceilings as of September 30, 1993, for the conduct of such activities are those specified in the classified Schedule of Authorizations. Authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to authorize employment of civilian personnel in excess of the numbers authorized for FY 1993 when necessary to the performance of important intelligence functions, subject to specified limitations. Requires the DCI to promptly notify the House and Senate intelligence committees whenever the DCI exercises the authority granted under this title. Authorizes: (1) appropriations for the Community Management Staff (CMS) of the DCI; and (2) 68 full-time CMS personnel as of September 30, 1993. Title II: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - Authorizes appropriations for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund for FY 1993. Title III: Department of Defense Intelligence Activities - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to assist employees who have occupied sensitive positions in DIA and who are found to be ineligible for continued access to sensitive compartmented information and employment with DIA, or whose employment with DIA has been terminated, in finding and qualifying for subsequent employment, receiving treatment of medical or psychological disabilities, and receiving necessary financial support during periods of unemployment. Conditions such assistance on the Secretary's determining that the assistance is essential to maintain the judgment and emotional stability of such employee and to avoid circumstances that might lead to the unlawful disclosure of classified information to which the employee had access. Specifies that such assistance may not be provided any longer than five years after termination of employment. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to include senior executive service (SES) positions within the civilian intelligence personnel system, subject to specified limitations. Directs the Secretary to fix rates of pay for, and prescribe regulations concerning, such positions. Authorizes the President to award ranks to such SES members. Authorizes the Commandant of the Defense Intelligence College, upon recommendation by the faculty of such college, to confer a bachelor's or master's degree appropriate to the profession of intelligence upon graduates of the college (currently, confer the degree of master of science of strategic intelligence upon graduates of the school) who have fulfilled the requirements for that degree. Specifies that such a degree may not be conferred unless entering students have fulfilled general education requirements suitable for a bachelor's degree before being accepted into the program and unless the curriculum leading to the degree is accredited by a professional authority determined appropriate by the Secretary. Amends the National Security Education Act of 1991 to direct the Secretary to carry out a program for awarding: (1) scholarships to undergraduate students who are U.S. citizens to study for at least one academic semester in foreign countries determined to be critical countries (as under current law) or for an equivalent term; and (2) fellowships to graduate students who are U.S. citizens to pursue education as part of a graduate degree program of a U.S. institution of higher education (currently, to pursue education in the United States) in specified fields. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into personal service contracts for periods up to one year for program administration, except that not more than ten such contracts may be in effect at any one time. Repeals a provision requiring the Secretary to administer the program through the Defense Intelligence College. Directs the Secretary to establish an independent center for international studies to administer the program. Includes as members of the National Security Education Board: (1) the Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities; and (2) six (currently, four) individuals appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, who shall be experts in specified fields (as under current law) and who may not be officers or employees of the Federal Government. Directs the Secretary to invest in full the amount in the National Security Education Trust Fund that is not immediately necessary for expenditure (currently, for obligation). Authorizes appropriations to the Fund. Amends the National Security Agency Act of 1959 to provide that no civil service-level employee of NSA may be paid above the rate paid to employees at Executive Level IV. Authorizes the Secretary to provide to NSA employees, in addition to basic pay, the same benefits, allowances, incentives, or compensation as other Federal employees are eligible to receive. Title IV: Federal Bureau of Investigation Administrative Provisions - Authorizes the Director of the FBI, during FY 1993, to accept bequests or devises made by U.S. citizens, on behalf of the FBI, to: (1) fund and administer a scholarship program for the benefit of the immediate families of Federal law enforcement officers slain or permanently disabled in the line of duty; and (2) pay all necessary expenses in connection with the acceptance of such bequests or devices. Specifies that: (1) proceeds from the sale of property accepted as a bequest or devise by the Director shall be maintained in an interest bearing account and shall remain available for disbursement until expended; and (2) such authority may be exercised only to the extent and in such amounts as provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Title V: Central Intelligence Agency - Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to grant the Inspector General of the CIA authority to receive complaints and information from any person (currently, from CIA employees). Title VI: General Provisions - Authorizes appropriations for such additional amounts for FY 1993 as may be necessary for increases in salary, pay, retirement, and other employee benefits authorized by law. Specifies that such authorization of appropriations does not constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity which is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. Expresses the sense of the Congress that, beginning in 1993, the aggregate amount requested and authorized for, and spent on, intelligence and intelligence-related activities should be disclosed to the public. Redesignates the National Security Education Act of 1991 as the David L. Boren National Security Education Act of 1991. Title VII: Intelligence Reorganization Act of 1992 - Subtitle A: In General - Intelligence Reorganization Act of 1992 - Amends the National Security Act of 1947 (the Act) to provide definitions of various terms used in subsequent amendments made to the Act. Subtitle B: The National Security Council - Authorizes the DCI (or, in his absence, the Deputy DCI) to attend and participate in meetings of the National Security Council (NSC). Subtitle C: The Director of Central Intelligence - Revises provisions with respect to the appointment of the DCI and Deputy DCI. Directs that the DCI serve as head of the U.S. intelligence community, act as the principal adviser to the President for intelligence matters related to the national security, and (as under current law) serve as head of the CIA. Expresses the sense of the Congress that it is desirable that either the DCI or Deputy DCI be a commissioned officer of the armed forces or that either such appointee otherwise have, by training or experience, an appreciation of military intelligence activities and requirements. Sets forth provisions with respect to the appointment and supervision of commissioned officers. Directs that the Office of the DCI, for administrative purposes, be within the CIA. Adds the position of DCI to the list of executive branch officials designated at Executive Level I (currently, at Level II). Repeals a provision providing for a DCI Community Staff. Makes the DCI, under the direction of the NSC, responsible for providing timely, objective national intelligence, independent of political considerations, and based upon all sources available to the intelligence community to: (1) the President; (2) the heads of departments and agencies of the executive branch; (3) the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and senior military commanders; and (4) where appropriate, the Senate and House of Representatives and the committees thereof. Establishes within the Office of the DCI the National Intelligence Council, composed of senior analysts within the intelligence community and substantive experts from the public and private sector, which shall: (1) produce national intelligence estimates for the Government (including, whenever the Council deems appropriate, alternative views held by elements of the intelligence community); and (2) otherwise assist the DCI in carrying out responsibilities. Directs the DCI, in his capacity as head of the intelligence community, to: (1) develop and present to the President and the Congress an annual budget for the National Foreign Intelligence Program (Program) of the United States; (2) establish the requirements and priorities to govern the collection of national intelligence by elements of the intelligence community; (3) promote and evaluate the utility of national intelligence to consumers within the Government; (4) eliminate waste and unnecessary duplication within the intelligence community; (5) protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure; and (6) perform such other functions as the President or NSC may direct. Directs the DCI, in his capacity as head of the CIA, to: (1) collect intelligence through human sources and by other appropriate means, subject to specified limitations; (2) provide overall direction for the collection of national intelligence through human sources by elements of the intelligence community authorized to undertake such collection, and ensure that the most effective use is made of resources and that the risks to the United States and those involved in such collection are minimized; (3) correlate and evaluate intelligence related to the national security and provide appropriate dissemination of such intelligence; (4) perform such additional services as are of common concern to the elements of the intelligence community, which services the DCI determines can be more efficiently accomplished centrally; and (5) perform such other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the President or NSC may direct, including the conduct of covert actions as may be authorized pursuant to the Act. Sets forth provisions concerning the authorities of the DCI with respect to: (1) access to intelligence; (2) approval of budgets; (3) the role of the DCI in reprogramming; (4) the transfer of funds or personnel within the Program; (5) coordination with foreign governments; (6) use of personnel; and (7) termination of employment of CIA employees. Subtitle D: The Intelligence Activities of the Department of Defense - Requires the Secretary to: (1) ensure that the budgets of the elements of the intelligence community within DOD are adequate to satisfy the overall intelligence needs of DOD; (2) ensure appropriate implementation of the policies and resource decisions of the DCI by elements of DOD within the Program; (3) ensure that the tactical intelligence activities of DOD complement and are compatible with intelligence activities under the Program; (4) ensure that the elements of the intelligence community within DOD are responsive and timely with respect to satisfying the needs of operational military forces; (5) eliminate waste and unnecessary duplication among the intelligence activities of DOD; and (6) ensure that intelligence activities of DOD are conducted jointly, where appropriate. Directs the Secretary (subject to specified limitations) to ensure: (1) through NSA (except as otherwise directed by the President or the NSC), the continued operation of an effective unified organization for the conduct of signals intelligence activities and that the product is disseminated in a timely manner to authorized recipients; (2) through a central imagery authority, with appropriate representation from the intelligence community, the continued operation of an effective unified organization within DOD for carrying out tasking of imagery collection, coordinating imagery processing and exploitation activities, and ensuring dissemination of imagery in a timely manner to authorized recipients; (3) through the National Reconnaissance Office, the continued operation of an effective unified organization for the research and development, acquisition, and operation of overhead reconnaissance systems necessary to satisfy requirements of all elements of the intelligence community; (4) through DIA, the continued operation of an effective unified system within DOD for the production of timely, objective military and military-related intelligence, based upon all sources available to the intelligence community, and ensure the appropriate dissemination of such intelligence to authorized recipients; (5) through DIA, effective management of DOD human intelligence activities, including defense attaches, and of such other intelligence programs as may be assigned to DIA by the Secretary; and (6) that the military departments maintain sufficient capabilities to collect and produce intelligence to meet the requirements of the DCI, the Secretary, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the unified and specified combatant commands and joint operations, and the specialized requirements of the departments for intelligence necessary to support tactical commanders, military planners, the research and development process, the acquisition of military equipment, and training and doctrine. Directs the Secretary to: (1) undertake appropriate consultations with the DCI before the appointment of any individual as head of NSA, the National Reconnaissance Office, or DIA; and (2) appoint, upon the recommendation of the DCI, the head of the central imagery authority within DOD. Specifies that nothing in the Act or any provision of law shall be construed to require the disclosure of the organization or any function of the National Reconnaissance Office, of any information regarding its activities, or the names, titles, salaries, or number of persons employed by, or assigned or detailed to, such office. Subtitle E: Effective Date - Provides that this title shall take effect upon the date of its enactment."
