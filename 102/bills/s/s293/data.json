    "text": "Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to grant the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) priority in claims against an insured depository institution's personnel (other than a claim asserted by another Federal agency). Sets deadlines for filing of such a suit in order to take such priority. Requires a court to grant the FDIC, upon request, an enlargement of time within which to file suit unless certain circumstances exist. States that the FDIC priority applies both to the prosecution of a claim and to execution on the judgment."
