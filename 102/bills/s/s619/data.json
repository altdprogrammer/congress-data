    "text": "Link-up for Learning Demonstration Grant Act - Establishes a program of grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) in partnership with other eligible entities for coordinated educational and other student support services for at-risk youth. Authorizes the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to award such grants to eligible entities to pay the Federal share of costs of specified activities. Sets forth special considerations in awarding grants. Allows such grants to be for up to three years, subject to satisfactory progress. Makes eligible to apply for such a grant (provided that at least one LEA in the partnership is eligible to receive financial assistance for disadvantaged children under chapter 1 title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965): (1) at least one LEA in partnership with at least one public agency; (2) at least one nonprofit organization, institution of higher education, or private enterprise in partnership with at least one LEA; or (3) an LEA that is receiving assistance under the Head Start Transition Project Act in partnership with any designated Head Start agency. Requires eligible entities, in order to receive such grants, to serve: (1) educationally deprived students, students eligible to be counted under chapter 1, or students in chapter 1 schoolwide projects, and their family members; and (2) any school, grade span, or program area if the project design is of adequate size, scope, and quality. Sets forth: (1) authorized uses of grant funds by LEAs; (2) application requirements; (3) application review coordination; and (4) various limitations. Requires each eligible entity desiring such a grant to establish a coordinated services advisory council to develop its application. Establishes a Federal Interagency Task Force consisting of the Secretaries of Education, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development, and other appropriate Federal agency heads, to identify means to facilitate interagency collaboration at Federal, State, and local levels to improve support services for at-risk students. Requires the Task Force to: (1) identify and eliminate program regulations or practices impeding coordination and collaboration; (2) develop and implement plans for jointly funded programs, unified eligibility and application procedures, and confidentiality regulations that facilitate information sharing; and (3) make recommendations to the Congress on legislative action to facilitate coordination of support services. Directs the Secretary of Education to: (1) conduct a study of grantees under this Act to identify regulatory and legislative obstacles to coordinated support services and innovative procedures and programs; and (2) report study results to the Congress with recommendations for legislative action. Limits the Federal share of project costs to 80 percent. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1994."
