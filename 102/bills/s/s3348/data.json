Makes such deduction permanent. Part II: Standards and Requirements of Small Employer Health Insurance Reform - Amends the Social Security Act to add a new title XXI, Standards For Small Employer Health Insurance and Certification Of Managed Care Plans. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to request that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) develop specific standards to implement specified requirements for health insurance plans issued to small employers that relate to: (1) insurer registration; (2) guaranteed eligibility, availability, and renewability; (3) preexisting conditions; (4) restrictions on rating practices; and (5) benefit package offerings. Provides that if NAIC fails to develop such standards or the Secretary finds that they do not implement such requirements, the Secretary must develop such standards. Provides that if a State has not established a regulatory program that provides for the application and enforcement of such standards, the Secretary must certify the compliance of small employer plans with them. Part III: Tax Penalty on Noncomplying Insurers - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an excise tax on the issuer of a health insurance plan to a small employer if the issuer fails to meet the requirements of title XXI of the Social Security Act (as added by this Act). Establishes such tax as 25 percent of the gross premiums received by the issuer. Makes such tax nondeductible. Subtitle B: Medicare and Medicaid Provisions - Part I: Medicare - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary to establish an experimental program offering certain Medicare beneficiaries a choice among specified types of benefit options.

Part II: Medicaid - Directs the Secretary to: (1) make grants to States for demonstration projects for improving access to Medicaid (SSA title XIX) services in medically underserved areas, providing medical assistance under Medicaid to certain uninsured individuals, providing outreach activites to individuals who may be eligible for certain medical assistance, and reducing infant mortality; and (2) report to the Congress on such projects.

Title III: Permanent Health Care Reform - Consumer Choice Health Care Reform Act of 1992 - Subtitle A: Tax Treatment of Health Care Expenses - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a credit for premiums paid by a qualified individual (excludes a federally covered individual) on an employer-sponsored health insurance plan. Specifies the limitations on such health expenses credit. Allows employers to make advance payments of such credit to employees with a health care expenses eligibility certificate. Terminates the medical expense deduction and the health insurance credit after December 31, 1994. Allows an individual a deduction for a percentage of employer-provided health insurance premiums and allows such deduction in computing adjusted gross income. Repeals the current income exclusion for employer contributions to accident and health plans. Limits the business deduction for employer-provided health insurance premiums to computations based upon the number of employees and the national average premium. Allows individuals a tax deduction for contributions made to a medical care savings account established for the benefit of an eligible individual. Adjusts such deduction for inflation after 1994. Allows such deduction in arriving at adjusted gross income. Establishes an excise tax for excess contributions to medical care savings accounts and makes such accounts subject to the tax on prohibited transactions. Subtitle B: Health Insurance Requirements - Sets forth requirements for employers for withholding health insurance premiums of employees, notifying employees of tax rights with respect to such premiums, converting non-self-insured plans, and selling, transferring, or reassigning existing self-insured plans. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax on the failure to notify employees of the option to convert a non-self-insured plan to a federally qualified health insurance plan. Imposes a tax on the failure of a carrier offering a health insurance plan to comply with requirements with respect to self-insured plans. Revises provisions covering continuation coverage requirements of group health plans and requires such coverage for a maximum of 60 months.

Title IV: Antitrust Provisions - Subtitle A: Modification of the Operation of the Antitrust Laws to Hospitals - Provides that it shall not be unlawful under the antitrust laws for two or more hospitals to engage in conduct solely for the purpose of negotiating a proposed agreement (including the sharing of data) to share expensive medical services or expensive high technology equipment. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue waivers to exempt such conduct from the operation of the antitrust laws, subject to specified requirements. Provides that, to be eligible to receive such a waiver, two or more hospitals must submit to the Secretary an application that contains a proposed agreement that only: (1) provides that such hospitals shall share the expensive medical services or high technology equipment identified in such agreement; (2) specifies the period of time during which such agreement shall be in effect; and (3) describes the particular medical services or high technology equipment to be shared. Directs the Secretary, in evaluating the application, to consider whether implementation of such agreement will result in enhancement of the quality of hospital or hospital-related care, the preservation of hospital services in geographical proximity to the communities traditionally served by the applicants, improvement in the cost-effectiveness of high-technology services provided by the applicants, improvement in the efficient utilization of hospital resources and capital equipment, the provision of services that would not otherwise be available, or the avoidance of duplication of hospital resources.
