    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-06-03", 
    "text": "International Sanctions Enforcement Act of 1992 - Directs the President to impose the following sanctions against any foreign person who has knowingly violated United Nations Security Council Resolution 748 imposing sanctions against Libya: (1) a prohibition on procurement by the U.S. Government or U.S. persons of goods or services from such persons; and (2) the export of U.S. goods or technology to such persons. Imposes such sanctions on successor entities to such persons, as well as subsidiaries, parents, affiliates, and co-ventures if they knowingly and materially assisted in the prohibited activities. Urges the President to initiate consultations with foreign governments with jurisdiction over such persons with respect to the imposition of sanctions. Requires the President to impose the sanctions unless he certifies to the Congress that a government has taken actions to terminate the involvement of a person in such activities. Exempts from prohibitions on procurement the procurement of defense articles and services: (1) under existing contracts; (2) if the person to whom sanctions would be applied is a sole source supplier, the articles or services are essential, and alternatives sources are not available; or (3) that are essential to national security under defense coproduction agreements. Applies such exemption to: (1) products or services provided under contracts entered into before the date the President publishes his intention to impose sanctions; (2) spare or component (not finished) parts essential to U.S. products or routine servicing and maintenance of products, if alternative sources are not available; (3) information and technology essential to U.S. products; and (4) medical or other humanitarian items. Applies sanctions for at least 12 months and terminates sanctions only if the President certifies to the Congress that a person has ceased to, and will not in the future, violate the Resolution. Permits the President to waive sanctions after the 12-month period if he certifies to the Congress that the continued imposition of sanctions would have a serious adverse effect on U.S. interests. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act to authorize the issuance of residence visas for protection purposes to aliens (and immediate relatives) who furnish information concerning acts of international terrorism against U.S. persons or property. Limits the number of aliens admitted for such purposes to 25. Increases criminal penalties for the misuse of passports. Directs the President to certify to the Congress whenever he determines that a country is not complying with the Resolution. Suspends service of such countries' air carriers to or from the United States. Authorizes the revocation of such countries' rights to engage in air transportation to or from the United States. Amends the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to regulate or prohibit the importation or exportation of informational materials containing technical or commercial data of value to the economy of a foreign country whose transactions are otherwise regulated or prohibited. Increases the amount of civil penalties authorized to be imposed for violations of such Act."
