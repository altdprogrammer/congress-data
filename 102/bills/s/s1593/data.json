Requires that money and sales proceeds of other property received as such gifts, bequests, or devises be deposited in the Treasury and available for disbursement upon the Commission's order. Revises the Commission's functions to include activities relating to international (as well as national) communications and cooperative networks. Provides that a majority of Commission members shall constitute a quorum for conduct of business at its official meetings. Revises provisions for the terms of office of Commission members. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such Act for FY 1992 and succeeding fiscal years."
