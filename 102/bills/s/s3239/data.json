Authorizes appropriations to pay the expenses of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the detection, investigation, and prosecution of persons who violate such provisions. Specifies that ten percent of such appropriations may be made available to make payments or advances for expenses arising out of contractual or reimbursable agreements with State and local law enforcement agencies engaged in cooperative activities in the enforcement of such provisions."
