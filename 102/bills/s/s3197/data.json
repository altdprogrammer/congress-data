Sets forth grounds upon which the Attorney General is empowered to remove a bankruptcy trustee for unsound fiduciary practices. Amends Federal bankruptcy law to expand the duties of United States Trustees. Amends Federal criminal law with respect to violations of bankruptcy fiduciary standards to reflect the role of the United States trustee as set forth in this Act."
