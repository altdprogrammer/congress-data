    "text": "Better Access to Student Aid Act of 1991 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to remove from the computation of expected family contribution, in the case of a family with an adjusted gross income of $40,000 or less, in the determination of need for assistance under the title IV (Student Assistance) Pell Grant program and other title IV student assistance programs, the following assets: (1) the family's principal place of residence; or (2) a farm on which the family resides. Sets forth formulas for determination of the adjusted net worth of the principal place of residence, from ten percent of the net value of such residence for parents' whose total income is between $40,000 and $45,000, increasing by increments of $5,000 income and 15 percent, up to 100 percent for those whose income is $70,000 or more. Reduces from 70 percent to not less than 45 percent the amount of student income considered for purposes of expected contribution by a dependent student. Permits independent students with dependents to deduct from their total income, for purposes of determining the family's available income in student aid calculations, an allowance for reasonable child care costs, which is equal to the amount paid by the student or to the student's spouse, or both, for each dependent child receiving child care services. Expands eligibility of students and families to use the Simplified Needs Test to apply for Federal student financial aid, by raising the income ceiling cap from $15,000 to $25,000. Provides that nothing in HEA title IV (Student Assistance) limits the authority of student financial aid administrators to: (1) make necessary adjustments to the cost of attendance and expected student and/or parent under special circumstances; or (2) use supplementary information about the financial status or personal circumstances of eligible applicants in selecting recipients and determining award amounts under specified student assistance programs. Allows the exclusion of certain assets from the calculation of expected family contribution in the case of dislocated workers or displaced homemakers. Allows, in the case of dislocated workers, projected income for the award year to be considered instead of income reported for the preceding tax year. Makes conforming amendments relating to provisions for dislocated workers and displaced homemakers. Repeals certain provisions relating to determinations of income and consideration of unemployment compensation received by dislocated workers."
