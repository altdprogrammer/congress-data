    "text": "Title I: General Provisions - Judicial Space and Facilities Management Act of 1991 - Sets forth definitions for purposes of this Act. Title II: Congressional Approval of Public Buildings for Federal Judiciary - Requires approval by specified congressional committees before an appropriation can be made to construct, alter, exchange, condemn, purchase, dispose of, or acquire any space or facility to be used as a court accommodation which involves a total expenditure that exceeds $1,650,000 (which may be adjusted annually by the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts) (Director). Requires the Director to: (1) transmit a prospectus to the Congress of the proposed judicial space or facility to secure consideration for such approval; and (2) report to the Congress, within a 15-day period of the convening of each new Congress, a program for the two succeeding fiscal years of projects and actions which the Director determines necessary to carry out his duties. Requires the Director to: (1) certify in such program that a public hearing has been held or an opportunity for such hearing has been afforded in the locality or proposed locality of each major construction, renovation, or acquisition project included in the program; and (2) provide, along with each certification, the final environmental impact statement, a report indicating the consideration given to facts and issues concerning the project, and various alternatives which were raised during the hearing or which were otherwise considered. Authorizes the Director to contract for the acquisition, construction, alteration, purchase, exchange, condemnation, or disposition of any space or facility with the Administrator of the General Services Administration (Administrator) (GSA), the Secretary of the Army, the U.S. Postmaster General, or other officer of the executive branch of the Federal Government with similar expertise. Provides that title to space or facility approved pursuant to this Act shall be held by the Administrator. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to require the Administrator of GSA to charge the Judiciary at rates to approximate the applicable cost incurred by GSA for providing space and services to the Judiciary. Title III: Judicial Buildings Fund - Establishes the Federal Judicial Building Fund in the Treasury. Authorizes the Director, subject to the approval of the U.S. Judicial Conference, to impose and collect such user charges and fees necessary for the purpose of financing the construction, purchase, acquisition, or alteration of facilities or space for the judicial branch of the Federal Government."
