Terminates the trade agreement after seven years. Directs the International Trade Commission to: (1) review such agreement biennially and recommend its termination of notification; and (2) recommend termination unless U.S. automobiles take quality improvement and executive salary reduction measures. Makes any Commission recommendation effective unless disapproved by passage of a joint resolution of both Houses of the Congress."
