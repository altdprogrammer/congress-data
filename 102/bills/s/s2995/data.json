    "text": "International Dolphin Protection Act of 1992 - Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to direct the Secretary of State to enter into international agreements establishing a program to reduce and eliminate dolphin mortality in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean tuna fishery. Mandates that an agreement: (1) require dolphin mortality be reduced to numbers approaching zero; (2) require the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission to establish a panel to report on international yellowfin tuna fishery compliance with those mortality limits; (3) require the Commission to establish an advisory board; and (4) establish an international research program on yellowfin tuna fishing methods. Mandates: (1) a ban on the importation of all yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna products from a nation which fails to fully implement its commitments under an agreements; and (2) if the failure continues, a ban on the importation from that nation of all fish and fish products. Subjects the general permit issued to the American Tunaboat Association to the requirement that total dolphin mortalities not exceed limits. Imposes penalties for certain acts, including for: (1) setting a purse seine net on or to encircle any marine mammal during yellowfin tuna fishing, subject to exceptions; and (2) interfering with searches or inspections. Authorizes appropriations. Modifies requirements regarding a ban (mandated by current law) on the importation of fish and fish products caught involving marine mammal kills in excess of U.S. standards to require that the exporting nation has agreed to and is enforcing a specified resolution of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (currently, that the harvesting nation has adopted a regulatory program comparable to that of the United States and meeting other requirements). Modifies requirements concerning intermediary nations. Requires, a specified period after a ban on yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products (currently, on yellowfin tuna or tuna products), that a certification be issued and that the certification be deemed to be a certification under the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967. Amends the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950 to require that persons from a non-governmental conservation organization be selected as: (1) at least one of the U.S. Commissioners on the International Commission for the Scientific Investigation of Tuna and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission; and (2) part of a related advisory committee. Amends the South Pacific Tuna Act of 1988 to authorize appropriations to the Departments of Commerce and State to carry out the Act and the Treaty on Fisheries Between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States of America."
