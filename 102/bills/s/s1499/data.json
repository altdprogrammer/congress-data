    "text": "Pell Grant Expansion Act of 1991 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend through FY 1997 the Pell Grant program authority. Revises the formula for and increases the amount of an individual Pell Grant. Sets the maximum amount at $4,500 for award year 1992-1993. Determines the amount as follows: (1) an allowance for living expenses, not to exceed $2,750; plus (2) an amount equal to 25 percent of the cost of tuition at the institution, not to exceed $1,750; minus (3) the expected family contribution. Provides, for academic years 1993-1994 through 1996-1997, for specified inflation adjustments for such specified maximum amounts. Raises to $400 the minimum amount which a student must be eligible for before a Pell Grant may be awarded. Revises Pell Grant program provisions for adjustments for insufficient appropriations. Requires the Secretary, in such cases, to expend from the next succeeding fiscal year's appropriation sums necessary to meet any such insufficiences. Revises the Pell Grant program definition of cost of attendance to eliminate certain limitations, for specified types of students, on the allowance for room and board costs, books, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous expenses."
