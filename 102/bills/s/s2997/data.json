    "text": "Amends the Small Business Act to increase the 1993 and subsequent fiscal year amounts to be expended in connection with a small business innovative research (SBIR) program by each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for research or research and development (R&D) in excess of $100,000,000. Makes such amount equivalent to 1.25 percent of such R&D budget for FY 1993 and increases such amount for each fiscal year thereafter up to a maximum of 3.0 percent of such R&D budget for FY 1997 and thereafter. Reserves all of such amounts in excess of 1.25 percent of such R&D budget for an SBIR program involving R&D of specified critical technologies. Requires each qualifying Federal agency, in expending such R&D amounts, to give a preference to such critical technology projects. Provides limitations with respect to non-SBIR and Department of Energy defense programs."
