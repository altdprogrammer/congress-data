Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) develop a comprehensive list of dams located on Indian lands that are in a satisfactory, fair, conditionally poor, poor, or unsatisfactory condition; (2) perform such rehabilitation work as is necessary to bring such dams to a satisfactory condition. Requires that the dam, upon completion of rehabilitation work, be placed under the program and be regularly maintained pursuant to program guidelines. Specifies that work authorized by this Act shall be for the purposes of dam safety operation and maintenance and not to provide additional conservation storage capacity or to develop benefits beyond those provided by the original dams and reservoirs. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) obtain technical assistance from agencies under his jurisdiction in addition to the BIA, or from other departments through memoranda of understanding, to carry out the purposes of this Act (but specifies that the safety of the dams program and the operation and maintenance program shall remain under BIA direction); and (2) contract with appropriate Indian tribes to carry out the program. Authorizes appropriations."
