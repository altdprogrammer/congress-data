    "text": "Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Act - Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program. Directs the Secretary to provide guidance for determining at what point a rehabilitated marine mammal is returnable to the wild. Requires the Secretary to collect and update information on: (1) practices for rescuing and rehabilitating stranded marine mammals and for preserving, labeling, and transporting marine mammal tissues for physical, chemical, and biological analyses; (2) scientific literature on marine mammal health, disease, and rehabilitation; (3) standings; and (4) other life history and reference level data that allows comparison of the causes of illness and deaths in stranded marine mammals with physical, chemical, and biological parameters. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into specified agreements with any person for the taking of marine mammals in response to a stranding. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a marine mammal unusual mortality event working group; (2) contact the group for guidance upon receiving notification from a stranding network participant that such an event might be occurring; (3) designate an onsite coordinator upon determining that an event is occurring; and (4) issue a contingency plan for responding to such event. Requires onsite coordinators to be Regional Directors of the National Marine Fisheries Service or the Fish and Wildlife Service. Establishes the Marine Mammal Unusual Mortality Event Fund to be available for costs incurred by: (1) persons in acting in accordance with contingency plans; and (2) stranding network participants in preparing and transporting tissues collected at an unusual mortality event. Provides for the storage, preparation, examination, and archiving of marine mammal tissues. Designates archived tissues as the National Marine Mammal Tissue Bank. Requires the Secretary to issue guidance for analyzing tissue samples as a means to monitor and measure overall health trends in species or populations of marine mammals. Directs the Secretary to maintain a data base on marine mammals that includes reference data on the health of marine mammals and on species of marine mammals subject to unusual mortality events. Requires the Secretary to establish criteria for access to the Tissue Bank, tissue analyses, and the data base. Authorizes appropriations."
