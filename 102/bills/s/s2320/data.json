    "text": "Universal Health Care Act of 1992 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to create a national health insurance program. Entitles each individual who is a U.S. resident and a citizen, national, or lawful resident alien to benefits under the program. Allows coverage of nonimmigrant aliens in certain circumstances. Provides for enrollment mechanisms. Lists covered benefits, including certain: (1) inpatient and outpatient hospital care; (2) services of health care professionals; (3) diagnostic tests; (4) pre-natal, post-natal, and well-baby care; (5) preventive services; (6) prescription drugs and biologicals; (7) dental care; (8) vision care; (9) nursing facility services; (10) hospice care; (11) inpatient and outpatient mental disorder care; (12) drug and alcohol abuse or dependency treatment services; and (13) home and community-based services. Prohibits coinsurance, deductibles, or copayments for such services. Allows payment only: (1) to providers who have entered into a participation agreement; and (2) if the conditions and limitations specified in certain provisions of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act are met. Allows an individual State to provide for additional coverage or expanded eligibility, with the costs absorbed by that State. Mandates a report to the Congress on coverage for mental disorders and drug and alcohol abuse. Excludes from coverage most of the items and services excluded from Medicare coverage. Provides for the establishment of a list of approved prescription drugs and biologicals, durable medical equipment and therapeutic devices and equipment. Bases payment for hospital and nursing facility services on an annual budget for the institution approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Provides for capital and medical education budgeting. Requires the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, instead of conducting activities under specified Medicare provisions, to: (1) advise the Secretary concerning approval of budgets; and (2) annually report to the Congress and the Secretary. Provides for payments for other facility-based services. Limits payments for home and community-based services. Establishes the Long-Term Care Payment Review Commission. Requires payment for the services of health care professionals to be based on a fee schedule. Renames the Physician Payment Review Commission (established under Medicare) as the Professional Payment Review Commission. Requires the Commission, instead of conducting activities under Medicare, to advise the Secretary on the fee schedule. Provides for payments for other items and services, mandating the appointment of a General Health Care Payment Review Commission to advise the Secretary on a fee schedule. Authorizes competitive contracts for claims processing. Requires payment under these provisions to be accepted as payment in full. Prohibits payment to most Federal providers providing services to the public generally as a community institution or agency and any provider obligated by law or contract to render services at public expense. Directs the Secretary to establish a system for the reporting of information sufficient to provide for the review and approval of budgets under these provisions. Requires payment schedules to be constructed so as to encourage providers to practice or locate in rural and medically underserved areas. Mandates administration of the program through the Health Care Financing Administration, but allows a State to administer the program on request until the State fails to comply with the requirements of this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish each year a national health budget and, for each State, a State health budget stating the level and application of expenditures under this Act and the amount in and source of revenues of the National Health Trust Fund. Prohibits expenditures in the budget from exceeding expenditures for the previous year increased by the increase in the gross national product. Requires the budget to include capital and medical education items. Creates the National Health Trust Fund. Appropriates to the Fund: (1) the taxes imposed on employees, employers, and self-employed individuals by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) relating to hospital insurance; (2) the taxes imposed by amendments to the IRC made by this Act; and (3) amounts paid by States under amendments to the Public Health Service Act made by this Act. Deposits in the Fund long-term care/health care premiums imposed by this Act. Transfers to the Fund any amount remaining in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund or the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund after payment of claims under Medicare. Mandates payments to the Fund from States according to a specified formula. Establishes the National Health Advisory Board and an advisory board in each State to advise the Secretary on implementation of the amendments made to the Public Health Service Act by this Act. Applies to the amendments made to the Public Health Service Act by this Act specified Medicare provisions relating to: (1) definitions; (2) skilled nursing facilities; (3) clinical diagnostic laboratory tests; (4) consultation with State agencies and other organizations; (5) agreements with service providers; (6) emergency medical conditions and women in labor; (7) determinations and appeals; (8) overpayment on behalf of individuals and settlement of claims for benefits on behalf of deceased individuals; (9) regulations, application of certain provisions of title II (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act, designation of organization or publication by name, and administration; (10) payments to health maintenance organizations and competitive medical plans; (11) physician referrals; (12) the provider reimbursement review board; (13) home health agencies and home health quality; and (14) breach of scholarship and loan contracts. Applies to the amendments made to the Public Health Service Act by this Act specified provisions of title XI (General Provisions and Peer Review) of the Social Security Act relating to: (1) fraud and abuse; (2) nonprofit hospital philanthropy; (3) organ procurement; (4) outcomes research; and (5) peer review of utilization and quality. Applies to the amendments made to the Public Health Service Act by this Act specified provisions of title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act relating to payments into the Treasury and benefit payments involving the Old-Age and Survivors, Disability, Hospital, and Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds. Allows the sale of private insurance to cover benefits not covered under the amendments made by this Act. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase tax rates for corporations, individuals, estates and trusts, employer hospital insurance, and self-employment income hospital insurance. Eliminates the dollar limitation on the amount of wages subject to employee and employer hospital insurance taxes. Removes provisions excluding certain State and local employees from hospital insurance taxes. Increases the portion of social security benefits subject to taxation. Imposes on individuals 65 years old and older, except those with an adjusted gross income under a specified amount, a monthly long-term care/health care premium. Declares that it is the sense of the Senate that the chairman of the Committee on Finance should recommend additional Internal Revenue Code provisions that may be necessary to assist in meeting the funding requirements of this Act. Terminates, after December 31, 1994, benefits and payments under titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act, the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), and provisions of Federal law relating to hospital, nursing home, domiciliary, and medical care for veterans."
