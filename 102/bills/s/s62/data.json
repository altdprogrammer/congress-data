Requires such teams to provide such assistance regardless of whether or not such individuals are eligible for Medicaid benefits. Allows State Medicaid coverage of individualized treatment plans, on a presumptive eligibility basis, for any psychiatric and medical service otherwise covered. Establishes the National Commission for the Homeless Mentally Ill to study the availability, accessibility, and composition of mental health services for homeless mentally ill persons. Directs the Commission to submit an annual report to the Congress containing recommendations for improving the delivery of services to such persons."
