    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-05-12", 
    "text": "Title I: Extension of Unemployment Benefits - Amends the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-164, as amended) to extend the emergency unemployment compensation (EUC) program. Changes the EUC program termination date (currently July 4, 1992) to March 6, 1993. Provides for phaseout reductions of such benefits for weeks beginning after June 12, 1992, and for weeks beginning after January 3, 1993. (Provides, therefore, up to: (1) 33 weeks of EUC benefits in certain high-unemployment States and 26 weeks in all other States, respectively, for claimants for weeks beginning prior to June 13, 1992; (2) 20 or 13 weeks, respectively, for new claimants for weeks beginning on or after such date; and (3) 10 or 7 weeks, respectively, for new claimants for weeks beginning on or after January 3, 1993, until March 6, 1993.) Amends the Social Security Act (SSA) to authorize certain advances to the extended unemployment compensation account to pay for emergency unemployment compensation benefits. Amends SSA to require the first Advisory Council on Unemployment Compensation to study and report with recommendations (by February 1, 1993) on certain proposed permanent changes in the extended benefits program under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. Title II: Revenue Provisions - Subtitle A: General Provisions - Amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to apply mark-to-market accounting method rules for certain securities held by dealers in securities (with specified exceptions for certain types of securities such as those held for investment or as a hedge). Requires taking into account for tax deduction determinations: (1) certain Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) assistance as compensation for loss; and (2) any FSLIC assistance for any debt for determining whether such debt is worthless and in determining the amount of any addition to a reserve for bad debts arising from such worthlessness or partial worthlessness. Revises the IRC for individual estimated tax payments. Changes (for taxable year years 1993 through 1996) from 100 to 115 percent of the preceding year's tax liability the amount of the timely estimated payaments which an individual must make to qualify for a \"safe harbor\" alternative in making such estimated payments. Repeals special rules which denied the use of such last year's liability safe harbor for certain individuals with significant increases in tax liability from one year to the next. Subtitle B: Alternative Taxable Years - Revises the IRC with respect to electing alternative taxable years. Allows a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation to elect a taxable year other than the required taxable year if the annual financial statements (if any) of the entity used for credit purposes or provided to the partners, shareholders, or other proprietors of the entity are based on a fiscal year ending in the same month as the taxable year elected. Increases the amount of the required payment that must be made by a partnership or S corporation that elects a taxable year other than the required taxable year. Requires an additional payment for any taxable year that a partnership or S corporation first makes or changes a taxable year election to increase the deferral period."
