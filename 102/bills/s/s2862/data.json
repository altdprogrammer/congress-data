Requires the Secretary of the Interior to develop a comprehensive plan for the long-range management and protection of the Conservation Area. Designates the following lands in Utah as wilderness and components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) Phipps-Death Hollow Wilderness; (2) North Escalante Canyons Wilderness; (3) Scorpion Wilderness; (4) Escalante Canyons Wilderness; and (5) Steep Creek Wilderness. Releases the Fifty Mile Mountain from further wilderness study to be managed as part of the Conservation Area for multiple use activities. Directs the Secretary to establish the Escalante National Conservation Area Advisory Committee to advise with respect to the preparation and implementation of the comprehensive long-range plan and the need and funding of the travel corridor. Authorizes appropriations."
