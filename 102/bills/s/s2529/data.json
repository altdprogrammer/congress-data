Makes such transfer effective upon the enactment and submission to specified congressional committees by Guam of a land use plan. Declares that such property shall not be subject to the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. Repeals the requirement set forth in the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1981 that the sale by the Government of Guam of certain property, including property within the Apra Harbor complex, conveyed to it by the Secretary of the Navy shall only be for monetary consideration."
