Requires humanitarian assistance funds for Cambodia to be disbursed to international organizations and private and voluntary organizations undertaking humanitarian and relief work in Cambodia and provides that districts within Cambodia shall be treated uniformly with respect to such assistance. Subjects funds disbursed in accordance with this Act to a provision of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 which prohibits assistance to the Khmer Rouge. Prohibits assistance to: (1) any Cambodian organization that the President determines is cooperating or has cooperated with the Khmer Rouge; and (2) any group or individual engaged in the use of force against the current Government of Cambodia."
