Requires procedures established by the Board of Review of the Airports Authority to include requirements for the selection of a Board Chairman. Subjects the following Airport Authority actions to review by the Board: (1) annual plans for the issuance of bonds; (2) the award of approved contracts (other than a contract for the transfer of revenue bonds); (3) approval of terminal design or airport layouts; and (4) the authorization for the acquisition or disposal of land and a grant of a long-term easement. Removes Airport Authority actions for the acquisition of land from such review. Sets forth provisions with respect to congressional approval or disapproval of Airport Authority actions. Establishes a new Board of Review for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority."
