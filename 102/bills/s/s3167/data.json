States that late planting coverage shall: (1) extend for up to 25 days after the final planting date; and (2) reduce yield guarantee by one percent per day for the first ten days and two percent per day for the next 15 days. Includes prevented planting coverage (with substitute crop option) as part of the basic crop insurance policy. Provides 50 percent coverage for a natural disaster-caused prevented planting. States that the insured producers shall not have their indemnity payment reduced because of a de minimis yield."
