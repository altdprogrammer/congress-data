Directs the President to submit a report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Speaker of the House on U.S. policy toward such regions to include: (1) the advisable levels and timing of U.S. diplomatic recognition and representation regarding such regions; (2) the actions that the United States will undertake bilaterally and in international bodies to prevent military and police forces from attacking or being stationed in such regions, to bring to justice government authorities who ordered such attacks, and to reduce the influence, funding, and size of military forces that have attacked such regions; (3) the actions that the United States will take through the United Nations and other international bodies to assure security and peace in the former Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia; and (4) the levels and types of assistance to be provided to regions that have had free, fair, and internationally supervised elections and are committed to democracy and human rights."
