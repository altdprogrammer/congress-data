    "text": "Port of Entry Inspections Improvement Act of 1992- Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to create grounds for exclusion of an alien who: (1) uses or attempts to use a fraudulent document to enter the United States, or to board a common carrier for such purpose; or (2) uses a document to board a common carrier and then fails to present such document to an immigration official upon arrival at a U.S. port of entry. Prohibits the granting of asylum to an alien who is found to be using fraudulent entry documents or who fails to present entry-related documents, unless a specially trained immigration officer determines such actions were pursuant to departure from a country in which: (1) the alien had a credible fear of persecution; or (2) there was a significant danger that the alien would be returned to a country in which he or she would have a credible fear of persecution. Provides for port of entry exclusion and deportation without administrative or judicial appeal (except by a limited petition of habeas corpus) for such admission document fraud. Increases penalties for certain alien smuggling offenses. Creates a separate offense and penalty for an alien smuggler who seriously injures or jeopardizes the life of an alien."
