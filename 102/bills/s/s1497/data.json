    "text": "Great Lakes Protection Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require Great Lakes States to adopt sediment quality standards. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate standards for States that fail to do so. Requires the Administrator to publish information concerning the public health and environmental effects of at least 20 contaminants in Great Lakes sediment by a specified deadline and of contaminants of concern as expeditiously as possible. Makes it unlawful, after October 1, 1994, to dispose of dredge spoil in Great Lakes waters other than at a confined disposal facility. Waives such prohibition if the material to be disposed of: (1) does not contain contaminants in excess of levels established in sediment quality standards; (2) will not result in a violation of water or sediment quality standards; (3) will not degrade the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of the substrate; (4) is disposed of in a manner which is consistent with an approved Coastal Zone Management Plan; and (5) will be disposed of at specified sites. Makes violators subject to civil penalties. Prohibits the establishment of a new confined disposal facility after October 1, 1992, without the concurrence of the Administrator and without providing for public review and comment. Requires the Administrator, in concurring in such establishment, to find that the facility is not likely to result in the violation of water or sediment quality standards or prevent the protection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous population of fish, shellfish, and wildlife. Directs the Administrator to terminate the use of facilities likely to violate such standards or prevent the protection and propagation of such populations. Requires persons disposing dredge spoil to obtain permits from the Administrator. Provides that permits shall be issued for periods not to exceed six months. Directs the Administrator, upon the submission of a Remedial Action Plan to the Great Lakes National Program Office, to work with other Federal agencies to develop a Federal Agency Memorandum of Understanding describing actions Federal agencies will take to support implementation of the Plan for the area of concern. Requires the Memorandum to be submitted to the International Joint Commission in conjunction with the submission of the Plan. Requires any contaminated aquatic sediment site assessed under the hazard ranking system of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act which is part of a designated area of concern within the Great Lakes, or contributes pollutants to such area as of July 1, 1991, to be awarded ten points (in addition to those otherwise awarded) in such ranking. Directs the Administrator to submit to the International Joint Commission a Lakewide Management Plan for Lake Michigan and proposed Lakewide Management Plans for the other Great Lakes by January 1, 1993, and January 1, 1996, respectively. Directs the Administrator, acting through the Great Lakes Program Office, to establish a Great Lakes Pollution Prevention Technology Demonstration Program. Requires the Administrator to develop a list of modernizing toxic use and waste reduction technologies requiring demonstration. Authorizes persons with permits to discharge into Great Lakes waters to participate in the demonstration program through: (1) the installation of a pollution prevention technology from the list developed to reduce pollutant discharges; or (2) the installation of other pollution prevention technology that will reduce discharges by 75 percent from discharges in the preceding year without shifting of pollutants to other environmental media. Provides that such participants shall: (1) be exempt from requirements to pay fees for the development of revised effluent guidelines; and (2) be granted an additional year to comply with new or revised effluent standards if the Administrator determines that such extension is necessary. Requires the Administrator to establish: (1) a Pollution Prevention Extension Service to advise, inform, and encourage pollution prevention by industrial discharges to the Great Lakes; and (2) a Great Lakes Pollution Prevention Clearinghouse to provide information to municipal and industrial dischargers and sources of nonpoint pollution on methods to reduce toxics use. Directs the Administrator to publish contaminated finfish and shellfish consumption advisories for appropriate areas of the Great Lakes and appropriate classes of fish and shellfish. Authorizes the Administrator to delegate responsibility for issuance of the advisories to States. Establishes a Great Lakes Policy Committee to advise the Administrator and Federal agencies on the implementation of programs for the protection of the Great Lakes. Requires the Administrator and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to submit a three-year plan for monitoring and research activities in the Great Lakes to the Congress. Revises provisions regarding the Great Lakes Research Office. Authorizes the use of State water pollution control revolving funds for implementing Lakewide Management Plans. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the Great Lakes pollution prevention program. Revises allocations of appropriations."
