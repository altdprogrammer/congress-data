    "text": "Children's Health Care Improvement Act of 1992 - Title I: School-Based Health Insurance - Establishes a program under which local educational agencies receiving Federal assistance are required to offer basic health insurance coverage to eligible students in schools. Sets forth student eligibility requirements, including: (1) being uninsured for at least six months; and (2) not being covered by title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act. Authorizes withholding from a noncomplying local educational agency a specified percentage of Federal educational assistance. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for qualified amounts paid for policies under this Act. Phases out the credit as income goes from 100 percent to 200 percent of the poverty line. Reduces the credit by the amount of tax imposed by provisions relating to alternative minimum tax. Provides for advance payment of refunds of the credits. Title II: WIC Program, Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant Program, and Medicaid - Requires development of a single model uniform application form and process for benefits under the Special Supplemental Food Program (WIC Program) of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, the Maternal and Child Health Service Block Grant Program (title V) of the Social Security Act, and Medicaid (the Programs). Mandates outreach to recipients in States which elect to use the uniform form and process. Mandates grants to not more than five States for demonstration projects to encourage women to obtain prenatal and well-baby care under the Programs. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title. Title III: Expansion of Migrant and Community Health Center Program - Authorizes appropriations for grants for the development of additional migrant and community health centers under existing provisions of the Public Health Service Act in medically underserved areas or areas in which there is a high concentration of medically underserved populations. Authorizes appropriations for operational assistance to the centers developed. Title IV: Revision of National Health Service Corps Priorities - Amends the Public Health Service Act to declare that the principal mission of the National Health Service Corps is to increase the access to primary health care services of urban and inner-city poverty stricken target populations, rural resident, high-risk pregnant women, migrant workers and their families, substance abusers, and homeless individuals. Mandates development and implementation of a strategy to provide incentives to encourage primary care physicians to serve in migrant or community health centers or related programs or in medically underserved inner-city and rural areas, using at least one of: (1) a program to recruit individuals from medically underserved areas to serve as Corps members in areas from which the individuals were recruited; or (2) a program to encourage Corps members to continue to serve in medically underserved areas after the individuals have discharged their service obligations to the Corps. Authorizes appropriations. Title V: Childhood Immunizations - Authorizes appropriations for grants for the provision with charge of immunizations. Title VI: Children at Risk - Establishes a demonstration program of grants to five States for healthy start programs to: (1) track mothers and children at high risk of abuse and neglect and at risk of not receiving necessary services and care; and (2) enable such services to be obtained. Mandates implementation, in such States, of a screening program to identify children at risk of abuse or neglect. Authorizes appropriations."
