    "text": "Jicarilla Apache Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act - Ratifies and approves the Settlement Contract between the Secretary of the Interior and the Jicarilla Apache Tribe of Indians in New Mexico for the resolution of water rights claims. Makes specified amounts of water available under the Contract from the Navajo Reservoir or River and the San Juan-Chama Project. Entitles the Tribe to use return flows attributable to uses of the water as long as water depletions do not exceed amounts set forth in this Act. Authorizes the Tribe, subject to the Secretary's approval and when water made available under the Contract is not being used, to sell, exchange, lease, or temporarily dispose of the water. Prohibits the Tribe from permanently alienating rights under the Contract. Limits terms of water use subcontracts, including renewals, to 99 years. Subjects subcontracts to the Secretary's approval. Authorizes appropriations for: (1) a water resources development trust fund to be used by the Tribe; and (2) the Tribe's share of the operation, maintenance,and replacement costs for the San Juan-Chama Project, when the Secretary has waived the Tribe's obligation to pay such costs under the Contract. Sets forth waivers with respect to the Tribe's share of costs of the Navajo Reservoir and the San Juan-Chama Project. Prohibits the use of water authorized for the initial stage of the San Juan-Chama Project to offset the impacts of other water projects in the San Juan River Basin in order to comply with the Endangered Species Act of 1973."
