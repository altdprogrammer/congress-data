    "text": "American Energy Independence Act of 1991 - Title I: Energy Conservation - Subtitle A: Telecommuting Infrastructure Act of 1991 - Telecommuting Infrastructure Act of 1991 - Directs the Departments of Transportation (DOT) and of Energy (DOE) to study the costs and benefits, in their respective sectors, of telecommuting (\"flex-place\" working via telephone and computer, usually from home). Makes companies which offer or expand telecommuting flex-place programs eligible for certain Federal business tax credits. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a telephone exchange service carrier from providing video program service in its telephone exchange service area except through an affiliated video program subsidiary separate from such carrier. Requires any such carrier which provides telephone exchange service and the video program service of its subsidiary over an integrated broadband distribution system to establish a video gateway. Subtitle B: Other Conservation Measures - Amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to require Federal agency heads to adopt procedures to assure that the construction of any new Federal building meets or exceeds certain applicable energy efficiency performance standards. Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to direct the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) to promulgate guidelines for procedures to be implemented by State governments that would enable the assignment of energy efficiency ratings to residential buildings. Directs the Secretary to: (1) pursue a research and development (R & D) program to improve energy efficiency and productivity in energy intensive industries and industrial processes; and (2) undertake joint ventures to encourage the commercialization of technologies so developed. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to establish specified voluntary energy efficiency guidelines for industrial plants. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Secretary to evaluate and report to the Congress on the feasibility of requiring electric lights, utility distribution transformers, and electric motors and pumps to meet minimum energy efficiency levels. Title II: Oil - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a variable excise tax on imported crude oil and refined petroleum products. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Secretary to take all necessary steps to expedite the increase of Strategic Petroleum Reserve storage capacity to 1,000,000,000 barrels of petroleum product. Sets a new capacity goal of 2,000,000,000 by FY 2003. Title III: Natural Gas - Creates a defense to any Federal civil or criminal antitrust action brought against cooperative associations of independent natural gas producers with respect to any voluntary marketing agreements or plans of action undertaken out of market necessity and with no purpose to reduce competition. Requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to: (1) determine if the charges, classifications, or practices of other domestic pipelines serving the market which certain import facilities serve confer an unjust competitive disadvantage on domestic natural gas producers; and (2) fix charges, classifications, or practices which would not confer such a competitive disadvantage. Title IV: Coal - Subtitle A: Value-Added Coal Refinery Act of 1991 - Value-Added Coal Refinery Act of 1991 - Directs the Secretary to establish within DOE a research, development, demonstration, and commercialization program for coal refining technologies based on hydrocracking to produce a slate of value-added clean burning boiler and transportation fuels, fuel additives, lubricants, chemical feedstocks, and carbon-based manufactured products more economically and efficiently than currently available commercial technology. Subtitle B: National Clearinghouse for Coal Fuels Technology Act of 1991 - Directs the Secretary to establish within DOE a clearinghouse for the collection and dissemination of information and data on coal and coal-derived fuel technology. Authorizes appropriations. Requires DOE to conduct a Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Proof of Concept Program leading to the design, construction, and operation of an MHD retrofit plant. Authorizes appropriations. Title V: Electricity - Amends the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Technology Competitiveness Act of 1989 to direct the Secretary to solicit proposals for, and provide financial assistance to, at least one joint venture for the demonstration of electric fuel cell technology. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to direct the Secretary to conduct a program to promote the early commercial application of electricity-producing fuel cell systems by the demonstration of such systems in Federal buildings. Authorizes appropriations. Title VI: Alternative Fuels - Alternative Fuels Act of 1991 - Directs the Secretary to establish a program to promote the development and use of domestic-produced replacement and alternative fuels. Requires the Secretary to prescribe the minimum percentage of such fuels a refiner must sell as a motor fuel in 1996 through 1998. Authorizes appropriations. Title VII: Renewable Energy - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a renewable energy production tax credit for specified energy technologies. Title VIII: General Effective Date - Makes this Act effective upon enactment."
