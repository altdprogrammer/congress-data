Sets forth reporting requirements. Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) to: (1) include a declaration by the Congress that it is the goal of the United States to eliminate the dumping of dredged materials containing contaminants in excess of marine water or sediment standards under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) into ocean waters; and (2) specify that no permit or dumping authorization shall be issued for a dumping of material that, in the case of a dump site located in the territorial sea, will violate water quality standards or contains contaminants in quantities in excess of sediment quality standards adopted pursuant to the FWPCA, or, in the case of any other dump site, will violate water quality criteria or contains contaminants in quantities in excess of sediment quality criteria published pursuant to the FWPCA. (Current law states that no permit shall be issued for a dumping of material which will violate applicable water quality standards.) Specifies that: (1) in any case in which the Administrator disagrees with the Secretary's determination as to compliance with the criteria or restrictions (currently, criteria) established pursuant to the MPRSA relating to the effects of the dumping or specified restrictions relating to critical areas and site management plans (currently, critical areas), the determination of the Administrator shall prevail; and (2) if the Secretary finds that, in the disposition of dredged material, there is no economically feasible method or site available other than a dumping site the utilization of which would result in noncompliance with such criteria or restrictions (currently, criteria), he shall so certify and request a special permit from the Administrator (currently, a waiver of the specific requirements involved). Requires the Administrator: (1) within 90 (currently, 30) days of the receipt of the special permit (currently, waiver) request, to grant such permit (currently, waiver), subject to specified conditions; and (2) in reviewing a request for such a permit, to provide for public notice and comment. Authorizes States to adopt only such criteria, standards, rules, or regulations (to be transmitted to the Administrator and Secretary, who shall assure compliance) relating to the dumping of materials into ocean waters within the jurisdiction of the State which are more stringent and protective of such waters and sediment than those adopted under the MPRSA. (Under current law, no State shall adopt or enforce any rule or regulation relating to such activity, but may propose to the Administrator criteria related to ocean dumping, which the Administrator may adopt if not inconsistent with such Act, subject to specified requirements.) Directs the Administrator: (1) to designate sites or time periods for dumping that will mitigate the adverse impact on the environment to the greatest extent practicable (current law authorizes the Secretary to designate recommended sites or times); and (2) in any case where the Administrator determines that, with respect to certain materials, it is necessary to prohibit dumping at a site or during a time period, to prohibit the dumping during such time period (under current law, when necessary to protect critical areas, sites or times within which certain materials may not be dumped). Specifies that this prohibition shall apply to any dumping at the site or during such time period. Requires the Administrator to develop and implement a site management plan for each site designated, including: (1) baseline assessment of environmental conditions at the site and in adjacent areas that may be affected by the dumping activity as if dumping had never occurred; (2) special management conditions or practices to be implemented at each site that are necessary for the protection of the environment; (3) a program of monitoring for each site; (4) the anticipated use and management of the site over the 20-year period following the date of preparation of the plan; (5) a schedule of review and revision of the plan; and (6) such other requirements and conditions as the Administrator considers necessary. Specifies that: (1) after January 1, 1993, no site shall receive a final designation unless a management plan has been developed pursuant to the MPRSA; and (2) beginning on January 1, 1995, no permit or authorization for dumping shall be issued for a site designated pursuant to such Act unless a site management plan has been adopted for such site. Directs the Administrator to: (1) develop a site management plan for any site designated prior to January 1, 1993, as expeditiously as practicable, giving consideration to development plans for designated sites that are considered to have the greatest impact on the environment; and (2) provide for public review and comment on site designation actions, and hold a public hearing on any proposed designation or management plan development, revision, or redesignation in the region in which the site that is the subject of the management plan is located. Requires that permits issued with respect to the dumping permit program for dredged material: (1) designate and include such requirements, limitations, or conditions as necessary to assure consistency with any site management plan approved pursuant to the MPRSA (currently, the length of time for which the permits are valid and their expiration date), and special provisions that the Administrator or the Secretary determines to be reasonable and necessary to control and prevent pollution of waters and sediment in the area of the dredging project from on-shore and related facilities subject to the control of the entity seeking a permit; and (2) be issued for a period of up to three years. Specifies that any person who: (1) knowingly violates any provision of, or regulation promulgated or permit issued under, this title shall be fined under the Federal criminal code, imprisoned for not more than five years, or both (currently, fined up to $50,000, imprisoned for up to one year, or both); and (2) is convicted of such a violation shall forfeit to the United States any property constituting or derived from any proceeds that the person obtained as a result of such violation, and any of the property of the person which was used, or intended to be used, to commit or facilitate the commission of the violation. Provides that any vessel used to commit an act for which such a penalty is imposed under the MPRSA shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture to the United States under procedures established for seizure and forfeiture of conveyances under the Controlled Substances Act, with exceptions. Authorizes appropriations. Title VII: Studies - Authorizes and directs the Secretary to review the report of the Chief of Engineers on the Ohio River and Tributaries and other pertinent reports to determine whether modifications of the recommendations contained therein are advisable at the present time, with particular reference to improvements for water and related land resource needs. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of the economic benefits of Federal and significant non-Federal shore protection activities in the Mid-Atlantic region from New York to Virginia, assessing: (1) the public investment in such activities; (2) damage incurred by such shore protection activities by the coastal storms of October 1991 and January 1992; (3) the prevention of damage by such storms to coastal and upland resources as a result of such shore protection activities; and (4) the extent to which the prevention of damage to coastal and upland resources is considered in benefit-cost ratios for shore protection activities. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of Agriculture to study problems associated with flooding in Harrison County, Mississippi. Specifies that such Secretaries shall jointly conduct a reconnaissance study of such county and specified bodies of water and associated watersheds. Sets forth reporting requirements.
