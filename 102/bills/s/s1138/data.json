    "text": "Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1991 - Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, with respect to site characterization at the Yucca Mountain site (Nevada), to declare that Federal substantive and procedural requirements with respect to site characterization activities shall be implemented by the Federal agency administering the relevant statute even though administration authority has been delegated to the State, or has been superseded by comparable State law. Declares that authorization requirements imposed by a State, local, or tribal entity do not apply to site characterization under this Act. Requires the Secretary of Energy to implement site characterization activities even though such entities have refused to act upon, or denied applications for, such authorization. Provides that an action to contest the constitutionality of any decision made or action taken under this Act must be brought within 60 days of the first such decision or action. Prohibits a court from enjoining site characterization activities in an action to contest the constitutionality of this Act except as part of a final judgment. Repeals specified restrictions and limitations on the timing for site selection, construction, and operation of a monitored retrievable storage facility."
