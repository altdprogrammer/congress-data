Sets forth conditions and procedures for obtaining an extension of such time limitation. Requires the Senate Judiciary Committee, within 90 calendar days after receiving such a nomination, to review the nomination and report it to the Senate for advice and consent. Directs that: (1) a nomination not reported to the Senate within such time limit be discharged from the Committee, without recommendation, for a vote by the Senate on confirmation; and (2) the Senate vote on such confirmation no later than 30 calendar days after receiving it."
