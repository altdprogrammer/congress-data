Prohibits an action for eviction or distress of the dependents of a member of the armed forces during his or her active military service with respect to any premises for which the rent does not exceed $811 monthly (currently, $150), except upon leave of court or in an action affecting the right of possession. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when not operating as a service in the Navy (currently, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, or the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to the the Coast Guard) to order an allotment of pay of military personnel in order to discharge rent requirements for his or her dependents while in military service. States that the exercise of rights and the receipt of benefits provided by the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 regarding obligations, liabilities, taxes, fines, penalties, and insurance shall not be: (1) considered to reflect adversely on the member's ability to satisfy such obligations; (2) the basis for adverse credit reports regarding such person; or (3) the basis for denying credit to such person."
