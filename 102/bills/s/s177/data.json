Authorizes the payment through CHAMPUS insurance coverage of items and services for which payment is also made under Medicare, with a reduction in the amount payable through CHAMPUS by the amount already covered for such items and services through Medicare. Requires a person claiming a benefit through CHAMPUS for covered items and services to certify the cost charged for such items and services, as well as the amount of such costs already covered under applicable Medicare provisions."
