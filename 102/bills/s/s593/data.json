    "text": "Visual Pollution Control Act of 1991 - Authorizes (current law requires) reduction of Federal highway funds by up to five (currently, equal to ten) percent of apportioned funds for States that have not made provision for effective control of outdoor signs, displays, or devices (advertising) along Federal-aid highways. Requires, as part of effective control, that: (1) each State maintain an annual inventory of such advertising, identify such advertising as illegal, nonconforming, or conforming under State law, and assure that any prohibited advertising shall be removed; and (2) no State allow or undertake any vegetation removal or other alteration of the highway right-of-way to improve visibility of such advertising or permit modification of nonconforming advertising to improve its visibility or prolong its useful life. Prohibits any new advertising from being erected under Federal highway provisions after October 1, 1991, and treats advertising erected between such date and the effective date of this Act as nonconforming. Sets forth provisions with respect to the removal and acquisition of advertising and Federal participation in costs incurred by the State for such removal. Bars outdoor advertising by Federal agencies on public lands (excluding Indian lands and reservations) that fails to conform to regulations issued by the Federal agency with jurisdiction over, or responsibility for, such land. Requires such regulations to be at least as stringent as the requirements of the State in which the land is located."
