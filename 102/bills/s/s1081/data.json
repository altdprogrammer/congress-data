Requires institutions of higher education, in addition to other requirements for receiving scholarships for persons planning to enter occupations involving treatment works, to have participated in the treatment works training program and to assure representation of minorities and women in the scholarship program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 and 1992 to carry out the operator training and scholarship programs. Reserves a specified amount of funds for the scholarship program. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants for training in technical matters related to pollution causes, prevention, and elimination. Requires (currently, authorizes) the Administrator to establish research fellowships and maintain a system for forecasting the supply of, and demand for, occupational categories needed for the prevention, reduction, and elimination of pollution. Revises provisions concerning effluent guidelines to require the Administrator to promulgate effluent guidelines applicable to point sources which discharge pollutants into navigable waters. Sets forth requirements for such regulations. Repeals a provision authorizing the modification of a timetable with respect to effluent limitations. Requires effluent guidelines to be reviewed and revised at least every seven years (currently, five years). Directs the Administrator to revise such guidelines on an earlier date if advances in pollution control technology or practices would achieve a significant reduction in the quantity of toxicity of pollutants discharged to navigable waters and such advances are technologically and economically achievable. Requires the Administrator to promulgate or revise standards of performance for new sources in a category whenever effluent guidelines for such category are promulgated or revised. Provides for the review and revision of such standards at least every seven years. Requires sources with pollutant discharge permits and sources introducing pollutants into publicly owned treatment works to pay fees to the Administrator to meet costs of developing effluent guidelines and new source performance standards. Bases the assessment of fees on the volume and toxicity of the discharge. Modifies or waives such fees for small businesses or for reasons of financial hardship.

Authorizes the Administrator to establish biological monitoring and assessment methods for pollutants. Requires the Administrator to publish biennially a list of conventional, nonconventional, and toxic pollutants. Directs the Administrator to submit a plan for the development of water quality criteria and information to the Congress on a triennial basis. Requires the first plan to provide for: (1) publication of criteria and information for at least 20 pollutants for which criteria and information are not currently available in each fiscal year; (2) revision of at least 20 existing criteria documents to address the needs of lakes and marine waters; and (3) publication of at least 20 criteria documents for pollutants in aquatic sediments. Directs the Administrator to publish: (1) at least 60 criteria documents within four years of this Act's enactment date; and (2) a criteria document for whole effluent toxicity. Requires States to designate uses for all water bodies for which uses have not been designated. Includes within the water bodies for which uses shall be designated rivers and streams, lakes, estuarine water bodies, and waters of the contiguous zone. Applies use designations to the waters and aquatic sediments of water bodies. Requires water bodies not currently designated to support the goal of fishable, swimmable waters to be designated by a specified deadline. Authorizes the Administrator to extend a designated use for a water body for three years based on a showing by a State that attainment and maintenance of fishable, swimmable waters: (1) is not feasible because naturally occurring pollutant concentrations prevent attainment of the use or human caused sources of pollution prevent attainment and would cause more environmental harm to correct than to leave in place; or (2) would result in substantial and widespread social and economic impacts. Requires States to adopt water and sediment quality standards adequate to protect designated uses. Sets forth standards requirements. Authorizes States to adopt biological monitoring and assessment methods for a class of pollutants affecting a water body. Directs a State to: (1) adopt standards for pollutants for which water quality criteria and information are published; (2) notify States which border on the waters of such State and States with water bodies located upstream from the State of changes in standards; and (3) report revisions or adoptions of uses or standards to the Administrator.

Directs the Administrator to: (1) negotiate with representatives of the Government of Mexico to establish a program to prevent pollution and to monitor and improve water quality in the U.S.-Mexican border region; (2) determine which water bodies in the region are not in compliance with designated uses; (3) determine the sources of pollutants causing impairment of such water bodies and the amounts of pollutants discharged; and (4) assess the need for sewage treatment works to serve such region and the degree to which such needs will be met through certain funds allotted to States. Extends the general authorization of appropriations for the Federal Water Pollution Control Act through FY 1998. Establishes a Clean Water Fund to support the implementation of specified water pollution control programs. Sets forth Fund allotment requirements. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1992 (currently, FY 1996 and FY 1995, respectively) for implementation of the Long Island Sound Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan and the Lake Champlain Management Conference. Revises a condition on the use of a State water pollution control revolving fund to make loans to provide that the costs of administering the fund shall not exceed four percent of all capitalization grants (currently, all grant awards to the fund). Permits capitalization grants to American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, the Trust Territory of Palau (or its successor entity), the Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia to be used for grants for the construction of treatment works. Continues the allotment of funds under the current formula through FY 1996. Requires the Administrator to: (1) reserve a specified percentage of funds for incentive capitalization grants; and (2) make such grants to any State which, after FY 1992, deposits moneys in an amount equal to that deposited in FY 1991 in a water pollution control revolving fund. Directs States to deposit awards in such funds. Adds to the list of conditions under which water pollution control revolving funds may make loans that loans for publicly owned treatment works utilizing innovative treatment processes may be made at or below market interest rates at terms not to exceed 40 years. Prohibits more than five percent of the capitalized value of a fund from being used to provide such assistance. Sets forth provisions concerning the use of unobligated funds. Revises repayment requirements for loans made from State revolving funds to require annual principal and interest payments to commence within three (currently, one) years after completion of a project. Permits such loans to be made to reduce the principal of debt obligations by at least 85 percent where such obligations were incurred after May 15, 1991, and where the State has determined that the municipality, intermunicipality, or interstate agency would not be able to afford to undertake a project with assistance. Requires value engineering reviews to be conducted for any treatment works construction projected in excess of $20,000,000 (currently, $10,000,000)."
