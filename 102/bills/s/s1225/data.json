Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to take necessary actions for fire prevention and watershed protection in such areas. Declares that the Congress reserves a quantity of water sufficient to fulfill the purposes of the wilderness areas created by this Act. Releases all wilderness areas in the Los Padres National Forest from further statewide roadless area review and evaluation for purposes of determining their suitability for inclusion in the System. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate segments of the Sespe Creek and the Sisquoc and Big Sur Rivers, California, as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Designates segments of the Piru, Matilija, and Lopez Creeks, and the Little Sur River, California, as potential additions to the System. Authorizes appropriations."
