    "text": "Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces Act of 1991 - Establishes the Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces to study all matters relating to the assignment of women in the armed forces and to make findings on: (1) the implications on combat readiness of permitting women to be assigned to all combat positions; (2) the social and cultural implications of such position assignments; (3) the advisability of permitting only voluntary assignments of women to combat positions and of permitting involuntary assignments; (4) the advisability of requiring women to register and be drafted under the Military Selective Service Act; (5) the legal and policy implications of permitting women to qualify for assignment to combat positions; (6) the extent of the need to modify facilities, vessels, vehicles, aircraft, and other equipment to accommodate women assigned to combat positions, as well as the costs of such action and its practicality; and (7) the effects of existing laws relating to the recruitment, assignment, and promotion of women in the armed forces on combat readiness, opportunities for women in the armed forces, and the quality of personnel in the armed forces. Directs the Commission to transmit a final report to the President by November 15, 1992. Requires the President, by December 15, 1992, to transmit such report to the defense committees, along with comments and recommendations. Outlines administrative provisions concerning Commission powers, procedures, personnel matters, and expenses. Terminates the Commission 90 days after submission of its final report. Authorizes the Secretary concerned to prescribe the conditions under which female members of the armed forces may be assigned to duty in aircraft that are engaged in combat missions. Directs the Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces to conduct comprehensive research and analyses regarding the potential for women in the armed forces to serve in combat assignments. Directs the Commission to determine and promptly advise the Secretary of the types of information necessary for such research and analyses. Authorizes the Secretary, in consultation with the Commission, to conduct test assignments of women to combat positions and to waive Federal restrictions on such duty assignments in order to conduct such test assignments."
