    "text": "Medicare and Medicaid Chronic Care Amendments Act of 1991 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to: (1) eliminate the requirement that the coinsurance rate for Medicare post-hospital extended care services equal 1/8th of the inpatient hospital deductible; (2) set the Medicare coinsurance amount for such services at $65.00 a day beginning in calendar year 1992; and (3) maintain such amount until the coinsurance rate equals 20 percent of the national average per diem cost recognized under Medicare for such services. Covers up to 42 consecutive days of nursing and home health aide services. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to study and report to the Congress on the impact of eliminating the three-day prior hospitalization requirement for Medicare coverage of post-hospital extended care services. Requires the Secretary to: (1) enter into agreements with at least three peer review organizations to review the prior hospital stay requirement; and (2) report to the Congress on review results. Authorizes five five-year demonstration projects under the Medicaid program (title XIX of the Social Security Act) to provide for the operation of adult day care centers located in elderly housing facilities financed under the Housing Act of 1959 in order to reduce the risk of institutionalization and provide respite to families who care for the elderly at home. Outlines project requirements, project application contents, individual eligibility criteria, financing and other provisions concerning such projects. Requires the Secretary to evaluate the effectiveness of each demonstration project and submit a report summarizing the evaluation to specified congressional committees."
