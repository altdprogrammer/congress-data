    "text": "Long Island Sound Comprehensive Improvement Act of 1992 - Directs the Secretary of the Army to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the Long Island Sound to: (1) consolidate certain ongoing studies; and (2) develop a comprehensive long-range plan of improvement for the Sound that includes provisions for the control of water quality, commercial and recreational navigation, storm protection, water pollution control and remediation, beach erosion control and recreation, technical data and modeling support for the Management Conferences of the Long Island Sound Study (Study), and other areas of concern. Requires the Secretary, with respect to the Sound and its principal tributaries, to: (1) develop a three-dimensional mathematical model; and (2) construct, operate, and maintain in the State of New York a large-scale hydraulic model and, in association with that model, construct a center for public education. Directs that the models and center be available, in conjunction with any research, investigation, or study conducted by the entity concerning the Sound, for use by: (1) any Federal agency; (2) the governments of New York and Connecticut; and (3) the Study. Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop a reconnaissance-level plan to implement this Act, including an inventory of ongoing related studies, an examination of known water resource problems and needs, an implementation plan for locating and constructing the hydraulic model, and a framework for participation by States and the public in the investigation; and (2) report to specified congressional committees. Directs the Secretary to conduct a comprehensive study, with respect to the Sound, to: (1) fully explore water resources problems; and (2) develop alternative plans that include an assessment of costs, benefits, and environmental impacts. Specifies that: (1) the principal focus of the study shall be the development of cost-effectiveness criteria against which to evaluate identified solutions to water resources problems of the Sound; and (2) the study shall fully evaluate the environmental consequences and future costs of refraining from taking any Federal action. Directs the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees a feasibility report that includes the findings of the study. Requires that the full cost of developing and preparing the reconnaissance plan and report be paid by the Federal Government. Sets the Federal share of developing and preparing the feasibility report at 50 percent. Directs that 50 percent of such costs be paid from non-Federal sources. Authorizes appropriations."
