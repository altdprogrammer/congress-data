    "text": "Foreign Tax Simplification Act of 1991 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt foreign corporations that are not doing business in the United States from the uniform capitalization rules in determining earnings and profits. Makes a technical correction to the definition of passive foreign investment company. Applies a separate foreign tax credit limitation for foreign corporations in which U.S. parent companies do not own a controlling interest. Requires that foreign tax credits claimed on foreign income be translated in U.S. dollars at the same rate as the income. Provides that the look-through rules for controlled foreign corporations do not apply to companies with less than $1,000,000 in all of their separate categories."
