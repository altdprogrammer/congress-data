    "text": "Fruit and Vegetable Producers Emergency Assistance Act of 1991 - Title I: Emergency Crop Loss Assistance - Subtitle A: Fruits and Vegetables - Provides disaster payments for and prevented planting credit for fruit and vegetable producers who suffered 1991 crop reductions due to 1990 or 1991 adverse weather conditions. Bases payment rates on crop loss percentages. Makes payments on a crop-by-crop basis. Prohibits 1991 payments unless a producer agrees to obtain 1992 and 1993 crop insurance, with specified exceptions. Authorizes 1991 crop quality reduction payments for producers incurring specified crop production deficiencies. Limits the Federal share of such assistance to 50 percent. Reduces disaster payments for producers receiving Federal crop insurance payments. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) program fund transfers; (2) de minimis yields; and (3) producer eligibility. Prohibits double payments on replanted acreage. Subtitle B: Administrative Provisions - Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) timing and manner of assistance; (2) use of the Commodity Credit Corporation; (3) duplicative payments; and (4) authorization of emergency designation of outlays. Title II: Other Emergency Provisions - Provides disaster assistance loan guarantees (through the Rural Development Insurance Fund) for rural businesses adversely affected by 1990 or 1991 weather conditions. Limits: (1) individual guarantees to $500,000; and (2) aggregate program guarantees to $300,000,000. Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to authorize disaster assistance for rehabilitation or restoration of damaged trees. Increases assistance limits. Amends the emergency grants for low-income migrant and seasonal worker program to: (1) increase assistance limits; (2) include packing house workers; and (3) provide housing cost assistance."
