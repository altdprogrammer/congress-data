    "text": "Authorizes the Assistant Secretary of the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) to develop a Teacher Job Bank Program. Requires such program to include: (1) development of a model computer program to link available teaching positions with applicants; (2) grants to States to use the model program to establish a teacher job bank in each State; (3) consultation with potential beneficiaries and users; (4) attempts to ensure that every State readily adopts the model program; and (5) specified model program capabilities and system contents. Requires OERI to: (1) have the model program available for implementation one year after enactment of this Act; (2) notify the Governors of each State of the model program's availability; and (3) award such grants to States, to be matched from non-Federal sources on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Requires State Governors to specify in a grant application an appropriate State agency to act as lead agency. Requires grant funds to be used to establish a teacher job bank in the State. Allows such funds to be used to purchase necessary equipment and hardware to make such job bank operational, but prohibits use of such funds for the job bank's ongoing maintenance and operation. Authorizes appropriations."
