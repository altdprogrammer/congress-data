    "text": "Allows a military medal or decoration to be awarded to a person as long as statements justifying such award or decoration are made within two years after the death of such person (currently, within two years after the distinguished service). Repeals provisions requiring such medals or decorations to be awarded within three years (Army and Air Force) or five years (Navy and Marine Corps) after the act justifying such award. States that the current time limitation policies with respect to the awarding of such medals or decorations may not be applied administratively to the awarding of such medals or decorations for the recognition of: (1) service as a member of the armed forces; or (2) any act of such person while so serving. Waives a provision requiring military records to be corrected within three years after the discovery of error. Allows such correction to be made as long as: (1) the claimant or his or her legal representative files a request for the correction; and (2) such request is filed within two years after the death of the claimant. Allows a board to excuse the lack of a timely filing in the interest of justice."
