States that for purposes of such program the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and titles II and III of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 shall not apply with respect to: (1) the importing of opium; and (2) the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of parenteral diacetylmorphine. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees concerning: (1) program-related activities; (2) the extent of research activities in the management of pain which have received funds through the National Institutes of Health; (3) the ways in which the Federal Government supports the training of health personnel in pain management; and (4) recommendations for expanding and improving the training of health personnel in pain management. Permits the Secretary at any time six months after implementation of the program to modify or terminate the program if: (1) the program is no longer needed; or (2) modifications or termination are needed to prevent substantial diversion of the diacetylmorphine."
