    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that U.S. nationals conducting industrial cooperation projects in China or Tibet should adhere to specified principles, including to: (1) suspend the use of merchandise manufactured by convict or forced labor; (2) seek to ensure political and religious freedom without fear for one's employment status; (3) ensure that methods of production do not pose a danger to project employees and the surrounding environment; (4) strive to use business enterprises that are not controlled by China; and (5) promote human rights in China. Requires the Secretary of State (Secretary) to forward a copy of such principles to member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and encourage them to promote such principles. Requires each U.S. national to register with the Secretary of State and indicate whether they agree to implement such principles. Sets forth specified reporting requirements. Authorizes U.S. agencies to intercede on behalf of a U.S. national with foreign governments or foreign nationals regarding export marketing activity in China or Tibet if such U.S. national adheres to such principles. Requires the Secretary to report annually to appropriate congressional committees on: (1) enforcement procedures with respect to prohibitions on the importation into the United States of goods manufactured by convict or forced labor; (2) steps taken to investigate which goods are produced by such labor in China and Tibet; and (3) the results of such investigations."
