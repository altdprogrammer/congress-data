Provides for the deposit of deducted amounts, along with an equivalent amount contributed by the Department of State, into the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund. Requires a special contribution for past service as an AID investigator/inspector which would have been creditable toward civil service law enforcement retirement and for which a contribution has not been made to equal the difference between the amount actually contributed under Foreign Service retirement provisions and the amount that should have been contributed under civil service provisions. Increases the mandatory retirement age for AID criminal investigators/inspectors to 57 (currently, 55). Includes premium pay for irregular, unscheduled overtime in the definition of \"basic pay\" for purposes of computing annuities for AID criminal investigators/inspectors."
