Authorizes the Secretary to enter into one or more cooperative research and development agreements and one or more funding agreements with U.S. companies to: (1) research how to overcome technical barriers to the development and construction of high-speed rail transportation systems; and (2) transfer such technology to industry to help create a viable commercial high-speed rail transportation industry in the United States. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1996. Requires the Secretary to submit to appropriate congressional committees a study of the commercial feasibility of constructing one or more high-speed rail transportation systems in the United States. Requires the Secretary to develop designs for high-speed rail system technological concepts that have the potential for both application in the United States and significant participation by U.S. industries in their development. Authorizes the Secretary to award contracts for the development of such designs. Requires the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees on which designs warrant development as a full-scale prototype. Directs the Secretary to establish the National High-Speed Rail Transportation Policy. Establishes within the Federal Railroad Administration the High-Speed Ground Transportation Office."
