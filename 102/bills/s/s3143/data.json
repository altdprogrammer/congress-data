    "text": "Military Personnel Transition Act of 1992 - Title V (SIC): Military Personnel Policy - Subtitle D: Active Forces Transaction Enhancements - Directs the Secretary to implement a program to encourage members and former members of the armed forces to enter into public and community service jobs after discharge or release from active duty. Directs the Secretary to maintain a registry of discharged or released former members who request assistance in pursuing such careers, as well as a registry of public and community service organizations. Directs the Secretary to match former personnel registered with jobs coming available through the service organizations. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop proposed uniform standards and procedures for the granting of appropriate credit for service in the armed forces under State teacher certification or licensing procedures; and (2) coordinate with appropriate State agencies the incorporation of such standards and procedures into such State's certification or licensing requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to delegate his responsibilities to the Secretary of Education. Authorizes the Secretary concerned to grant to an eligible member of the armed forces a leave of absence of up to one year to pursue a program of education or training for the development of skills relevant to the performance of public and community service. Outlines provisions concerning eligibility requirements and excludes any member granted such a leave of absence for such purposes from any required military personnel end strength limitations. Terminates the authority to grant such leaves on September 30, 1995. Authorizes the Secretary concerned, upon the member's request, to grant an early retirement to regular or reserve commissioned officers in their respective military departments who have served between 15 and 20 years, as long as such members agree to register on the public or community service registry maintained under this Act by the Secretary and to receive counseling regarding such job opportunities. Provides for the computation of the retired pay of members so retired and provides funding for the implementation of such early retirement. Terminates such authority on October 1, 1995. Provides that if a member so retired is actually employed by a public or community service organization within their enhanced retirement qualification period, their retirement pay shall be recomputed to provide an increase in the years of service which includes the years of public or community service. Defines the \"enhanced retirement qualification period\" as the period between the member's early retirement date and the date on which the member would have completed 20 years of service had the member not chosen early retirement. Provides for a similar recomputation of the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) base amount for the purpose of payment of survivors annuities. Allows active-duty personnel who are voluntarily discharged or released from the armed forces, who have completed a program of education leading to a standard college degree, and who previously made an election while on active duty not to participate in the Montgomery GI Bill educational assistance program to withdraw such election within 90 days after discharge or release and participate in the program. Requires a $1,200 payment to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs by such individuals for participation in the program. Provides that, except for annual training or active duty for training of 30 days or less, a reserve member entitled to voluntary separation incentive payments who is also entitled to basic pay for active service shall forfeit an amount of voluntary separation incentive pay which is equal to the total amount of basic pay received during such concurrent periods. Extends through FY 1995 the authorization of appropriations for certain employment, job training, and other assistance for members being separated from active duty. Directs the Secretary and the Director of OPM to jointly carry out a program to provide eligible persons with temporary health benefits under the program of continued health coverage provided for former civilian employees of the Government. Makes eligible for such continued coverage members who were voluntarily or involuntarily discharged or released from active duty under other than adverse conditions, were entitled to medical and dental care prior to such discharge or release, and would not otherwise be eligible for such benefits after such discharge or release and any applicable period of transitional health care. Outlines provisions concerning: (1) notification by the Director of eligibility;(2) election by the member to receive such continued benefits; (3) coverage of dependents; (4) charges for such coverage, to be paid into the Employees Health Benefits Fund; (5) contributions into such Fund by the Secretary in the case of coverage for a member involuntarily discharged; (6) the period of continued coverage; (7) transitional provisions; and (8) termination of other health conversion policies upon election of coverage under the above health benefits continuation program. Subtitle E: Guard and Reserve Transition Initiatives - Defines the \"force reduction transition period,\" for purposes of this Subtitle, as the period beginning on October 1, 1991, and ending on September 30, 1995. Provides that during the force reduction transition period (period), no unit in the Selected Reserve may be inactivated and no such member may be involuntarily discharged from a reserve component or involuntarily transferred from the Selected Reserve before the Secretary has promulgated, implemented, and transmitted to the defense committees regulations that govern the treatment of members assigned to such units and members of the Selected Reserve being subjected to such actions. Requires such regulations to ensure that Selected Reserve members are treated fairly with respect to their service to their country and with attention to the adverse personal consequences of unit deactivation or involuntary discharges or transfers. States that the protections afforded by such regulations shall not apply with respect to a member discharged or transferred under specified circumstances, including: (1) at the member's request; (2) due to the lack of qualification for further membership; (3) under adverse conditions; or (4) based on current eligibility for retirement or separation pay. Provides for the payment of annual retirement payments by the Secretary concerned to a member of the Selected Reserve who, during the period (and an application period), has completed at least 20 years of retirement-creditable service, is under 60 years of age, and applies for transfer to the Retired Reserve. Outlines provisions concerning the length of such annual payments as well as its computation. Authorizes the Secretary concerned to limit the applicability of such provisions in order to meet the specific needs of the service. Provides funding. Authorizes the Secretary concerned, during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and ending on October 1, 1995, to provide early retirement benefits for a person who has completed at least 15, but less than 20 years of service as of October 1, 1991, or after such date and before October 1, 1995, has completed at least 15 years of service and transfers to the Retired Reserve. Authorizes the Secretary concerned to limit the applicability of such provisions in order to meet the specific needs of the service. Provides separation pay, in a computed amount, to members of the Selected Reserve who have completed at least six but less than 15 years of service and who are involuntarily discharged or transferred from the Selected Reserve. Waives the continued service required for eligibility under the Montgomery GI Bill educational assistance program for individuals who, before completing the years-in-service requirement, cease to be members of the Selected Reserve by reason of inactivation of their unit during the period. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations to authorize a person who involuntarily ceases to be a member of the Selected Reserve during the period to continue to receive commissary and exchange privileges for one year after such cessation or one year after the enactment of this Act, whichever is later. Increases from 120 to 365 days after the involuntary termination as a member of the Selected Reserve the period during which continued coverage under Servicemen's Group Life Insurance will be provided, as long as such member is able to fulfill certain other requirements for eligibility for such insurance. Authorizes the Secretary concerned to limit the applicability of any of the above benefits provided to members and former members of the Selected Reserve in order to meet the needs of the service. States that all such benefits are inapplicable to personnel who cease to be members under adverse conditions."
