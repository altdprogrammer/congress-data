    "text": "Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments Act of 1989 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to outline requirements for State solid waste disposal plans. Directs each State to certify to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency that it will have adequate capacity to manage all solid waste generated in such State for the next 20 years. Considers a State which is required to transport over 20 percent of its solid waste annually to another State to have failed to manage such waste in accordance with a plan and certification. Authorizes States that provide the required certification to impose and collect fees for solid waste disposal or treatment. Permits such fees to be imposed on solid waste generated within or outside of the State. Authorizes States to delegate fee assessment authority to political subdivisions. Directs the Administrator to require persons transporting or shipping solid waste in excess of 500 pounds in interstate commerce to submit annual registration statements. Makes such statements available to the public. Makes it unlawful for any State to transport waste in interstate or foreign commerce unless such waste is transported under a written agreement with another State under which such State agrees to accept such waste. Authorizes the Administrator to assess civil penalties or commence civil actions for unlawful transportation of waste. Permits two or more States to enter into agreements or compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance for the management of solid waste. Grants congressional approval to such compacts. Makes the Interstate Commerce Commission responsible for investigating and reviewing interstate operations and agreements involving the transportation, treatment, and disposition of solid waste. Prohibits any sanitary landfill from being established within: (1) a 50 year floodplain; (2) a wetland; or (3) two miles of a State or national park, forest, wild and scenic river, or river study boundary. Requires landfills sited under the Solid Waste Disposal Act to: (1) have methods to detect and prevent leakage or contamination of soils and waters; (2) show financial responsibility capabilities for damages resulting from operations; (3) have appropriate requirements for source separation and recycling prior to disposal; and (4) have appropriate requirements for closure and postclosure care."
