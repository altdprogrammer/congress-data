    "text": "National Defense Technology and Industrial Base Conversion and Assistance Act of 1992 - Title VIII (SIC): Acquisition Policy, Acquisition Management, and Related Matters - Subtitle A: Defense Conversion Policy for the National Defense Technology and Industrial Base - Sets forth provisions concerning the National Defense Technology and Industrial Base (NDTIB). Outlines NDTIB policy objectives and how they relate to defense conversion and civil-military integration objectives. Establishes the National Defense Technology and Industrial Base Council (Council) to provide overall policy guidance and direction to the military departments and defense agencies concerning: (1) the capabilities of the NDTIB to meet U.S. national security objectives; (2) programs for achieving the defense conversion objectives set forth; and (3) changes in acquisition policy that would strengthen the NDTIB. Directs the Council to prepare a comprehensive annual assessment of the NDTIB to achieve its stated objectives. Requires each assessment to include a sector (technology or industry) capability analysis containing specified information with respect to its ability to achieve the stated objectives. Outlines factors concerning foreign dependency on raw materials, systems, equipment, and facilities to be addressed in each assessment. Requires each such assessment to also include: (1) an analysis of the present and projected financial condition of each sector for specified periods; (2) an analysis of the impact of the terminations and significant reductions of major R&D and procurement programs of DOD on the capability of each sector to achieve its objectives; (3) a critical technology analysis that identifies the product and process technologies that are most critical for attaining the technology and industrial base objectives; and (4) an analysis of each sector's viability in light of defense and nondefense expenditures, integration with the commercial marketplace, and production. Directs the Council to prepare an annual plan for ensuring that the policies and programs of DOD, the Department of Energy (DOE), and other Federal departments and agencies are planned, coordinated, funded, and implemented in a manner which achieves policy objectives. Requires each plan to provide specific guidance, including goals, milestones, and priorities, with respect to: (1) sector viability; (2) manufacturing technology; (3) critical technologies; (4) integrated financing; (5) civil-military integration; (6) defense conversion; (7) technology and industrial base work force; (8) major program acquisition; and (9) acquisition reform.

Sets forth provisions concerning dual-use technologies (technologies having both commercial and military applications). Directs the Secretary to conduct a program providing for the establishment of cooperative arrangements (partnerships) between DOD and certain non-DOD entities (nonprofit research corporations, federal laboratories, institutions of higher education, agencies of State governments, and other entities showing support for such work) in order to encourage and provide for research, development, and application of technologies to attain the NDTIB objectives. Limits partnership duration to five years. Provides 50 percent Federal funding of the partnership for the first year, reduced by ten percent each year of the partnership. Provides for consideration of in-kind contributions by non-Government participants in a partnership when determining the sharing of partnership costs. Requires competitive procedures to be used in the establishment of such partnerships. Outlines partnership selection criteria and authorizes the Director of Defense Research and Engineering to perform the responsibilities of the Secretary under the partnerships. Renames the current critical technology application centers assistance program as the regional technology alliances assistance program.

Directs the Secretary to establish within his Office the Office of Technology Transition to ensure that technology developed for national security purposes is integrated into the private sector of the United States in order to enhance the NDTIB. Provides further duties of the Office and requires the Secretary to report to the defense committees on Office activities. Requires such Office to commence operations within 180 days after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish a National Defense Manufacturing Technology Program to: (1) provide centralized guidance and direction to the military departments and defense agencies on all matters relating to manufacturing technology; (2) direct the development and implementation of DOD goals, plans, projects, activities, and policies that promote the development and application of advanced technologies to manufacturing processes, tools, and equipment; (3) improve the quality and practices of businesses providing goods and services to DOD; (4) promote dual-use manufacturing processes; (5) disseminate to businesses information concerning improved manufacturing concepts; (6) enhance the skills of the manufacturing work force; and (7) ensure appropriate coordination between the manufacturing technology and industrial preparedness programs of DOD and similar programs undertaken by other Federal departments and agencies and the private sector. Requires the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition to perform the duties of the Secretary under the manufacturing technology program. Earmarks specified amounts authorized for R&D under this Act for: (1) defense advanced manufacturing technology partnerships; (2) manufacturing technology extension programs; and (3) defense manufacturing education programs. Sets forth provisions concerning miscellaneous technology base policies and programs. Directs the Secretary to establish a program to achieve the NDTIB objectives set forth under this Act by providing dual-use enhancement capability support to various nonprofit, public, and private organizations. Outlines services provided under the program. Provides Federal funding of such program of 50 percent in the first year, 40 percent in the second year, and 30 percent in the third and following years.
