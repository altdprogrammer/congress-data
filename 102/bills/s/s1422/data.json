    "text": "Disaster Assistance Act of 1991 - Title I: Emergency Crop Loss Assistance - Subtitle A: Annual Crops - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make disaster payments to 1990 and 1991 producers of wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, extra long staple cotton, rice, peanuts, sugar, tobacco, and other nonprogram crops. Extends crop quality reduction disaster assistance. Reduces disaster assistance payments in relation to Federal crop insurance payments. Requires producers to obtain Federal crop insurance for 1992 and 1993 in order to be eligible for disaster payments and other specified assistance for 1990 and 1991 crop losses. Sets forth exempted circumstances. Requires the Secretary to announce within a specified time the conditions for establishing a 1990 or 1991 farm yield for forage-use-crops. Limits assistance under this subtitle to $100,000. Prohibits double payments on replanted acreage. Authorizes: (1) the substitution of crop insurance program yields for 1990 and 1991 disaster assistance eligibility purposes; and (2) the Secretary to determine a de minimis yield for each crop eligible for reduced yield disaster payments. Permits oilseeds to be planted in place of 1991 program crops in disaster-affected areas on 0/92 and 50/92 acreage and on prevented planting acreage under specified conditions. Subtitle B: Emergency Forage Program - Directs the Secretary to implement an emergency forage program to reseed 1990 or 1991 weather damaged forage crops. Limits: (1) Federal cost-sharing to 50 percent; and (2) individual payments to $3,500. Funds such program through the Commodity Credit Corporation (with a $50,000,000 limit). Subtitle C: Administrative Provisions - Directs the Secretary to make full disaster assistance available as soon as possible. Title II: Rural Businesses - Directs the Secretary to make loan guarantees to rural businesses (including Indian tribes and entities) affected by damaging weather in 1990 or 1991. Limits: (1) individual payments to $500,000; and (2) program guarantees to $200,000,000. Title III: Disaster Credit and Forbearance - Directs the Secretary to provide 1992 direct credit operating loans and loan guarantees to assist farmers who suffered major weather caused crop losses in 1990 or 1991."
