    "text": "Civil Rights Act of 1991 - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide for the burden of proof which the complaining party and the respondent must meet in certain situations relating to unlawful employment practices based on disparate impact. Declares that, for determining whether a litigated or consent judgment or order resolving a claim of employment discrimination binds only the individuals who were parties to the judgment or order, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply in the same manner as to other civil actions. Amends Federal law to declare that: (1) for purposes of provisions relating to equal rights under the law, the right to make and enforce contracts includes the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contract; and (2) the rights protected by the amended provisions are protected against impairment by non-governmental discrimination as well as against impairment under color of State law. Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to declare that an alleged unlawful employment practice occurs, with regard to a seniority system, when: (1) the system is adopted; (2) an individual becomes subject to the system; or (3) a person is injured by application of the system or provision, adopted for an intentionally discriminatory purpose, whether or not the discriminatory purpose is apparent on the face of the provision. Makes it an unlawful employment practice to harass an employee or applicant because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, provided the complaining party failed to use the employer's procedure for resolving harassment complaints. Provides for temporary or preliminary relief and for monetary awards to a specified maximum amount. Delays the deadline for filing charges for a limited period while an employee uses the employer's harassment resolution system. Allows expert's fees to be included in attorney's fees awarded to the prevailing party in an employment discrimination case. Extends the time limit for an aggrieved employee or employment applicant to file a civil action after notice of final action by a department, agency, or unit of the Federal Government. Requires the same interest to compensate for delay in payment by the Government as in cases involving non-public parties. Replaces, in provisions prohibiting employment discrimination by the Federal Government, a reference to the legislative branch with a reference to the Congress, or its Houses, committees, offices or instrumentalities, or the offices of any of its Members. Gives, with respect to such entities, the authorities of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to each House of Congress, or to the Congress as a whole. Encourages, when knowingly and voluntarily agreed to by the parties, reasonable alternative means of dispute resolution in place of the judicial resolution of disputes under this Act and the Acts amended by this Act."
