    "text": "Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1991 - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to restrict the export of nuclear weapon items to a non-nuclear weapon state, unless: (1) such state maintains International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards on all its peaceful nuclear activities; and (2) the export, retransfer, or activity is under the terms of an agreement for cooperation. Prohibits the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from issuing any license for the export of highly enriched uranium. Directs the President to undertake negotiations with foreign nations which participate in the Nuclear Suppliers Group to establish specified multilateral nuclear non-proliferation controls. Sets forth sanctions for violations of this Act. Amends the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 to require the United States to enter into negotiations with other nations and groups of nations to improve the effectiveness of the safeguards of the IAEA."
