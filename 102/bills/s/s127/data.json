    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-01-14", 
    "text": "Veterans Benefits and Health Care Amendments of 1991 - Title I: Compensation - Part A: Generally - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to increase the rates of, and limitations on, Department of Veterans Affairs disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation to coincide with benefit increases under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act. Requires such rate increases to be published in the Federal Register. Part B: Radiogenic Disabilities - Extends the presumption of service-connection, for purposes of eligibility for veterans' disability compensation, to cover members of the reserves who participated in a radiation-risk activity while serving on active duty for training or inactive duty for training. Amends Federal provisions relating to the payment of disability compensation due to certain diseases and disabilities presumed to be service-connected to remove the current limitation on the required manifestation period (either 40 or 30 years from the date on which a veteran last participated in a radiation-risk activity). Adds cancer of the salivary gland and cancer of the urinary tract to the list of diseases that will be presumed to be service-connected for purposes of such disability compensation. Requires the Secretary, within 210 days after enactment of this Act, to identify at least three military activities which likely would have exposed individuals to levels of ionizing radiation above background levels. Requires the Secretary to identify at least three additional activities by October 1 of FY 1991 through 1993. Requires the Secretary, immediately after identifying each additional activity, to direct the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards to evaluate, make findings, and report on whether participation in such activities resulted in exposure comparable to that resulting from a radiation-risk activity as defined under current law. Requires the Secretary to list each such activity unless the Advisory Committee's report and all other evidence indicate that such activity did not result in comparable exposure to that of veterans participating in radiation-risk activities. Requires the Secretary to make certain reports. Part C: Agent Orange Exposure and Vietnam Service - Veterans' Agent Orange Exposure and Vietnam Service Benefits Act of 1991 - Establishes a presumption of service connection, for the purposes of eligibility for veterans' disability compensation, for each of the following diseases incurred by individuals who served in Vietnam during the Vietnam era, if such diseases become manifest to a disability degree of ten percent or more: (1) non-Hodgkins lymphoma; (2) each soft-tissue sarcoma; and (3) chloracne. Provides a presumption of service-connection in the case of a Vietnam veteran suffering from a disease associated with effects of exposure to certain dioxins or other herbicide agents during such service in Vietnam. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations listing a positive association between any disease and the biological effects of exposure to an herbicide agent in Vietnam. Requires the Secretary to update such list continually. Requires the Secretary, in prescribing and revising such list, to obtain by contract the determinations and estimates of a contract scientific organization. Requires such organization to: (1) determine which diseases have any degree of association with the biological effects of exposure to a herbicide agent; and (2) estimate the extent of association between each such disease and each such biological effect. Requires the organization to determine such association specifically with respect to lung cancer and each other cancer. Outlines contract provisions required in such agreements between the Secretary and the scientific organization, including surveys, evaluations, and periodic determinations. Requires such scientific organization to provide reports to the Secretary and the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees (veterans' committees) regarding its determinations and evaluations. Requires such organization to determine, in the event of a positive association, whether there is a reasonable basis for concluding that a Vietnam veteran with the highest level of exposure to that herbicide agent in Vietnam was exposed to such agent under the circumstances necessary for such biological effects. Requires a report from the organization to the Secretary and the veterans' committees when no such reasonable basis is found. Requires the Secretary to make certain determinations and follow-up reports after receiving such reports from the contract scientific organization, including the issuance of a report to the veterans' committees and the promulgation of positive association regulations, if necessary. Requires benefits to be continued even though a disease is removed from the list of diseases having positive associations. Terminates such contracting authority ten years after the first day of the fiscal year in which a scientific organization transmits its first report to the Secretary. Provides interim regulations and special effective dates. Directs the Secretary to compile and analyze all clinical data that: (1) are obtained by the VA in connection with examinations and treatment of veterans for disabilities related to exposure to certain herbicides or to service in Vietnam; and (2) are likely to be scientifically useful in determining the association, if any, between the disabilities of such veterans and their exposure to such herbicides and other toxic substances. Requires the Secretary to submit an annual report to the veterans' committees concerning such analysis and its results. Directs the Secretary to consult with the Director of the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) before compiling and analyzing such information. Requires the Director of OTA to review each annual report submitted by the Secretary and transmit to the Secretary an evaluation of the contents of each report. Directs the Secretary to establish and maintain a system for the collection and storage of voluntarily contributed samples of blood and tissue of veterans who performed active service in Vietnam during the Vietnam era. Outlines provisions concerning the security and authorized uses of such specimens, as well as limitations on the acceptance of such samples. Requires the Secretary to consult with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to the extent that an agreement has been reached with NAS serving as the contract scientific organization for the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to consult with the Director of OTA if no agreement is made with NAS. Directs the Secretary to establish a program to provide for studies of the feasibility of conducting additional scientific research on health hazards resulting from: (1) exposure to dioxin; (2) exposure to other toxic agents in herbicides used in support of U.S. and allied military operations in Vietnam during the Vietnam era; and (3) active military, naval, or air service there. Requires the Secretary to report to the veterans' committees on the results of such studies. Requires the Secretary to consult with NAS before undertaking such studies and requires NAS to review such studies and report recommendations to the Secretary and the veterans' committees to the extent provided under any agreement between the Secretary and NAS. Amends the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 1988 to require the Secretary to annually furnish updated information to individuals listed in the Department of Veterans Affairs Agent Orange Registry on health risks resulting from exposure to dioxin or other toxic agents in herbicides as a result of service in Vietnam during the Vietnam era. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the veterans' committees on the research being conducted to develop treatments for psychological absorption of dioxin and other toxic agents used in herbicides by the United States in Vietnam, including research relating to exposure to dioxin and other toxic agents outside Vietnam. Extends through December 31, 1993, the eligibility for hospital and nursing home care for veterans exposed to toxic substances in Vietnam. Title II: Health Care - Part A: Mental Health - Authorizes the provision of health care and services for veterans of World War I or II, the Korean Conflict, the Vietnam Era, or any other area during a period in which hostilities occurred who have been diagnosed to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to such services even though such disorder has not been determined to be service-connected. Requires the VA to accomplish an evaluation of a veteran within seven days after referral of such veteran to a Department health-care facility from a Vet Center (a center for treatment of veterans with mental illness disabilities). Expands eligibility for readjustment counseling at Vet Centers to include veterans of wars prior to Vietnam and veterans of service in any areas in which U.S. personnel were subjected to danger from armed conflict comparable to that occurring in battle with an enemy during a period of war. Directs the Secretary to establish and operate up to five VA health-care facilities as centers of mental illness research, education, and clinical activities, taking into account appropriate geographic distribution of such facilities. Precludes the Secretary from designating any health-care facility as a center unless the facility has (or may reasonably be anticipated to develop): (1) an arrangement with an accredited medical school or graduate school of psychology which provides education and training in psychiatry and psychology through regular rotation through such center so as to provide training in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness; (2) an arrangement under which nurses, social workers, or other allied health personnel receive education and training in mental health care through regular rotation through such facility; (3) the ability to attract the participation of scientists who are capable of ingenuity and creativity in research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of mental illness and into models for furnishing care and treatment to veterans suffering from mental illness; (4) a policymaking advisory committee to advise the directors of such facility and center on policy matters pertaining to the activities of such center; and (5) the capability to conduct effectively evaluations of the activities of such center. Authorizes appropriations. Declares that activities of clinical and scientific investigation at each center shall be eligible to compete for the award of funding from funds appropriated for the Department's medical and prosthetics research account and shall receive priority insofar as funds are awarded to projects for mental illness. Requires the Chief Medical Director (CMD) to ensure that: (1) research activities carried out through such centers include an appropriate emphasis on the psychosocial dimension of mental illness and on models for furnishing care and treatment to veterans suffering from mental illness; and (2) useful information produced by the centers is disseminated throughout the Veterans Health Services and Research Administration (HSRA). Requires the Secretary to submit to the veterans' committees an annual report on activities and effectiveness of the centers. Directs the Special Committee on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder to submit to the Secretary and veterans' committees no later than February 15 of each of the years 1991 through 1993 a report on the Committee's evaluation of the results of a study required under the Veteran's Health Care Amendments of 1983 relating to the diagnosis and treatment of veterans suffering from PTSD. Directs the Secretary to comment to the veterans' committees concerning such report. Requires the Committee to update certain reports required of the Committee under the Veterans' Health Care Act of 1984 and requires the Secretary to comment to the veterans' committees concerning such updates. Directs the Secretary, in certain papers required to be submitted to the President annually, to identify the amounts in the appropriations requests for the VA that are estimated to be obligated for payments and treatments for veterans suffering from PTSD, and for education, training, research, and the operation of the National Center on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Requires the Secretary to ensure to the extent practicable that there are Department PTSD treatment units in locations readily accessible to veterans residing in rural areas of the United States. Part B: General Health - Authorizes the VA to furnish wheelchairs, prosthetic devices, and other medically necessary supplies and services as part of veterans' outpatient care when necessary either to obviate the need for hospital admission or in preparation for hospital admission. Provides outpatient dental care when medically necessary in preparation for hospital admission or for a veteran otherwise receiving other outpatient care or services. Increases the maximum cost limitation for the provision of certain home health care services to disabled veterans. Makes permanent the program of community-based contract veterans' alcohol and drug treatment program (currently expires September 30, 1991). Extends through FY 1995 the authority to provide contract care to U.S. veterans in the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in the Philippines. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the upgrading and replacement of equipment and facilities for such Center through FY 1995. Decreases such annual authorization amount from $1,000,000 to $500,000. Earmarks the first $50,000 of grants appropriated to the Center for educating and training hospital personnel. Expands the current authority of the Secretary to acquire and provide housing for homeless veterans in order to allow entities to provide transitional housing for veterans recovering from substance abuse or mental illness disabilities. Extends such program through 1993. Establishes in the Treasury the Transitional Housing Fund for the provision of housing and loans to assist veterans in recovering from alcohol or drug dependence or abuse disabilities. Outlines loan conditions and conditions for veterans residing in housing provided. Requires the Secretary to issue guidelines for the operation of such residences. Requires the director of either each medical center or each regional office of the VA to make an assessment of the needs of homeless veterans living within the area served, including needs for health care, education and training, employment, shelter, counseling, and outreach services. Requires the director of each medical center to develop a plan for each of FY 1991 through 1993 for the provision of outreach and other services to meet the needs identified. Requires actions taken under such plans to be coordinated with other programs of the VA and Federal, State, or local governments. Requires the director to disseminate information regarding services provided to homeless veterans by the medical center or other facilities of the VA. Directs the Secretary to conduct a pilot program to determine the effectiveness of providing, through community-based organizations, domiciliary care (including medical services) to homeless veterans. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with community-based organizations for the provision of such care. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1993. Authorizes the Secretary to reprogram certain previously-appropriated funds to such program if it is found to be effective. Authorizes the Secretary to accept donations of funds or services in order to expand the medical services provided to homeless veterans through the Department. Amends the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 to extend through FY 1993: (1) the authorization of appropriations for medical programs of the Department; (2) earmarked amounts for the conversion of unused space in urban VA facilities into domiciliary care beds for homeless veterans; and (3) earmarked amounts for the furnishing of care and services to homeless veterans who have chronic mental illness disabilities. Amends the Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988 to extend its program for mentally ill homeless veterans. Extends through FY 1991 a pilot program under the Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988 for the provision of mobile health-care clinics for the treatment of veterans residing at least 100 miles from a VA treatment facility. Requires the Secretary to establish the Advisory Committee on Prosthetics and Special-Disabilities Programs to advise the Secretary and the CMD on the coordination of VA and non-VA programs, and the adequacy of funding, for prosthetics and special disabilities programs administered by the Secretary. Requires a report. Includes within the definition of \"medical services\" for coverage under Federal veterans' benefits provisions services to achieve pregnancy in a veteran or a veteran's spouse when such services are necessary to overcome a service-connected disability impairing the veteran's procreative ability. Directs the CMD to appoint an advisory committee to advise the CMD on the exercise of authority to furnish such services. Authorizes use of the Special Therapeutic and Rehabilitation Activities Fund of the VA for the payment of travel and related expenses necessary for the training of employees in the administration of therapeutic and rehabilitative services. Directs the Secretary, during FY 1991-1995, to conduct a compensated work therapy and therapeutic residence pilot program (CWTTR). Directs the Secretary to establish nonprofit corporations for the making of contracts for conducting work therapy programs under the CWTTR program at no less than ten or more than 15 VA medical centers operating such programs. Requires the Secretary to be assured from a nonprofit corporation that it will operate a therapeutic residence for eligible veterans in conjunction with an existing compensated work therapy program at a medical center. Allows for the provision of in-kind services from the Secretary to the corporation, including technical and clinical advice, supervision of activities, and minor maintenance and repairs to a therapeutic residence. Authorizes the Secretary to lend amounts to a corporation in order to assist such corporations to lease or purchase property for use as therapeutic residential treatment centers. Provides loan limits and other administrative provisions concerning such loans. Directs the Secretary to transfer to the Veterans Health Services and Research Administration no less than ten residences acquired by the VA for use for such centers. Requires each such property to be leased to a nonprofit corporation for operation as a therapeutic residence under the pilot program. Outlines lease conditions and other administrative provisions concerning the establishment of nonprofit corporations for therapeutic residences. Requires each such corporation to submit to the Secretary annual reports providing a detailed statement of its operations, activities, and accomplishments during the preceding year. Requires the Secretary to report to the veterans' committees concerning each such corporation and its participation under the pilot program. Requires the Secretary, under the pilot program, to operate residences as therapeutic residences for the furnishing of transitional housing solely for veterans who are furnished compensated work therapy under applicable Federal law. Authorizes the Secretary to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire residential housing for the purpose of furnishing such transitional housing for veterans being furnished compensated work therapy. Outlines the following conditions for the operation of such transitional housing: (1) that only qualified veterans and a house manager live in such residence; (2) that each resident (other than the house manager) pay the VA rent for the period of residence in such housing; (3) that, in the establishment and operation of such housing, the Secretary must comply with all local zoning, building, and other similar requirements; and (4) that the residence meet the State and community fire and safety requirements applicable to property used for similar purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for free room and subsistence for a house manager. Requires the CMD to be responsible for the management, maintenance, and disposition of property acquired for such transitional housing. Authorizes the Secretary to dispose of such property when no longer used for such purpose. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Secretary to report to the veterans' committees on the experience under the pilot program. Allows the Secretary to authorize the establishment of one or more nonprofit corporations to provide a flexible funding mechanism for the conduct of VA compensated work therapy programs for veterans (including homeless veterans) in such community or communities as the Secretary may designate. Requires such corporations to be established solely for such programs. Requires funds received by such a corporation for the conduct of such programs to be transferred to the Special Therapeutic and Rehabilitation Activities Fund. Outlines administrative provisions concerning the establishment and operation of each such nonprofit corporation, including provisions concerning: (1) the board of directors and executive officers; (2) general powers; (3) applicable State law; and (4) accountability and oversight.
