    "text": "National Independent Colleges and Universities Discovery Act - Establishes the National Commission on Independent Higher Education as an independent agency in the executive branch. Sets forth provisions for Commission membership, report and recommendations, powers, and personnel matters. Requires the Commission to: (1) develop a factual base for understanding the status of independent colleges and universities (independents), their contributions to public priorities, and the effects of national higher education policies on the independent nonprofit sector; (2) review the issuance of Federal regulations regarding independents, and suggest means for their accountability for use of public resources without inappropriate intrusion into their autonomy; and (3) address the relation between Federal and State policies on independents, particularly with respect to student access and choice, finance, institutional subsidies, and institutional accountability. Terminates the Commission three years after the enactment of this Act."
