    "text": "Title I: Community Reinvestment Act Amendments - Regulatory Efficiency For Depository Institutions Act - Amends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to provide that a regulated financial institution that receives a written rating of \"satisfactory\" or better by a Federal depository institutions regulatory agency with respect to its record of meeting the community's low-and-moderate income credit needs shall not be subject to any further such evaluation during the two-year period beginning on the date of the evaluation's public disclosure. Exempts certain small-sized institutions from the requirements of such Act. Prohibits a Federal financial supervisory agency from requiring a regulated financial institution to prepare certain community credit needs data that duplicate information submitted under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975. Title II: Expedited Funds Availability and Electronic Transfers - Amends the Expedited Funds Availability Act with respect to: (1) availability schedules; (2) deposits into shared automated teller machines (ATMs); (3) new accounts; (4) next day availability schedule exceptions; and (5) Federal Reserve Board jurisdiction to impose risks of loss and liability. Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to impose consumer liability of $500 for unauthorized electronic fund transfers in cases where the cardholder has substantially contributed to its unauthorized use (including writing on, or keeping with the card or other means of access a personal identification or other security code). Title III: Amendments to the Truth in Lending Act - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to exempt from its disclosure requirements credit transactions involving consumers who earn more than $200,000 annually, or who have net assets in excess of $1,000,000 at the time of such transaction. Imposes liability upon a cardholder for the unauthorized use of a credit card if the liability exceeds $50, and the cardholder does not provide the card issuer timely notice of unauthorized transactions after receipt of his account statement. Authorizes the Board to modify or waive rights under such Act regardless of circumstances. Title IV: Amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act - Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to permit a consumer reporting agency to furnish a consumer report to a person it has reason to believe intends to use the information for solicitation or marketing of financial services, if such report contains no specific information on the credit experience of any consumer. Title V: Homeownership Amendments - Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 to provide that federally-related real estate transactions having a value of not more than $100,000 shall not require the services of either a State-certified or licensed appraiser. Amends the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 to increase to three business days the time by which lenders of federally-related home mortgage loans must furnish borrowers with a federally-produced real estate settlement procedures information booklet. (Currently such booklet must be furnished at the time the mortgage application is received.) States that no booklet need be provided if the loan is denied. Amends the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 to exempt from its provisions certain small-sized depository institutions. Amends the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 to limit an \"adjustable rate mortgage loan\" solely to consumer loans. Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 to repeal the requirement that a creditor notify a delinquent homeowner of the availability of homeownership debt counseling offered by the creditor and federally-approved nonprofit organizations. Prohibits a Federal financial institutions regulatory agency from requiring an institution under its jurisdiction to collect or analyze data in connection with Fair Housing Act requirements (other than a data form required under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975)."
