    "text": "Alaska Native Culture Protection Act - Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act to allow importing of any marine mammal or marine mammal product: (1) by an Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo, if the mammal or mammal product is received as a gift (prohibits resale); or (2) if the item was previously exported by the same individual and declared at the time of export. Allows issuance of permits for temporary importation, if prohibitions of the Act are not violated, for an organized cultural exchange or as a personal item or equipment. Requires, when the point of entry is in the State of Alaska, delegation to the Director of the Alaska Regional Office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service of the authority to issue permits under the Act."
