Terminates the current presumptive period (the maximum period allowed before manifestation of the illness or disease occurs in order to be presumed to be service-connected and, therefore, covered as a veterans' benefit) of 40 years after participation in the radiation-related activity (30 years in the case of leukemia). Amends the Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act to direct the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards (Committee) to: (1) review all available studies and information relating to the exposure of veterans to ionizing radiation during service occurring before January 1, 1970; (2) identify any activity during which significant numbers of veterans received exposure; and (3) based on such review, submit to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs a report containing Committee recommendations on the feasibility and appropriateness of any additional investigation with respect to exposure of veterans to ionizing radiation during such period. Directs the Secretary to assist the Committee's work by supplying all relevant information with respect to such service. Directs the Secretary, after receipt of the Committee report, to: (1) identify any activities that the Secretary intends to investigate more fully; (2) prepare a plan to carry out such investigation; and (3) provide to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees (veterans' committees) the Committee's originial report, the list of activities scheduled for further investigation, and the Secretary's plan of action. Directs the Secretary to require the Committee to review pertinent scientific data relating to bronchio-alveolar carcinoma to determine whether such disease should be considered radiogenic. Requires: (1) the Committee to report its findings to the Secretary; and (2) the Secretary, based on such findings, to submit to the veterans' committees a decision on whether to presume such disease to be service-connected if suffered by a radiation-exposed veteran."
