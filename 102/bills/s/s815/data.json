    "text": "Community and Migrant Health Centers Self-Insurance Act of 1991 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish in the Public Health Service the Office of Medical Insurance (Office) to administer the Self-Insurance Fund established by this Act. Establishes in the Treasury a trust fund known as the Office of Medical Insurance Self-Insurance Fund (Fund). Provides for transfer to the Self-Insurance Fund of specified amounts appropriated under provisions relating to migrant and community health centers and grants for health services for the homeless. Provides for operation of the Fund. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Office, to obligate sums in the Fund to provide coverage for successful: (1) medical malpractice claims against recipients of funds under such provisions or their health care providers; and (2) claims against Directors or officers of such recipients arising out of acts, errors, or omissions under procedures as provided in this Act. Directs the Secretary to set aside specified amounts from the Fund as a contingency fund to be used only if the Secretary determines that a claim on the fund is catastrophic. Sets forth requirements for coverage by the Fund of a migrant or community health center or a homeless health services program, including requiring centers and programs to make contributions to the Fund in amounts set by the Office. Allows a center or program to retain and use amounts saved as a result of participating in the Fund. Makes it unlawful for any hospital to deny admitting privileges to any health care personnel employed by a center or program, subject to certain requirements. Requires the Office to contract for three actuarial analyses of the Fund, one each by the Health Care Financing Administration, the Congressional Budget Office, and an independent evaluator selected by the Office by competitive bid. Requires the Office to develop a data collection method to insure that accurate and reliable data is collected and made available concerning the Fund."
