Requires the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and submit a general management plan for the historic site to specified congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Dry Tortugas National Park - Establishes the Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida. Abolishes the Fort Jefferson National Monument. Specifies that the park shall be administered by the Secretary of the Interior as a unit of the National Park Service and managed for specified purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) acquire lands and interests in land within the park by donation or exchange; (2) exchange those Federal lands which were deleted from the park by specified boundary modifications and which are directly adjacent to lands owned by the State of Florida outside the park, for lands owned by Florida within the park boundary; and (3) lease or acquire, by purchase, donation, or exchange, and to operate incidental administrative and support facilities in Key West, Florida. Provides for the transfer to the Secretary of jurisdiction over lands within the park boundaries determined by the U.S. Coast Guard to be excess to its needs, subject to specified requirements. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: National Park System Advisory Committees - Waives provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act that require a Federal advisory commission or committee in connection with a national park system unit to file a charter upon the renewal of the commission or committee and upon the expiration of each successive two-year period. Permits any member of such commission or committee to serve after the expiration of his or her term until a successor is appointed. Changes the deadline by which the Mississippi River Coordinating Commission must submit a comprehensive plan for the land and water use of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area to within three years after appointment of the full membership of the Commission. Postpones the termination of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area Advisory Committee for ten years (currently, scheduled to terminate after October 27, 1992). Title IV: New River Wild and Scenic Study - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to include the segment of the New River defined by public lands beginning at the U.S. Route 460 bridge over the New River in Virginia to the maximum summer pool elevation of Bluestone Lake in West Virginia, as a study river for possible inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic River System. Specifies that nothing in this Act shall affect the management of the Bluestone project or of related Federal project activities. Requires such study's completion within one year of enactment of this title. Title V: Boston Harbor Islands Study - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to study and report to the Congress on the opportunities for the National Park Service to contribute to efforts to promote the conservation of the Boston Harbor Islands, Massachusetts, and their use and enjoyment by the public."
