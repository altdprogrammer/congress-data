Repeals the numerical limitation on \"P\" nonimmigrants. Requires the Comptroller General to report to specified congressional committees with regard to the use of \"O\" and \"P\" visas, their impact on U.S. labor, and restrictions upon U.S. citizens seeking such employment abroad. Revises \"P-1\" visa standards. Defines \"extraordinary ability\" as \"distinction\" for \"O\" visa purposes. Repeals the three-month out of country requirement for \"P-2\" and \"P-3\" visas. Makes employers liable for the return transportation costs of dismissed \"O\" and \"P\" aliens. Treats fashion modeling as a specialty occupation for nonimmigrant admissions purposes."
