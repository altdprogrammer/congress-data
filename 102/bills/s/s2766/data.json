    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1992-07-31", 
    "text": "Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1992 - Provides that not later than 30 days after a lobbyist first makes a lobbying contact, or agrees to make lobbying contacts, with a covered legislative or executive branch official, such lobbyist, or as provided below, the organization employing such lobbyist, shall register with the Office of Lobbying Registration and Public Disclosure (OLRAPD). Provides that any person whose total receipts or costs in connection with lobbying activities on behalf of a particular client do not exceed, or are not expected to exceed, $1,000 in a semiannual period is not required to register for such client. Defines \"lobbyist\" as any individual who is employed or retained by another for financial or other compensation to perform services that include lobbying contacts, other than an individual whose lobbying activities are only incidental to, and not a significant part of, the services for which such individual is paid. Specifies that such registration shall contain: (1) the name, address, business telephone number, and principal place of business of the registrant, and a general description of its business or activities; (2) the name, address, and principal place of business of the registrant's client, and a general description of its business or activities if different than those of the registrant; (3) the name of any organization, other than the client, that contributes more than $5,000 toward lobbying activities in a semiannual period, significantly participates in the supervision or control of lobbying activities, and has a direct financial interest in the outcome of lobbying activities; (4) the name, principal place of business, and approximate percentage of equitable ownership in the client of certain foreign entities; (5) a statement of general issue areas in which the registrant expects to engage in lobbying activities on behalf of the client and, to the extent practicable, a list of specific issues that have already been, or are likely to be addressed; and (6) the name of each employee of the registrant whom the registrant expects to act as a lobbyist on behalf of the client and, if any such employee has served as a covered legislative or executive branch official in the two years before the date of the registration, the position in which such employee served. Provides that in the case of a registrant representing more than one client, a separate registration shall be filed for each client represented. Requires any organization that has one or more employees who are lobbyists to file a single registration for each client on behalf of its employees who engage in lobbying activities on behalf of such client. Requires each registrant to file with OLRAPD a report on its lobbying activities during a semiannual period. Specifies the contents of such reports. Establishes within the Department of Justice an OLRAPD and sets forth OLRAPD administrative duties, which include: (1) prescribing such rules, forms, penalty schedules, and procedural regulations as are necessary for implementation of this Act; (2) making copies of each registration and report filed under this Act available to the public; and (3) transmitting to the President and the Congress an annual report describing OLRAPD activities and the implementation of this Act. Establishes procedures for: (1) informal resolution of alleged noncompliance with the requirements of this Act; (2) determinations of noncompliance in cases where information provided to OLRAPD through the procedures established above indicates that a noncompliance may exist; and (3) addressing registrations and filings that are more than 30 days late and failures to provide such information. Provides for judicial review of written decisions issued by OLRAPD under the last two procedures enumerated above. Repeals the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act. Amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 to: (1) revise the definition of \"foreign principal;\" (2) eliminate references to political propaganda and, in certain cases, replace such references with references to informational materials; and (3) modify the exemption for lawyers with respect to registration filing to make such exemption applicable to communications with agency officials only in the course of agency or other specified proceedings required by statute or regulation to be conducted on the record. Revises the limitation on use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracting and financial transactions to: (1) eliminate certain disclosure provisions; (2) require declarations by applicants for Federal contracts, grants, loans, or cooperative agreements to name any registrant under this Act who has made lobbying contracts on behalf of such applicant with respect to that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement; and (3) require similar declarations with respect to Federal loan guarantees. Repeals provisions under the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act relating to housing lobbyist activities. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
