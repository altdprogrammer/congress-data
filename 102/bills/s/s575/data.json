Requires local educational agencies located in areas designated as priority radon areas to conduct radon tests in school buildings owned or operated by such agencies. Directs the Administrator to designate such areas by September 30, 1991. Makes test results available for public review. Requires testing to be supervised by a person who has received instruction pursuant to an EPA or State-approved program and requires the use of devices and methods approved by the radon proficiency program. Extends the authorization of appropriations for grant assistance to States for radon programs through FY 1992. Earmarks funds for radon remediation measures for local educational agencies and for grants to such agencies to reduce radon levels. Authorizes appropriations."
