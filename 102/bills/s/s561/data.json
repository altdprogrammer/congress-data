Amends the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act to require the Secretary to conduct an outreach program informing minors of the health hazards of smoking. Authorizes appropriations enabling the Secretary of Education to make incentive grants to States which enact legislation: (1) prohibiting minors from smoking in school buildings and on school grounds and buses; and (2) requiring schools to establish adult smoking areas that are separate from students and to protect students from exposure to smoke. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the tax on cigarettes for FY 1992 through 1996. Requires deposit of the increase in cigarette tax revenues into the Adolescent Tobacco Prevention Trust Fund from which incentive grant funds shall be obtained. Establishes such Fund."
