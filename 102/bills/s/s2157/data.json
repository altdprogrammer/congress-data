    "text": "Developing Countries Demilitarization Act of 1992 - Makes a developing country eligible for foreign assistance, including security assistance, if its total annual military expenditures do not exceed 3.6 percent of its gross national product. Includes a country's request for security assistance in the calculation of military expenditures. Directs the President to: (1) inform all U.S. representatives to multilateral lending and development assistance agencies about this Act's policy; (2) assure that no U.S. funds are provided through such agencies to any developing country that expends more than such percentage on military expenditures; and (3) consult with U.S. allies about such policy and urge them to adopt similar policies. Waives the application of this Act if the President certifies to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee that this Act would cause grave harm to a democratic country facing armed aggression from: (1) a hostile neighboring state whose government is not democratically elected or is guilty of human rights violations; and (2) a local insurgency that presents an immediate danger to survivability of the government and is guilty of human rights violations."
