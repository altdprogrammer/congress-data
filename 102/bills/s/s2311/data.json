    "text": "Save American Jobs Act - Defines \"employer,\" \"plant closing,\" \"mass layoff,\" and \"work transfer\" for purposes of this Act. Applies the provisions of this Act to an employer who orders a plant closing or mass layoff at a work site and within one year before or after such event transfers work to a foreign country which has an average wage less than 50 percent of the average U.S. wage. Requires a covered employer to provide affected workers and the Secretary of Labor with a 120-day relocation notice. Subjects an employer to a civil penalty for failure to provide such notice. Directs the Secretary to compile a list of relocating employers and maintain an employer on it for five years. Requires a covered employer to provide dislocated workers with specified coverage of severance pay, health care benefits, and retraining reimbursement. Gives Federal contract priority to employers not on the relocation list. Prohibits the giving of Federal grants or loan guarantees to listed employers, except in certain circumstances. Authorizes the Secretary or any individual to bring an enforcement action under this Act, which may include relief for wages and interest, damages and fees, and injunctive relief."
