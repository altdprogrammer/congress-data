    "text": "Permits subsistence fishing and gathering in Glacier Bay National Park by local residents in accordance with provisions of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Prohibits construction of permanent structures associated with such activities such as set net sites, fish camps, cabins, or other related facilities. Authorizes commercial fishing within the nonwilderness marine waters of the Park utilizing the following methods and means in use in the Park between 1980 and 1991: (1) seining for salmon, but only in Excursion Inlet; (2) trolling; (3) longlining; and (4) the use of pots and ring nets. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to develop a plan for a comprehensive multiagency research and monitoring program to: (1) evaluate the health of fishery resources in the nonwilderness marine waters of the Park; (2) determine whether and to what extent commercial fishing in such waters may have a detrimental impact on Park resources; and (3) determine appropriate levels and methods of commercial fishing to be allowed within such waters. Requires the Secretary to: (1) notify specified congressional committees upon completion of such plan; (2) complete the program within seven years after such notification and transmit the results of the program to such committees; and (3) promulgate regulations, based on the results of the program, to protect the marine and terrestrial ecosystems preserved in the Park as well as their scientific values and resources and other Park resources from any significant adverse impact which may result from commercial fishing activities. Prohibits the annual average commercial fishing effort for each species within nonwilderness marine waters of Glacier Bay north of a line drawn from Point Carolus to Point Gustavus from exceeding the average annual effort which existed for that species during the period between 1980 through 1991. Requires commercial fishing seasons in the Park, including those within such waters, to be consistent with fishing seasons established for waters adjacent to the Park. Authorizes the Secretary to temporarily restrict where and when commercial fishing (including particular means and methods) may be allowed in order to protect fish stocks, wildlife populations, public safety, or to effectively conduct research studies. Authorizes appropriations."
