Sets forth findings, purposes, and definitions. Title II: Rangeland and Farmland Enhancement - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage Indian rangelands and farmlands, either directly or through cooperative agreements, self-determination contracts, and grants under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Enumerates management conservation, agricultural production, agribusiness, leasing, and other objectives. Requires a reservation-by-reservation resource management planning program. Requires the Secretary's recognition of tribal governments for purposes of their participation in such land management activities. Requires compliance with tribal laws pertaining to Indian agricultural lands. Directs the Secretary to assemble a task force to develop a comparative analysis of Federal investment and management efforts for Indian trust lands as compared to federally owned lands managed by other Federal agencies. Authorizes the Secretary to approve leasing of Indian rangelands or farmlands under specified conditions. Directs the Secretary, when authorized by an appropriate tribal resolution establishing a general policy for leasing Indian agricultural lands, to: (1) provide a preference to Indian operators, so long as the lessor receives fair market value; (2) waive or modify a required surety or performance bond; and (3) when the tribe defines highly fractionated undivided heirship lands, waive or modify general notice provisions and negotiate and lease or permit such lands to prevent waste, reduce idle land acreage, and ensure income. Sets forth rights of individual land owners. Title III: Education in Agriculture and Natural Resource Management - Requires the establishment, in the Bureau of Indian Affairs or elsewhere, of at least 20 natural resources intern positions for Indians and Alaska Native students. Requires establishment of a cooperative education program for employment of Indian and Alaska Native students in Federal professional natural resource-related positions. Provides financial assistance under the program. Authorizes a scholarship program and requires outreach programs, postgraduate recruitment programs, education and training programs, and internships to attract and train Indians and Alaska Natives in careers in Indian natural resources management. Authorizes cooperative agreements between the Department of the Interior and Indian tribes for: (1) manpower and job training related to Department programs and activities; (2) environmental education and natural resources planning materials development and publication; and (3) land and facility improvements and other activities related to land and natural resource management and development. Provides for obligated service and breach of contract repayments. Title IV: Authorization of Appropriations - Authorizes appropriations.
