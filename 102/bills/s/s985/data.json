Sets forth U.S. policy with respect to equitable distribution of relief and rehabilitation assistance and international relief efforts in the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, and Djibouti). Authorizes the President to: (1) provide international disaster assistance for civil strife and famine relief and rehabilitation in the Horn of Africa; and (2) transfer funds from unobligated security assistance (without regard to a specified 20 percent increase limitation) to carry out this chapter. Makes available a percentage of assistance for management support activities. Urges the President to provide supplemental emergency food assistance for civilian victims of civil strife in the Horn of Africa. Encourages the President to consult with other nations, armed and unarmed parties in the Horn of Africa, and the United Nations Secretary General to bring about negotiated settlements of the armed conflicts in the Horn of Africa. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should: (1) direct the U.S. representative to the United Nations to take specified steps with respect to peace and the establishment of an arms embargo in the region; (2) play an active role in other fora in pressing for settlements to conflicts; and (3) participate in regional and international peace consultations. Declares that development assistance in the Horn of Africa should be targeted to aid the poor. States that U.S. Government aid institutions should seek to: (1) build upon the capabilities and experiences of organizations active in local grassroots relief, rehabilitation, and development efforts; (2) consult with such organizations and incorporate their views into the policymaking process; and (3) support the expansion of their activities without compromising their private nature. Declares that development assistance should be: (1) targeted to the voluntary relocation and repatriation of displaced persons and refugees; and (2) carried out in coordination with strategies for debt relief of countries in the region and with efforts to establish an international fund for reconstruction of developing nations which settle civil wars. Requires development assistance and assistance from the Development Fund for Africa to be channeled through private and voluntary or specified international organizations unless the President makes the required certification under this chapter. Prohibits economic support assistance and foreign military financing and international military education and training assistance to Ethiopia, Somalia, or Sudan unless the President certifies that the government of the country has: (1) begun to implement peace or national reconciliation agreements; (2) demonstrated a commitment to human rights; (3) manifested a commitment to democracy and has held or established a timetable for free and fair elections; and (4) agreed to distribute development assistance without discrimination."
