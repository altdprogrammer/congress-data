    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-09-17", 
    "text": "Prerecorded Telephone Solicitation Consumer Rights Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to make it unlawful for any person to make any call using any automatic dialing recorded message program system or an artificial or prerecorded voice: (1) to any emergency telephone line or pager line or pager of any hospital, medical physician or services office, health care facility, or fire protection or law enforcement agency; (2) to any telephone number assigned to paging or cellular telephone service; or (3) to any restricted telephone number on the national database list. Directs the Federal Communications Commission to: (1) initiate a rulemaking proceeding to develop proposed regulations to implement methods and procedures for protecting the privacy rights of residential telephone subscribers to avoid receiving unsolicited prerecorded telephone solicitations to which they object; and (2) prescribe technical and procedural standards for systems that are used to transmit any artificial or prerecorded voice message via telephone. Makes it unlawful for any person to initiate any telephone call using any automatic telephone dialing system that does not comply with such standards, or to use any such system to transmit prerecorded telephone solicitations in a manner that does not comply with such standards. Lets stand any State law that imposes more restrictive intrastate requirements or regulations on, or which prohibits: (1) the use of automatic telephone dialing systems to transmit prerecorded telephone solicitations; and (2) the use of artificial voice or recorded messages. Preempts any provisions of State law concerning interstate communications that are inconsistent with the provisions of this Act."
