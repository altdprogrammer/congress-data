    "text": "Children's Security Trust Fund Act - Establishes the Children's Security Trust Fund (the Fund) in the Treasury, to be used to expand certain Federal programs that provide assistance to children. Provides that all funds transferred to the Fund shall be voluntary contributions by retirees from their Federal retirement benefits (from Social Security, civil service, military, or railroad retirement programs). Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to invest the portion of the Fund not required for current withdrawals, and to credit the Fund with interest and proceeds from such investments. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to obligate available amounts in the Fund, including any not obligated in previous fiscal years, for programs and services under: (1) the Head Start Act; (2) the supplemental food program under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966; or (3) the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant Act. Directs the Secretary of HHS to refer individuals receiving Federal retirement benefits (of the types described in provisions for voluntary contributions) who desire to volunteer to provide services under the children's programs that receive assistance under this Act to the appropriate State and local officials and community organizations responsible for such programs."
