    "text": "Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to make specified contract notice requirements currently applicable to property transferred by Federal agencies on which a hazardous substance was stored, released, or disposed applicable to leases of, or granting of easements with respect to, such property. Directs the heads of Federal agencies to identify, with respect to real property owned by the United States on which the Government plans to terminate operations or transfer or dispose of the property, property for which no remedial action is necessary to protect health and the environment. Requires the identification to be based on: (1) an investigation of the property to determine evidence of the likely presence of a release of hazardous substances; and (2) an environmental sampling, as appropriate. Sets forth specified sources of information to be reviewed as part of the identification. Makes identification results available to the public. Considers remedial action to have been taken on transferred Federal property on which a hazardous substance was stored, released, or disposed of if: (1) no action was required to protect health and the environment; or (2) the construction and installation on the property of a remedial action for treatment under an approved plan has been completed and the remedy is operating successfully. Requires deeds for the transfer of such property to include a covenant that grants the United States access to such property in any case in which remedial action is found to be necessary after the date of transfer. Authorizes the President to arrange for the removal of any hazardous substance on real property regardless of whether a danger to the public health or welfare or environment exists. Permits Federal agencies to subdivide property subject to this Act for purposes of disposal by sale, lease, grant of easement, or other transfer. Directs the Secretary of Defense to hold harmless, defend, and indemnify the following persons from and against all suits, claims, demands or actions, liabilities, judgments, and costs arising out of the release of hazardous substances or pollutants from Department of Defense activities at any military installation that is closed pursuant to a base closure law: (1) States, political subdivisions, or other persons that acquire ownership or control of any military installation facility (to the extent that they did not contribute to a release); and (2) any successor, assignee, transferee, lender, or lessee of such persons or entities."
