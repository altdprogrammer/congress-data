Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure that persons insured under either program are notified of such increase and given an opportunity to increase their coverage. Directs the Secretary to pay a death gratuity to each SGLI beneficiary of each deceased member of the armed forces who dies after August 1, 1990, and before the date of enactment of this Act. Makes the amount of such death gratuity equal to the SGLI coverage at the time of death. Requires the appropriate SGLI recipient to make application to the Secretary for the payment of such death gratuity within one year after the enactment of this Act. States that, for purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act), all direct and discretionary spending contained in this Act are emergency expenditures related to Operation Desert Shield."
