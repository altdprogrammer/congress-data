    "text": "Veterans' Compensation Rates and Pension Eligibility Reform Act of 1992 - Title I: Disability Compensation and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation Rate Increases - Increases the rates of: (1) veterans' disability compensation; (2) additional compensation for veterans' dependents; (3) the clothing allowance for certain disabled veterans; (4) dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses and children; and (5) supplemental dependency and indemnity compensation for disabled adult children. Requires such increases to be the same percentage as the increase in benefit amounts payable under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make consistent adjustments administratively to the rates of disability compensation payable to certain persons who are not in receipt of compensation for service-connected disability or death. Requires the Secretary to publish such increases in the Federal Register at the same time that OASDI benefit increases are required to be published. Title II: Wartime Service Requirement for Pension - Increases the minimum service period required for a war veteran to qualify for a pension due to permanent and total disability that is not service-connected to 180 days or more (currently 90) during a period of war or for an aggregate of 180 days or more (currently 90) in two or more separate periods of service during more than one period of war. Makes such amendment applicable only to veterans who first enter into active military service after the end of the Persian Gulf conflict."
