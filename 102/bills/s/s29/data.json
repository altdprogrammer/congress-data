    "text": "Medicaid Drug Treatment for Families Act of 1991 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to allow States to provide federally reimbursed Medicaid coverage of case-managed alcoholism and drug dependency residential treatment services for pregnant women whose family income is below 185 percent of the Federal poverty level and their children and spouses. Lists the required services included in such coverage as: (1) individual, group, and family counseling; (2) room and board in a standard environment with on-site supervision 24 hours a day; (3) therapeutic child care to be provided under part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of title IV of the Social Security Act; (4) assistance to parents in obtaining developmental assistance for their preschool children and public education for themselves and their school-age children; (5) easier access to other health and social services; (6) planning and assistance in reentering society; and (7) continuing specialized training of residential treatment facility staff members in the most recent and effective treatment techniques. Requires that such coverage continue for 12 months, except that the coverage of pregnant women must continue for one year following the end of pregnancy. Limits the size of a residential treatment facility to no more than 40 beds unless the State provides assurances that a larger facility can provide the mandatory services."
