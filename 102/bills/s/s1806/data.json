    "text": "Reclamation Land Resources Management Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal Water Project Recreation Act to: (1) provide that non-Federal public bodies shall bear at least one-half (currently, all) of the costs of operation, management, and replacement of a Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) project for recreation or fish and wildlife enhancement; (2) remove the requirement that a non-Federal public body must execute an agreement for administering a reclamation project within ten years after initial operation of the project; (3) allow such non-Federal bodies administering such projects to lease Bureau facilities and lands after agreeing to bear at least one-half (currently, all) of the costs of operation, maintenance, and replacement of such facilities; (4) authorize the expansion of any recreation facility constructed under such Act if the facility is currently inadequate to meet such recreational needs and the non-Federal public body executes an agreement to administer such facilities pursuant to a plan under which the non-Federal public body bears at least one-half of the costs of expansion, operation, maintenance, and replacement attributable to such expansion; and (5) remove a current $100,000 limitation on the amount that the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to expend at any one reservoir in order to increase the public recreational use of such reservoir. Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, to establish certain filing fees, user charges, and other charges and commissions for entry upon and various uses of reclamation lands and to promulgate necessary regulations in connection with such land use and the protection of the public and resource values during such use. Authorizes the Secretary to prepare and continually maintain an inventory of reclamation land resources and uses, to be made available to the public, and to ascertain the boundaries of reclamation lands. Authorizes the Secretary to develop, maintain, and revise resource management plans for reclamation lands. Provides that funds expended by the Secretary in carrying out the provisions of this Act shall be nonreimbursable under the Federal reclamation laws. Authorizes the Secretary, in carrying out this Act, to acquire and dispose of property and to accept gifts of real or personal property. Authorizes the Secretary, in accordance with authorized reclamation project purposes and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to such project, to manage the recreational, natural, cultural, historic, environmental, and fish and wildlife resources on reclamation lands. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into agreements for managing such lands; (2) approve the use of reclamation lands and resources by easements, licenses, and permits; and (3) seek adequate compensation for the use of resources associated with reclamation lands. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to: (1) change, modify, or expand authorized reclamation project purposes; (2) authorize any activity that results in reduction of water supplies for any entity under contract to receive water from a project; and (3) with a specified exception, result in any increase in the cost of operation, maintenance, and repair of any reclamation project to any contracting entity. Requires the Secretary, prior to any expenditure for the expansion of a recreational facility under this Act, to determine that such expansion will not result in a delay, postponement, or lack of funding for, the repair, replacement, or rehabilitation of the water storage or delivery features of any reclamation project."
