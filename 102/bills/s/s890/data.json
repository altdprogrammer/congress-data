    "text": "Amends the Star Schools Program Assistance Act (the Act, which provides for demonstration grants to eligible telecommunications partnerships for telecommunications facilities and equipment, instructional programming, and technical assistance, to improve instruction in mathematics, science, foreign languages, and other subjects such as vocational education) to broaden the program to include improvement of instruction in literacy skills and service to underserved populations including the disadvantaged, illiterate, limited English proficient, and disabled. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to award program grants for a two-year period, and allows such grants to be renewed for additional two-year periods in accordance with continuing eligibility provisions added by this Act. Extends through FY 1998 the authorization of appropriations for Star Schools Program Assistance. Eliminates certain limitations on the period and aggregate amount of program grants to any one eligible telecommunications partnership (while retaining a maximum limit on the amount of such a grant for any one fiscal year). Requires that, of the funds available to the Secretary in any fiscal year under this Act, at least: (1) 25 percent be used for the cost of instructional programming; and (2) 25 percent be used for telecommunications facilities and equipment. Makes 75 percent the maximum limit on the Federal share of program costs (rather than the exact amount of such share). Requires the Department of Education and any other Federal agency operating a Star Schools program to coordinate assisted activities under such programs. Adds to the list of eligible telecommunications partnerships under the Act private (as well as public) entities with experience and expertise in planning and operating a telecommunications network, including those involved in telecommunications through cable, telephone, or computer. Directs the Secretary to permit applicants for funds under the Act and applicants for funds under the Classrooms of the Future Act to submit a single application for such assistance. Revises application requirements to include provisions for: (1) training of instructors in using the facilities and equipment and in integrating programs into class curriculum; (2) assurances that instructional and training programming will be designed in consultation with professionals who are expert in the subject matter and grade level; (3) specific inclusion of students who are disadvantaged, limited English proficient, disabled, or illiterate among traditionally underserved students who will benefit; (4) use of existing telecommunications equipment, where available, in benefitting traditionally underserved students; (5) coordination of funds under the Act with those received under the Classrooms of the Future Act (if a single application is submitted for both); and (6) descriptions of activities and services. Includes as examples of activities or services to be assisted: (1) making programs accessible to individuals with disabilities through mechanisms such as closed captioning, as much as possible; (2) linking networks together around issues of national importance such as elections; (3) sharing curriculum materials between networks; (4) providing teacher and student support services; (5) incorporating community resources such as libraries and museums into instructional programs; and (6) providing teacher training to early childhood development and Head Start teachers and staff. Requires that a telecommunications company (such as a cable, telephone, computer, or public or private television network) will participate in the partnership and will donate in-kind equipment for telecommunications linkages (under grant application requirements). Provides that describing how traditionally underserved students will participate in the benefits of the assisted telecommunications facilities, equipment, technical assistance, and programming is required only of applicants who have not previously received funds under the Act. Sets forth provisions for continuing eligibility. Requires, for grant renewal, that an eligible telecommunications partnership demonstrate in their application that they will both continue to provide services in the subject areas and geographic areas previously assisted and use all such grant funds to provide expanded services by: (1) increasing the number of students, schools, or school districts served; (2) providing new courses of instruction; or (3) serving new populations of underserved individuals, including children or adults who are disadvantaged, limited English proficient, disabled, illiterate, lacking high school diplomas or equivalents, or incarcerated individuals, or older individuals. Requires renewed grant funds to supplement and not supplant services provided previously. Allows renewed grant funds to be used to provide programs for adults at times other than the school day, in order to maximize the use of telecommunications facilities and equipment. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to reduce the rights and protections provided to individuals with disabilities under the Americans With Disabilities Act or the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act."
