    "text": "Depository Institutions Disaster Relief Act of 1992 - Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 to cite conditions under which real property-related transactions located within a presidentially declared national disaster area may be exempted from the Act's appraisal requirements. Amends the Truth in Lending Act and the Expedited Funds Availability Act to authorize the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to make additional exceptions to the requirements of such Acts with respect to institutions located within national disaster areas if it determines that the exception can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects. Prescribes conditions under which the leverage limit formula prescribed under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and specified publication requirements pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, may be modified for insured depository institutions located in such disaster areas. Amends the Revised Statutes and the Federal Reserve Act to authorize national banking associations and State member banks, respectively, to make investments primarily designed to promote the welfare of low- and moderate-income communities or families. Prescribes permissible liability parameters. Expresses the sense of the Congress that specified Federal regulatory agencies should encourage depository institutions located in certain major national disaster areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities."
