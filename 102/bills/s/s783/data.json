    "text": "Financial Institutions Prosecution Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to prohibit, except with the prior written consent of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a person who has been convicted of any criminal offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust, or has agreed to enter into a pretrial diversion or similar program in connection with the prosecution of such offense from becoming or continuing to be employed in any capacity by an insured depository institution. Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to prohibit, except with the prior written consent of the National Credit Union Administration Board, a person who has agreed to enter into a pretrial diversion or similar program in connection with the prosecution of a criminal offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust from: (1) becoming, or continuing as, an institution-affiliated party or employee in any capacity with any insured credit union; or (2) owning or controlling any such credit union. Prohibits the Board from consenting for a ten-year period to any exception to such prohibition for such person for certain offenses. Sets forth a specified exception. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties. Amends the Crime Control Act of 1990 to add as one of the responsibilities of the Special Counsel for the Financial Institutions Fraud Unit of the Department of Justice that it provide technical assistance and other appropriate resources to State prosecutors, State officials authorized to prosecute, or other law enforcement officials engaged in fraud cases involving the collapse of a private deposit insurance corporation. Revises the membership of the senior interagency group (established to identify the most significant financial institution fraud cases) to include senior officials from the Internal Revenue Service. Requires the Attorney General to submit to the Congress a report containing the findings, together with recommendations, of the financial institutions fraud task forces with respect to the collapse of private deposit insurance corporations."
