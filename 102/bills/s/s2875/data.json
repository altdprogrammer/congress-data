(Public organizations are thus not limited in the number of sites they may operate.) Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to modify the guidelines for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to follow in allocating returned funds to the States. (Allows the Secretary to estimate anticipated returns of unused State administrative expense funds and allocate an equivalent amount to homeless programs in advance of need.) Title II: WIC Infant Formula Procurement - WIC Infant Formula Procurement Act of 1992 - Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to set forth guidelines under which the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) shall offer to solicit bids on behalf of State agencies regarding cost-containment contracts to be entered into by infant formula manufacturers and those State agencies. Directs the Secretary to make the offer to agencies once every 12 months. Prescribes guidelines for the solicitation and selection process. Prescribes guidelines to reduce the costs of any supplemental foods. Establishes a civil penalty for companies that engage in price-fixing or related anticompetitive practices. Authorizes the Secretary to disqualify such companies from participating in the WIC Program for two years. Requires each State agency to advise the Secretary which procedures it will use to reduce the purchase of low-iron infant formula for infants for whom such formula has not been prescribed by an appropriate health professional. Directs the Secretary to allocate amounts to each State agency for nutrition services and administration on the basis of a prescribed formula which may provide funds to help defray reasonable anticipated expenses associated with innovations in cost-containment or associated with procedures that tend to enhance competition. Sets a deadline by which the Secretary must report to certain congressional committees on: (1) State agencies that request the Secretary to conduct bid solicitations for infant formula under the Act; and (2) cost reductions achieved by the solicitations. Sets a termination date for the authorities provided by this Act."
