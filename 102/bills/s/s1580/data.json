    "text": "Provides that if a Federal agency releases an employee from a position in the competitive service through a reduction in force (RIF) and, within two years, seeks to fill that position or a position in the same competitive area, it: (1) must offer such employee reemployment in such position before offering it to anyone else; (2) may not replace such employee with a contract or temporary employee; and (3) must offer positions to released employees on a seniority basis before offering the positions to anyone else. Requires an agency that seeks to establish a position in the excepted service within two years after a RIF to provide a written notification and justification to the Office of Personnel Management and the Congress which includes a list of all employees released under the RIF. Outlines similar protections to be afforded to released Senior Executive Service personnel."
