    "text": "Older Americans Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1991 - Title I: Objectives and Definitions - Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 (OAA) to establish as an OAA objective the provision of support to family members and other persons providing voluntary care to older individuals needing long-term care services. Adds the definitions of various terms to OAA, including such terms as \"elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation\", \"conflict of interest\", and \"case management services\", that are to be used later in this Act. Makes the OAA poverty line reflective of the Office of Management and Budget's official poverty line. Title II: Administration - Adds the following as new functions of the Associate Commissioner on American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian Aging: (1) promoting coordination between programs established under OAA titles III (Grants for State and Community Programs on Aging) and IV (Training, Research, and Discretionary Projects and Programs); (2) acting as an advocate for older Native Americans with the Indian Health Service; and (3) collecting and disseminating information regarding elder abuse, in-home care, health programs, and other problems unique to Native Americans. Establishes the Office of Long-Term Care Ombudsman Programs in the Administration on Aging (AOA) to be headed by an Associate Commissioner for Ombudsman Services who shall serve as an advocate on behalf of long-term care facility residents, within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and with other Federal departments and agencies. Requires the AOA Commissioner to: (1) establish a National Ombudsman Resource Center to provide technical assistance and training to State long-term care ombudsman programs, to analyze laws, regulations, policies, and actions affecting such residents, and to provide assistance regarding recruitment and retention of volunteer ombudsmen; (2) establish a National Aging Data Center to compile, analyze, publish, and disseminate various statistical data on aging, older individuals, and the services provided to them as well as to provide technical assistance, training, and other means of assistance to State agencies, area agencies on aging, and service providers regarding State and local data collection and analysis; (3) establish and operate a National Center on Elder Abuse and in the process compile, publish, and disseminate a summary of research and training materials on elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation; develop and maintain an information clearinghouse on programs which show promise of preventing, identifying, and treating elder abuse, neglect and exploitation; provide technical assistance to State agencies and other public and nonprofit agencies involved in prevention of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation; and conduct research and demonstration projects regarding the causes, prevention, identification, and treatment of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation; (4) develop and maintain, along with State and area agencies on aging, a national aging network that ensures a responsive community-based services system for older individuals; (5) establish information and assistance services as priority services; (6) develop guidelines for area agencies in choosing and evaluating legal assistance providers; (7) develop a model job description for legal assistance developers; (8) study ways in which Federal funds might be more effectively targeted to low-income, minority, and rural older individuals to better meet the needs of States with a disproportionate number of older individuals with the greatest social and economic need; (9) study ways in which Federal funds might be more effectively targeted to better meet the needs of States with a disproportionate number of older individuals; and (10) report the findings of such studies to the House Committee on Education and Labor and the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Outlines funding requirements for the National Ombudsman Resource Center and the National Center on Elder Abuse. Requires the AOA Commissioner to advise, consult, and cooperate with the Department of Labor (DOL) in carrying out the Community Service Employment Program for Older Americans and with ACTION in carrying out OAA. Requires DOL to consult and cooperate with the AOA Commissioner in carrying out the Job Training Partnership Act.
