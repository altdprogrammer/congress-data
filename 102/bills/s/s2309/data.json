    "text": "Efficient Spectrum Management Act of 1992 - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to initiate a rulemaking process to: (1) designate co-primary uses of the radio frequency spectrum where technically and economically feasible; (2) permit the transfer of assigned licenses among authorized co-primary uses; (3) reclassify older technologies as secondary uses when appropriate to make use of newer technologies for such frequencies; (4) create spectrum utilization standards to encourage the migration from older to newer technologies; (5) strengthen a pioneer's preference to reward innovative technology development in the licensing process; (6) designate a maximum amount of spectrum permissible for the initial license to any one legal entity within a given frequency band; and (7) adopt any other provisions or modifications that will streamline the allocation and assignment of the spectrum for new technologies and services. Directs the FCC to report to the Congress on whether additional legislative authority is needed to implement such procedures or other similar procedures for the enhancement of the spectrum allocation and licensing process."
