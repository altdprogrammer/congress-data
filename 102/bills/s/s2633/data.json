    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-04-29", 
    "text": "Job Training 2000 Act - Establishes, as part of the Federal system of funding for vocational training programs: (1) a network of local skill centers to provide a common point of entry; (2) a certification system; and (3) a voucher system. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Education for allocations to States and private industry councils to assist in carrying out title III of this Act, relating to certification of vocational training programs. Title I: General Provisions - Part A: Federal Responsibilities - Establishes the Federal Vocational Training Council (Federal Council), composed of the Secretaries of Labor, Education, Health and Human Services, Agriculture, and Veterans Affairs (or their designees) and such other agency heads as the President may designate. Includes among Federal Council functions: (1) advice and guidance on implementation of this Act to affected Federal, State, and local agencies and organizations; (2) ensuring application of consistent policies, practices, and procedures in Federal vocational training programs (including, through waiver authority, requiring common terms and performance standards, collection of common data, coordination and consolidation of timing and sequence, of State and local plans and reports); (3) serving as an information clearinghouse among Federal, State, and local officials; (4) evaluation of the this Act's effect on individuals, institutions, agencies, and labor markets; and (5) oversight of implementation and administration of this Act. Grants each member of the Federal Council limited waiver authority over regulations or provisions of law in their jurisdiction that would prevent application of consistent practices and procedures to the specified items. Terminates such authority three years after the effective date of this Act. Requires certain reports to the President by the Federal Council. Establishes a National Private Sector Advisory Board on Vocational Training (Advisory Board), composed of 15 members appointed by the President. Allows the President to consider including: (1) representatives of the private sector, who shall be private sector owners or executives with substantial management or policy responsibility, to constitute a majority of the membership; (2) representatives of educational agencies, welfare and social service agencies, labor organizations, or community-based organizations; and (3) participants in vocational training programs and other individuals who have special knowledge and qualifications with respect to vocational training. Directs the Advisory Board to advise the Federal Council on carrying out its responsibilities, increasing private sector involvement in vocational training programs, and ways of ensuring that the Federal vocational training system meets labor market needs. Part B: State Human Resource Investment Council - Requires establishment of a single State human resource investment council (State Council) by each State that receives assistance under an applicable program (i.e., one under the Adult Education Act, Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act, Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Wagner-Peyser Act, the JOBS program under AFDC provisions of the Social Security Act, specified employment and training provisions under the Food Stamp Act of 1977, specified student aid provisions for Pell Grants, Supplemental Grants, Stafford Guaranteed Loans, Work-Study Programs, and Perkins Direct Loans under the Higher Education Act of 1965, Veterans Vocational Training programs, and other programs designated by the Federal Council). Requires the State Council to advise the Governor on: (1) coordination methods, after reviewing provision of services and use of funds under applicable programs; and (2) developing, implementing, and coordinating State and local standards and measures relating to applicable programs. Requires each State Council to consist of members appointed by the Governor who are representatives of: (1) business and industry (including agriculture, where appropriate), who shall constitute a majority of the membership; (2) organized labor and community-based organizations; (3) the chief administrative office from each State agency primarily responsible for administering an applicable program; (4) the State legislature and appropriate State agencies and organizations; (5) local governments; (6) local educational agencies and postsecondary institutions; (7) local welfare and public housing agencies; and (8) individuals with special knowledge and qualifications with respect to education and career development needs of members of special populations, women, and minorities, including one individual representative of special education. Requires each State to certify to the Federal Council the establishment and membership of the State Council at least 90 days before the beginning of each period of two program years for which a Job Training 2000 plan is submitted. Part C: Additional State Responsibilities - Requires each Governor to biennially issue a statement of goals and objectives for the Job Training 2000 system established in the State pursuant to this Act, in order to assist the private industry councils in preparing the Job Training 2000 Plan. Requires dissemination of such statement to private industry councils and other interested agencies, organizations, and individuals. Requires each Governor to report annually to the Federal Council on activities undertaken in the State pursuant to this Act, including specified information and additional imports as requested. Includes among each Governor's oversight responsibilities with respect to private industry councils: (1) monitoring compliance; (2) providing technical assistance; and (3) applying sanctions, including revocation of plan approval or imposition of a reorganization plan (which may be appealed to the Secretary of Labor). Part D: Local Plan and Report - Requires each private industry council (PIC) to submit to the Governor a Job Training 2000 plan for two-year periods. Requires PICs to prepare such plans in a specified manner, and in consultation with representatives of: (1) Federal vocational training programs and local public and private providers of service to such programs, including programs authorized under specified Federal laws and provisions; and (2) local business, labor, educational, and community-based organizations and other interested individuals and organizations. Sets forth required contents of such plans, including provisions relating to the certification system and the voucher system under this Act. Sets forth provisions for review and approval of such plans by the Governor (with State Council advice), with opportunities for PIC plan modifications and appeals to the Secretary of Labor, and final review by such Secretary. Requires annual PIC reports to the Governor and State Council. Title II: Skill Centers - Requires each PIC, in accordance with specified consultation procedures, to designate a network of skill centers in each service delivery area (SDA) to: (1) improve individuals' access to vocational training by designating common entry points to programs; (2) better inform individuals to employment opportunities, local labor market conditions, and local vocational training programs' performance; (3) facilitate matching local employers with potential employees who meet hiring qualifications and workforce skill needs; and (4) encourage greater coordination and minimize duplication of services between federally funded vocational training programs. Allows any entity or consortium located in the SDA to apply to be designated as a skill center (including Employment Service offices, community colleges, community-based organizations, administrative entities under JTPA, and other interested organizations and entities). Sets forth skill center functions, including providing specified services in the following categories: (1) core services which each center is required to make available; (2) enhanced services which each center may make available; and (3) specialized employer services which each center may provide to employers on a fee-for-service basis (income from which must be used to expand or enhance the services such center provides). Requires that programs authorized under specified Federal provisions (under certain of the Federal laws listed as applicable programs under title I part B) participate in the operation of the skill centers. Allows other programs providing basic skills, literacy, or vocational training to participate in such center operation as a party to an agreement if the PIC and other participating programs approve. Sets forth requirements for skill center: (1) designation procedures (including publication of notice, consultation, selection criteria, and charter issuance); (2) participating programs agreements with PIC (including exceptions where a participating program may be allowed to provide specified core services in addition to center provision of such services); (3) performance standards (prescribed by the Secretary of Labor in consultation with the Federal Council, with adjustments and additions by each Governor, and with sanctions for noncompliance); and (4) incentive grants, to be awarded to skill centers by Governors from funds available under specified provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act (Employment Service) and the JTPA. Title III: Certification System for Federal Vocational Training - Directs the Secretary of Education to allocate funds (appropriated pursuant to the authorization under this Act) to the States and PICs to assist in carrying out a certification system to: (1) ensure that only high quality vocational training programs are eligible to receive Federal funds; (2) establish performance standards to increase effectiveness of vocational training programs; and (3) promote the availability of information on the local level regarding performance of vocational training programs. Provides that such allocations shall be based on factors deemed appropriate by such Secretary, in consultation with the Federal Council. Requires a vocational training program provided by an institution or other service provider (except an on-the-job training program) to be certified in order to be eligible to receive Federal funds under specified covered programs (including those under certain of Federal laws and provisions listed as applicable programs under title I part B and mandatory participating programs under title II). Directs the Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Federal Council, to prescribe performance standards for vocational training programs provided by an institution or other service provider. Prohibits such standards from being revised more frequently than once every two years. Requires such standards to address: (1) the institution's financial responsibility; (2) program costs; (3) student withdrawal rates; (4) student loan default rates at the institution; (5) graduate licensure rates; and (6) graduate employment placement, retention, and earnings. Authorizes additional standards based on other measures of program effectiveness in meeting special needs of disadvantaged students and in preparing students for employment, including meeting relevant industry skill standards. Allows PICs to modify levels of successful performance under each such standard, if local conditions so justify and if State and Federal approval is given. Sets forth certification procedures, including: (1) designation of a single State agency to certify programs, collect data, issue guidelines, and determine information to be included in applications; (2) role of the PIC (in the SDA in which the program is located) in certifying, upon notification of the application, whether the program meets performance standards (in which role a PIC may use staff of skill centers or other entities or may establish a consortium with other PICs in the State); (4) State agency approval of applications (with requirements for recertification under specified conditions, and authority to suspend program certification on an emergency basis); (5) appeal procedures at State and Federal levels; (6) conflict-of-interest prohibitions; and (7) PIC dissemination of information on program performance to the skill centers. Title IV: Vocational Training Voucher System - Establishes a vocational training voucher system. Requires that vocational training and related services provided to individuals from funds under the following covered programs shall only be provided through such voucher system: (1) title II (Training Services for the the Disadvantaged) and title III (Employment and Training Assistance for Dislocated Workers) of JTPA; (2) specified employment and training provisions under the Food Stamp Act of 1977; and (3) the new Postsecondary Vocational Training program which this Act adds as part D of title II of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. Defines related services as those provided by a single service provider as part of a package of services which includes vocational training. Allows the covered program to provide, in addition to vocational training and related services, other services (which must be identified in the agreement) through such voucher system. Allows other Federal programs, in addition to the listed covered programs, to participate in the voucher system if such participation is consistent with the laws governing such programs and the PIC approves. Makes the PIC responsible for overseeing the establishment and operation of the voucher system. Directs the PIC, after consultation with local providers of vocational training, to enter into an agreement with the skill centers and the local agencies responsible for administering the covered programs and the additional programs. Requires such written agreement to specify: (1) common procedures for voucher issuance; (2) financial and management information systems to be used to administer the voucher system; (3) payment schedules relating to vouchers, including those for courses not completed by participants; and (4) conditions to ensure compliance with covered program requirements. Requires such vouchers to contain specified information and conditions, including an expiration date and the limitation that the voucher is only redeemable for certified programs. Requires at least 20 percent of the total payment to be withheld from the service provider until the participant has: (1) successfully completed the training; and (2) been employed and retained employment for a period of at least 90 days. Directs the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Federal Council, to issue regulations implementing such withholding requirements. Limits the total dollar amount of outstanding vouchers issued in an SDA by a covered program to not more than the amount of funds available to such program in such SDA. Sets forth special rules for vouchers issued for on-the-job training, including: (1) specification of a particular occupational area; (2) redemption only by employers with available positions approved by the covered program in that occupational area; and (3) inapplicability of the withholding requirement. Allows a contract for direct services, in lieu of a voucher, to be used for provision of vocational training and related services under a covered program if the PIC approves the program's request based on a finding of: (1) an insufficient number of providers in an SDA for a voucher system; or (2) programs in the SDA are unable to provide effective services to special participant populations, such as individuals with severe disabilities and substance abusers. Authorizes the Governor to direct a PIC to rescind such a contract upon determining that there was an insufficient basis for such findings. Title V: Conforming Amendments to Other Acts - Amends the Adult Education Act, Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Act, Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Wagner-Peyser Act, Social Security Act, and Food Stamp Act of 1977 to add requirements relating to duties of State human resource councils (as required by this Act) with respect to applicable programs under such Acts. Amends JTPA to add various program requirements (conforming to this Act) for certification of vocational training programs, participation in operation of skill centers, and vouchered services under JTPA title II (disadvantaged adults and youth programs) and title III (dislocated worker program). Revises JTPA provisions for the Job Corps to include specified arrangements with the skill centers, transfer of specified resources to skill centers, and certification requirements for vocational training providers to be eligible for contracts with Job Corps Centers. Amends the Wagner-Peyser Act to include the skill centers under provisions for incentive grants. Requires the employment service to: (1) participate in operation of the skill centers; (2) ensure that core services and agreed-upon enhanced services are provided only through skill centers; and (3) transfer sufficient resources to the skill centers to provide such services to individuals who are authorized to receive services under the Wagner-Peyser Act and who are not participants in other participating programs under the agreement. Allows local employment service offices to apply to be designated as skill centers. Amends Federal law relating to Veterans Vocational Training programs to include references to skill centers. Requires participation in the operation of skill centers and transfer of sufficient resources to such centers to provide the core services and agreed-upon enhanced services to individuals participating under provisions for Veterans Vocational Training.

Reserves a specified portion of funds for such programs. Provides for State allotments and local allocations under such program in accordance with specified funding formulas under JTPA. Bases individual eligibility on: (1) either completion of high school or nonenrollment in high school while being beyond compulsory attendance age; and (2) being economically disadvantaged as defined under JTPA. Requires use of program funds to provide eligible individuals with postsecondary vocational training and related services through the voucher system established under this Act. Requires a vocational training program to be certified under this Act before it may provide postsecondary level training to students under the Tech-Prep Education program (part E of title III of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act). Amends the JOBS program under Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) provisions of the Social Security Act to require State agency participation in the operation of skill centers and transfers of sufficient resources to such centers to provide core services and agreed-upon enhanced services. Requires a vocational training program to be certified under this Act before it may receive funds under the JOBS program. Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to require a vocational training program to be certified under this Act before it may receive funds under certain employment and training project provisions of such Act. Requires vocational training under such Act to be provided only through the voucher system established under this Act. Allows other additional services to be provided through such system. Requires State agencies to enter into agreements relating to administration of the voucher system. Requires State agencies to participate in operation of skill centers and transfer sufficient resources to such centers to enable them to be the sole providers of core services and agreed-upon enhanced services to food stamp program participants determined to need vocational training. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require certification for certain institutions that offer vocational education, for purposes of eligibility for certain student aid programs (including specified grant, loan, and work-study programs). Requires such institutions to provide for skill center referrals, prior to enrollment, for students receiving such aid. Amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Refugee Assistance Act program under specified Federal law, and the Trade Adjustment Assistance program under the Trade Act of 1974 to require certification of vocational training programs under this Act as a condition of eligibility for funding under such Acts.
