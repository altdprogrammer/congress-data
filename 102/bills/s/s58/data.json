    "text": "National Biological Diversity Conservation and Environmental Research Act - States that the conservation of biological diversity is a national priority. Requires Federal actions to be consistent with such goal. Directs the Council on Environmental Quality to: (1) issue regulations to require agencies to assess the impacts of Federal actions on biological diversity in preparing environmental impact statements under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; and (2) identify those biotic communities, species, and populations that appear to be in decline, in imminent danger of loss of viability, or otherwise of special concern. Requires Federal agencies to review their programs for consistency with the conservation of biological diversity pursuant to this Act and to report the results of such reviews to the President, the Council, and the Congress. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in reviewing environmental impact statements, to take into account the impacts of proposed actions on biological diversity. Establishes an Interagency Working Committee on Biological Diversity to be responsible for developing a coordinated Federal strategy for conservation of biological diversity. Dissolves the Committee after the submission to the Congress of the strategy. Sets forth the required contents of such strategy and reporting requirements. Establishes a National Center for Biological Diversity and Conservation Research within the Smithsonian Institution to: (1) set research priorities; and (2) coordinate the understanding and promotion of knowledge of the biota and make such knowledge accessible to the public. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Council to retain the National Academy of Sciences to: (1) provide scientific and technical advice and counsel in the preparation of the Federal strategy; and (2) provide a general reference and scientific and technical advisory source for the nation in matters relating to the conservation of biological diversity. Authorizes the Administrator, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative, to award to a domestic firm a contract made under this Act that, under the use of competitive procedures, would be awarded to a foreign firm, if: (1) the final product of the domestic firm will be completely assembled in the United States; (2) at least 51 percent of the final product will be domestically produced when completely assembled; and (3) the difference between the bids submitted by the foreign and domestic firms is not more than six percent. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress on such contracts, contracts entered into with foreign entities, and contracts that meet such requirements but are in violation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or another international agreement. Directs specified Federal agencies to encourage conservation of biological diversity through: (1) supporting and coordinating global conservation of biological diversity programs; (2) supporting research for, and increasing training, education, and technical assistance related to, sustainable development and international conservation of biological diversity; and (3) cooperating with each other and international organizations to carry out such activities. Requires the Agency for International Development (AID) to hire U.S. environmental and natural resources staff with training in conservation of biological diversity and sustainable development. Reaffirms congressional support for provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 which address tropical deforestation and loss of biological diversity. Directs AID to give high priority to the implementation of such provisions."
