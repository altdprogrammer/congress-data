    "text": "Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (the Act) to authorize appropriations for FY 1992 and 1993 for railroad research and development and general safety operations. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to request and use non-Federal funds for expenses incurred in training safety employees of public and private industry, State and local authorities, or other rail safety inspectors. Declares that civil penalties with respect to the failure to comply with railroad safety rules, regulations, orders, and standards shall, to the same extent as they do to railroads, apply to: (1) any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or facilities; or (2) any contractor providing goods or services to a railroad. Amends Federal law to provide criminal penalties for the murder or attempted murder or manslaughter of any Federal Railroad Administration employee assigned to perform investigative, inspection, or law enforcement functions. Amends the Act to repeal the Hours of Service Act. Requires the Secretary to issue regulations embodying such Act's provisions regarding the number of continuous hours a railroad employee can safely work. Authorizes the Secretary to make linguistic changes to transform such provisions into regulatory form. Declares such regulations shall not be subject to judicial review. Repeals specified Federal safety laws to make changes similar to those made above. Prohibits railroad accident reports or reports of investigations of such accidents that are submitted to the Secretary from being admitted as evidence or used for any purpose in any suit or action for damages growing out of any matter contained in such reports."
