Requires such annuity to be paid in the same manner as if the individual had made a designation to provide an annuity as a veteran under the Survivor Benefit Plan. Requires an individual who is entitled to an annuity under Federal armed forces provisions and an annuity under Federal veterans' benefits provisions by reason of a subsequent marriage to choose one annuity to receive."
