    "text": "Combined Stormwater and Sewer Overflow Management Strategy Act of 1992 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, in cooperation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and in consultation with local organizations, to conduct a program to assess the technologies and methodologies available to: (1) address the adverse impacts on receiving waters of discharges from combined stormwater and sanitary systems (overflows); and (2) ensure compliance with water quality standards of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Directs the Secretary to study conditions and problems associated with overflows, and appropriate management and engineering strategies to remedy such problems, and to complete a comprehensive overflow management plan for specified areas in Massachusetts, Louisiana, Maine, New Jersey, and New York. Outlines information to be included in each such overflow management plan, including environmental and public health impacts, technologies and methodologies available to address such impacts, and an appropriate overflow management strategy for each area. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress within four years after enactment of this Act on assessments conducted, together with recommendations and observations. Authorizes the Secretary, as part of the overflow assessment conducted for each area, to enter into an agreement with the appropriate State or local government official to construct and monitor an overflow prevention project that uses the best available control technology. Requires such official to provide assurances that the overflow prevention project will be operated and maintained by such State or local government at a non-Federal share of 100 percent of the project's costs. Requires the Federal share of each project's construction costs to be 100 percent. Directs the Secretary to evaluate the capabilities and performance of each project under this Act for use in developing a Federal strategy for a combined stormwater and sanitary sewer system infrastructure. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary to develop a Federal strategy for the optimal expenditure of Federal funds for: (1) minimizing the adverse effects of overflows in the waters and aquatic ecosystems of the United States; and (2) assuring compliance with water quality standards of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Outlines information to be utilized in the development of such Federal strategy, including the evaluation of the capabilities and performances of each area project authorized under this Act. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress within five years after enactment of this Act on the strategy. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary, in order to ensure coordination of the Federal strategy with results of the area overflow programs authorized under this Act, to consult with the EPA Administrator, the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other appropriate Federal and non-Federal entities."
