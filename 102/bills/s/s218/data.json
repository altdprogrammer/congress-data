    "text": "Emerging Telecommunications Technologies Act of 1991 - Requires the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to conduct, at least biannually, and report to the Congress annually on joint spectrum planning with respect to: (1) future spectrum requirements for public and private uses and the allocation actions to accommodate those uses; and (2) actions to promote the efficient use of the spectrum without causing harmful interference. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to submit to the President and the Congress a report identifying band frequencies that: (1) are allocated on a primary basis for Government use and are eligible for licensing pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act); (2) are not required for the present or identifiable future needs of the Government; (3) can feasibly be made available for use under the Act (other than for Government stations); (4) will not result in costs to the Government or loss of services or benefits to the public that are excessive in relation to the benefits that may be obtained by non-Federal licensees; and (5) are most likely to have the greatest potential for productive uses and public benefits. Sets forth criteria for identifying, and recommending for reallocation, such bands of frequencies. Sets forth conditions for the mixed use of frequencies by both the Government and non-Federal stations. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress a report which makes a preliminary identification of reallocable frequencies. Directs the Secretary to convene an advisory committee to: (1) review the bands of frequencies identified in the preliminary report; (2) advise the Secretary with respect to the bands of frequencies which should be included in the final report and the effective dates which should be established with respect to such frequencies; (3) receive public comment on the reports; and (4) prepare and submit to the Secretary and specified congressional committees a report on recommendations for the reform of the process of allocating the electromagnetic spectrum between Federal and non-Federal use. Directs the President, after receiving the final report, to: (1) withdraw the assignment to a Government station of any frequency which such report recommends for reallocation; (2) limit the assignment to a Government station of any frequency which such report recommends be made available for mixed use; (3) withdraw or limit the assignment to a Government station of any frequency which the report recommends be reallocated or made available for mixed use on a delayed effective date; (4) assign or reassign other frequencies to Government stations as necessary to adjust to such withdrawal or limitation of assignments; and (5) transmit a notice and description of the actions taken to the FCC and each House of the Congress. Authorizes the President to substitute alternative frequencies in the interest of national defense, important governmental needs, or public health or safety, or where the reassignment will result in costs to the Government that are excessive in relation to the benefits that may be obtained from commercial or other non-Federal uses of the reassigned frequency. Directs the FCC to submit to the President and the Congress a plan for the distribution of the reallocated bands of frequencies under this Act. Authorizes the President to reclaim reallocated bands of frequencies for reassignment to Government stations. Sets forth procedures for reclaiming bands of frequencies. Authorizes appropriations to cover the costs of reclaiming bands of frequencies."
