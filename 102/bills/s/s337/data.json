(Currently, members of the Selected Reserve are eligible upon completion of their reserve requirement to limited monthly basic educational assistance of approximately one-half the amount provided for former active-duty personnel.) Allows Selected Reserve personnel to combine their reserve duty and active duty in the Persian Gulf in order to meet the minimum two-year active duty requirement in order to receive such increased benefits."
