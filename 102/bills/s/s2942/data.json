Provides an exemption from certain requirements for regulatory actions for which the President publishes in the Federal Register a statement of waiver that: (1) outlines the reasons for waiving such requirements because of emergency need for such specific regulatory action; and (2) includes a timetable for satisfying remaining requirements as early as possible. Requires the President to provide for independent evaluation of the regulatory process and the effect of regulations on different areas of the economy. Provides funding for such evaluation."
