    "text": "Judicial Survivors' Annuities Improvements Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal judicial code to authorize judicial officials of the United States (officials) to elect to contribute one percent of their salary and 3.5 percent of their retirement salary (under current law, five percent of their salary) to the Judicial Survivors' Annuities Fund. Requires an official who is not entitled to receive an immediate retirement salary upon leaving office but who is eligible to receive a deferred retirement salary at a later date to file, within 90 days before leaving office, a written notification of intent to remain within the purview of provisions with respect to the Fund (which shall constitute consent to contribute the 3.5 percent of deferred retirement salary) or be deemed to have revoked the election to participate under such provisions. Provides for the refund of deposits into the Fund for officials who leave office and are ineligible to receive a retirement salary, or who leave office and are entitled to a deferred retirement salary but fail to make an election. Counts as creditable service those years during which an official had deductions withheld from his or her retirement salary. Revises the formula with respect to the computation of the annuity to take into account the number of years during which the official had deductions withheld from his or her retirement salary. Authorizes an official who ceases to be married after making the election, to revoke such election in writing by notifying the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Provides a credit for prior contributions made to the Fund by officials at the higher rate. Puts officials, including judges of the U.S. Claims Court, the District Courts of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands, and bankruptcy judges and magistrate judges on a par with any other \"justice or judge of the United States\" (those covered under current law) with respect to eligibility for Government life insurance, termination of insurance, and conversion rights. Makes any member of a family who is a survivor of a justice or judge of the United States, a judge of the U.S. Claims Court, the District of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands, a bankruptcy judge, or a full-time magistrate judge, eligible for Government health insurance."
