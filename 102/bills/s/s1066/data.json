Authorizes increases for each such fiscal year in the number of certain personnel authorized to be on active duty in support of the reserve forces. Part C: Military Training Student Loads - Authorizes the average military training student loads for FY 1992 and 1993. Provides for the adjustment of such student loads consistent with manpower strengths as authorized under this Act. Title V: General Provisions - Repeals: (1) a Federal provision requiring a separate budget request for reserve and National Guard procurement in each annual defense budget submitted to the Congress; (2) the current limitation on the number of military and civilian personnel assigned to headquarters and non-management headquarters and support activities within the Department of Defense (DOD); and (3) a requirement for the authorization of civilian DOD personnel by end strength. Revises the submission date of a report required under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 concerning annual defense outlays. Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish in DOD a Defense Business Operations Fund to finance operations within or among DOD departments and agencies, including: (1) the financing and furnishing of inventories and supplies; and (2) the performance of industrial, commercial, and support activities. Establishes such Fund in the Treasury and provides for debits, credits, and authorized Fund uses. Provides transition provisions for defense working capital funds affected by the creation of the Fund. Establishes in the Treasury the Lease Replacement Fund, Defense (Lease Fund), to be available for the rehabilitation, construction, and renovation of property and facilities owned by DOD which are determined to be suitable, available, or needed for utilization as replacement facilities for facilities being leased by or on behalf of DOD.

Repeals a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 which provides funding for the Navy for the V-22 aircraft program. Repeals a Federal provision requiring the Secretary to establish guidelines for reducing the number of civilian DOD employees employed by industrial- or commercial-type activities. Provides for the determination of the amount of the variable housing allowance to be paid to members and former members of the reserves. Authorizes the provision of special pay to health care officers who: (1) are reserves on active duty other than for training for at least 31 days but less than one year; (2) are involuntarily retained on active duty for at least 31 days; or (3) voluntarily agree to remain on active duty for less than one year while other officers are involuntarily retained on active duty or in cases of other special circumstances as determined by the Secretary. Provides that, in the case of retired officers ordered to active duty who serve on such active duty in a grade higher than their retired grade, such officers shall be advanced on the retired list upon release from such active duty to the highest grade satisfactorily served. States that if such retired list grade is higher than their original retired grade, such service must be for a minimum of three years of total active service. Allows the President to waive such three-year requirement in individual cases. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 to allow the number of certain intelligence personnel to be adjusted in accordance with certain actions taken by the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence with respect to the revision of priorities and the consolidation of functions.

Extends through FY 1995: (1) a provision which repealed a provision of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1984 which disallowed certain service to be considered for purposes of mandatory retirement under the retired reserve; (2) the original appointment period as a reserve medical officer for purposes of grade determination; (3) the promotion authority for certain reserve officers serving on active duty; (4) the initial appointment period for certain health professionals of the Selected Reserve to qualify for education loans through the Secretary of Defense; and (5) the enlistment and reenlistment bonus authority for members of the reserves.

Extends through FY 1997 the enlistment and reenlistment bonus authority for active-duty personnel. Authorizes the Secretaries of the military departments concerned to assign such powers, functions, and duties as considered appropriate to the General Counsels of such departments. Authorizes such General Counsels to temporarily perform the duties of the Secretaries of such military departments. Identifies the General Counsels as the chief legal officers of such departments. Establishes the pay grade for General Counsels at Level IV of the Executive Schedule.
