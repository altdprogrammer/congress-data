    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-11-27", 
    "text": "Right to Know More Act of 1991 - Requires owners or operators of facilities subject to toxic chemical release requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 that meet threshold requirements under such Act or threshold quantities established under this Act for releases or transfers to offsite facilities to include comparable supplemental information for transfers or releases of chemicals that are: (1) priority pollutants relating to steam electric power point source pollutants under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act; (2) specified hazardous wastes listed under the Solid Waste Disposal Act; (3) specified chemicals listed under the Clean Air Act; (4) pesticides with respect to which the registration has been denied, cancelled, or is under suspension or pesticides undergoing administrative review or that are classified for restricted use; (5) chemicals listed under the Safe Drinking Water Act for which maximum contaminant levels have been proposed; (6) chemicals identified as carcinogens by the Carcinogen Assessment Group of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the International Agency for Research on Cancer, or the National Toxicology Program; (7) extremely hazardous substances listed pursuant to the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986; and (8) chemicals listed in 90 California Regulatory Notice Register 990 as reproductive toxins. Directs the EPA Administrator to establish a threshold quantity for releases to the environment or transfers to offsite facilities for such chemicals. Sets specified thresholds for such chemicals if the Administrator fails to establish thresholds. Applies toxic chemical release reporting requirements to facilities employing at least ten full-time employees that are currently exempt from such requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, but meet threshold reporting requirements. Requires facilities subject to reporting requirements to submit additional information that includes maximum hourly release rates for chemicals, compilations of annual input, accumulation, and output quantities of chemicals, targeted production processes, and goals for reduction in the use and generation of such chemicals. Directs the Administrator to: (1) establish criteria to aid such facilities in focusing pollution prevention strategies on targeted production processes; and (2) identify environmental and health hazards resulting from such chemicals. Applies provisions of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 concerning trade secrets, public availability of information, and the provision of information to health professionals to toxics information under this Act. Prescribes civil and administrative penalties for violations of this Act. Directs the Administrator to study and report to the appropriate congressional committees on methods of encouraging the reporting of toxics information through the use of computer telecommunication and other means. Waives compliance with this Act if the President determines a waiver to be necessary in the paramount interest of the United States. Authorizes petitions for rescission of waivers. Requires the Director of the Office of Technology Assessment to study and report to the Administrator and the appropriate congressional committees on the provision to the public of toxic release inventory information and reports required by this Act. Directs the Administrator to establish a grant program to assist States, local governments, local emergency planning commissions, and State emergency response commissions in carrying out specified provisions of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 and this Act. Requires States to make 75 percent of a grant available to local governments and emergency planning commissions. Bases the awarding of grants on the extent to which chemical substances are manufactured, processed, used, and disposed of in a State, the extent of exposure to such substances in a State, and the population density of a State. Authorizes appropriations. Makes owners or operators of facilities subject to reporting requirements of this Act subject to source reduction and recycling reporting requirements under the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990."
