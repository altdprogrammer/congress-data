    "text": "Small Business Technology Transfer Act of 1992 - Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to require: (1) any non-Federal entity that operated a laboratory pursuant to a contract with a Federal agency to submit to the agency any cooperative research and development agreement that the entity proposes to enter into with a small business firm and the joint work statement (JWS) required with respect to that agreement; (2) a Federal agency that receives such a proposed agreement and JWS to review and approve, request specific modifications to, or disapprove the proposed agreement and JWS within 30 days after submission (and prohibits an agreement from being entered into by a Government-owned, contractor-operated laboratory before both approval of the agreement and JWS); and (3) an agency which has contracted with such an entity that disapproves or requests the modification of an agreement or JWS to transmit a written explanation of such disapproval or modification to the head of the laboratory concerned. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to facilitate and encourage the transfer of technology to small businesses and issue guidelines relating to the program by May 1, 1993. Makes funds authorized to be appropriated to the Department of Energy and made available for laboratory directed research and development available for agreements or other arrangements for technology transfer."
