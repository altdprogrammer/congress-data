Authorizes the Secretary of Education to guarantee any lender against loss of principal or interest on a loan made by the lender to a non-Federal, nonprofit, public corporation: (1) in existence as of January 1, 1992; (2) whose charter is designed for affiliation with State and local instructional institutions and other instructional resource providers; (3) whose governing board includes members representing specified types of education and institutions; and (4) whose sole purpose is to acquire and operate a communications satellite system dedicated to transmitting instructional programming. Sets forth conditions on such loans as well as limitations on amounts. Requires lenders, in order to receive guarantees, to agree to assign to the United States any right or interest in the system that such lender possesses upon payment by the Secretary on the guarantee. Authorizes appropriations."
