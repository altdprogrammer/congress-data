    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-03-31", 
    "text": "Water Resources Development Act of 1992 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to carry out, at specified costs: (1) a project for navigation at Canaveral Harbor, Florida; and (2) a project for storm damage reduction at the Saugus River and Tributaries, Massachusetts. Authorizes the Secretary to modify a current flood control project in Rochester, Minnesota, in a specified amount. Amends the National Dam Safety Act of 1972 to authorize appropriations annually (currently through FY 1992) for continuously maintaining an updated inventory of all dams located in the United States. Authorizes the Secretary to develop and implement a program to share the cost of managing recreation facilities and natural resources at water resources development projects under the Secretary's jurisdiction. Amends the Flood Control Act of 1968 to authorize the Secretary to charge fees for the use of developed recreation sites and facilities. Prohibits the imposition of such fees for certain general public access uses at such sites and facilities. Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to eliminate the requirement that the Army Corps of Engineers provide one free campground at each of its projects where camping is permitted. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1990 to continue indefinitely (currently terminates at the end of FY 1992) a joint program of the Corps of Engineers and the Department of Transportation regarding research and development of magnetic levitation technology and applications. Authorizes the Secretary to procure materials deemed necessary to promote the Army's safety program, to be distributed to Army employees. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to provide that operation and maintenance costs of water resources development projects (projects) located on Federal public lands or lands owned or operated by State and local governments shall be borne fully (currently, 75 percent) by the agency responsible for management activities for fish and wildlife on those lands. Directs the Secretary to establish a goal of five percent of the total amount of civil works funds obligated for Department of the Army contracts and subcontracts entered into during FY 1993 for award to small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (as defined by the Small Business Act) and to historically Black colleges and universities or minority institutions. Outlines procurement procedures to be used to achieve such goal. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out projects for the protection, restoration, and creation of aquatic and ecologically related habitats, including wetlands, in connection with dredging for construction, operation, or maintenance of an authorized navigation project. Allows such projects to be undertaken whenever the Secretary finds that: (1) the environmental, economic, and social benefits of the project justify the cost; and (2) such project would not result in further environmental degradation. Requires non-Federal interests to enter into cooperative agreements for such projects which establishes cost-sharing requirements. Authorizes appropriations. Includes Indian tribes, U.S. territories and possessions, and Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands under the definition of a \"State\" eligible for provision by the Corps of Engineers of certain reimbursable services. Authorizes the Secretary, at the request of a State, to place beach quality sand (obtained from dredging activities) on the beaches of a political subdivision (currently, only permitted for the State itself), as long as the political subdivision agrees to the same cost-sharing provisions required of States for receiving such sand. Requires funds recovered by the Secretary for the cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances in support of the Army Civil Works Program to be credited toward the cost of taking such action. (Currently, such funds must be deposited into the general Treasury.) Authorizes the Secretary, in maintaining hydroelectric power generating facilities at projects under the jurisdiction of the Army, to increase the efficiency of energy production or capacity at such facilities if such uprating is economically justified, will not result in significant adverse effects on the project's purpose or the environment, and will not involve major structural or operational project changes. Authorizes the Secretary to undertake surveys, plans, and studies and prepare reports which may lead to work under existing civil works authorities or to recommendations for authorizations. Provides funding. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to: (1) set at 25 percent the non-Federal share of the cost of Corps of Engineers projects for environmental protection and restoration; and (2) remove a provision prohibiting dredging vessels and related equipment from being sold in the United States in order to engage in dredging activities. Authorizes the Secretary to make one-time, lump-sum payments to non-Federal sponsors for the Federal share of operation, maintenance, replacement, and rehabilitation costs of civil works projects, after completion of construction of the project. Requires the non-Federal interest, before such payment is made, to enter into a building agreement with the Secretary to perform the operation, maintenance, replacement, and rehabilitation of such project. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to: (1) increase from $15,000,000 to $25,000,000 the annual funding limit for modifications to projects in order to improve the quality of the environment in the public interest and when not incompatible with project purposes; and (2) limit funding for each modification to $5,000,000. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1988 to authorize the Secretary to apply infringement protection as provided under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to software technology developed by the Corps of Engineers which the Secretary feels will be subject to a cooperative research and development agreement within two years of its development. (Currently, such infringement protection is afforded only after the cooperative agreement is entered into.) Authorizes the Secretary to accept contributions from nonprofit private entities and non-Federal public entities other than project sponsors in connection with carrying out projects for environmental protection and restoration. Provides for the deposit of contributed funds. Requires recommendation to the Congress by the Secretary that a non-Federal sponsor bear 50 percent of the cost of any proposed modification of an existing authorized project by removal of one or more of the project features which would significantly and adversely impact the authorized project purposes or outputs. Expresses the sense of the Congress that negotiations between affected States and, when warranted, concerned Federal agencies and affected Indian tribes is an effective method of settling disputes concerning water flows and water levels in rivers and associated lakes and reservoirs and could eliminate the need to settle such disputes through the court system. Authorizes the Secretary to participate in such negotiations and to provide technical assistance when determined to be in the interest of the Army."
