    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-06-24", 
    "text": "Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1991 - Amends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to extend the authorization of appropriations for early intervention program services for infants and toddlers with disabilities. Includes among such services assistive technology devices and services. Provides that service coordination and coordinator include case management services and a case manager. Requires the comprehensive system of personnel development to be consistent with the system under the program of assistance for the education of all children with disabilities. Revises lead State agency responsibilities to include monitoring compliance of programs and activities used by the State to carry out early intervention services, whether or not these are receiving assistance. Allows a State (in addition to the currently authorized direct services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families) to use early intervention program funds to: (1) finance services in support of a free appropriate public education, in accordance with the preschool program, to children with disabilities in the transitional period from their third birthday to the beginning of the next school year; and (2) provide appropriate developmental services to infants and toddlers who do not have disabilities but are at risk of having substantial developmental delays if such services are not provided. (Current law allows State discretion to include such infants and toddlers among those served.) Requires the State, in providing services to such at-risk infants and toddlers, to describe them and such services in its application, comply with payor of last resort requirements, and comply with all other requirements unless it can give acceptable reasons for noncompliance. Requires each State receiving early intervention funds to: (1) describe in its application the extent to which it will use them for direct services not otherwise available and for expanding and improving otherwise available services; (2) keep records demonstrating that such uses have been as authorized, and in compliance with payor of last resort requirements (for nonsubstitution of other funds and nonreduction of other benefits); and (3) include data on the amount of such funds expended as direct services and as expansion and improvement, and the purposes of such expenditures. Revises early intervention program requirements relating to State Interagency Coordinating Council membership composition and numbers. Provides that nothing in IDEA relating to early intervention shall be construed to permit the State to reduce medical or other assistance or alter eligibility under any program within the State. (Current law refers to nonreduction of benefits only under Social Security Act title V provisions relating to maternal and child health and title XIX provisions relating to medicaid for handicapped infants and toddlers.) Requires a State, in order to receive its full allotment of early intervention funds, to: (1) adopt a schedule of sliding fees for early intervention services; or (2) provide a satisfactory explanation for not adopting such a schedule. Provides that any State not meeting such requirement shall receive only 90 percent of its allotment. Revises IDEA provisions for the preschool grants program to allow a State to opt to use a certain portion of its preschool grant to provide a free public education to two-year-old children with disabilities who will reach age three during the school year, whether or not they are receiving or have received early intervention program services. (Allows the local or intermediate educational agency to use State preschool grant funds for such purpose, if consistent with State policy.) Provides that early intervention program provisions do not apply to any child with disabilities receiving a free public education with preschool grant funds."
