    "text": "National Pursuit Awareness Act of 1992 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) to make grants to States under the drug control and system improvement grant program for programs that increase awareness and improve public safety through implementation of policies and training procedures to regulate the use of vehicular pursuit by law enforcement officers (officers) of criminal suspects. Reduces BJA formula grants by 25 percent (for redistribution to other participating States) to any State that by the first day of each fiscal year after FY 1995: (1) does not have in effect a law which prohibits the driver of a motor vehicle from increasing speed or taking other evasive action if an officer signals the driver to stop and which provides a minimum penalty of three months imprisonment and seizure of the violator's vehicle for such a violation; and (2) does not require each State agency employing officers who may conduct a motor vehicle pursuit in the course of employment to have in effect a policy which describes the manner and circumstances in which such a pursuit should be conducted and terminated, to train all officers of the agency in accordance with such policy, and to transmit to the State in such fiscal year a report containing information on each motor vehicle pursuit conducted by an officer of the agency. Requires: (1) the Attorney General, the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, and Treasury, the Chief of the Capitol Police, and the Administrator of the General Services Administration to report to the Congress on department policy on motor vehicle pursuits by department officers, and on procedures used to train department officers in implementation of such policy; and (2) each such policy to meet the requirements of this Act."
