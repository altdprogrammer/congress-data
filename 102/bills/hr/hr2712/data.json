    "text": "Airborne Drug Trafficking Deterrence Act - Sets forth the interdiction procedures to be followed by the commander of a drug interdiction aircraft when he or she reasonably believes that an aircraft is transporting illegal drugs into the United States. Requires such commander to notify higher authorities in the Coast Guard and then use all available means of communication to order the aircraft to land. Authorizes the firing of a warning signal across the nose of the intercepted aircraft after: (1) such aircraft has been observed dropping cargo which has been recovered, if it is feasible to do so, and found to contain a controlled substance; (2) such aircraft changes its course away from the continental United States and remains under constant surveillance; (3) continuing efforts to communicate with the aircraft prove futile and the commander reasonably believes that the aircraft recognizes the drug interdiction aircraft's identity, presence and intent; and (4) use of the warning signal is approved in advance by a higher authority. Authorizes the commander to shoot the aircraft down as a national security threat if: (1) at least two warning signals have been fired and it is reasonable to believe that they have been recognized and understood by the occupants of the intercepted aircraft; (2) the cargo has been recovered and identified as a controlled substance; (3) such aircraft fails to obey further communications; and (4) a higher authority has approved the use of force in advance. Directs the Coast Guard to coordinate such interdiction efforts with the Drug Enforcement Administration. Prohibits the use of warning signals or force: (1) over or within 12 miles of U.S. land area or in the airspace of a foreign country unless the foreign government authorizes the United States to use force; (2) if the commander reasonably believes that such signal or force would harm an innocent person; or (3) the intercepted aircraft is flying towards the United States. Requires that drug interdiction aircraft be equipped with a flashing blue light and such other identifying insignia as the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe. Requires that National Search and Rescue procedures be used to recover downed occupants of an intercepted aircraft. Directs the Secretary to notify fliers of their obligation to communicate with and obey commanders of drug interdiction aircraft and the possible consequences of disobedience. Indemnifies commanders and their assistants for penalties or damages incurred from the use of force. Authorizes Department of Defense assistance to Coast Guard interdiction efforts. Directs the Secretaries of Transportation and Defense to jointly prescribe regulations to implement the Coast Guard's duties under this Act."
