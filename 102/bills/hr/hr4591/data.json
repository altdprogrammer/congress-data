    "text": "Community Works Progress Act of 1992 - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to establish a new title VI, Community Works Progress and Youth Community Corps Programs. Establishes in the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the Department of Labor a Community Works Progress Office (the Office), to be headed by an Administrator. Directs the Administrator to prepare a plan for implementation of programs of the Office and submit a report summarizing it to the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary), who shall send a copy of the report to the appropriate congressional committees, and promulgate regulations to carry out the plan. Sets forth requirements relating to contracts made by administrative entities carrying out projects under this Act. Requires that such projects comply with nonduplication and nondisplacement requirements under the National and Community Service Act of 1990. Provides that compensation or benefits received by project participants under this Act shall be excluded from consideration under the Higher Education Act of 1965, specified provisions of the Social Security Act, and other determinations of Federal benefits. Requires administrative entities carrying out such projects to submit quarterly progress reports to the State Governor. Directs the Comptroller General to evaluate programs under this Act and report to the Secretary and appropriate congressional committees. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Administrator, to establish in the Office a Community Works Progress (CWP) program. Provides for CWP program allotments to States, including bonuses to States demonstrating progress in the preceding fiscal year in securing employment for individuals who were receiving AFDC and who no longer require such aid as a result of such employment. Allows States to use such allotments to award grants for CWP projects. Sets forth requirements for State Governors' award of CWP grants to eligible entities (including public agencies, private contractors, and private nonprofit organizations) for CWP projects that will serve a significant public purpose in a community service field (as described under the National and Community Service Act of 1990). Requires compliance with criteria established by the Secretary for job training, job search, and volunteer services. Sets forth requirements for job training plans for such CWP grant projects. Requires the Governor to enter into a written grant agreement with the administrative entity, including requirements for: (1) limits on administrative expenses and construction contracts; (2) use of at least 70 percent of the grant for compensation and supportive services for participants; (3) a three-year completion deadline; and (4) jobs opportunities and basic skills training program requirements for AFDC recipients. Sets forth requirements for nonpartisan selection and eligibility of unemployed individuals as project participants. Allows project participation, under specified conditions, of individuals who are also participants in the job opportunities and basic skills training program under AFDC provisions of the Social Security Act. Allows participation of individuals receiving unemployment compensation if certain age, education, residence, and unemployment period criteria are met. Allows participation of individuals who are not receiving unemployment compensation and who are discouraged workers if the other criteria are met. Requires, if possible, that at least 25 percent of project participants not be AFDC training program participants. Makes ineligible for project participation any individual eligible for specified retirement benefits. Sets forth restrictions on project participation, including: (1) 32-hour maximum project work per week; (2) 20-hour maximum on any additional part-time employment; (3) job search requirements; and (4) testing and education requirements. Sets forth requirements for compensation and supportive services for project participants, including unemployment compensation recipients, AFDC recipients, and individuals not receiving unemployment compensation. Sets forth duties of State units with respect to the CWP program in each State. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Administrator, to establish in the Office a youth community corps (YCC) program. Provides for YCC program allotments to States to award grants for YCC projects. Sets forth requirements for State Governor's award of YCC grants to eligible entities (community-based organizations, local educational agencies, or partnerships of local education agencies with local public community service agencies) for YCC projects to employ participants in projects in community service fields. Sets forth requirements for job training plans. Requires YCC grant agreements to limit administrative expenses and construction contracts, require 70 percent of grant funds for compensation and benefits for participants, and limit length of individual participation to not more than 250 hours per year. Sets forth requirements for selection and eligibility of YCC participants. Makes eligible elementary and secondary school students a ged 14 to 21 who are children of participants in the AFDC job opportunities and basic skills training program or who are members of families receiving AFDC benefits, or of eligible households under the food stamp program, or of families with incomes at or below the official poverty line. Allows employment of other eligible students who do not meet such poverty criteria if the project requires a greater number of participants and preference in such selection is given to students with work experience related to the project. Prohibits employment as a participant in a YCC project of any individual who is not making progress toward attainment of a high school diploma or equivalent. Requires payment to YCC participants of either: (1) a monetary credit for use at institutions of higher education, based on hours of participation; or (2) a cash benefit equal to one-half the amount of the educational credit. Sets forth duties of State units with respect to the YCC program in the State. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Administrator, to establish in the Office a national youth community corps (NYCC) program. Directs the Secretary to make equal allotments to ETA regional offices to make NYCC grants and to make administrative cost grants to States in which NYCC projects are carried out. Authorizes a regional office to make one grant for each fiscal year to establish and carry out an NYCC project to employ participants aged 17 to 22 in a project related to community service fields within the region served by that office. Makes eligible to receive such a grant a State or local public agency or a private nonprofit organization that provides such community services within that region. Sets forth requirements for job training plans. Requires NYCC grant agreements to: (1) limit administrative expenses and construction contracts; (2) use at least 70 percent of the grant for compensation and benefits for participants; (3) limit individual participant employment to not more than two years; (4) provide for training participants in accordance with specified provisions of the National and Community Service Act of 1990; and (5) provide for periodic and confidential evaluations of each participant. Sets forth requirements for selection and eligibility of NYCC project participants. Requires individual applications to the Governor to indicate the NYCC projects in which the individual seeks to participate. Requires the Governor to refer such application to each administrative entity administering such projects. Requires an individual to be age 17 to 22 to be eligible to participate in a NYCC project. Requires the administrative entity to make offers to eligible individuals to become participants in the project. Provides for living allowances and payments to NYCC participants. Provides for a choice of higher educational credits equal to $10,000 per year or cash benefits equal to $5,000 per year. Sets forth duties of State units with respect to an NYCC program conducted in the State. Authorizes appropriations under JTPA to carry out this Act. Amends the Social Security Act with respect to programs under this Act in ways relating to: (1) disregard of income earned as compensation by a program participant under this Act; (2) employability plans; (3) referral to projects under the CWP, YCC, and NYCC programs; (4) work supplementation program; and (5) community work experience program. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude: (1) compensation for service under this Act as wages for unemployment compensation purposes; and (2) compensation and benefits for service under this Act from gross income for income tax purposes."
