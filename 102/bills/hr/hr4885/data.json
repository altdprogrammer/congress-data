Requires permits to: (1) specify sites for deposit in the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans or the Gulf of Mexico; (2) provide that such waste is deposited in a manner that prevents the waste from contacting the water column before reaching the vicinity of the deep seabed; (3) authorize deposits for a five-year period; and (4) direct the authorized person to conduct monitoring of the waste site and report to the Under Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Directs the Under Secretary and the Administrator to jointly conduct a program for monitoring environmental conditions at waste sites and nearby areas."
