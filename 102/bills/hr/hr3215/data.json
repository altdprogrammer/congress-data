Authorizes the Director (Director) of NSF to make grants to U.S. nongovernmental organizations, including colleges and universities, for the purpose of debt-for-science exchanges (agreements whereby a country's commercial debt burden is exchanged by the holder for a contribution of local currencies or other assets to support scientific and technological research). Requires the Director to report to the Congress with respect to: (1) Binational Science Foundations; and (2) the Inter-American Scientific Cooperation Program. Authorizes appropriations. Wind Engineering Program Act of 1992 - Establishes within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Institute) a Wind Engineering Program which shall: (1) provide for wind engineering research; (2) serve as an information clearinghouse; and (3) improve interagency coordination on wind engineering research.
