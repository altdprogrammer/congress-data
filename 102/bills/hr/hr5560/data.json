Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) (as amended by title III of Public Law 102-62) to authorize the Secretary of Education to enter into a contract or grant (currently only a contract) with the Center for Civic Education to carry out the civic education program known as \"We the People...The Citizen and the Constitution.\" Provides for an annual national competition of simulated hearings for secondary students who wish to participate in the program. (Currently such competition is to be at the congressional district, State, and national levels.) Makes secondary schools (as well as elementary schools) eligible to participate in such program. Amends specified Federal law to provide for ten Assistant Secretaries of Education. (Current law provides for six such Secretaries and four additional officers of the Department of Education.) Revises ESEA title I chapter 1 with respect to educationally disadvantaged children to revise formulas for average per pupil expenditure for designated schools receiving certain funds for schoolwide projects."
