    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-10-06", 
    "text": "Telecommunications Authorization Act of 1992 - Title I: National Telecommunications and Information Administration - Part A: Organization and Functions - National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act - Provides statutory authorization for the establishment within the Department of Commerce (DOC) of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Directs the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) assign to the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information (of DOC) and NTIA responsibility for the performance of the Secretary's communications and information functions; and (2) submit annual reports to the President pursuant to the Communications Satellite Act of 1962. Requires the Secretary and the NTIA to amend the Department of Commerce spectrum management document entitled \"Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management\" to improve Federal spectrum management activities and publish any changes in regulations in the Federal Register. Sets forth requirements for such amendments, including requirements that provide for availability of information to the public. Requires the Secretary to certify compliance with such requirement to the Congress. Directs the Secretary, in assigning frequencies for mobile and other radio services, to promote efficient and cost-effective use of the spectrum. Authorizes the Secretary to withhold or refuse to assign frequencies for such services to further the goals of efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Requires the Secretary to implement and report to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on a plan requiring Federal agencies with mobile radio systems to use more spectrum-efficient technologies. Authorizes the Secretary to reassign to another DOC unit a function required to be assigned to NTIA by this Act, subject to specified limitations. Part B: Special and Temporary Provisions - Authorizes appropriations for NTIA administration for FY 1992 and 1993. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to extend the authorization of appropriations for the National Endowment for Children's Educational Television through FY 1994. Extends the authorization of appropriations for acquisition of satellite space segment capacity and equipment to provide communications services for the Pan-Pacific Educational and Cultural Experiments by Satellite Program (PEACESAT) program. Directs the Secretary to establish an advisory panel to develop recommendations for the improvement of rural health care through the collection of information needed by providers and the improvement in the use of communications to disseminate such information. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the NTIA to report to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on the role of telecommunications in hate crimes and violent acts against ethnic, religious, and racial minorities. Title II: Federal Communications Commission - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to extend the authorization of appropriations for travel reimbursements by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) through FY 1994. Amends the Federal Communications Commission Authorization Act of 1988 to extend an authorization to expend funds for a monitoring station in Hawaii through FY 1994. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to repeal provisions that require the operation of all broadcasting station transmitting apparatus by a person holding an operator's license (thus allowing the FCC to permit broadcasters to substitute automated technology for human operators). Extends the time period for permitting licensee forfeitures in certain situations. Authorizes the FCC, for purposes of providing radio club and military-recreational call signs, to utilize the voluntary and uncompensated services of tax-exempt amateur radio organizations. Adds charges for low-earth orbit satellite systems to the Schedule of Charges. Reduces Schedule fees for inspection of vessels under the Great Lakes Agreement. Makes nonlicensee radio tower owners who have violated tower maintenance requirements subject to forfeiture liability if they have received previous notice of such obligations. Bars FCC approval of the assignment or transfer of control of a television broadcast license without a prior hearing if the license holder is a corporation owned or organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the transfer was approved on November 14, 1985. Provides for waivers of such requirement at the request of a corporation. Amends the Federal Communications Commission Authorization Act of 1988 to extend through FY 1993 the FCC's authorization to make grants to and agreements with nonprofit organizations to utilize older Americans in FCC programs. Removes a condition on the Older Americans Program that requires a certification that a grant or agreement will not result in filling a position without public announcement of availability and in accordance with regular employment procedures. Directs the FCC to make efforts to reduce telephone rates for armed forces personnel in specified foreign countries. Requires the FCC to initiate a rulemaking and adopt a standard for AM radio stereophonic transmitting equipment that specifies the composition of the transmitted signal."
