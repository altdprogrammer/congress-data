    "text": "National Wildlife Refuge System Management and Policy Act of 1991 - Amends the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 to prohibit the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) from initiating or permitting a new use of a refuge or expanding, renewing, or extending an existing use unless it is determined that it is compatible with the purposes of the System and the refuge. Allows existing uses of such refuge system lands that have been determined to be compatible under this Act, or the Refuge Recreation Act, to continue under specified conditions. Ceases such use and revokes permits for it within five years after the enactment of this Act unless the Secretary determines that such use is compatible. Directs the Secretary, Acting through the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to establish and maintain a formal process for governing determinations of whether an existing or proposed new use in a refuge is compatible or incompatible with the purposes of the System and the refuge. Sets forth requirements for such determinations. Requires the head of each Federal agency that has, with respect to a refuge, an equivalent or secondary jurisdiction with the Department of the Interior, or conducts activities within any refuge to ensure that any actions authorized, funded, or carried out in whole or in part by such agency will not impair the resources of the refuge or be incompatible with the purposes of either the System or refuge, unless such action is specifically authorized by law or necessary for national security. Directs the Secretary to: (1) prepare by September 30, 1994, and revise not less that every ten years thereafter, a comprehensive plan for the System; and (2) prepare and revise at least every 15 years, a comprehensive conservation plan for each refuge or ecologically related complex of refuges in the System, except those in Alaska. Authorizes appropriations. Grants the Secretary emergency power to suspend any activity in any range in the National Wildlife Refuge System if such activity constitutes an imminent danger to the health and safety of any wildlife population, refuge, or to public health and safety."
