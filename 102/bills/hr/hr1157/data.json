Extends the period of time applicable to the rollover of gain on the sale of a principal residence for certain taxpayers who have substantial frozen deposits after the date of sale of the old residence. Limits such time to not more than five years after such sale. Exempts from the excise tax on excess accumulations in qualified retirement plans amounts required to be distributed that are frozen deposits."
