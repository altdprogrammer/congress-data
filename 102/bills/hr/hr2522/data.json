Authorizes security holders of specified market value or voting strength to nominate persons for election to the issuer's board of directors. Requires that such nominations be included in the issuer's proxy statement and form of proxy. Requires that, upon receipt of an entitled person's written request, an issuer promptly make available its list of security holders of record, and any list of beneficial owners available to it. Establishes a monetary penalty for noncompliance. Sets forth confidentiality guidelines."
