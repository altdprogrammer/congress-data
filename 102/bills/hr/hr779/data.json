    "text": "Natural Gas Enhancement Act of 1991 - Amends the Natural Gas Act to extend the time within which the Federal Power Commission must take final action with respect to applications for rehearing of Commission orders. Permits applicants who are required to prepare environmental impact statements with respect to the construction or extension of facilities for the transportation of natural gas to elect a contractor, consultant, or other person designated by the Commission to prepare such statement at the applicant's expense. Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to authorize the Commission to utilize rulemaking procedures with respect to the establishment of rates and charges, or the issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity, including abandonment of natural gas facilities and services, and the establishment of physical connections under the Natural Gas Act. Amends the Natural Gas Act to declare that the replacement or repair of natural gas facilities for which a certificate of public convenience and necessity has been issued shall not be considered the construction or extension of such facilities unless such replaced or repaired facility has substantially more or less delivery capacity than the original certificated facility, or such replacement or repair results in a reduction or abandonment of service provided by the original certificated facility. Requires the Commission to file notice in the Federal Register of proposed certificates of public convenience and necessity as soon as all required information has been received by it. Deems such certificates to have been issued if no protest or objection has been filed in response to such notice within 60 days after publication of such notice. Amends the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 to authorize the Commission to approve any intrastate pipeline to transport natural gas and to construct and operate natural gas facilities of any size or capacity to be used solely for the transportation of natural gas. Requires rates and charges of interstate natural gas pipelines to be just and reasonable. Amends the Natural Gas Act to authorize the President to designate as a priority project the construction or expansion of natural gas facilities over a specific route, or from a specific gas producing area, or into a specific gas consuming market if it is in the national interest. Requires the Commission to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the construction or expansion of such facilities if the President designates such facilities as a priority project. Declares that a certificate shall not be required for the construction or extension of natural gas facilities if such construction begins after enactment of this Act. Sets forth specified requirements with respect to such construction."
