    "text": "Authorizes Eagle and Pitkin Counties in the State of Colorado to offer for exchange to the United States specified lands located in the White River National Forest. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, within 90 days after receipt of a quitclaim deed from the Counties for such lands, to convey to the Counties all rights of the United States to specified lands located in the Mt. Sopris Tree Nursery (MSTN). Expresses the intention of the Congress that any lands and water rights conveyed to the Counties pursuant to this Act be retained by the Counties and used solely for public recreation and recreational facilities, open space, fairgrounds, and such other public purposes as do not significantly reduce the portion of such lands in open space. Requires the Secretary, in the deed of conveyance to the Counties, to provide that all rights in and to lands and water rights conveyed shall revert back to the United States in the event that such lands or water rights are sold or otherwise conveyed by the Counties or are used other than for public purposes. Directs the Secretary to complete appraisals of the lands to be exchanged. Specifies that $120,000 shall be deducted from the value of the Counties' offered lands to reflect any adverse claims against such lands which may be adjudicated pursuant to this Act. Requires the Secretary to determine whether the values of the lands to be exchanged are equal and immediately notify the Counties. Provides that, if the values are not equal, any cash equalization which would otherwise be owed to the Counties by the United States shall be waived and any equalization amount which may be owed to the United States by the Counties shall be satisfied through conveyance to the United States (within five years) of additional lands or interests in lands acceptable to the Secretary. Provides that: (1) the National Forest inholdings acquired by the United States pursuant to this Act shall become a part of the White River, Gunnison, and Arapaho National Forests, or a part of an appropriate existing wilderness area; and (2) the Quiet Title Act shall be the sole legal remedy of any party claiming any rights in or to any National Forest inholdings conveyed by the Counties to the United States pursuant to this Act. Requires, upon conveyance of the National Forest inholdings to the United States, that the Secretary publish a list of such acquired properties in a newspaper of general circulation in the Counties, together with a statement that any party desiring to assert a claim of any rights in or to such inholdings must bring a civil action against the United States pursuant to the Quiet Title Act in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia within six years after the publication of such listing. Sets forth additional provisions with respect to: (1) the vesting of title in the United States; (2) reimbursement of U.S. costs by the losing party in an action to quiet title; and (3) the obligation of the Counties (as a condition of any transfer of lands to the Counties under this Act) to reimburse the United States for 50 percent of costs in excess of $240,000 of defending any claim or legal action against the United States with respect to rights in or to the inholdings that is not reimbursed by a losing claimant. Requires the Counties to reimburse the United States for National Forest inholdings that the United States acquires under this Act that are lost in a final title determination adverse to the United States. Allocates and provides for the management of the existing water rights in the MSTN, including water well and irrigation ditch rights adjudicated under Colorado law, together with the right to administer, maintain, access, and further develop such rights. Requires transfers of lands authorized and directed by this Act to be completed within one year after the Counties make a timely offer. Transfers the White River National Forest Headquarters and administrative offices in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, from the jurisdiction of the U.S. General Services Administration to that of the Secretary, who shall retain such facilities unless and until otherwise provided by subsequent Acts of the Congress."
