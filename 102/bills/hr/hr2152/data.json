    "date": "1992-08-12", 
    "text": "High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act - Title I: High Seas Large-Scale Driftnet Fishing - Requires: (1) publication of a list of nations whose nationals or vessels conduct large-scale driftnet fishing beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation; (2) barring from leaving or entering U.S. ports any large-scale driftnet fishing vessel documented in the United States or in such countries; and (3) prohibition of importation from those countries of fish, fish and fish products, and sport fishing equipment. Mandates certification under the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 of any country: (1) for which that import prohibition is insufficient to terminate such fishing; or (2) that retaliates against the United States because of that import prohibition. Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act to modify requirements regarding documentary evidence that certain tuna was not harvested with driftnets meeting specified criteria after listed dates. Excludes from the definition of \"large-scale driftnet fishing,\" as used in this Act, specified use, until January 1, 1994, of certain nets in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. Title II: Fisheries Conservation Programs - Amends the Fisherman's Protective Act of 1967 to authorize, when certification is made under the Act, a prohibition on the importation of any products (currently, of fish products or wildlife products) from the offending country. Adds references to the District of Columbia and territories or possessions of the United States to the definition of \"United States\" under the Act. Removes provisions defining: (1) \"fish products\" and \"wildlife products;\" and (2) the \"taking\" of wildlife products to include certain conduct whether or not the conduct is legal under the laws of the offending country. Mandates a memorandum of understanding between the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of Defense regarding increasing the effectiveness of enforcement of domestic laws and international agreements that conserve and manage living marine resources of the United States. Declares that it is the sense of the Congress that the President should address environmental issues during multilateral, bilateral, and regional trade negotiations and take certain actions regarding environmental concerns and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Title III: Fisheries Enforcement in Central Bering Sea - Central Bering Sea Fisheries Enforcement Act of 1992 - Prohbits U.S. vessels and nationals from fishing in the central Bering Sea except in accordance with an international fishery agreement involving the United States and the Russian Federation. Mandates civil penalties and permit sanctions for violaitons. Mandates: (1) publication of a list of nations whose nationals fish in that area, except in accordance with such an agreement; (2) withholding or revocation of clearance for any fishing vessel documented in such a nation; and (3) denial of entry for any violating vessel. Prohibits any permitted fishing vessel from fishing in, or any processing facility from receiving fish from, an area under the authority of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council if the vessel is owned by any person that also owns or controls a fishing vessel documented in such a nation. Terminates this title seven years after enactment. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to modify requirements regarding imports from intermediary nations. Defines \" intermediatry nation\" as a nation which: (1) imports yellowfin tuna from countries subject to a ban on direct impoorts into the United States; and (2) exports yellowfin tuna to the United States. Authorizes the Secretary of State to extend the reemployment rights of a U.S. employee who, on a specified date, was serving with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
