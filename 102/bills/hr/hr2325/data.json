Requires the Secretary of the Interior to determine the extent to which such Area has been protected against specified activities through enforceable covenants, or action of the local government of Indiana using easements, zoning, or other means. Requires that if the Secretary identifies any area within the Salt Creek Protection Area that is unprotected in the manner specified in this Act, the landowner and the appropriate units of local government shall be notified within 60 days. Gives the Secretary authority to acquire easements for any unprotected area within the Salt Creek Corridor Protection Area no sooner than 90 days following such adequate notice under specified conditions. Promulgates guidelines for such easements."
