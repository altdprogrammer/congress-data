    "text": "Credit Availability and Regulatory Relief Act of 1992 - Title I: Supervisory Reforms - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to authorize the appropriate Federal banking agency to exempt any insured depository institution owned or controlled by a depository institution holding company from statutory examination requirements if: (1) the agency is satisfied that adequate internal controls and examination procedures exist within the holding company structure; and (2) the institutions owned or controlled by the holding company having at least 80 percent of all insured depository institutions owned or controlled by such holding company have been subjected to onsite examinations. Modifies statutory auditing and reporting requirements in order to reduce the regulatory costs incurred by insured depository institutions. Requires the Small Business Administration together with specified financial institution regulatory agencies to conduct a joint study and report to the Congress on the appropriate methods to obtain the information needed to assess the availability of credit to small businesses, including minority-owned small businesses and small farms. Repeals the existing mandate for certain regulatory standards for safety and soundness. Requires the appropriate Federal banking agencies to review their regulations and adopt uniform regulations. Excludes from bank closure requirements specified branches and automated teller machines. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to modify the aggregate statutory limits on insider lending. Repeals the current statutory mandate with respect to the regulation of interbank risks. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to change the assessment base calculation for deposit insurance premiums (from the two most recent quarterly call reports of the institution to the next-to-last call report and the one immediately before it). Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 to: (1) establish a threshold of $100,000 or less level below which State-certified or State-licensed appraisers are not required for certain Federal real estate-related transactions; and (2) prohibit the States from requiring State-certified or State-licensed appraisers for such transactions.
