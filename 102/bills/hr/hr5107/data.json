    "text": "Requires the Secretary of Defense to carry out a program to establish and finance at least ten electric vehicle market/infrastructure pilot projects geographically dispersed in eligible metropolitan areas in the United States designed to demonstrate: (1) electric vehicles for use both on and off military facilities; (2) the infrastructure necessary to support the operation and maintenance of a wide range of types of electric vehicles; or (3) both such vehicles and the associated infrastructure. Directs the Secretary to assign oversight and coordination of a pilot project to the Air Force Air Logistics Center in the State in which the project is located or to the nearest Center if such State does not have one. Makes the person submitting a proposal eligible for selection if he or she agrees to make non-Federal contributions equal to at least 50 percent of the costs associated with the pilot project. Sets forth criteria to be used in selecting a proposal. Authorizes appropriations."
