    "text": "Persian Gulf War Health Registry Act - Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) to maintain a Persian Gulf War Health Registry for purposes of compiling information on Persian Gulf War veterans to assist in identifying possible disabilities which may result from service in the U.S. armed forces in southwest Asia during such war. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) information to be included in the Registry, including a description of activities in which the veteran participated during the war that may have long-term health effects, locations in which the veteran served, and any investigation drugs administered to such veterans by the Department of Defense (DOD); and (2) steps that the Secretary may (and Secretary of Defense, upon request, shall) take, including a comprehensive mental and physical examination and follow-up consultation, to determine the current health status of such veterans. Directs the Secretary and Secretary of Defense to: (1) inform Gulf War veterans who are no longer members of the armed forces of the provisions of this Act and encourage such veterans to participate in the Registry; and (2) annually furnish to such veterans updated information on health risks of service in southwest Asia during the war. Requires DOD to reimburse the Department of Veterans Affairs each fiscal year, from funds appropriated for health care, for the cost of administering the Registry for Gulf War veterans who are members of the armed forces. Specifies that: (1) nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorizing the Secretary to provide Gulf War veterans in the Registry with hospital care, nursing home care, or outpatient medical services for the treatment of diseases or disabilities identified in an examination authorized pursuant to this Act; and (2) application for an examination shall not be construed as an application for any other benefit. Directs the Secretary to conduct a longitudinal study, over a 50-year period, to assess the short- and long-term health consequences of service in southwest Asia during the Gulf War, including an ongoing examination of the health consequences of petrochemical exposure, investigation drugs administered during the Gulf War, the fumes of burning trash, and diseases indigenous to the Middle East. Requires the Secretary and Secretary of Defense to submit to the Congress a joint annual report on the Registry. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish the Registry (and have access to the registry established by the Secretary of Defense); and (2) submit to the Congress a research protocol for the 50-year study."
