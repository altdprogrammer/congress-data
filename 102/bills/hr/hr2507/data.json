Requires establishment of: (1) a data system, available to the public, for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information regarding research on women's health conducted or supported by the institutes; and (2) a program to provide information on research and prevention activities of the institutes relating to women's health research. Subtitle C: Scientific Integrity - Replaces provisions relating to protection against scientific fraud with provisions establishing as an independent entity in the Department of Health and Human Services the Office of Scientific Integrity. Requires: (1) applicants for a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement under the Act for biomedical or behavioral research to have an administrative process to review reports of scientific misconduct and agree to report any investigation of such reports; and (2) a response process for the Office. Establishes the Commission on Scientific Integrity. Provides for employee whistle blower protection. Mandates measures for identifying, responding to, and reporting the existence of a financial interest that will or may create a bias in favor of obtaining results, in a project to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a drug, medical device, or treatment, that are consistent with the interest.

Title III: National Institutes of Health in General - Establishes a fund for use by the NIH Director to carry out NIH activities. Authorizes appropriations. Modifies the duties of the NIH's Associate Director for Prevention. Establishes a program to enhance the competitiveness of research entities in States which have historically had low success in obtaining funds from the national research institutes for biomedical and behavioral research. Mandates activities, consistent with the global Children's Vaccine Initiative, to develop affordable new and improved vaccines. Authorizes appropriations. Requires a plan regarding research methods that do not require the use of animals, that reduce the number of animals used, and that produce less distress in the animals. Establishes the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Use of Animals in Research. Repeals similar provisions. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct and support research, research training, recruitment, and other activities to increase the number of women and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds in biomedical and behavioral research.
