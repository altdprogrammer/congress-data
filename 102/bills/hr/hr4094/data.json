Amends Federal law relating to health insurance for Federal employees to allow the services to be covered under service benefit plans and indemnity benefit plans. Establishes a project to demonstrate the effectiveness in providing preventive health care services in improving the health of individuals and reducing the aggregate costs of providing health care. Mandates five-year grants to 50 counties to: (1) provide specified preventive services to individuals otherwise unable to pay; (2) conduct a study and report to the Congress regarding preventive service requirements imposed by each State on health benefit plans offered to residents of the State; and (3) dissemination of information on preventive care, the importance of periodic examinations, and the need to maintain a family medical history."
