Requires such tax, equal to 50 percent of the premium, to be paid by the policy issuer. Title II: Federal Standards for Long-Term Care Insurance Policies - Amends the Social Security Act to add a new title XXI under which the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to establish, review annually, and revise as necessary Federal standards for long-term (12 months or longer) care insurance policies that incorporate specified requirements relating to: (1) consumer disclosure; (2) benefits and eligibility, including restrictions on inflation adjustments and policy forfeiture; (3) premium increase limitations and policy renewability, conversion, and replacement; (4) policy issuance and sale, including prohibitions against the sale or issuance of a policy to a beneficiary under Medicaid or under Medicare (titles XIX and XVIII, respectively, of the Social Security Act) or a Medicare supplemental policy if benefits are duplicated; and (5) issuer reporting of information on policies, premiums, lapse rates, and denials of applicants and claims. Directs the Secretary to establish a procedure for certifying long-term care insurance policies as meeting Federal standards. Deems a policy issued in and approved by a State to be certified if (and for so long as) the Secretary determines that the State has en effective regulatory program that applies and enforces the Federal standards."
