    "text": "Disaster Assistance Act of 1991 - Title I: Emergency Livestock Assistance - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to prohibit a person from receiving emergency feed assistance under this title and disaster assistance for the same 1991 weather damaged crops. Subjects eligible recipients to specified combined payments and benefits limitations. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to implement an emergency forage program to reseed 1991 weather damaged forage crops. Limits: (1) Federal cost-sharing to 50 percent; and (2) individual payments to $3,500. Funds such program through the Commodity Credit Corporation (with a $50,000,000 limit). Title II: Emergency Crop Loss Assistance - Subtitle A: Annual Crops - Directs the Secretary to make 1991 disaster payments to producers of wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, extra long staple cotton, rice, peanuts, sugar, tobacco, oilseeds, and other nonprogram crops. Extends crop quality reduction disaster assistance through the 1991 crop year. Reduces disaster assistance payments in relation to Federal crop insurance payments. Requires producers to obtain Federal crop insurance for 1992 in order to be eligible for disaster payments and other specified assistance for 1991 crop losses. Sets forth exempted circumstances. Requires the Secretary to announce within a specified time the conditions for establishing a 1990 farm yield for forage-use-crops. Limits assistance under this subtitle to $100,000. Prohibits double payments on replanted acreage. Authorizes: (1) the substitution of crop insurance program yields for 1991 disaster assistance eligibility purposes; and (2) the Secretary to determine a de minimis yield for each crop eligible for reduced yield disaster payments. Subtitle B: Administrative Provisions - Makes a person with qualifying annual gross income (as defined by this Act) in excess of $2,000,000 ineligible for assistance under this title. Places a specified pro rata cap on 1991 wheat, feed grain, upland cotton, extra long staple cotton, and rice deficiency payments if corn planted in 1991 exceeds a specified acreage. Subtitle C: Sense of Congress - Expresses the sense of the Congress regarding disaster payments' purposes of preserving farm livelihoods and the financial health of rural communities. Title III: Other Emergency Provisions - Directs the Secretary to provide loan guarantees through the Rural Development Insurance Fund to rural businesses (including Indian tribes) who have suffered 1991 disaster damage. Limits: (1) individual guarantees to 90 percent of $500,000; and (2) aggregate guarantees to $200,000,000."
