    "text": "National Security Education Act of 1991 - Amends the National Security Act of 1947 (the Act) to add a new title VIII, National Security Scholarships, Fellowships, and Grants. Directs the National Security Education Board (the Board, established by this Act) to conduct a program of: (1) scholarships to undergraduate students for study abroad for at least one semester in a Board-identified critical country; (2) fellowships to graduate students for graduate study in the United States in Board-determined critical areas of the disciplines of international studies, area studies, and foreign languages (in exchange for work for the Federal Government or in the education field in such study area); and (3) grants to institutions of higher education to establish, operate, and improve programs in Board-determined critical areas of the disciplines of international studies, area studies, and foreign languages. Limits such scholarships and fellowships to U.S. citizens or resident aliens. Sets forth requirements for individual fellowship agreements. Directs the Board to: (1) develop criteria for awarding such scholarships, fellowships, and grants; (2) provide for the wide disbursement of information on activities assisted under this Act; (3) consider providing an equitable geographic distribution of such awards; (4) use a merit review process in making them; and (5) adjust the amount of such awards annually for inflation. Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish the National Security Education Board. Requires the following or their representatives to be members of the Board: (1) the Secretaries of Defense (chairperson), of Education, of State, and of Commerce; (2) the Directors of the Central Intelligence and the U.S. Information Agencies; and (3) four appointees of the President, with Senate advice and consent, who have expertise in the fields of international, language, and area studies education. Directs the Board to: (1) establish qualifications for students and institutions desiring such scholarships, fellowships, and grants; and (2) review administration of the program assisted under this Act. Directs the Board to identify as critical: (1) (for undergraduate scholarships) countries not emphasized in other U.S. study abroad programs, such as countries where few U.S. students are studying; (2) (for graduate fellowships) areas of study within the named disciplines which the Board determines U.S. students are deficient in learning; and (3) (for institutional program grants) areas of study within the named disciplines in which U.S. students, educators, and government employees are deficient in learning and in which insubstantial numbers of U.S. institutions of higher education provide training. Establishes in the Treasury the National Education Trust Fund (the Fund) to provide for such scholarships, fellowships, and grants, from the Fund's account by the Board. Requires the Board to report annually to the President and the Congress on its operations. Provides for an Executive Secretary of the Board. Authorizes the General Accounting Office to audit Board activities."
