Establishes a National Water Quality Research Committee to advise the Administrator on research activities. Requires the Committee to report annually to the Congress on: (1) research conducted in the preceding year; (2) highest priority research needs for the following five-year period; (3) planned research activities; and (4) opportunities to coordinate Federal and State research. Establishes a Water Quality Monitoring Council to ensure the coordination of Federal and State surface and groundwater quality monitoring programs. Directs the Administrator to conduct a program of research and development of methods for the control of nonpoint sources of pollution. Requires the Administrator to: (1) conduct a national survey of data regarding bottom sediment contamination; and (2) conduct a program of research and development of methods for improved remediation and control of pollution problems resulting from contaminated sediments. Directs the Administrator to conduct a program of research and investigation concerning groundwater quality. Requires the Administrator to: (1) conduct a program of research and development to improve understanding of the status and trends of ecosystems and to develop improved predictive models upon which to base standardized protocols; and (2) issue protocols based on such program for use by States in conducting water quality assessments. Requires protocols to include requirements for monitoring rivers, streams, estuaries, coastal waters, and lakes. Directs the Administrator to conduct a research technology development and demonstration program to identify and demonstrate cost-effective preventive measures for sources of pollution in complex watersheds having a mix of land use types. Requires the Adminstrator to conduct a basic research, development, and demonstration program for wetlands. Revises provisions concerning grants for research and development to require the Administrator to establish a program to demonstrate practices for the prevention and control of industrial and municipal sources of water pollution. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants or enter into contracts with persons to demonstrate such practices. Sets forth conditions for the receipt of such assistance. Requires the Administrator to publish annual solicitations for proposals to demonstrate practices which may be effective in controlling sources of water pollution. Sets forth application and approval procedures. Limits the amount of Federal funding for projects. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
