    "text": "Welfare Reform Demonstrations Act of 1992 - Title I: Changes In Welfare Policy - Amends part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) (AFDC) of title IV of the Social Security Act to provide for an increase in: (1) funding for programs under part F (Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program) (JOBS) of such title; (2) the Federal matching rate for JOBS programs; and (3) the limitation on payments to States for JOBS programs. Requires families with younger children over age one (currently, age three) to participate in AFDC programs. Authorizes the Director of the Office of Social Reform Demonstrations to grant waivers to enable certain social service providers to help individuals and families leave welfare. Specifies the Federal programs subject to such waiver authority. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise the earned income credit. Gives States the option of excluding resources (not exceeding $10,000) retained for educational, job training, or home ownership purposes from the limitation on resources used in determining AFDC eligibility. Provides that such resources shall not be taken into consideration for purposes of determining eligibility for benefits under such Federal programs. Provides for the treatment of certain resources disposed of for less than fair market value for purposes related to the AFDC program. Allows States to permit JOBS program participants to reserve such amounts of income and resources as the State agency determines necessary for attaining self-employment. Sets forth guidelines for a State to follow in disregarding income and resources for purposes of AFDC eligibility when a participant has made progress towards achieving self-employment. Requires parents to ensure that their children receive proper immunizations and well-child care and regularly attend school in order to continue to receive AFDC benefits. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to review and report to the Congress on: (1) literature on teenage sexual activity and childbearing; and (2) the relationship between early sexual activity and the contraction of sexually transmitted diseases and their effects on long-term health and reproduction. Title II: Demonstrations - Requires the Secretary to establish the Office of Welfare Reform Demonstrations to be headed by a Director. Requires the Director to: (1) select demonstration projects to be conducted by the States for testing various approaches to help AFDC recipients leave welfare and increase their financial security; (2) enter into contracts with such States for the conduct and evaluation of such projects; and (3) report to the Congress on such projects. Authorizes appropriations. Establishes the Advisory Committee on Welfare Reform to advise the Office of Welfare Reform Demonstrations. Specifies the types of demonstration projects required by this Act. Provides for optional types of demonstration projects as well."
