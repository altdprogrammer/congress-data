    "text": "Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Service Programs Act of 1992 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish and operate through September 30, 1995, a pilot program to expand and improve the provision by the Department of Veterans Affairs of benefits and services to homeless veterans. Includes within such program: (1) the establishment of up to four additional demonstration programs to be centers for the provision of such services; and (2) the placement of veterans benefits counselors at a specified number of sites at which the Secretary furnishes services to homeless mentally ill veterans and domiciliary care to homeless veterans and at centers which provide readjustment counseling. Directs the Secretary, during FY 1993 through 1995, to make grants to eligible entities for establishing new programs to furnish outreach, rehabilitative services, vocational counseling and training, and transitional housing assistance to homeless veterans. Directs the Secretary to establish criteria for the awarding of such grants. Prohibits grant funds from being used to support operational costs. Prohibits the Secretary from making a grant unless the grant applicant: (1) is a public or private nonprofit entity capable of administering such a grant; (2) has demonstrated adequate available financial support to carry out the grant project; and (3) has agreed to meet all applicable grant criteria and requirements. Prohibits the making of a grant unless the applicant agrees to: (1) provide services for which the grant is furnished at locations accessible to homeless veterans; (2) maintain referral networks for, and aid such veterans in, establishing eligibility for assistance and obtaining services under available entitlement and assistance programs; (3) ensure the confidentiality of records maintained on homeless veterans receiving services under the grants; (4) establish procedures for accounting with respect to the grant; (5) with respect to service centers, meet specified requirements concerning service hours, space for Federal agencies and other organizations, and necessary services, including job training and placement; and (6) seek to employ homeless and formerly homeless veterans in positions created for purposes of the grant. Requires the Secretary to provide per diem payments to a grant recipient for services furnished to any homeless veteran: (1) whom the Secretary has referred to the recipient; or (2) for whom the Secretary, within three working days, has authorized the provision of services. Authorizes the Secretary, in lieu of per diem payments, to provide a recipient with in-kind assistance. Permits the Secretary to inspect the facilities of any entity eligible for payments. Directs the Secretary to assign employees of the Veterans Benefits Administration to conduct outreach programs and services for homeless veterans. Authorizes the Secretary to lease to a representative of the homeless for a term in excess of three years any real property at the West Los Angeles Veterans Medical Center for which an application for its use as a homeless shelter has been approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under provisions of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. Authorizes the Secretary to lease, or lease with a purchase option (currently, only to sell) real property acquired by the Department as the result of home loan defaults for use for the homeless. Limits the term of any such lease to three years. Extends through December 31, 1995, the authority of the Secretary to sell or lease such property for such purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans to nonprofit organizations to finance the purchase of real property in order to assist homeless veterans. Directs the Secretary to establish appropriate credit standards. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) provide a low interest rate for such loans; and (2) waive the collection of any required loan fee. Directs the Secretary to report to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees annually during FY 1994 through 1996 on the implementation of this Act. Amends the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to: (1) authorize appropriations for FY 1993 through 1995 for certain homeless veterans' reintegration projects; and (2) decrease the FY 1993 authorization of appropriations for job training for the homeless. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1995."
