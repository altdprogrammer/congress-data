Title II: Congressional Employees' Civil Rights - Congressional Employees Civil Rights Act of 1992 - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide that all employees or applicants for employment in the Congress and all employees in the White House Office or the Office of the Vice President shall be afforded the same rights to be free from, and the same remedies against, employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap, or disability as those enjoyed by other employees or applicants under such Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and specified other provisions, with exceptions. Title III: Ethics in Congress - Ethics in Congress Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal judicial code to make specified officials, including Senators and Representatives, the Comptroller General, chairmen and treasurers of incumbents' reelection campaign committees, and other Senate or House officers, subject to independent counsel provisions. Amends the Federal criminal code to make congressional employees subject to Federal conflict of interest provisions. Makes: (1) exceptions where the congressional officer or employee first makes full disclosure of a personal financial interest to the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, subject to specified requirements; and (2) the \"agency granting the exemption\" such Office with respect to congressional officers and employees. Title IV: Political Activities of Congressional Employees - Political Activities of Congressional Employees Act of 1992 - Extends the ban on political activities by Government employees to congressional employees, with exceptions. Specifies that, with respect to congressional employees, certain authorities granted to the Merit Systems Protection Board shall be exercised by the General Accounting Office (GAO) Personnel Appeals Board (Board), and those granted to the Special Counsel shall be exercised by the General Counsel of such Board. Repeals a provision exempting GAO personnel from prohibitions relating to political activities. Title V: Openness in Congress - Openness in Congress Act of 1992 - Includes the Congress (other than the personal offices of any Senator or any Member of or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the House, or the leadership offices of either House), and any agency or instrumentality of the legislative branch (including GAO) within the term \"agency\" for purposes of coverage under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act, with exceptions relating to material statutorily exempt from disclosure. Requires the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate to report to the President periodically regarding access to congressional information. Specifies that authorities granted to the Special Council to enforce FOIA and Privacy Act-related provisions shall be exercised by the General Counsel of the Board. Title VI: General Provision - Specifies that wherever in this Act the Congress, a House of Congress, or a congressional office or instrumentality is authorized or required to perform rulemaking functions, such functions (unless otherwise specified) shall be exercised in each House as determined by that House, and in offices and instrumentalities not within a House as determined by the Congress."
