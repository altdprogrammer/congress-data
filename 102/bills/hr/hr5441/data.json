Establishes a program for protection and preservation of the economic and environmental resources of the Gulf, to be known as the Gulf of Mexico Program. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a Gulf of Mexico Program Office within EPA. Establishes a Gulf of Mexico Executive Board to: (1) prepare and update a joint plan for the Federal, State, interstate, local, and nongovernmental development of economic, ecological, and aesthetic resources of the Gulf and protection of the ecosystem; (2) develop long-range schedules for the collection and analysis of data and for planning and completion of projects in the Gulf and surrounding areas; and (3) approve and fund studies of economic, ecological, and aesthetic resource problems in the Gulf and surrounding areas. Sets forth required contents of the plan and requires the Administrator to submit the plan to the Congress. Provides for State cost-sharing of Gulf restoration activities. Requires the Administrator to award grants for the conduct of research to develop baseline scientific data regarding environmental quality of the Gulf for use in evaluating and implementing the plan. Authorizes grants to be awarded to any Gulf State agency, non-profit research organization, or university which meets eligibility requirements. Sets forth grant proposal, application, and cost-sharing requirements. Authorizes and allocates appropriations."
