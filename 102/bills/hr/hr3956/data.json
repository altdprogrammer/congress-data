    "text": "Oil Recycling and Safe Handling Act of 1991 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to revise provisions concerning the management of used oil. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to list as a hazardous waste any used oil and any product derived from such oil that fails to meet certain specifications for flashpoint, lead, arsenic, chromium, cadmium, halogens, and polychlorinated biphenyls. Prohibits compliance with such specifications by blending used oil with virgin oil or other materials. Permits fuel containing used oil that meets specifications without treatment to be marketed as containing ingredients that are not hazardous wastes if the oil and fuel are analyzed to demonstrate compliance. Exempts used oil generated by petroleum refining or production facilities which is to be refined along with normal process streams from requirements for hazardous waste under the Solid Waste Disposal Act if it is inserted into the refining process or production pipeline. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations for the management of used oil classified as a hazardous waste. Exempts from such regulation generators of used oil which is household waste or State or local government curbside collection programs collecting such oil. Exempts certain used oil generators and collectors from hazardous waste regulations under the Solid Waste Disposal Act (other than those under this Act) if they have: (1) recycled or burned used oil at a permitted hazardous waste management facility or have arranged for the periodic transport of such oil by a licensed transporter to a permitted facility; (2) not disposed of such oil except as provided under this Act or mixed the oil with other hazardous wastes; and (3) maintained specified records with respect to the volume of such oil. Applies standards for hazardous waste transporters and facilities to hazardous used oil transporters and facilities. Permits the modification of transporter requirements for used oil that contains less than a specified concentration of halogens. Requires hazardous used oil facilities to obtain hazardous waste management permits. Directs the Administrator to require producers and importers of lubricating base stock to guarantee the reuse of an annually increasing percentage of used lubricating oil. Requires States to encourage used oil collection by providing incentives to retailers and others who accept and collect used oil. Imposes fees on lubricating base stock sold at retail and provides for the use of such fees for State and local used oil collection efforts. Requires agencies procuring recycled goods to report on the effectiveness of the re-refined oil procurement program. Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act to prohibit any person from bringing an action against (currently, recovering response costs or damages from) service station dealers for response costs or damages resulting from releases of used (currently, recycled) oil, subject to certain conditions."
