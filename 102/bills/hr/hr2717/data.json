Authorizes the Secretary to make grants of up to $500,000 in a fiscal year to States for identifying rights-of-way, developing a plan, and implementing a program pursuant to the Act. Limits the Federal share to 80 percent. Directs the Secretary to: (1) take action as necessary to encourage State highway departments to enter into cooperative agreements with State foresters in implementing the requirements of this Act; and (2) enter into a cooperative agreement with the Chief of the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture for technical and other assistance."
