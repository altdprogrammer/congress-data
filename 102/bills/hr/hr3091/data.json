    "text": "Interstate Waste Disposal Control Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to grant State governments the authority to enact laws to regulate the disposal of solid waste that originates in other States. Specifies that such laws must include the requirement that: (1) any person desiring to transport more than 100 pounds of solid waste into a State for disposal shall submit an application for permission, including information on the volume, contents, and toxicity of such waste; (2) the State shall approve or deny an application within 60 days upon determining whether the proposed waste disposal is consistent with the applicable solid waste management plan (or, in the case of a State that is a party to an interstate compact, upon determining whether all parties to the compact agree to the proposed disposal); and (3) the State may require the owner or operator of the solid waste management facility at which the waste will be disposed to comply, at a minimum, with solid waste management standards that are at least as stringent as those of the State in which the waste originated. Authorizes States to enter into interstate compacts for efficient regional solid waste management. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to: (1) establish a reference center within the EPA to assist States in the implementation of laws enacted pursuant to this Act; and (2) compile information on, and copies of, all State laws, regulations, standards, and plans pertaining to solid waste management, and ensure that such information is readily accessible to the public."
