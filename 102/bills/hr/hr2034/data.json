Limits the Federal share payable for such construction to 75 percent. Provides that: (1) each toll bypass highway or approach constructed under this Act must be publicly owned and operated; and (2) the State highway department must enter into an agreement that all toll revenues received from the facility be used only for construction, operation, maintenance, and debt service costs of the facility, except that excess revenues may be used for construction of other transportation projects in the region. Specifies that toll mileage constructed under this Act shall not be used to increase a State's apportionment under any apportionment formula."
