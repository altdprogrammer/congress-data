    "text": "Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 - Title I: Safety and Soundness- Subtitle A: Deposit Insurance Funds - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to increase from $5,000,000,000 to $30,000,000,000 the amount of credit available from the Treasury to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Sets maximum limits upon the outstanding obligations of the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). Directs the Comptroller General to report quarterly to certain congressional committees regarding FDIC compliance with such obligation limitations. Mandates a repayment schedule as a prerequisite to any such borrowing. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a copy of such schedule to certain congressional committees and to consult with them regarding repayment terms. Authorizes the FDIC to impose special assessments upon insured depository institutions (in addition to existing assessments) if emergency assessments are required and if they are allocated between the BIF and SAIF according to their respective needs. Sets forth guidelines the BIF must follow when borrowing from its members. Subtitle B: Supervisory Reforms - Prescribes guidelines for: (1) mandatory annual on-site examinations of all insured depository institutions; and (2) fiscal status reports from all insured depository institutions (except for certain small-sized insured depository institutions). Sets forth guidelines for assessments to cover FDIC costs of conducting examinations of insured depository institutions and their affiliates. Outlines the application procedure for deposit insurance. Requires the FDIC to study and report to the Congress on ways to streamline Federal banking regulatory requirements. Subtitle C: Accounting Reforms - Mandates that: (1) the accounting principles applicable to all insured depository institutions be uniform and consistent with generally accepted accounting principles; (2) each appropriate Federal banking agency implement certain accounting principles (maintaining uniform accounting standards to use in determining compliance with statutory requirements of insured depository institutions); and (3) each appropriate Federal banking agency report annually to certain congressional committees on any differences between its accounting or capital standards and those used by other agencies. Requires each insured depository institution to include in its annual status report the total number and aggregate dollar amount of its outstanding loans to specified small businesses and farms. Exempts certain small-sized depository institutions from this requirement. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require that certain-sized large institutions engaged in interstate banking submit reports of financial conditions, including specified aspects of loan data for each State in which such institutions maintain branches. Subtitle D: Prompt Regulatory Action - Requires each appropriate Federal banking agency and the FDIC to prescribe regulations for implementation of a prompt regulatory action system which includes: (1) uniform standards; (2) minimum capital requirements; (3) deadlines for submission and review of capital restoration plans; (4) standards for safety and soundness; and (5) asset growth guidelines. Sets capital distribution restrictions for any insured depository institution which does not meet all currently applicable capital standards after making such distribution. Requires undercapitalized depository institutions to submit capital restoration plans with specified contents. Sets forth regulatory guidelines and restrictions for depository institutions according to risk categories (including the appointment of conservators or receivers for national banks and Federal savings associations not in compliance with statutory capital standards). Authorizes the FDIC Board of Directors to appoint the FDIC as sole conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution (after consultation with the appropriate Federal or State agency) after a determination that specified risk conditions have been met. Subtitle E: Least-Cost Resolution - Mandates that FDIC assistance to troubled insured depository institutions be in accord with prescribed least-cost resolution guidelines to ensure that such assistance is the least costly of all possible methods to the affected deposit insurance fund. Mandates an annual General Accounting Office (GAO) audit of the FDIC and the Resolution Trust Corporation to determine compliance with such least-cost approach. Sets forth procedural guidelines with respect to: (1) creditors' claims; (2) data collection; (3) financial services industry impact analyses before resolution of a troubled insured depository institution; and (4) financial assistance prior to appointment of a receiver of conservator. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to set forth limitations on advances by a Federal Reserve bank to an undercapitalized depository institution. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to direct the FDIC upon providing assistance to a troubled institution to: (1) remove its board of directors; and (2) treat shareholders' claims with regard to such institution as if the institution were closed. Subtitle F: Federal Insurance for State Chartered Depository Institutions - Uniform Depositor Protection Act of 1991 - Sets a deadline by which State depository institutions or credit unions must obtain deposit insurance as a prerequisite to accepting deposits. Subtitle G: Technical Corrections - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to: (1) grant the FDIC all rights, powers, and duties to implement its duties with respect to the assets and liabilities of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) Resolution Fund; and (2) declare the FDIC successor to the FSLIC as conservator or receiver of certain depository institutions. Title II: Regulatory Improvement - Subtitle A: Regulation of Foreign Banks - Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act of 1991 - Amends the International Banking Act of 1978 to prohibit a foreign bank from establishing any branch or agency in the United States without prior approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board). Outlines approval and termination procedures. Authorizes the Board to examine each branch or agency of a foreign bank or foreign entities engaged in lending practices. Mandates annual on-site examinations of such entities and outlines a coordinated examination procedure with the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC. Prohibits foreign banks from establishing representative offices without the Board's prior approval. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require a financial institution to file a consolidated report with the appropriate Federal banking agency if the credit it extends (currently, if the loan or loans it makes) to an insured depository institution is secured by 25 percent or more of any class of shares of an insured depository institution. Amends the International Banking Act of 1978 to authorize the Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision to disclose to their foreign counterparts information obtained in the course of exercising supervisory or examination authority, subject to confidentiality requirements. Sets forth a civil money penalty schedule for violations of such Act by a foreign bank. Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to declare that consideration of a bank's managerial resources by the Board includes the competence, experience, and integrity of its officers, directors, and principal shareholders. Subtitle B: Customer and Consumer Provisions - Sets a deadline by which each appropriate Federal banking agency must submit to certain congressional committees recommendations with respect to reducing paperwork and improving the administration and enforcement of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. Directs GAO to study and report to the Congress on the examination processes used by Federal banking agencies to evaluate compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977.
