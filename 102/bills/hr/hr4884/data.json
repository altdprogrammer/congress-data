Permits the FTC, during such period, to retain whatever authority it may have had prior to enactment of this Act with respect to any proposed or past transfer otherwise subject to such provision, under specified limitations, if: (1) the licensee transferring the license has a market share of at least 15 percent; (2) there is a third-tier alternative licensee; or (3) as a direct result of such transfer, one licensee would become the sole licensee for trademarked soft drinks in the relevant geographic market. Specifies that nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the authority of the Department of Justice to challenge transfers of soft drink trademark licensing contracts under the antitrust laws."
