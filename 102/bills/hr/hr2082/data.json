Establishes the Interagency Working Committee on Biological Diversity to: (1) prepare a coordinated Federal strategy for the conservation of biological diversity; and (2) issue guidance to Federal agencies regarding biodiversity impact assessment. Dissolves the Committee upon its submission of the strategy to the Congress. Sets forth required elements of the strategy. Requires the Council on Environmental Quality to identify the Federal agencies that conduct programs having a significant impact on biological diversity. Directs such agencies to: (1) review its actions and programs biennially for consistency with the Federal strategy; and (2) report the results of such reviews to the Council. Requires the Council to review such reports biennially and report to the Congress on the consistency of Federal programs with the strategy. Directs the President to establish a National Center for Biological Diversity and Conservation Research. Requires the Center to: (1) identify gaps in the understanding of biological diversity and develop a plan for filling such gaps; (2) issue grants to private institutions for projects to contribute to implementation of the plan; (3) provide information to the Interagency Committee in preparation of the Federal strategy; (4) develop a plan for the establishment of a clearinghouse; and (5) identify species and natural communities of special concern. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a biological diversity grant program for purposes of monitoring the status of plants, invertebrate organisms, terrestrial communities, and freshwater aquatic communities and species. Limits the Federal share of grant activities to 75 percent of the total cost. Requires the Secretary to identify: (1) the types of natural communities native to the United States; (2) the types of communities that do not occur in at least three protected areas of sufficient size to maintain populations of the species of plants and animals associated with such communities; (3) the types of communities that are especially rich in terms of the number of native species they contain; and (4) the location on Federal lands of communities identified under (2) and (3). Directs the Secretary to issue regulations establishing requirements for considering areas of lands to be protected areas for purposes of this Act. Prohibits lands from being considered as protected areas unless the lands are: (1) managed primarily for the purpose of maintaining viable populations of native plants and animals and self-sustaining natural communities; and (2) subject to permanent land use restrictions to ensure the protection of such plants, animals, and communities. Requires Federal agency heads to consult with the Secretary regarding the management actions necessary to maintain natural communities on Federal lands identified under this Act and to ensure the long-term sustainability of such communities. Authorizes appropriations."
