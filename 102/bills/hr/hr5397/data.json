Deems a barge not to to be abandoned if: (1) it is located at a federally- or State-approved mooring area; (2) it is on private property with the property owner's permission; or (3) the owner or operator notifies the Secretary of Transportation of the barge's location and that the barge is not abandoned. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) assess a civil penalty for violations of this Act; and (2) remove a barge that has been abandoned. Declares that the United States shall not be liable for damages resulting from such removal. Makes the owner or operator of an abandoned barge liable for expenses incurred by the United States in removing it. Declares that barge removal contractors and subcontractors are not liable for damages resulting from such removal, except in certain circumstances. Requires undocumented barges weighing 100 gross tons operating on U.S. navigable waters to be numbered."
