    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-09-22", 
    "text": "National American Youth Service Act - Title I: Imposition and Term of Mandatory National Service Obligation - Imposes an obligation to perform at least 1,000 hours of national service on each individual who: (1) is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident; and (2) attains age 18 on or after October 1, 1995. Allows commencement of such service upon the individual's attaining age 18, but requires completion before the individual attains age 26. Provides that prior service shall not be counted if performed before October 1, 1995, or before registration as a participant under this Act. Provides for prorated amounts of service for new citizens and permanent residents after age 18 and before age 26. Requires registration with the local national service board within 90 days after the participant attains age 18 (or after naturalization or attainment of permanent resident status). Allows advanced registration at any time after age 16. Sets forth the types of national service to satisfy the obligation, including: (1) service as a (tax free) one dollar-per hour volunteer with an accredited sponsor organization or a Federal volunteer program established by a Federal agency pursuant to task force or identification; (2) service with the existing programs of the Peace Corps, the National Volunteer Antipoverty Program (VISTA, student community service programs, and special volunteer programs), the Urban Elementary School Literacy Corps, the American Conservation and Youth Corps and other programs of the Commission on National and Community Service, and the National Health Service Corps; (3) employment as a law enforcement officer or firefighter for at least two years before attaining age 26; (4) service in the armed forces (unless the member is separated under adverse conditions before attaining age 26); and (5) participation in the Job Corps or a job training program for the economically disadvantaged under the Job Training Partnership Act or a comparable State job training program (such participation counting toward the service obligation only if the participant successfully completes training). Makes individuals who fail to register or complete the national service obligation ineligible for: (1) appointment to a position in a Federal agency; (2) the Medicare program; (3) Federal old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits; (4) any student grant, loan, or work assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965; (5) student assistance under the Public Health Service Act; and (6) job training and employment assistance under the Job Training Partnership Act. Requires inclusion of an appeals process under rules to implement such eligibility requirements and to verify individual compliance with registration and service obligations. Provides for exemptions and deferments on the basis of unfitness to serve. Provides for temporary hardship deferments. Title II: Administration of National Service - Establishes in the executive branch and Office of National Service (ONS) to regulate and oversee registration and performance of national service participants. Requires ONS to be supervised by a Director appointed by the President, by and with Senate advice and consent. Requires ONS to be fully operational by October 1, 1995. Establishes a task force on national service (the task force), which shall consist of the Director and a representative of each Executive department. Requires the task force to: (1) identify existing opportunities in the Federal Government for volunteer services performance; (2) consider methods to expand opportunities for national service participants to satisfy their obligations through federally-operated programs; and (3) report to the President and the Congress within nine months after enactment of this Act. Requires the Director to: (1) establish a system to track and record national service performance by participants; (2) consider the feasibility of using Selective Service System personnel and facilities and certain Internal Revenue Code statement and records for such purpose; (3) notify each participant upon completion of the service obligation; and (4) carry out other duties relating to information services, promotion, and consultation. Requires the Director to establish a network, consisting of a State national service office for each State and a local national service board for each congressional district, to: (1) register participants; (2) assist participants to find and perform national service in satisfaction of their obligation; and (3) approve sponsor organizations. Authorizes the Director, with the cooperation of the Director of Selective Service, to use State headquarters and local boards of the Selective Service System as part of the network. Requires each State office and local board in the network to: (1) disseminate information on registration and national service obligations; (2) provide information and counseling to participants on service opportunities; and (3) investigate complaints between participants and sponsor organizations. Sets forth application procedures for nonprofit organizations to serve as sponsor organizations for national service participants in a State. Sets forth accreditation agreement requirements for such organizations. Requires the State office to establish and maintain a directory of accredited sponsor organizations. Requires that the actual selection of a participant to perform service with a sponsor organization be left to that organization's discretion. Authorizes appropriations for titles I and II. Title III: Miscellaneous National Service Programs - Amends the National and Community Service Act of 1990 to authorize appropriations to the Commission on National and Community Service for grants under the American Conservation and Youth Service Corps program. Amends the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 to extend the authorization of appropriations for the Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program. Increases the minimum number of years of VISTA volunteer service (including training and other support) for which funds must be made available first from appropriations for National Volunteer Antipoverty Programs for specified fiscal years. Amends the Peace Corps Act to authorize appropriations to carry out the Peace Corps program. Requires the President to endeavor to maintain a minimum Peace Corps enrollment of at least specified numbers of volunteers for specified fiscal years. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to establish the Urban Elementary School Literacy Corps (UESLC) to recruit, select, train, and assign volunteers to provide individual attention and instruction in reading and writing to first and second grade students in urban elementary schools. Sets forth UESLC program requirements for qualifying schools and volunteers, volunteer assignment and placement, terms and conditions of service, stipends, allowances and support services, notice and acceptance of terms and conditions, grievance procedures, and legal expenses. Sets forth requirements for UESLC preservice training, including support and allowances, and direct administrative authority or grants and contracts to various entities to carry out such training. Sets forth special limitations relating to UESLC volunteer activities, support costs, government assistance, and nondiscrimination. Makes Federal law relating to Federal employees inapplicable to UESLC volunteers, except as specifically provided in this Act for purposes of specific Federal laws, for credit in connection with subsequent employment in the Federal Government, and for eligibility for appointment to the competitive service in the same manner as Peace Corps volunteers. Authorizes appropriations for UESLC program. Requires the Secretary to establish the UESLC program within two years after enactment of this Act. Amends specified Federal law relating to Federal employees compensation for work injuries and civil service retirement to include provisions for UESLC volunteers. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide for cancellation of certain student loans because of service as a UESLC volunteer. Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to credit towards Foreign Service retirement any service as a UESLC volunteer. Amends the Public Health Service Act to allow a deferment of repayment of certain health education assistance while a borrower is in service as a UESLC volunteer."
