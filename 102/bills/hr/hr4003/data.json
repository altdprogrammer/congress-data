    "text": "Procurement and Contract Administration Integrity Act - Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to revise provisions suspended by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 governing the conduct of certain individuals involved in procurement-related activities. Repeals certain conflict-of-interest restrictions. Applies: (1) existing prohibitions relating to proprietary and source selection information to cases occurring prior to the award, modification, or extension of a contract; (2) existing prohibitions relating to gratuities and employment discussions to cases occurring during the administration by a covered contractor of a Federal agency contract for property or services; and (3) current restrictions resulting from procurement activities of procurement officials to such activities occurring during the period ending one year after such an official's separation from Federal Service. Sets forth new contractor reporting requirements. Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that the terms \"officer or employee\" and \"special Government employee\" shall include enlisted members of the armed forces under conflict of interest provisions concerning the following: (1) compensation to Members of Congress, officers, and others in matters affecting the Government; (2) activities of officers and employees in claims against and other matters affecting the Government; (3) restrictions on former officers, employees, and elected officials of the executive and legislative branches; (4) acts affecting a personal financial interest; (5) the salary of Government officials and employees being payable only by the United States; and (6) the voiding of transactions in violation of such Federal criminal code provisions. Repeals the following provisions suspended by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989: (1) provisions of the Department of Energy Organization Act regarding postemployment prohibitions and associated reporting requirements for former supervisors and violations of such provisions considered in deciding the outcome of Department proceedings; (2) miscellaneous procurement requirements relating to private employment contracts between certain Department of Defense (DOD) procurement officials and defense contractors and certain former DOD procurement officials and the limitations on their employment by contractors; and (3) Federal criminal code provisions imposing restrictions on retired military officers in certain matters affecting the Government. Repeals certain procurement provisions regarding reporting requirements for employees and former employees of defense contractors and requirements for defense contractors regarding former DOD officials."
