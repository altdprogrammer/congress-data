Requires that any project be designed and carried out so as to provide for a valid analysis of whether the research variables affect women or minorities differently than other subjects. Directs the Secretary to establish within the advisory council of each agency of an institute and ADAMHA a Clinical Research Equity Subcommittee to review all clinical research of that agency to determine whether it is being conducted in accordance with requirements of this Act. Provides for suspension or revocation of the authority for any project which the Secretary determines is not being conducted in accordance with those requirements. Defines \"minority groups\" to mean racial and ethnic minority groups. Requires that the technical and scientific peer review process in the institutes and ADAMHA include an evaluation of the inclusion of women and minority groups as research subjects."
