    "text": "Immigration Amendments of 1992 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to repeal the sunset date for certain retired international organization officers and employees (G-4 visa holders) to file for special immigrant status. Grants special immigrant status to certain immigrant employees of the United States Information Agency (USIA) having essential foreign language skills. Limits such entrants to at most 150 in FY 1993, and at most 50 in each subsequent fiscal year. Waives the two-year foreign residence requirement for such aliens. Grants nonimmigrant status to an alien coming to work for USIA if: (1) he or she has essential language skills; and (2) no other qualified workers can be found in the United States. Limits: (1) such annual entrants to not more than 50; and (2) their period of authorized status to not more than five years. Provides with regard to foreign adopted children that: (1) the child does not have to be adopted abroad by a U.S. citizen; and (2) the child may be up to 18 years old (current maximum age is 16 years old). Revises the definition of orphan for such purposes. Provides for the adoption of children from foreign states which are certified by the Secretary of State as having met specified standards concerning the adoption of children for placement abroad. Amends Federal law to establish a criminal penalty for a U.S. citizen or national who purchases an alien child with the intent to establish U.S. permanent residency for such child. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide permanent resident status for refugees admitted into the United States as of their date of U.S. arrival. Repeals P.L. 89-732 (Cuban refugee status adjustment)."
