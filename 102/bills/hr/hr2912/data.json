    "text": "National Teacher Recruitment and Training Act of 1991 - Title I: Loans Incentives for Teaching - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to establish a separate fund for teachers under the National Direct Student Loan (NDSL) program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1996 for the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to make separate capital contributions to NDSL student loan funds. Requires a student, in order to receive a loan from the special account, to: (1) have completed two undergraduate years; (2) intend to pursue a teaching career; and (3) agree to certain repayment conditions if the student either does not enter full-time teaching within a certain period or ceases such teaching before the end of the five-year service period required for loan cancellation. Gives priority for such loans to: (1) minority students, or those otherwise underrepresented in the teaching profession or curricula areas; (2) individuals demonstrating an interest in working in early childhood development; (3) individuals demonstrating an interest in working in special education teaching, related services, and early intervention; (4) individuals demonstrating an interest in pursuing a career in providing school-based teaching or counseling aimed at resolving conflicts and/or assisting persons who have been exposed to and affected by community violence; and (5) individuals who qualify and need such a loan and who demonstrate high academic achievement and potential for success in teaching. Provides for an expedited loan cancellation option for teaching at certain types of schools. Title II: Financial Assistance for Institutional Recruitment and Retention of Individuals Preparing to Enter the Teaching Force - Directs the Secretary to make grants to institution of higher education for programs to recruit and retain undergraduate and graduate students, particularly minority or other underrepresented students, preparing to enter: (1) the teaching profession; (2) employment in early childhood development programs; and (3) a career in providing school-based teaching and counseling aimed at resolving conflicts and/or assisting persons who have been exposed to and affected by community violence. Sets forth requirements for applications, plans, use of funds, selection procedures for institutional awards, grant duration, and amount, and reports and evaluation. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1996 to carry out this title."
