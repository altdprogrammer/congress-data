    "text": "Indian Environmental Assistance Program Act - Title I: Indian Environmental Integrated Assistance - Authorizes the Administrator (Administrator) of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make a single integrated environment program award to an Indian tribe. Prohibits the amount of a consolidated grant from being less than the aggregate sum of all grants consolidated. Authorizes the Indian tribe receiving such consolidated grant to determine the proportion of its proceeds to be allocated among the pertinent programs. Authorizes the Administrator, with regard to such integrated assistance awards, to: (1) waive any matching funds or written application or reporting requirements; and (2) adjust any maintenance or level of effort requirements. Title II: General Assistance Program - Directs the Administrator to establish an Indian Environmental General Assistance Program to provide grants to eligible Indian tribal governments or intertribal consortia for planning, development, and establishing environmental protection programs on Indian lands. Establishes an annual minimum general assistance grant of $75,000. Prohibits such a grant from exceeding more than ten percent of the funds appropriated under this Act. Allows the term of any such grant to exceed one year. Authorizes an Indian tribal government or intertribal consortium to receive a general assistance grant for a maximum of four years in each specific media area. Declares that the award of such grant shall not result in reduction of EPA grants for environmental program to such tribal government or consortium. Permits the receipt of individual media grants or cooperative agreements. Includes the development and implementation of solid and hazardous waste programs for Indian lands among the purposes of such assistance. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Authority to Grant State Status to Indian Tribes for Enforcement of Solid Waste Disposal Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize the Administrator to grant State status to qualifying Indian tribes for purposes of enforcing such Act on Indian lands. Authorizes related Indian-State cooperative agreements. Directs the Administrator to: (1) undertake an inventory of tribal hazardous waste and solid waste open dump sites; and (2) assist in the upgrading of open dump facilities."
