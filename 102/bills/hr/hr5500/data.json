Requires national and authorizes State minimum standards to assure service quality. Defines a comprehensive health service organization (CHSO) as an organization that, in return for a capitated amount, furnishes, arranges for, or pays for a full range of health services to a population in a specified service area.

Subtitle B: Payments by States to Providers - Requires direct payment by a State program to institutions and facilities for operating expenses under an approved negotiated annual prospective global budget.

Entitles every independent health care practitioner to payment for the provision of covered services either, at the practitioner's election, by a fee-for-service method or a capitation method. Allows a State program, through an agreement with an organization representative of independent practitioners or otherwise, to pay individual practitioners through an annual salary, hourly payments, or other method under which aggregate payments do not exceed the amounts that would otherwise be made.

Mandates determination by the State program of the amount of payment for other covered services in accordance with payment methodologies specified by the Board. Requires the Board to establish, in addition to payment otherwise provided in this title, model payment methodologies and other incentives that promote the provision of services in medically underserved areas. Authorizes the Board to waive required payment methodologies as necessary to allow alternative payment schemes or conduct experiments and demonstration projects. Subtitle C: Malpractice Reform - Authorizes the Board to award grants to State programs for the development and implementation of programs for medical malpractice reforms. Authorizes appropriations.

Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle D: Mandatory Assignment and Administrative Provisions - Declares that payments for benefits under this Act constitutes payment in full, requires the furnishing entity to accept the payment as such, and prohibits the entity from accepting any payment other than from the State program, except for authorizd cost-sharing.

Requires a State program to establish: (1) a timely and administratively simple procedure for reimbursement to all providers under this Act; and (2) an appeals process regarding provider payments. Title VI: Financing - Creates the National Health Insurance Trust Fund. Appropriates to the Fund all: (1) tax increases from this Act; and (2) amounts that would otherwise have been appropriated to carry out titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act, the Federal employees health benefit program, and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS). Transfers to the Fund any amounts remaining in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund or the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. Directs the Secretary of the Tresury to: (1) develop a formula for determining and collecting National Health Insurance premiums from individuals and employers to finance covered services; (2) determine the aggregate premiums for each taxable year; and (3) collect premiums from individuals using a formula with specified characteristics, including that it be income-based and progressive. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to collect the premiums from employers by: (1) increasing the highest marginal corporate income tax rate; (2) increasing the employer and self-employment hospital insurance tax; and (3) imposing a surtax on regular and minimum taxes. Declares that such taxes shall be increased as specified by the Secretary. Mandates a method for employers to pay premiums otherwise payable by employees. Amends Internal Revenue Code provisions relating to exclusions from gross income to define \"accident or health insurance\" to mean an approved State program under this Act. Removes provisions relating to amounts paid to highly compensated individuals under a discriminatory self-insured medical expense reimbursement plan. Disallows deductions for employer expenses for health care services, whether or not covered under this Act. Declares that this does not disallow a deduction for National Health Care premiums. Allows health insurance costs (currently, 25 percent of health insurance costs) of self-employed individuals to be deducted. Removes provisions ending the deductibility on a specified date. Defines \"medical care,\" for provisions relating to individual deductions for medical and dental expenses, to mean National Health Insurance premiums, cost-sharing, and other premiums for coverage under a State program. Ends, after a specified date, the health insurance credit for coverage which includes at least one child. Makes each State responsible for establishing a financing program for the implementation of the State program. Entitles each State with a State program approved by the Board to funding from the Board in the amounts provided under specified provisions of this Act. Title VII: Promotion of Primary Health Care; Development of Health Service Capacity; Programs to Assist the Medically Underserved - Subtitle A: Promotion and Expansion of Primary Care Practitioners - Makes the Board responsible for certain activities toward a national goal of having, ten years after enactment of this Act, 50 percent of the physicians in medical residency programs being trained as primary care physicians, including coordinating graduate medical education policies and overseeing State program residency expenditures. Requires the Board to establish a method of applying the national goal to program goals for each medical residency program. Provides for enforcement, against State programs that fail to meet the goal, through reducing: (1) medical residency payments; and (2) the indirect portion of extramural biomedical and behavioral research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Requires the Board to provide for an Advisory Committee on Graduate Medical Education. Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish in NIH the Office of Primary Care and Prevention Research.

Authorizes appropriations. Part 2: Reduction in Medical Malpractice Liability for Community Health Centers - Includes entities receiving Federal funds under provisions relating to migrant health centers, community health centers, health services for the homeless, or (as added by this Act) grants for expansion of the availability of primary care services (and officers, employees, or contractors of such entities who are licensed health care practitioners) in the coverage of provisions regulating civil actions for injury resulting from medical or related functions against commissioned officers or employees of the Public Health Service. Subrogates to the United States any insurance claim such an entity or person has. Prohibits grants under such provisions unless the applicant has: (1) implemented policies and procedures to assure against malpractice; and (2) reviewed the professional credentials, claims history, and other information regarding its licensed health care practitioners; and (3) no history of claims against it under such provisions relating to officers and employees of the Public Health Service, or has cooperated with the Attorney General in defending against such claims and has taken corrective action. Empowers the Attorney General, if certain conditions are met, to determine that an individual practitioner shall not be deemed a Public Health Service employee for purposes of these provisions. Prohibits hospitals from denying admitting privileges to an otherwise qualified health care provider who is an officer, employee, or contractor of such an entity. Mandates withholding from the amounts appropriated for such entities an annual estimate of the amount of all claims under provisions relating to such civil actions. Subtitle C: Expansions in the National Health Service Corps - Authorizes appropriations for: (1) the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program for physician and midlevel practitioner placements at entities receiving grants for expansion of the availability of primary care services; and (2) a number of contracts (for such repayments and scholarships under the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program) sufficient to ensure the placement of a specified number of additional primary care physicians and a specified percentage increase in midlevel practitioners in health professional shortage areas.
