    "text": "Directs the establishment of an international research, development, and production center at the Hanford Reservation in Richland, Washington, to be known as the Research Reactor User Complex (RRC). Allows the RRC to enter into agreements with non-Federal entities, including foreign governments and entities, or a consortium of such entities, for use of the RRC relating to production of isotopes, irradiation services, and steam. Allows assessment of charges from those entities as necessary. Limits the agreements to 25 years. Allows the agreement to: (1) include a termination provision requiring the payment of the unamortized balance of certain facilities in some circumstances; and (2) authorize the use, to make the repayments, of funds made available for operating expenses. Allows, in entering into an agreement, the use of procedures other than competitive procedures as described in specified provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. Requires any entity under contract to operate the RRC to operate the Fast Flux Test Facility pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act and to meet other requirements. Establishes in the Treasury the RRC Fund to consist of all amounts received under the assessments under this Act. Authorizes the use of Fund amounts to offset RRC operating costs."
