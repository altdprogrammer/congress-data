    "text": "Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) transfer specified Federal lands in the county of Clear Creek, Colorado; and (2) file maps and legal descriptions of the Federal lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management in such county with specified congressional committees. Requires that: (1) the acreage and legal descriptions of such lands to be transferred to non-Federal owners be determined to the Secretary's satisfaction; and (2) the cost of additional surveys required by the Secretary be borne by such non-Federal owners. Directs the Secretary to transfer specified Federal lands to the U.S. Forest Service, to be added to the Arapaho National Forest, subject to valid existing rights. Requires the Secretary to transfer specified Federal lands to: (1) the town of Silver Plume, Colorado; (2) the town of Georgetown, Colorado; (3) the county of Clear Creek, Colorado; and (4) the State of Colorado. Makes such transfers subject to valid existing rights, a reservation with respect to mineral rights, and the requirement that such lands be used only for recreation and public purposes. Directs the Secretary to transfer specified other Federal lands to the county of Clear Creek, Colorado, subject to valid existing rights and a reservation with respect to mineral rights. Bars the Secretary from transferring such lands until the county develops an implementation plan, to the Secretary's satisfaction, under which the county agrees to: (1) identify and protect access routes and important resource values on such lands, including threatened or endangered species, and historic and cultural resources; and (2) identify the portion of such lands that the county intends to sell and require that 50 percent of the net proceeds of the sale of any portion of such lands be expended by the county for parks, open space, historical preservation, historical interpretation, or environmental education."
