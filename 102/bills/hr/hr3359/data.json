Proscribes geothermal exploration or development activity on non-Federal lands, waters, or interests within a 15-mile radius of the Park's boundaries in Montana and Wyoming until 180 days after receipt by certain congressional committees of: (1) a study of the impact of potential geothermal development on the thermal features of the Park; and (2) a certification and copy of the laws by the Governor of the State in which the affected lands are located that it has enacted laws regulating geothermal activities and resources in a manner which protects the thermal features of the Park. Prohibits geothermal exploration or development activity on non-federally-owned lands, waters or interests, in the Corwin Springs Known Geothermal Resource Area (Montana) until 180 days after the Governor of Montana has transmitted such certification. Directs the Secretary of the Interior (in conjunction with certain entities) to conduct, and submit to the Congress by a specified deadline, a study on the impact of potential geothermal development on the thermal features of the Park. Declares that the existence and extent of property rights shall be based on the laws of the State in which the resource is located. Confers exclusive, original jurisdiction of any action alleging the taking of property as a result of this Act, without regard to the amount claimed, upon the Federal district court where the property in dispute is located. Declares that the United States shall pay just compensation should the court determine that a taking within the meaning of the Constitution has occured. Authorizes appropriations."
