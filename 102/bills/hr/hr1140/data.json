    "text": "Energy Price and Supply Information Act of 1991 - Directs the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy to conduct and publish weekly surveys on a national, State, and PADD (Petroleum Administration Defense District) basis during each winter season with respect to: (1) home heating fuel; (2) natural gas; and (3) automotive fuel. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish recommended adequate inventory levels for home heating fuel, natural gas and automotive fuel on a national, State, and PADD basis. Requires the Secretary to: (1) notify the Congress, the President, and State energy offices before October 1 of each year whether such inventory levels will be met for the winter heating season; and (2) make recommendations for legislative and administrative actions necessary to restore inadequate inventories if they fall below the recommended levels. Requires the Secretary to report the results of a study of the effect of interruptible natural gas contracts on the demand and supply of home heating fuel during the 1989-1990 winter heating season."
