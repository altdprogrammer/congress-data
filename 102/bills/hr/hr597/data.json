Prohibits such State plan from being approved unless the Commissioner of the Administration on Aging approves such statement and such demonstration. Requires such State plan to provide assurances that special efforts will be made to provide technical assistance to minority service providers. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1995 for the purpose of making grants to States for supportive activities for volunteer workers who provide in-home services to frail older individuals. Directs the Commissioner to carry out a program for making such grants."
