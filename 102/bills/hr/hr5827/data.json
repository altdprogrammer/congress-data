Prohibits the Secretary or any other Federal agency or officer from approving or issuing any permit for, or providing any assistance for, the construction of any new dam, reservoir, or impoundment on any segment of North St. Vrain Creek or its tributaries within the boundaries of the Park or on the main stem of the creek downstream to the point at which it crosses the elevation 6500 feet above mean sea level. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to prevent the issuance of any permit for the construction of a new water gaging station on the Creek at the point of its confluence with Coulson Gulch. Title II: Land Exchange - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to pursue negotiations with Longmont, Colorado, concerning the city's proposed exchange of lands located in and near Coulson Gulch for Federal lands. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress biennially on the progress of such negotiations."
