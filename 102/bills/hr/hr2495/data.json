    "text": "Teacher Leadership Act of 1991 - Title I: Teacher Recruitment - Part A: University Partnerships for Classroom Leadership - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to create University Partnerships for Classroom Leadership. Authorizes the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to make grants to qualifying institutions (including institutions with large enrollments of minority or disadvantaged and historically Black colleges or universities) to establish partnerships with local education agencies (LEAs) to support: (1) mentorship or tutoring programs; (2) cultural, recreational, or athletic activities; (3) programs of college students as teacher aides; (4) seminars or workshops to advise college students about child development, child psychology, teaching methods, or the teaching profession; and (5) other appropriate activities to establish a presence of minority role models in the classroom or encourage minority students to enter the teaching field. Requires equitable distribution of such grants throughout the Nation and among a variety of communities. Permits the use of grant funds for: (1) training of college students and professors and school teachers; (2) instructional or curriculum materials; (3) transportation or incidental costs associated with participation; and (4) any other appropriate expenses of planning, implementing, or operating the partnership with the LEA. Authorizes appropriations. Part B: Community Partnerships for Classroom Leadership - Creates a National Mini Corps Program for higher education institution partnerships with the migrant community. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to such institutions to establish partnerships to provide certain migrant college students with training to help them serve as student or teacher role models, links to the community, and tutors and teachers of migrant children. Provides for equitable distribution of grants. Allows the use of grant funds for program planning, implementation, and operation, but limits the portion that may be used for administrative expenses. Authorizes appropriations. Part C: National Job Bank for Teacher Recruitment Study and Demonstration - Establishes a National Job Bank for Teacher Recruitment. Directs the Secretary, through the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), to study the feasibility of establishing: (1) a clearinghouse to operate a national teacher job bank; and (2) regional clearinghouses. Directs the Secretary, through OERI, to contract with one or more State entities, nonprofit organizations, or higher education institutions to pay the Federal share of costs of establishing a Teacher Job Bank Clearinghouse to help: (1) public and private education agencies locate qualified applicants for teaching-related positions; and (2) individuals locate teaching-related jobs or training necessary to enter the teaching profession. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Broadening the Diversity of Skills and Expertise of Teachers - Part A: Business Partnerships for Classroom Leadership - Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to LEAs to establish model partnerships with business community representatives to sponsor programs for: (1) local business representatives to work with teachers to provide supplementary instruction in the classroom; (2) classroom teacher internships working in local businesses to gain practical experience or new skills or expertise; (3) local business representatives to work with school administrators to develop instructional material; and (4) other appropriate activities for forming a working relationship between business and classroom leaders. Provides for equitable distribution of grants. Gives priority to partnerships focusing on mathematics or science expertise of classroom teachers, particularly at the elementary level. Allows awards only to partnerships of sufficient size and scope to be models. Allows use of funds for partnership planning, implementation, and operation, but limits the portion which may be used for administrative costs. Authorizes appropriations. Part B: Teacher Certification and Licensure - Establishes Standards for Teacher Certification programs to provide Federal support and technical assistance to States to: (1) review their teacher certification and licensure requirements; and (2) determine what new standards or alternative routes need to be developed. Directs the Secretary to make State allotments based on population of children ages five through 17. Directs the Secretary to reserve a portion of funds to provide technical assistance to States which are developing new standards or alternative routes for teacher certification and licensure. Allows States to use assistance for review of existing standards and development of new standards and alternative routes for teacher certification and licensure. Allows States to carry out such activities directly or through grants to appropriate agencies, institutions, or organizations. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Innovations in the Practice of Teaching - Part A: CLASS (Classroom Leaders Assisting Students to Succeed) Academies - Replaces professional development resource centers for teachers with CLASS (Classroom Leaders Assisting Students to Succeed) Academies. Directs the Secretary to award grants to LEAs, State educational agencies, higher education institutions, private management organizations, or nonprofit organizations, or consortia of such entities, to establish and operate a CLASS Academy in each State. Requires that special consideration in awarding grants be given to entities receiving Leadership in Educational Administration Development assistance which can meet specified requirements. Sets forth grantee obligations and general criteria for grants. Requires each grant to be for five years, with possible renewal for one additional five-year period. Allows the use of grant funds for: (1) developing and implementing preservice and in-service training programs and professional development activities for prospective and practicing teachers, including summer institutes; (2) providing support services, consultation, and technical assistance for school-based training and professional development activities; (3) disseminating information about Academy programs and the latest research findings on teaching and learning; and (4) other appropriate expenses related to development and implementation of teacher programs and activities and Academy operation. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary, from appropriations for this part for FY 1992 or any succeeding fiscal year, to make available a necessary amount for establishing and operating a CLASS Academy in each State. Sets the non-Federal matching amount at 25 percent of the award to a grantee in FY 1992, and 50 percent in succeeding fiscal years. Part B: Research, Evaluation, and Dissemination - Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to and contracts with higher education institutions and other public or private organizations for research and evaluation of alternative teaching strategies, including ones designed to reach particular student populations (such as those who are disadvantaged or who have disabilities or limited English proficiency), and innovative programs for teacher education and training. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary, through the National Diffusion Network, to disseminate information and technical assistance with respect to alternative teaching strategies to LEAs, higher education institutions' teacher training programs, and CLASS Academies. Authorizes appropriations."
