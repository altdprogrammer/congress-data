Authorizes such carriers during the moratorium period to elect to have on file tariffs stating the rate for the transportation or service and charge any lesser rate up to and including the filed rate. Suspends specified penalty and rate violation provisions of Federal law for the duration of the moratorium. Requires the Interstate Commerce Commission to collect, and report to the Congress and specified Federal agencies, information on the impact of this Act upon the motor common carrier of property industry."
