    "date": "1991-10-02", 
    "text": "Defense Production Act Amendments of 1991 - Title I: Amendments to the Defense Production Act of 1950 - Part A: Declaration of Policy - Revises the declaration of policy under the Defense Production Act of 1950 to state that such Act affords the President an array of authorities to shape defense preparedness programs and to take appropriate steps to maintain and enhance the defense industrial and technological base (the defense base). States that domestic energy supplies used in support of the defense base should be augmented to the maximum extent possible through reliance on renewable fuels and energy conservation measures. Provides that the geographic dispersal of U.S. industrial facilities should seek to include economically depressed areas, rural counties experiencing job loss, and Indian reservations with severe health and employment problems. Requires executive agencies and departments responsible for defense acquisition to continuously assess the capability of the defense base to satisfy peacetime requirements as well as increased mobilization production requirements. States that plans and programs to carry out the policy stated above shall duly consider the promotion of efficiency and competition. Expresses certain congressional findings disapproving the growing U.S. dependence on foreign sources for critical components and materials used to manufacture major weapons systems for our national defense. States that it is imperative for the United States to preserve and strengthen its industrial and technological capabilities. Part B: Amendments to Title I of the Defense Production Act - Directs the President to: (1) identify critical components essential for the execution of the national security strategy of the United States in peacetime and during graduated mobilization; and (2) take appropriate actions to protect against unreliable sources for critical components. Requires critical components to be identified for all items on the CINC Critical Items List. Requires the Department of Defense to take into account all components identified as critical by a national security assessment or presidential determination under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Directs the President, in providing assistance to authorized defense contractors and subcontractors, to provide a strong preference for small businesses: (1) as defined by the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA); and (2) located in areas of high unemployment or in areas that demonstrate a continuing pattern of economic decline. Directs the President, in considering applicants for the purchase or lease of advance manufacturing equipment, to provide a strong preference for smaller subcontractors that have obtained the recommendation of: (1) an agency of the Department of Defense (DOD); or (2) the Secretary of Commerce or the Administrator of the SBA and have arranged to obtain management assistance services in connection with the installation of the equipment. States that nothing in this Act shall be interpreted to: (1) provide for the imposition of wage or price controls without prior authorization by a joint resolution of the Congress; or (2) require action or compliance by any private person to assist in the production of, or other involvement in, chemical or biological warfare capabilities unless authorized by the President. Part C: Amendments to Title III of the Defense Production Act - Expands the existing loan guarantee authority of the President to include providing such authority for the procurement of industrial resources or a critical technology item for the national defense. Increases from $25,000,000 to $50,000,000 the maximum loan guarantee amount that may be made before a specific authorization by law is needed. Makes the same changes for loans made to private business enterprises under such Act. Authorizes the President to provide for purchases or purchase commitments for an industrial resource or a critical technology item for Government use or resale. (Currently, such purchases or purchase commitments are permitted for the purchase of metals, minerals, and other material.) Prohibits the President from executing a contract for purchases or purchase commitments unless: (1) the industrial resource or critical technology is essential to the national defense; (2) U.S. industry cannot reasonably provide such resource or technology in a timely manner; or (3) U.S. national defense demand and foreseeable nondefense demand for the resource or technology is equal to or greater than the output of domestic industrial capability determined to be available for national defense. Increases from $25,000,000 to $50,000,000 the maximum industrial resource shortfall authorized to be reached by the President before a specific authorization by law is required. Waives such requirements: (1) during periods of war or national emergency; or (2) upon a determination by the President that a specific guarantee is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability. Waives such requirements with respect to loan guarantees and loans to private business enterprises during periods of national emergency declared by the Congress or the President. Extends the term for purchases or purchase commitments from September 30, 1995, to a date not more than ten years from the date such purchase, commitment, or sale was initially made. Authorizes the President to make provision for the development of substitutes for the production readiness of critical technology products and processes when he determines that it will aid the national defense. Establishes in the Treasury the Defense Production Act Fund to carry out the purposes of title III of such Act. Establishes a maximum Fund balance. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to designate a Fund manager to manage such Fund and report to the Congress annually on Fund activities. Provides for the determination of liabilities against the Fund. Transfers a specified amount to such Fund from the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund. Requires any individuals involved in the operation or oversight of the Fund to report annually to the Secretaries of Defense and Commerce, disclosing personal income information as well as possible conflict-of-interests information. States that it shall be the policy of the Congress that: (1) no agency of the United States shall encourage or commit U.S. firms to any offset arrangement in connection with the sale of defense goods or services to foreign governments; (2) Government funds shall not be used to finance offsets in security assistance transactions except under specified procedures; (3) nothing in this Act shall prevent U.S. agencies from fulfilling obligations incurred through international agreements entered into prior to enactment of this Act; (4) the decision whether to engage in offsets and in negotiating and implementing offset arrangements lies with the companies involved; and (5) the President may approve exceptions to such policy after receiving the recommendation of the National Security Council. Directs the Secretary of Defense to lead an interagency team to consult with foreign nations on limiting the adverse effects of offsets on defense procurement and to report to specified congressional committees. Requires the Secretary of Commerce (currently, the President) to prepare a report on the impact of offsets on the defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness, employment, and trade of the United States, as required under the Defense Production Act of 1950. Provides that if a U.S. firm enters into a contract for the sale of a weapon system or defense-related item to a foreign country or foreign firm and such contract is subject to an offset agreement exceeding $5,000,000, such firm shall furnish to a designated defense official information concerning such sale. Provides for the protection of confidential information provided to such defense official. Outlines information to be included in the reports prepared by the Department of Commerce. Requires findings and recommendations contained in such reports to be considered by representatives of the United States during bilateral and multilateral negotiations aimed at minimizing the adverse effects of offsets. States as a purpose of the Defense Production Act of 1950 the creation of production capacity that will remain economically viable after guarantees and other assistance provided under such Act have expired. Amends such Act to direct the President to take necessary action to ensure that all materials manufactured with assistance provided under such Act: (1) are tested for qualification for use in the production of existing and future weapons systems and development programs; and (2) are used and incorporated into the production of such systems and programs.
