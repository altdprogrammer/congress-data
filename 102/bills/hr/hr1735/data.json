Amends the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to extend applicability of new integration rules to all existing accrued benefits. Amends the IRC to disallow integration for simplified employee pensions, by repealing provisions relating to permitted disparity under rules limiting discrimination under simplified employee pensions. Provides for eventual repeal of certain integration rules, by repealing for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2000, IRC provisions relating to: (1) pension integration exceptions under nondiscrimination requirements for qualification; and (2) nondiscriminatory coordination of defined contribution plans with Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance. Revises IRC minimum coverage requirements with respect to separate lines of business. Sets forth a special rule where the employer operates a single line of business. Limits a line of business exception. Eliminates a special vesting rule for multiemployer plans under IRC and ERISA. Sets forth effective dates for amendments made by this Act. Sets forth a special rule for coverage of collectively bargained plans. Sets forth a special rule for plan amendments. Provides for studies and reports by the Comptroller General relating to cost-of-living adjustments and pension portability. Provides for the continued availability of remedies relating to rights of spouses to accrued benefits under pension plans under divorce case domestic relations orders entered before 1985."
