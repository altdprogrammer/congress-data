Requires the program to provide funding and support for projects having the following three components: (1) financial assistance to women to support the creation of businesses in which women can participate, foster investment in businesses owned by women, and enable women to further their education; (2) assistance to support efforts of educational institutions to encourage participation by women and prepare them for involvement in government and businesses; and (3) assistance to support local resource centers which offer courses, workshops, career counseling, and information to women interested in business or government careers. Urges the Administrator to use at least ten percent of funding made available for assistance for micro-enterprise development."
