Requires: (1) the Environmental Protection Agency to issue habitat quality criteria that will protect and restore coral reefs; and (2) States, in developing programs under specified provisions of Federal law relating to protecting coastal waters, to include policies for coral reef protection and restoration. Establishes in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration a program of monitoring and public education relating to coral reefs. Mandates technical assistance and training to foreign government reef management employees. Establishes a program of grants under the National Sea Grant College Program to support research on aquaculture of marine species of fish and invertebrates associated with coral reefs that are commonly collected from the wild for display in public or private aquaria.
