(Excepts from such limitation actions that have been determined by a final order of a court of binding jurisdiction to be in violation of a cable operator's rights prior to enactment of this Act.) States that such limitation shall not apply with respect to any claim against a franchising authority based on discrimination involving race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, or handicap."
