Outlines specific actions in furtherance of such goal, including actions to: (1) call upon all governments to abide by the Organization of American States (OAS)-supported embargo of Haiti; (2) support the Protocol between President Aristide and the Parliamentary Negotiating Committee to Find a Permanent Solution to the Haitian Crisis; (3) call upon the Haitian armed forces, parliament, and de facto government to restore individual rights; (4) call upon the armed forces to submit to civilian control and all parties to renounce violence as a means of achieving political goals; (5) support a civilian OAS-DEMOC mission (a mission to restore democracy and human rights); and (6) call upon the OAS to consider additional measures if progress toward restoration of the democratically elected government is not promptly achieved. Authorizes the Secretary of State to make contributions to the OAS-DEMOC mission in Haiti. Declares that the President should use a specified amount of economic support assistance for a contribution to the mission. Authorizes appropriations. Imposes the following sanctions against Haitian nationals who provided support for the coup d'etat overthrowing President Aristide, or for terrorist acts against the Haitian people after the coup: (1) ineligibility to receive visas and exclusion from admission into the United States; and (2) blocking of assets. Continues such sanctions until the President certifies to the Congress that a democratically elected government has been restored in Haiti consistent with the Haitian Constitution."
