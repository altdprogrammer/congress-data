    "text": "Deposit Insurance Modernization Act of 1991 - Sets a maximum $100,000 per person aggregate limit for deposits which may be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. Sets such limitation without regard to the capacity in which the account holder holds an interest in such account. Makes a deposit insurance declaration a prerequisite for the issuance of deposit insurance. Sets forth a priority scheme for deposit insurance coverage in the case of multiple accounts. Sets forth criminal fines for fraudulent attempts to obtain deposit insurance in excess of such limitation. Prescribes payment and oversight procedures. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Federal Credit Union Act to: (1) limit the aggregate amount of deposit insurance payments which may be made to any one person in any three-year period; and (2) outline a risk-based assessment scheme (including risk-based premiums and credits). Prohibits FDIC insurance coverage on certain deposit obligations which would not have been covered as of April 6, 1989. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Federal Credit Union Act to require insured credit unions and depository institutions to disclose, upon consumer request, their credit ratings. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to: (1) include foreign deposits in the calculation of assessment rates of depository institutions in certain locations outside the continental United States; and (2) preclude insurance coverage for brokered deposits."
