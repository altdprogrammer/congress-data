Excepts the President, Vice President, and their families from this prohibition, if they reimburse the Federal Government the full costs of such travel. Requires executive agency reports on agency use of Government owned or leased aircraft, and prohibits agency use of funds to lease or operate aircraft until such reports have been submitted.

States that any such golf course shall be operated by concessionaire contract and open to the general public. Prohibits the expenditure of Federal agency funds to: (1) subsidize the costs to equip, operate, or maintain dining rooms or kitchen facilities for the exclusive use of senior Government officers or to purchase or prepare food for their consumption, except in certain circumstances; (2) acquire luxury vehicles for the purpose of transporting senior Government officers, except for cabinet officers and executive agency heads, among others; or (3) employ drivers for the exclusive use of transporting senior Government officers, except for the officers listed. Requires the General Services Administration to prescribe regulations and uniform guidelines for the purchase or lease of luxury vehicles for or by the Federal Government that ensure the least cost to the Government. States that all costs to equip, operate, and maintain certain physical fitness facilities for use by Federal employees shall be fully paid by the users of such facilities. Prohibits the expenditure of appropriated funds by any executive agency for the costs of membership or other fees for the use of certain physical fitness facilities, including exercise equipment and classes. Directs the head of each executive agency to charge a nominal fee to any employee of such agency for access to medical services provided by the Public Health Service, the employing agency, any other Federal agency, or other medical service provider for which no charge is otherwise paid by such employee. Establishes a schedule for reductions in executive agency noncareer Senior Executive Service positions and Schedule C positions.
