    "text": "Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Access and Enhancement Act - Amends Federal law to repeal specified time and financial restrictions on the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to acquire the Crescent Dune area for inclusion in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Allows individual owners of property excluded from Lakeshore boundaries before October 1, 1991, but included after such date to retain use and occupancy rights on improved property for noncommercial residential purposes. Directs the Secretary to enter into a memorandum of agreement with the Northern Indiana Public Service Company in which such company shall provide specified services with respect to the Greenbelt area of the Lakeshore, including: (1) providing access to the National Park Service (NPS) for resource management and interpretation of the Greenbelt area and through the Greenbelt and across the dike for purposes of a public hiking trail; and (2) preserving the Greenbelt in its natural state. Prohibits the Secretary from acquiring lands or interests in land in the Greenbelt belonging to the company if such a memorandum of agreement is entered into, provided that the memorandum is in effect and is being performed. Specifies that if the Company: (1) utilizes the Greenbelt temporarily for a project involving pollution mitigation or construction on its adjacent facilities, it shall restore the project area to its natural state; and (2) proposes a different use for Greenbelt, it shall notify the NPS and specified congressional committees and make no change in the use of the property until three years after notice is given. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a cooperative agreement with Gary, Indiana, to provide technical assistance in interpretation, planning, and resource management for programs and developments in the city of Gary's Marquette Park and Lake Street Beach. Directs the Secretary to consult with the Commissioner of the Indiana Department of Transportation in determining what lands and interests the State requires for improvements to certain roads for the Lakeshore. Designates the NPS visitor center at the Lakeshore as the Dorothy Buell Memorial Visitor Center. Eliminates the limitations on expenditures from the Land and Water Conservation Fund by the Secretary for acquisition of lands for the Lakeshore."
