Prohibits revisions in the boundary of the Site except by an Act of the Congress. Repeals the Steamtown National Historic Site Act of 1986 that established and authorized appropriations for the Site. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and submit a new comprehensive general management plan for the Site to specified congressional committees. Prohibits the Secretary from acquiring any lands or interests in lands contaminated with hazardous substances that would require removal or remedial action at the expense of the United States. Requires any National Park Service funds expended for such purpose before enactment of this Act to be fully reimbursed before the Secretary may accept title to such lands or interests in them for the Site. Directs the Secretary to preserve the collection of railroad equipment (including locomotives and rolling stock present at the Site as of enactment of this Act) along with equipment and essential machinery for their maintenance. Allows a maximum of three steam locomotives and one diesel to be restored and permits the operation of only two steam locomotives and one diesel at any time. Prohibits Federal funds from being expended for access between the Site and any structure that is privately-owned or operated for profit. Requires the Secretary to preserve the artifact collection and archival materials located at the Site. Authorizes the Secretary to provide a regular excursion from Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Moscow, Pennsylvania. Prohibits the Secretary from expending funds of the National Park Service for the restoration or maintenance of tracks, bridges, or tunnels outside the Site, except certain funds appropriated before November 15, 1991. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) pay customary and appropriate track usage fees; and (2) provide four additional annual excursions if no such excursion is longer than 50 miles one way. Establishes the Steamtown National Historic Site Advisory Committee to: (1) provide professional expertise in railroad management and history; and (2) advise the Secretary in the development and operations of the Site. Terminates the committee ten years after enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area - Amends Federal law to change the map reference for the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area with respect to its boundary."
