    "text": "National Alternative Fuels and Motor Vehicles Act of 1991 - Title I: Alternative Transportation Fuels - Authorizes the Secretary of Energy (Secretary), in consultation with the Administrator of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, to enter into cooperative agreements and joint ventures proposed by any municipal, county, or regional transit authority in an urban area with a population over 100,000 to demonstrate the feasibility of using natural gas or other alternative fuels for mass transit. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992, 1993, and 1994. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of Transportation, to establish and carry out a program to provide financial assistance to encourage the development and commercialization of natural gas and other alternative fuels for use in fleets. Requires such program to provide for the purchase or construction of alternative fuel vehicles and associated refueling equipment. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992, 1993, and 1994. Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish and carry out a training and certification program for technicians who are responsible for vehicle installation of equipment that converts gasoline or diesel-fueled vehicles to alternative fuel vehicles, and for the maintenance of such converted vehicles. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992, 1993, and 1994. Directs the Secretary to carry out a program of research, development, and demonstration on techniques related to improving natural gas and other alternative fuel vehicle technology. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992, 1993, and 1994. Directs the Secretary, within six months of enactment of this Act, to: (1) institute a program to educate consumers of the costs of alternative fuels; (2) report to the Congress on the purchasing policies of the Federal Government which inhibit or prevent the purchase by the Government of alternative fuel vehicles; and (3) report to the Congress on Federal, State, and local traffic control measures and policies and how the use of alternative fuel vehicles could be promoted by granting such vehicles exemptions or preferential treatment. Amends the Natural Gas Act, the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 to provide for Federal regulation of the sale of vehicular natural gas. Allows the Secretary to assist State governments in establishing an office of alternative fuels. Requires funds to be available for funding alternative fuel programs established by such offices. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992, 1993, and 1994. Title II: Alternative Fuel Fleet Requirements - Requires any person who owns, operates, leases, or otherwise controls a covered fleet to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire alternative fuel vehicles from 1995 to 2000. Sets forth the percentages for such years from ten percent to 90 percent, respectively. Sets forth exceptions to such requirement and civil penalties for violations."
