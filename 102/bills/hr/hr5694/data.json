Requires 50 percent of such requirements to be designated for Federal purposes. Sets forth requirements with respect to allocations from the Fund for State purposes, including provisions for: (1) treatment of all Indian tribes and Alaska Native Village Corporations as one State for which funds shall be apportioned accordingly; and (2) State matching requirements for multipurpose acquisitions. Requires each statewide outdoor recreation plan for FY 1995 and each year thereafter to include: (1) an assessment of the impact requested projects will have on open space areas in the region for all metropolitan areas in excess of 100,000 people; and (2) a plan for maximizing use of National Park Service technical assistance available to the State for developing such regional open space assessment and for determining the needs and priorities for projects qualified for assistance under this Act. Sets forth requirements regarding maintenance of expenditures by State and Federal grant recipients."
