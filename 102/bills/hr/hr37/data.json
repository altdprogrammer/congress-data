Defines a senior civilian official of DOD as a civilian officer or employee serving in a position for which the rate of pay is greater than or equal to the rate of pay for a position in the Senior Executive Service. Makes applicable current Federal provisions that: (1) set forth civil penalties for the violation of such prohibition; and (2) allow a person who may fall under such prohibition to request the appropriate official for advice as to the applicability of such prohibition to his or her situation."
