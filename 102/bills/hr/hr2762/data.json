Requires the Secretary to transfer such property or facility to the Bureau of Prisons if the Attorney General certifies that such property will be used primarily in the incarceration of prisoners convicted of controlled substances offenses and that such property is essential to Bureau program objectives. Provides identical procedures to be followed by the Secretary for any real property or facility of the Department located at any military installation to be closed or realigned other than under the above Acts."
