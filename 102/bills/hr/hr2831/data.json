    "text": "Impacted Communities Assistance Act of 1991 - Directs the Administrator of General Services to assume jurisdiction over that part of the real property of a closed military installation which is suitable for transfer as soon as the Secretary of Defense: (1) closes such installation; and (2) renders the transferrable property environmentally safe in accordance with Federal law. Directs the Administrator, as soon as possible after assuming such jurisdiction, to offer title to such real property first to the local community affected by the closure of such military installation. Provides that if the local community refuses such property (or fails to accept such property within six months), the Administrator shall offer the property successively to the county involved, the State of the installation, other Federal departments and agencies, and the highest bidder. Provides for the disposition of property located in more than one local community or county. Authorizes the Secretary or the Administrator to sever from property so transferred that property not suitable for transfer because of environmental concerns or other valid reasons, including a finding that development of such property would destroy an environmental heritage. Requires the Secretary and the Administrator to include appropriate representatives of the local community in all discussions and decisions concerning the disposition of a closed military installation. Requires the local community, county, or State receiving such property to agree: (1) that if the property is sold within ten years after the date of conveyance, the entity involved must pay the United States 25 percent of the proceeds from such sale; (2) to make available to the Comptroller General all necessary information; and (3) to such other terms and conditions as determined necessary by the Administrator to ensure the acceptance of such property at the earliest possible date by the impacted community. Outlines actions to be taken by the Administrator if a local community, county, or State fails to comply with any such condition. Authorizes appropriations."
