    "text": "Resolution Trust Corporation Funding Act of 1991 - Title I: RTC Resolution Process and Funding - Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to mandate that requests for additional funding for the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC): (1) be submitted to specified congressional committees; and (2) contain a complete and detailed six-month financial plan for spending such resources. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of the Treasury to provide interim funding for the RTC. Precludes the RTC from exercising its authority with respect to insured depository institutions in conservatorship unless: (1) the RTC Board of Directors determines that the exercise of such authority is necessary for the RTC to provide insurance coverage for the insured deposits; and (2) the total amount of RTC expenditures and obligations is the least costly to the RTC of all possible alternatives. Presents guidelines for determining the least costly approach. Mandates an annual compliance audit by the General Accounting Office. Authorizes the RTC to: (1) disallow claims; and (2) treat certain claims against an insolvent insured depository institution as unsecured. Title II: RTC Disposition of Affordable Housing - Excludes from the RTC low-and-moderate-income housing program those residential properties of a closed savings association which the RTC has sold to an insured depository institution. Authorizes the RTC to sell residential property to qualifying persons without regard to any minimum purchase price. Sets forth tenant protection guidelines for eligible single family properties acquired by the RTC. Title III: Issues Relating to RTC Property - Mandates that the RTC maintain and periodically update a separate inventory of its real property with special significance (i.e., natural, cultural, recreational or scientific value). Title IV: Effect of RTC Actions on Communities - Mandates that applications by depository institutions to acquire residential properties from the RTC which fall within the affordable housing program must include a written community lending plan for meeting the credit needs of the community served by the acquiring institution. Prescribes guidelines for the community commitment requirements. Mandates that the RTC consider imposing limitations or conditions which would reduce or terminate the assistance it offers to a depository institution which discriminates against individuals on the basis of race, religion, sex, national origin or disability. Requires the RTC to report annually to the Congress on its actions during the year."
