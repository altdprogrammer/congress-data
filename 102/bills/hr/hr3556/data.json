Amends the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to amend the definition of \"agricultural commodity.\" Authorizes export sales financing under the direct credit sales and the export credit guarantee programs to assist emerging democracies. Authorizes the FY 1992 waiver of the credit guarantee program debt repayment requirement for the Soviet Union, its successor (including Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania), or its republics under urgent or critical circumstances. Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to make export credit guarantees in emerging democracies available for the provision of services or U.S. produced goods. Authorizes the integration of export assistance programs in order to meet foreign needs and promote U.S. agricultural exports. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish the E.
