    "text": "Campaign Finance Fairness and Reform Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit a multicandidate political committee from making contributions with respect to any election for Federal office which, in the aggregate exceed $1,000 (currently $5,000). Requires intermediaries and conduits for contributions to a candidate to register with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) if they are statutorily required to report to it regarding the original source and intended recipient of a contribution. Prohibits labor organizations from using dues or agency fees for political purposes unless the dues- or fee-paying employee approves in writing. Mandates that any corporation or labor organization that pays for certain communications or activities related to any Federal election report such payment to the FEC in the same manner that the principal campaign committee of a candidate for the Congress must report its contributions or expendtitures. Prohibits transfers among noncandidate, nonparty political committees. Sets forth House of Representatives election contribution limitations upon persons who are not local individual residents. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow income tax credits for individual contributions to House of Representatives candidates. Disallows such credit to estates or trusts. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to remove certain contribution limitations placed upon a political committee of a political party, or by a House of Representatives or Senate campaign committee of a political party. Prohibits Members of the House of Representatives from sending unsolicited mail under the frank during an election year. Prohibits a candidate for Federal office from establishing, financing, or controlling a political committee other than the candidate's principal campaign committee. Prohibits a Federal candidate's principal campaign committee from making contributions to any principal campaign committee (other than the principal campaign committee of the same individual as a candidate for another Federal office). Prohibits any person from making contributions to Federal office candidates which, in the aggregate, exceed the statutorily defined \"applicable amount\". Sets a limitation upon carryover of campaign funds by House of Representatives candidates."
