    "text": "School Improvement and Flexibility Act - Title I: Improvement of Student Performance - Directs the Secretary of Education to report by January 1, 1994, on the administration of public schools in ten to 15 States, identifying and analyzing the impact of new legal, regulatory, and organizational requirements (promulgated since 1980) that affect educational practices. Requires impact analysis of mandated curricula and student-teacher ratios and data collection and paperwork requirements. Requires such report to include recommendations on how best to simplify Federal or State regulations so that more resources can be used to improve student performance. Title II: Educational Performance Agreements for School Restructuring - Establishes a national program of educational performance agreements for school restructuring, under which: (1) local authorities develop proposals for enabling students to achieve higher performance; (2) schools with such proposals are allowed to combine Federal, State, and local funds under specified Federal laws relating to the education of special needs students, drug education, and training programs (and to waive certain restrictions under such programs); (3) Federal, State, and local protections with respect to civil rights, nondiscrimination, and safety will be upheld; and (4) States will make available funds necessary to plan, develop, monitor, and evaluate local performance agreements. Provides that funding combinations and waiver restrictions may include such types of programs under specified Federal laws in the case of: (1) training programs at the secondary level for children in vocational education courses; and (2) special needs programs at the elementary level for disadvantaged children served under chapter 1 title I of ESEA. Provides for: (1) authority of other Federal agencies; (2) limitations; (3) sunset of combination authority after the sixth year of the agreement; (4) audits; (5) State assurances and State educational performance agreements; (6) local performance agreements and local review and assessment; and (7) evaluation and report to the Congress. Title III: Incentives for Program Improvement - Provides for education program improvement, accountability measures, and incentives under the following Federal laws: (1) the General Education Provisions Act; (2) the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965; (3) the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act; (4) the Adult Education Act; (5) the Bilingual Education Act; and (6) the Dwight D. Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Education Act. Waives certain repayment requirements for violations of administrative regulations if the State, local educational agency, or other educational entity recipient has sustained improved educational performance over the year or program period in question."
