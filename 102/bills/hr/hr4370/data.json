    "text": "Bodie Protection Act of 1992 - Prohibits specified Federal lands and interests known as the Bodie Bowl (California) from being available for any mineral mining, leasing, or disposal activities, except under valid existing claims. Directs the Secretary to undertake an expedited validity review of all unpatented mining claims located within the Bodie Bowl, but prohibits any challenge to the validity of any claim for failure to do assessment work for any period after the date of enactment of this Act. Prescribes limitations for the issuance of patents for mining and mill site claims on such lands. Subjects mineral exploration, mining, beneficiation, and processing on unpatented mining claims within the Bodie Bowl to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior to ensure that such mineral activities are conducted in a manner that does not adversely affect historic, cultural, recreational and natural resource values of the Bodie Bowl area. Mandates the restoration of the effects of mining exploration by mining operators. Exempts the holder of any unpatented mining or mill site claim within the Bodie Bowl from specified statutory expenditure and filing requirements. Declares that, in lieu of filing a certain affidavit of assessment work, such holder shall only be required to file a specified notice of intention to hold certain mining claims under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Directs the Secretary to: (1) review possible actions to preserve the scenic character, historical integrity, cultural and recreational values, flora and fauna, and ghost town characteristics of lands and structures within the Bodie Bowl; and (2) report to certain congressional committees any recommendations as to which steps should be undertaken to achieve such preservation."
