Imposes an excise tax on each accident and health insurance contract, self-insured plan, and health maintenance organization to generate revenues for a stop-loss pool. Establishes the Health Reinsurance Trust Fund consisting of the excise taxes imposed by this Act. Makes such Fund available: (1) to reimburse a plan for core benefits for any individual after $25,000 has been expended on such individual; and (2) for administrative expenses incurred by such Fund."
