Authorizes the transfer of certain lands between the Secretaries of the Interior and Defense for inclusion in the Park. Permits the Secretary of the Interior to acquire by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange lands or interests in lands within the revised boundaries of the Park, except that lands and interests within the 1991 additions that are: (1) owned by the State or a political subdivision may be acquired only by donation; and (2) used for noncommercial residential purposes as of July 1, 1991, may be acquired only with the owner's consent unless the property is being developed in a manner detrimental to the Park. Authorizes an owner of property acquired by the Secretary to retain a right of use and occupancy for up to 25 years from the date of acquisition or the death of the owner or the owner's spouse, whichever is later. Requires the Secretary, in the case of individuals who sold residential property between 1966 and 1968 to the United States for the Park and continue to occupy such property pursuant to special use permits, to offer to extend such permits for a term ending on the death of the individual or the individual's spouse, whichever is later. Conditions such extensions on the payment of an annual fee. Authorizes appropriations."
