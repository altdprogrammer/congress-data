    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-05-20", 
    "text": "Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1991 - Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for FY 1992 through 1994 for specified environmental research, development, and demonstration activities and for program management and support of the Office of Research and Development. Prohibits the Administrator from using any funds appropriated in this Act for office closings or reductions in force unless a congressional notice and wait procedure has been complied with by the Administrator. Requires the Administrator to establish a separately identified core research program consisting of fundamental ecological, health, and risk reduction research to support efforts to identify, assess, and mitigate serious environmental risks. Directs the Administrator to establish a Research Strategy Council to oversee, review, and ensure adequate funding of the core research program. Requires the Science Advisory Board to review and make recommendations on core research program activities. Directs the Administrator to establish an Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program to conduct comprehensive, long-term environmental monitoring, data collection, and data analysis to assess and respond to the current and long-term status and trends of the ecological resources of the United States. Requires the Administrator to coordinate Program activities with other Federal agencies and to make available to the public and the Congress statistical data summaries and interpretive reports on ecological status and trends developed as a result of the Program. Directs the Administrator to: (1) establish a modernization program to identify, acquire, and maintain modern buildings, facilities, supplies, and equipment needed to conduct high quality research; and (2) conduct studies and make assessments of the adequacy of the equipment and facilities to meet the needs of EPA and to attract well-qualified scientists, engineers, and other appropriate personnel. Repeals a required annual report from the Administrator of a five-year plan for environmental research, development, and demonstration. Requires the Science Advisory Board to submit annual reports to the Congress and the Administrator on the proposed research program described in the President's budget request for research, development, and demonstration activities of the EPA. Requires the Board to conduct periodic evaluations of selected areas of the current and planned activities. Requires concurrent submission to the Congress of any report required from the Board to the Administrator. Directs the Administrator to carry out a program of research and monitoring on regional, national, and global impacts of environmental pollution and perturbation on biological diversity. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) lease facilities, buildings, and other property to promote the activities authorized under this Act; and (2) enter into cooperative agreements to conduct application reviews and use research funds for such cooperative agreements. Directs the Administrator to: (1) report biannually to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the accomplishments of programs authorized under this Act; (2) develop and implement a research program to increase understanding of the health effects of exposure to electric and magnetic fields; and (3) carry out a program of environmental technology transfer and exchange of scientific information to make full use of EPA's research, development, and demonstration efforts. Requires the annual EPA appropriations request to distinguish funding requested for source reduction research and development and demonstration activities. Authorizes the Administrator to undertake multimedia source reduction projects. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Administrator to: (1) identify at least ten research issues correlating to environmental hazards in the category of highest risk to human health and the environment and address such issues as part of an overall strategic planning process; and (2) outline research priorities on efforts aimed at eliminating or minimizing the generation of wastes or pollutants. Directs the Adminstrator to conduct research on methods for evaluating emerging products and techniques for detecting lead in paint films and dust. Requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop protocols, criteria, and minimum performance standards to be used in such evaluation and to ensure reliable and effective lead detection technologies. Requires the Administrator to conduct research on: (1) the short-and long-term efficacy of lead abatement and management techniques for housing based on levels of lead in dust and in occupants' blood; and (2) the performance properties of products for encapsulating or stripping lead-based paint. Directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish performance criteria and standards for encapsulants and strippers. Requires the Administrator to: (1) conduct a long-term research study to establish the sources of lead exposure for children with blood lead levels greater than ten micrograms per deciliter; and (2) sponsor public education and outreach efforts to increase awareness of lead poisoning from household sources and the need for abatement and management actions. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Administrator to provide funds for establishing a voluntary accreditation program to the National Institute for Standards and Technology. Requires the National Institute for Standards and Technology to establish protocols, criteria, and performance standards and implement an accreditation program with respect to laboratory analysis of lead in paint films, soil, and dust. Directs the Administrator to establish a separately identified research program to improve EPA's capability to identify and assess risks to public health and ecosystems resulting from contamination of the environment."
