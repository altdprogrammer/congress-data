Increases the amounts already authorized to be appropriated for FY 1993 and 1994. Title II: Incentive for Quality Education - Incentives for Quality Education Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Act of 1965 (ESEA) to add to ESEA title I chapter 1 (Financial Assistance to Meet Special Educational Needs of Children) a new Incentives for Quality Education program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1997 for such incentive grants program. Sets forth provisions for: (1) allocation of program funds among States; (2) State applications; (3) State use of at least 96 percent of such funds for awards to local educational agencies (LEAs) that meet specified criteria; (4) State review panels; and (5) annual State reports. Requires the State educational agency (SEA) to make such awards to any LEA: (1) whose students are receiving ESEA title I chapter 1 services; and (2) that has met criteria established by the SEA. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to establish minimum to be used by every SEA in developing selection criteria. Requires such minimum criteria to address specified matters. Requires each SEA to establish additional selection criteria that measure progress in student achievement and other indicators of a school's success. Sets forth a formula for determining the amount of such award based on other chapter 1 awards. Requires the LEA to use its award for activities that further the educational program of the school in order to further student achievement. Restricts such activities to specified types, and to supplementation of other funding. Prohibits Federal, State or local reduction of other assistance. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a biennial evaluation of such quality education incentive awards; and (2) submit information on successful quality education incentive programs to the National Diffusion Network for possible dissemination. Title III: Incentives for Educational Excellence - Incentives for Educational Excellence Act - Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to LEAs to strengthen the skills of students and teachers. Sets forth application and program requirements. Requires, at a minimum, assurances that the LEA has developed programs or shall develop a plan to: (1) increase the number of days students attend school each year to at least 200 days per year by the year 2000, which may include all-year-round attendance requirements; (2) decrease the number of students in each class or increase the ratio of teachers to students in each class; (3) improve teacher training through inservice programs that include collaborative efforts with colleges and universities; (4) reduce the number of school dropouts through innovative outreach programs; and (5) develop career skill centers to give students an exposure to various career opportunities. Requires States receiving such grants to submit annual progress reports. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1997 to carry out such grants program."
