Provides that the Program shall be managed by the Secretary independently of other foreign assistance programs of the Federal Government but may have cooperative activities and cost-sharing arrangements with certain other Federal agencies. Prescribes guidelines for the establishment of an information clearinghouse under the Program to disseminate energy and environmental technology alternatives. Establishes the Interagency Working Group to assist and advise the Secretary about the priority of projects to be funded under the ADEPT Program and the integration of pertinent information. Requires the Secretary to take into consideration the advice of the ADEPT Management Panel and the Interagency Working Group when making any decision to approve or disapprove an ADEPT Program project proposal. Directs the ADEPT Management Panel, in consultation with the Interagency Working Group, to submit periodically for the Secretary's review and approval a consolidated plan for the ADEPT Program. Directs the Secretary to submit a copy of such plan to the Congress. Prohibits ADEPT Program implementation from affecting the activities and funding of certain DOE cooperative projects. Authorizes appropriations."
