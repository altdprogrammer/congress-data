    "text": "International Medical Graduate Equity Act of 1991 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to establish: (1) a National Repository of International Physician Credentials (the Repository); and (2) an Advisory Council on the Repository (the Council). Authorizes appropriations for such purposes for FY 1992 through 1994. Requires the Secretary to obtain information on a periodic basis from the physician licensing authority of at least ten States with respect to license applications and periodically report on such information to the Congress. Prohibits any State from discriminating against an individual on the basis of their being an international medical graduate (i.e. a graduate of a medical school located outside the United States) by denying their application for a license to practice medicine, if the individual: (1) has received such a license from another State and has practiced medicine in the United States for five years after receiving such license; and (2) meets the State's criteria for issuance of such license to graduates of U.S. medical schools. Prohibits any entity that operates a residency program for medical school graduates to discriminate against an international medical graduate by denying such individual an available residency in the program in any case in which: (1) the residency cannot be filled by a U.S. medical school graduate; and (2) the international medical graduate meets the criteria for program admission for U.S. medical school graduates. Allows individuals aggrieved by such discrimination by a State or a residency program operator to obtain relief through civil action. Sets a five-year statute of limitations on such actions."
