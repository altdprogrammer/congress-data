    "text": "State Care: State-Based Comprehensive Health Care Act of 1992 - Amends the Social Security Act (SSA) to add a new title XXI under which the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to select States to participate in health coverage demonstration projects. Establishes the Universal Health Care Advisory Board to make recommendations to the Secretary regarding approval of applications of States to participate in a demonstration project. Requires a State, in order to participate in a demonstration project, to submit to the Secretary and the Advisory Board an application containing information and assurances that the State has enacted a comprehensive health care plan and established a State Health Care Authority. Requires the State Health Care Authority to develop such plan. Provides that in order for a State to have its application approved, it must develop and enact a plan that: (1) is in effect in all political subdivisions of the State; (2) provides benefits and services that are at least equal to those provided under Medicare (SSA title XVIII), and for individuals entitled to Medicaid (SSA title XIX) benefits as of the date of the enactment of this Act, equal to the benefits and services provided under Medicaid; (3) ensures that all individuals in the State who are citizens or lawful residents have access to health coverage through a single State administered plan, a plan that requires employers to cover employees through either a public or private insurance plan, or any other plan approved by the State and determined appropriate by the Advisory Board; (4) provides for appropriate cost-control mechanisms; (5) requires providers of services and insurance policies to meet licensure, certification, and other appropriate standards; (6) provides for budgetary procedures to ensure that a statewide health care budget is established with respect to plan benefits and services; and (7) includes quality control procedures. Prohibits payments under Medicare or Medicaid for services provided under a demonstration project if payment for such services may be made under the State's comprehensive health care plan. Directs the Secretary to pay to each State participating in a demonstration project an amount equal to the amount of any payments that, as a result of such prohibition, were not made under Medicare or Medicaid because payment was made under such comprehensive plan."
