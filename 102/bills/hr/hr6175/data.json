Limits lifetime payments. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an additional individual income tax on any individual (and the individual's spouse) who received such payments. Establishes the Medical School Assistance Trust Fund, appropriating to it the taxes imposed by this Act. Authorizes appropriations to the Trust Fund, as repayable advances, as necessary to make the payments."
