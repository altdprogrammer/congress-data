    "text": "Intelligence Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1991 - Title I: Intelligence Activities - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 for intelligence activities in specified departments and agencies of the U.S. Government, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Declares that the authorized amounts and personnel ceilings for such intelligence activities are those specified in the classified schedule of authorizations. Authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to employ civilian personnel in excess of the ceiling for such personnel when necessary to the performance of important intelligence functions. Title II: Intelligence Community Staff - Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Staff for FY 1991. Establishes an end strength ceiling of 240 full-time Intelligence Community Staff employees, including 50 full-time personnel who are authorized to serve in the Security Evaluation Office. Provides that such staff shall be administered in the same manner as the CIA. Title III: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System and Related Provisions - Authorizes appropriations for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund for FY 1991. Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees to eliminate the statutory provisions requiring a 15-year career review and an election option for participants in the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System (CIARDS) and requires such participants to remain under CIARDS for the duration of their CIA service. Specifies that the five years of marriage spent outside the United States required to qualify for former spouse status must have been during periods of the participant's service with the CIA. Permits a retiree under CIARDS who was unmarried at the time of retirement to: (1) elect a reduction in an annuity for purposes of providing a survivor benefit upon marriage after retirement (currently, an election for a current spouse must be equal to the election made for a spouse to whom the participant was married at the time of retirement); and (2) irrevocably elect within one year of remarriage, where his or her annuity was not reduced to provide a survivor annuity at the time of retirement, to provide an annuity for the new spouse in the event such spouse survives the retired participant (in such case, the retired participant would be required to deposit an amount by which his or her annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date of retirement; or, if later, the date the previous reduction in the annuity was terminated). Reduces the remarriage age for purposes of entitlement to survivor and retirement benefits under CIARDS.

Authorizes the Secretary, if compliance with any Federal laws and regulations would create an unacceptable risk of compromise of an authorized intelligence collection activity, to permit the operation of the activity notwithstanding such laws and regulations. Permits personnel to conduct such activities in the United States only to the extent necessary to support intelligence activities abroad. Prohibits entities engaged in such activities from employing, assigning, or detailing U.S. persons to perform duties for such entities unless such persons are informed in advance of the intelligence security purposes of such activities. Requires the Secretary to ensure that the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are kept currently and fully informed of such activities.
