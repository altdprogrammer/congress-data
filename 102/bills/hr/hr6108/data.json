Requires the Commission to submit an initial report to the President and the Congress with recommendations for the application of TQ principles to the organization and operation of the legislative and executive branches of the Government, with additional annual reports to follow. Requires the President, after receiving such a report from the Commission, to submit to the Commission and the Congress separate reports containing the President's recommendations for restructuring and improving the operation of all executive branch organizations recommended for reform by the Commission. Requires House and Senate leadership, after receiving such a report from the Commission, to submit to the Commission and the President separate reports with recommendations for restructuring and improving the operation of all legislative branch organizations recommended for reform by the Commission."
