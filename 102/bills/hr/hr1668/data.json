Revises the direct (Perkins) student loan program to provide for partial loan cancellation for full-time volunteer service (comparable to Peace Corps or VISTA service) with a tax-exempt organization. (Current law provides for such partial cancellation for service in the Peace Corps or VISTA.) Revises the guaranteed (Stafford) student loan program to provide for partial loan repayment for service in the Peace Corps or VISTA or for comparable full-time service as a volunteer with a tax-exempt organization. Sets certain maximum compensation limitations as a requirement for specified deferments of Stafford and Perkins loans."
