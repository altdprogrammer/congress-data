    "text": "Political Broadcasting Access Act of 1991 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require each licensee for a broadcasting station to make available annually free broadcast time for political advertising. Provides standards for time allotment, including total time to be allotted, the length of each unit of such free time, and the hours of the day and the time of the year in which such free time must be allowed. Requires national political parties meeting certain minimum qualifying standards to be treated equally for purposes of such allotment. Provides that nothing in this Act shall restrict a candidate's or party's right to purchase other broadcast time on such station. Requires a cable operator to make available annually free cable time for political advertising under similar requirements. Prohibits the renewal of a franchise of any cable operator that fails to comply with such requirements."
