    "text": "Health Services Cost Control Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General to jointly carry out a demonstration program of 20 three-year grants for collaboration among hospitals or other medical facilities regarding the provision of expensive, capital-intensive medical technology or other highly resource-intensive services. Requires that projects be designed to demonstrate a reduction in costs, an increase in access to care, and improvements in the quality of care. Allows grant funds to be used only to facilitate collaboration and not to purchase expensive, capital-intensive medical technology or other highly resource-intensive services not previously owned or provided by the facility. Requires cooperative agreements facilitated under these provisions to provide for the sharing of medical technology or eligible services. Declares that it is not a violation of antitrust laws for a hospital to carry out activities under these provisions. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Attorney General to issue a three-year certificate of review to medical facilities that enter into cooperative agreements with respect to the provision of expensive, capital-intensive medical technology or other highly resource-intensive services if the agreements: (1) are designed to reduce duplication, increase access to care, or improve quality of care; (2) will not unreasonably enhance, stabilize, or depress prices; and (3) will not constitute unfair competition. Prohibits criminal or civil antitrust actions against a facility for conduct in compliance with a certificate. Allows any person injured as a result of conduct engaged in under a certificate to injunctive relief, actual damages and interest, and the costs of suit. Requires such an action to proceed, subject to specified differences, as if it were commenced under certain provisions of the Federal antitrust law commonly known as the Clayton Act. Allows the Attorney General to sue under specified provisions of the Clayton Act to enjoin conduct threatening clear and irreparable harm to the national interest."
