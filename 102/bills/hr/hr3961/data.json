Prohibits funds appropriated to the Departments of Energy or of Defense from being obligated to provide financial assistance to enterprises of the Soviet Ministry of Atomic Power and Industry of the Soviet Union or its successor entities until the President certifies to the Congress that information on past and present Soviet nuclear weapons production and fissile materials inventories has been made available to the public of the Soviet Union."
