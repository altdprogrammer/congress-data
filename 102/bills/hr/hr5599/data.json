Waives the physical U.S. presence requirements for a person claiming U.S. citizenship based upon descent from a person described above. Makes such provisions retroactive. Waives the government knowledge naturalization requirement for persons: (1) over age 50 who have resided in the United States as permanent residents for at least 20 years; or (2) over age 55 who have resided in the United States as permanent residents for at least 15 years. Waives such requirement and the English language requirement for persons who are unable to comply because of physical, mental, or developmental impairment. (Current law waives the English language requirement for persons unable to comply because of physical impairment.) Changes the residence requirement language from \"residing permanently\" to \"physically present\" for purposes of naturalization of children born outside the United States."
