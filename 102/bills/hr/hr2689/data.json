    "text": "Choice in Education Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to make four-year grants to public schools or local educational agencies for demonstrations and evaluations of choice in education programs which provide parents and children with an opportunity to choose an appropriate education. Provides for evaluation of data from such demonstration programs and other ongoing public and private school choice programs. Earmarks the first year of a grant for planning and training and the next for implementation. Allows grantees to apply for an additional two-year continuation grant. Limits the use of other Federal funds for such demonstration programs. Requires grant applications to contain specified assurances and documentation. Requires a review panel appointed by the Secretary to make grant recommendations for specified types of proposals. Requires the grantee to submit a detailed implementation plan at the end of the planning year. Requires approval of such plan, unless: (1) parents and students are not involved in planning and implementation and are not provided with adequate and objective information on available choices; (2) the program does not demonstrate the probability of increasing educational opportunities of disadvantaged students, minority students, or students with disabilities; and (3) the program does not provide equal access for all students. Requires grantees to report biennially on program operation and student achievement. Directs the Secretary to reserve a portion of funds to evaluate grant programs under this Act in comparison with other similar programs not receiving assistance under it. Directs the Secretary to provide the independent evaluation results to the Educational Resources Information Center and to all program participants. Authorizes the Secretary, through the Office of Educational Research and Improvement, to provide for research, evaluation, and dissemination of results through grants to and contracts with various entities. Directs the Secretary to report biennially to the Congress. Defines \"choice\" as a system adopted by a State or local educational agency under which parents may select the school or educational program in which their child will be enrolled, including limited choice, open enrollment, and magnet schools. Authorizes appropriations."
