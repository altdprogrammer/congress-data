    "text": "Puget Sound Cruise Ship Act of 1991 - Amends Federal law to set forth citizenship and English comprehension requirements for crews of a passenger vessel operating between Puget Sound and Alaska. Mandates financial guarantees for the construction in the United States of vessels to carry passengers between such areas. Authorizes, in certain circumstances, issuance of a certificate of documentation for otherwise ineligible vessels to engage in the coastwise carriage of passengers between such areas. Mandates the issuance of permits under the Marine Mammal Protection Act for the operation of vessels observing marine mammals in Glacier Bay, Alaska. Amends Federal law (commonly known as the Johnson Act) to declare that nothing in the Act prohibits use of any gambling device on certain vessels."
