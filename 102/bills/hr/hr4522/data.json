    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-03-20", 
    "text": "Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend and revise Special Programs for Students from Disadvantaged Backgrounds (TRIO Programs). Extends through FY 1997 the authorization of appropriations for such programs. Adds to program goals motivation and preparation of such students for doctoral programs. Adds requirements for: (1) a peer review application process; (2) inflation adjustments; (3) minimum grant levels for specified programs; (4) duration of grants and contracts; (5) notice of application status; (6) early notification and technical training for potential providers of special programs and projects; (7) unlimited number of applications by an entity; and (8) coordination with other programs for disadvantaged students. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to ensure that: (1) members of groups underrepresented in higher education are represented as readers of TRIO programs applications; and (2) each such application is read by at least three reviewers not employed at the Department of Education. Sets forth requirements for documentation of status as a low-income individual, for purposes of TRIO programs eligibility. Revises provisions for the Talent Search program (one of the TRIO programs). Sets forth an expanded list of permissible services which talent search projects may offer, in addition to tutoring, including counseling, mentoring, and parent workshops. Lowers the minimum age and elementary education completion levels for participant eligibility to 11 years of age and five years of school completed (currently 12 and six, respectively, while retaining the maximum age level of 27 years). Revises provisions for the Upward Bound program (one of the TRIO programs). Adds to the list of permissible services which upward bound projects may offer mentoring programs involving elementary or secondary school teachers, college faculty, students, or any combination thereof. Requires any assisted upward bound project which has received two or more years of program funding to include in its core curriculum: (1) instruction in mathematics through precalculus; (2) at least one laboratory science; (3) at least one foreign language; and (4) instruction in composition and literature. Revises provisions for Student Support Services (one of the TRIO programs). Adds requirements for design goals of support services projects, including increased rates of college retention, graduation, and transfers from two- to four-year institutions, and institutional climates supportive of low-income and first-generation college students and individuals with disabilities. Adds to permissible services for such projects mentoring programs involving school teachers, college faculty and/or students. Revises provisions for the Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement (under TRIO programs provisions). Adds to permissible services: (1) mentoring programs involving elementary or secondary school teachers, college faculty, and/or students; and (2) exposure to cultural events and academic programs not usually available to disadvantaged students. Allows costs for summer room and board, summer tuition, and transportation to summer programs to be paid in addition to the maximum annual amount for a student stipend. Eliminates provisions which: (1) conditioned program funding on specified minimum funding for other programs; and (2) set program funding limits. Revises provisions for Educational Opportunity Centers (under TRIO programs provisions). Expands the list of permissible services which such centers may offer, in addition to tutorial and counseling services, including public information campaigns, assistance in course selection, financial aid application, and entrance exam preparation, alternative education guidance for dropouts, career workshops, monitoring programs, and special programs for students of limited English proficiency. Revises provisions for Staff Development Activities (for training for staff and leadership personnel for projects under TRIO Programs). Requires such training to be offered annually for new directors of such projects as well as annually specified topics and other topics chosen by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to make Outreach Grants to institutions of higher education, community-based organizations, and other public and private nonprofit organizations to provide outreach information to potential providers of programs and projects authorized under Federal Early Outreach and Student Services Programs (the new subpart 1) that could serve groups underrepresented in such programs. Authorizes the Secretary to make Project Evaluation grants and contracts to institutions of higher education and other public and private organizations to: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of the various programs authorized under TRIO programs provisions (chapter 1); and (2) disseminate results of ongoing evaluations to similar programs as well as to other individuals concerned with the postsecondary access and retention of low-income, first-generation students."
