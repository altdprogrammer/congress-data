    "text": "Commercial Space Competitiveness Act of 1992 - Title I: General Provisions - Sets forth findings and definitions for this Act. Title II: Space Transportation - Amends the Commercial Space Launch Act to extend certain provisions relating to payment by the United States against a licensee under the Act until January 1, 2000. Amends the Launch Services Purchase Act of 1990 to require all Federal agencies (currently only the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)) to purchase launch services, including suborbital payloads, from commercial providers, except: (1) if the payload requires the unique capabilities of the space shuttle or serves a national security or foreign policy purpose; (2) if cost effective commercial services are not reasonably available; or (3) if use of commercial launch services poses an unreasonable risk of loss of a unique scientific opportunity. Requires the Administrator of NASA to: (1) report to the appropriate congressional committees any determination not to use commercial launch services; and (2) report to the Congress on NASA plans to increase commercial launch services in its suborbital launch programs. Requires the Federal Government (currently, NASA) to conduct full competitions for launch services contracts, limit requirements for cost or pricing data, and use performance specifications to the maximum extent feasible. Phases in such Federal agency launch services requirements. Establishes a demonstration program to award vouchers to researchers for the payment of commercial launch services and payload integration services for small scientific payloads. Requires the Administrator to submit a program report to the Congress. Authorizes grants for projects relating to the development or improvement of space transportation infrastructure. Establishes in the Treasury the Commercial Space Transportation Trust Fund, to consist of revenues from any fees assessed by the Department of Transportation for the licensing of commercial launch activities and to be used for projects that directly benefit the U.S. space transportation industry. Requires that projects be selected by an Industry Selection Committee representing fee payors. Requires an inventory to identify federally-owned launch support facilities: (1) not needed for public use; or (2) which could be made available for non-Federal use on a reimbursable basis without interfering with Federal activities. Requires the Administrator to submit a program report to the Congress. Title III: Miscellaneous - Authorizes the Administrator to enter into contracts in which the Government agrees to procure sufficient quantities of a commercial space product or service needed to meet Government mission requirements so that a commercial venture is made viable (anchor tenancy contracts) in order to increase the viability of a commercial space venture. Authorizes Federal agencies to allow non-Federal entities to use their space-related facilities on a reimbursable basis if: (1) in support of commercial space activities; and (2) equivalent commercial services are not reasonably available. Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to mandate protection of information developed under specified provisions of the Act from dissemination. Establishes a Commercial Space Achievement Award, consisting of a medal and, if funding is available, a cash prize, to individuals, corporations, corporate divisions, or corporate subsidiaries meeting certain criteria. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to accept gifts from public and private sources for the cash prize. Prohibits the fraudulent use of \"Made in America\" labels. Bars a person who violates such prohibition from contract eligibility under this Act. Requires Federal agencies soliciting bids under this Act to comply with the Buy American Act."
