    "text": "Title I: Federal Agency Energy Efficiency and Management - Government Energy Efficiency Act of 1991 - Requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to ensure reliable Federal building energy consumption costs accounting. Requires the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to report to specified congressional committees on the estimated utility cost of leased buildings or space in which the Federal Government does not directly pay the utility bills. Requires the President's budget to identify each agency's requested amount for energy operating costs, energy conservation, and efficiency expenditures. Requires an audit survey by each Inspector General of agency energy use to determine compliance with energy management goals for Federal buildings set forth under the National Energy Conservation Policy Act. Requires a report to the Congress on survey results by the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency. Requires GSA to hold regional workshops for Federal, State, and local officials to coordinate energy management and conservation planning. Requires a GSA report to specified congressional committees on the schedule for such workshops. Authorizes appropriations. Requires GSA to undertake a program to include energy efficient products on the Federal Supply Schedule and the New Item Inventory Schedule. Establishes a GSA demonstration program to identify and label those products with significant energy-saving potential and encourage their use by all Federal agencies. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to authorize the deposit of amounts from rebates or other cash incentives related to energy savings into the Federal Buildings Fund Authorizes the Administrator, in the administration of any real property which the Administrator leases and pays utility costs for, to assign energy rebates to the lessor for purposes of installing energy conserving equipment. Permits the Administrator to obligate certain funds for energy management improvement and programs to promote source reduction and recycling. Requires agency programs for the training of Federal building managers in energy management according to prescribed guidelines. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Secretary of Energy to establish a financial award program to reward outstanding building managers and others making outstanding contributions toward the reduction of building energy costs or use. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Federal Energy Management Improvement Act of 1988 to require the Secretary of Energy's survey of energy saving potential to determine the barriers which may prevent agency attainment of the energy management goals set forth under the National Energy Conservation Policy Act. Establishes Federal building energy consumption targets. Authorizes Federal agencies to participate in utility incentive programs. Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to require the Secretary to establish a demonstration program to install commercial energy efficiency technologies in Federal buildings. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Technology Competitiveness Act of 1989 to revise the management plan required to conduct activities under that Act. Requires the Architect of the Capitol to undertake a study to determine the feasibility and costs of compliance with all applicable Federal energy reduction requirements of all facilities under the Architect's jurisdiction. Title II: Federal Alternative Fuel Vehicle Procurement and Management - Federal Alternative Fuel Vehicle Procurement and Management Act of 1991 - Requires the GSA Administrator to ensure that alternative fuel vehicles are procured for Federal agency use. Requires the GSA Administrator to: (1) institute a program to promote and educate Federal agencies and employees on such vehicles; (2) coordinate with State and local governments in the purchase, refueling, and maintenance of such vehicles; and (3) provide technical assistance to Federal agencies in the procurement and placement of alternative fuel vehicles. Provides for exempting motor vehicles operated by the Departments of Defense, Justice, and the Treasury from this title for reasons of national security and law enforcement. Authorizes an incentive program for agencies to lease such vehicles. Establishes an awards program for Federal employees who demonstrate a strong commitment, through the use of such vehicles, to a cleaner environment and energy secure country. Authorizes appropriations. Requires an annual GSA report and an annual Postal Service report to the Congress on their alternative fuel vehicle programs. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title."
