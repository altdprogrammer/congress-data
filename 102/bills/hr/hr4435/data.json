Requires that current waiting lists be observed before initiating designated housing options. Prohibits forced tenant moves based upon amendments made by this title. Considers central dining facility expenditures made in connection with congregate housing as an operating cost. Title II: Standards and Obligations of Residency and Coordination of Services in Federally Assisted Housing - Requires federally assisted housing owners and public housing authorities to select only tenants who comply with specified occupancy criteria. Permits refusal of occupancy because of: (1) criminal activity; (2) prior evictions; (3) a history of disturbing other neighbors or destroying property; (4) intentional misrepresentations; or (5) failure to meet financial obligations. Requires leases to enumerate such criteria and state that their violation shall be sufficient grounds for eviction. Requires the appointment of service coordinators in federally assisted housing to coordinate services for older or disabled residents, which may include safety, social, health, and nutritional services. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to direct public housing agencies to assist elderly or disabled families in funding nonpublic housing."
