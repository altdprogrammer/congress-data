Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation to establish up to ten National Advanced Materials Processing and Synthesis Centers for collaboration among industry, universities, research groups, and government entitles. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Energy, the Director of the National Science Foundation, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to establish within each of their departments or agencies a competitive grants program of Advanced Materials Principal Investigator Awards to provide funding for research and development by individual investigators on specific topics of interest in the advancement of materials science and engineering. Requires each of such departments and agencies to establish a Graduate Fellowship Program for Materials Processing and Synthesis to enable research and work in affiliation with the awarding department or agency, to be awarded on the basis of academic merit. Authorizes appropriations."
