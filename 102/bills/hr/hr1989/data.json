Sets forth reporting requirements. Mandates a report to specified congressional committees on what renovations and upgrades of NIST facilities are necessary over the next decade. Prohibits awarding a contract or subcontract with funds authorized under this title for an article or material produced or manufactured in a foreign country whose government unfairly maintains in government procurement a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination against U.S. products or services which results in identifiable harms to U.S. businesses. Makes ineligible to receive a contract or subcontract from the Department of Commerce any person who fraudulently affixes a \"Made in America\" label to a product. Authorizes the Secretary, in certain circumstances, to award to a domestic firm a contract that, under competitive procedures, would be awarded to a foreign firm. Title II: Advanced Technology Program Amendments - Emerging Technologies and Advanced Technology Program Amendments Act of 1991 - Amends the NIST Act to require the Secretary and the NIST Director, in operating the Advanced Technology Program, to be guided by the findings and recommendations of the Biennial National Critical Technology Reports. Authorizes the Secretary, through the Director, to: (1) aid industry-led joint (currently, aid joint) research and development ventures under the Program; (2) participate in such joint ventures through grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements; and (3) make grants (as well as entering into contracts and cooperative agreements) with U.S. businesses (currently, with U.S. businesses and independent research organizations) under the Program. Prohibits the Program from making an award unless the award will facilitate formation of a new joint venture or the initiation of new research and development by an existing joint venture. Removes provisions entitling the Federal Government to a share of licensing fees and royalty payments from joint ventures. Sets forth eligibility requirements for company participation in the Program. Requires assistance under the Program to be designed to support high risk projects with potential for eventual substantial widespread commercial application.
