Requires the Secretary to impose quantitative restrictions on the export of unprocessed timber from any State where a critical shortage exists in it. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress specified quarterly reports. Requires the Secretary, whenever he or she imposes such export restrictions, to give preference in the allocation of export licenses to persons who own fewer than 1281 acres of forest land. Directs the Secretary to impose quantitative restrictions on exports of unprocessed timber from Washington, Oregon, and California."
