Prescribes participation by the Commission in judicial proceedings regarding violations of this Act. Requires the Commission to report to the House of Representatives after each general election on: (1) candidate expenditures; (2) aggregate amount of voter communication vouchers; (3) the status of repayments; and (4) the balances remaining in the two campaign funds under this Act. Authorizes appropriations. Reduces the limitations on contributions per election: (1) from $1,000 to $500 for individuals; and (2) from $5,000 to $1,000 for nonparty multicandidate political committees.

Requires broadcast licensees to accept voter communications voucher from a candidate and provide broadcast time. Directs the Commission to take a random sampling to evaluate licensee compliance with the requirements of this Act. Amends Federal postal law to mandate reduced rates for certain House of Representatives candidates. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prescribe intended expenditure reporting requirements for candidates for the the House of Representatives who: (1) have not been certified to receive certain benefits (lowered broadcast media or mailing rates, and voter communication vouchers); (2) make independent expenditures over $10,000 during any general, primary, or runoff election period; or (3) during the election cycle expend more than ten percent of the general election expenditure limit from personal funds. Requires the Commission to transmit such reports to the Secretary of the Senate within two working days of receipt. Title II: Expenditures and Contributions -Subtitle A: Independent Expenditures - Defines the scope of cooperative expenditures and declares that cooperative expenditures shall not be treated as independent expenditures. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to revise the equal broadcast time notification requirements for persons who reserve broadcast time through the payment of certain independent expenditures. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prescribe disclosure requirements for certain broadcast communications paid for through independent expenditures. Subtitle B: Provisions Relating to Soft Money of Political Parties - Limits the amount of expenditures which a State party committee may make with respect to the general election campaign of a candidate for President affiliated with such party. Subjects FECA reporting requirements any amount received or expended by party committees with respect to any Federal election. States that the limitations on contributions under the Act applies to transfers between and among political committees. Sets forth limitations on fundraising activities of Federal candidates and officeholders. Requires party national committees and congressional campaign committees to report all receipts and disbursements during certain periods whether or not they are connected to a Federal election. Subtitle C: Contributions - Sets limitations on contributions which may be accepted from a PAC by either a party congressional campaign committee or a party national committee. Revises the guidelines for contributions made through intermediaries and conduits on behalf of a particular candidate. Declares that contributions made by dependents not of voting age shall be treated as having been made by the individual upon whom they are dependent. Authorizes the retention by a candidate of certain excess contributions for future campaign purposes. Title III: Amendments to Internal Revenue Code - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the checkoff amount for the Presidential Election Campaign Fund. Permits a tax credit for up to $100 of contributions to certain qualifying House of Representatives candidates. Provides that candidates shall not be eligible for payments from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund if they have received or solicited funds which are not subject to the reporting requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Title IV: Miscellaneous - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit an incumbent in or candidate for Federal office from establishing or controlling a political committee (other than the candidate's authorized committee, or a party committee). Proscribes fraudulent solicitation of political contributions.
