    "text": "Amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 to replace references to: (1) \"agent\" with \"representative\"; and (2) \"propaganda\" with advocacy or informational materials.\" Includes within the definition of \"political advocacy or informational materials\" any attempt to influence U.S. domestic policy. Excludes from the definition of \"representative of a foreign principal\" any incorporated, nonprofit membership organization organized under U.S. laws that is registered under the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act, that has obtained tax-exempt status, and whose activities are directed in whole by U.S. citizens. Includes within the definition of \"political consultant\" any person who distributes political advocacy or informational materials to a Federal officer or employee, in his or her capacity as an officer or employee. Revises content requirements of registration statements required to be filed by representatives of foreign principals. Requires such representatives to: (1) maintain appropriate financial records and records of activities relating to registration; and (2) file quarterly reports with the Attorney General on activities for which a registration is required. Repeals specified provisions concerning the filing and labeling of political propaganda. Repeals an exemption to registration requirements for persons representing foreign governments whose defense is deemed vital to the defense of the United States. Provides that the exemption from the registration requirement for individuals providing legal representation for a foreign principal before a U.S. agency shall apply only to representation before the Patent and Trademark Office. Requires persons relying on such exemption or on an exemption provided for persons engaging in private and nonpolitical activities or soliciting funds for humanitarian assistance to notify the Attorney General. Makes subject to civil penalties persons who have: (1) failed to file registration statements; or (2) omitted a material fact or made false statements on registration statements. Authorizes the Attorney General to serve civil investigative demands on persons in control of materials relevant to investigations concerning violations of registration requirements. Redesignates the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 as the Foreign Interests Representation Act."
