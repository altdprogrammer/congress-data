Sets carbon dioxide emissions standards for model year 1993 vehicles. Requires the Administrator, in connection with standards established after model year 1993, to: (1) analyze sales trends, fuel efficiency, and emissions data annually; and (2) increase such standards so that the objective of reduced emissions is achieved while revenue neutrality is maintained. Directs the Administrator to establish a fee and rebate program. Requires, beginning with model year 1993: (1) the assessment of fees on buyers of new vehicles with carbon dioxide emissions exceeding the standard for their size class; and (2) the granting of rebates to buyers of new vehicles with carbon dioxide emissions below the standard for their size class. Bases the amount of the fee or rebate on the amount by which emissions are above or below the standard. Directs the Administrator to adjust fees and rebates, based on the annual analysis of sales trends and emissions data. Requires each new vehicle, commencing with model year 1993, to have displayed on the dealer sticker: (1) the carbon dioxide emissions standard for the size class of the vehicle; (2) the average carbon dioxide emissions of the vehicle; and (3) the rebate or fee which the consumer will receive or pay in connection with the purchase of the vehicle. Authorizes appropriations."
