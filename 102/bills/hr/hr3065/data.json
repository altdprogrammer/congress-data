    "text": "National Science Foundation Antarctic Environmental Protection Act of 1991 - Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to issue regulations designating pollutants and to implement a permit program to prevent harm from pollutant discharges by any U.S. person in Antarctica. Requires the Director, in issuing pollution control regulations and permits under this Act, to: (1) ensure that the waste disposal and environmental protection requirements applicable to Antarctica as adopted by the United States or the Antarctica Treaty Parties are made mandatory minimum requirements for all U.S. persons in Antarctica; and (2) provide the same degree of environmental protection to U.S. activities in Antarctica as would be afforded by U.S. environmental laws. Makes it unlawful for U.S. persons, unless such an action is committed under emergency circumstances or to prevent loss of life, to: (1) discharge hazardous or toxic pollutants; (2) engage in the practice of ice staging; (3) transport hazardous or toxic pollutants to Antarctica for disposal purposes; (4) dump waste at sea in Antarctica, except in accordance with specified permits; (5) engage in open burning of wastes at coastal stations; and (6) discharge sewage or wastewater onto ice free land. Requires the Director to: (1) complete a comprehensive solid and hazardous waste management plan for all U.S. Antarctic Program stations, field camps, and operations; (2) implement a solid waste management program at McMurdo Station which is consistent with the NSF Implementation Plan; (3) establish policies to prevent oils, heavy metals, and hazardous and toxic pollutants from entering station wastewater collection systems; (4) permit the discharge of human wastewater into Antarctica coastal waters only after maceration and dilution; and (5) complete and implement recommendations of a hazardous and toxic pollutant spill prevention, control, and counter-measures plan. Prescribes civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Confers responsibility for enforcement of this Act on the Director. Sets forth provisions concerning seizure of property. Requires an environmental audit of U.S. Antarctic Program stations, field camps, and operations to be concluded by an independent panel of experts. Requires the Director to submit a plan for implementing the panel's recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget. Requires the Director, upon completion of the new science facility laboratory at McMurdo Station, to dedicate appropriate personnel and resources within the laboratory to environmental monitoring, assessment, compliance, investigation, and enforcement activity. Directs NSF's Office of the Inspector General to establish procedures for reporting violations of this Act or of other applicable laws. Requires the Director to implement a long-term environmental monitoring program for Antarctica. Requires the Director to report to the Congress on: (1) the adequacy and effectiveness of efforts to control and reduce adverse effects of tourism on Antarctica wildlife, the environment, and the conduct of scientific research; and (2) the need for expanding the protection of Sites of Special Scientific Interest and Specially Protected Areas to include other areas requiring protection from tourist activities. Requires the Director to issue further regulations to apply to U.S. persons as may be necessary to: (1) minimize and prevent such adverse effects; (2) establish qualifications for guides for tourist expeditions to Antarctica; and (3) implement, with respect to such expeditions, any additional safety standards for vessel and air transportation under the weather conditions of that area. Provides for an environmental assessment of major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of Antarctica's environment. Applies such requirement to all activities conducted by Federal agencies or by private or governmental entities receiving Federal assistance for such activities."
