    "text": "Department of Defense Civilian Employee Management Reform Act of 1992 - Revises guidelines for reductions of civilian personnel within the Department of Defense (DOD). Requires the Secretary of Defense (currently, each agency or component of DOD that employs persons who are or may be furloughed) to include annually in budget materials submitted to the Congress a master plan (currently, a five-year master plan) for DOD as a whole, and for each military department, defense agency, or other employing component of DOD. Requires each master plan to include civilian DOD employment information with respect to the previous two, the current, and the upcoming two fiscal years. Outlines information to be provided in each master plan, including a profile of civilian employment levels sufficient to establish and maintain a baseline for tracking annual accessions and losses of DOD civilian personnel and to provide for the analysis of trends in civilian employment levels within DOD as a whole and within its related departments, agencies, and components. Requires annual trends in employment workloads for industrial- and commercial-type activities of DOD that are funded through the Defense Business Operating Fund to also be included in each such master plan. Permits deviation from the guidelines in the master plans when critical to the national security of the United States, requiring congressional notification of such determination by the Secretary, together with the reasons therefor. Prohibits a DOD military department, defense agency, or component from implementing any involuntary reductions or furloughs of civilian DOD personnel until 45 days after notification to the Congress."
