Requires the use of domestic company tax return data from the same taxable year as the year for which minimum effectively connected net investment income calculations are made. Requires the use of a carryover account for year-to-year income comparisons. Allows a foreign company to elect to use the individualized company yield method for determining such company's minimum effectively connected net investment income. Bases such method on United States dollar-denominated assets."
