    "text": "Young American Workers' Bill of Rights - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (the Act) to add and revise requirements relating to child labor standards. Directs the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) and the Census Bureau to compile annual data from State employment security agencies on types of industries and occupations employing individuals under age 18, and cases of violations of child labor standards. Requires employers employing individuals under 18 to report to such State agencies information on any lost-time injury or any illness such individual incurred while at work. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in conjunction with the Secretary, to report annually on the status of child labor in the United States and its attendant safety and health hazards. Prohibits employment of any individual under age 18 who is not a high school graduate unless the employer has in effect a certificate for such employment issued annually with the approval of the minor's parents or guardians, family physician, and appropriate local school officials. Sets forth conditions for issuance of such certificates. Requires the State agency to provide a copy of such certificate to the parents or guardians and the local school district. Requires employers to post child labor law provisions at each premise where child labor is employed. Requires State agencies to report annually to the Secretary on such certificates. Directs the Secretary to revise certain child labor orders relating to: (1) certain types of driving; and (2) use and cleaning of machinery at restaurants and fast food establishments. Directs the Secretary to find and declare that poultry processing, seafood processing, paper bailing, power-driven meat slicing, and pesticide handling are particularly hazardous for employment of children between the ages of 16 and 18, for certain purposes under the Act. Revises a specified child labor regulation to: (1) prohibit individuals under 16 from making door-to-door sales for profit, or from using fryers, baking equipment, and cooking equipment in food service establishments; and (2) eliminate an exemption involving soda fountains, lunch counters, snack bars, or cafeteria serving counters. Increases the fine for certain child labor law violations. Adds criminal penalties of fines or imprisonment for willful violations of child labor laws in cases of: (1) repeat offenders; or (2) resultant serious bodily injury or death to the minor employee. Provides that a prior offense is not a prerequisite for imprisonment for willful violations of child labor provisions. Makes willful violators of child labor provisions who are repeat offenders ineligible: (1) for any direct or indirect Federal grant, contract, or loan, for five years after determination; and (2) to pay a special training wage below the minimum wage rate Provides for civil actions for child labor violators. Makes violators liable for appropriate legal or equitable relief. Directs the Secretary to establish and encourage closer working relationships among Federal and State agencies responsible for enforcing labor, safety and health, and immigration laws. Requires establishment of referral systems among Federal and State labor standards and occupational health and safety enforcement personnel, and of those personnel with Immigration and Naturalization Service enforcement personnel. Directs the Secretary to: (1) seek advice from the private and non-Federal public sectors on the Act and its regulations relating to employment of minors; and (2) establish an Advisory Committee for Child Labor for such purpose. Directs the Secretary to: (1) publish and distribute regionally the addresses, and types of violations of willful violators of child labor laws; and (2) post and otherwise make available to affected school districts the name of each violator of child labor laws, with the location and nature of the violation. Applies certain child labor law provisions of the Act to employers regardless of the annual dollar volume of sales whereby certain enterprises are exempted from coverage under the Act. Prohibits, under the definition of oppressive child labor, employing any person under the age of 14 as a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations to carry out this Act. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary to cover additional costs resulting from the reporting, and recordkeeping and the penalty enforcement requirements of this Act."
