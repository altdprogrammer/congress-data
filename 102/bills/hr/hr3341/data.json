    "text": "Ethics in Government Act Amendments of 1991 - Amends the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to modify the ban on honoraria to allow Federal officers and employees, other than Members of Congress and noncareer officers and employees whose rate of basic pay is equal to or greater than the rate of basic pay payable for Level V of the Executive Schedule, to receive an honorarium for an article in a bona fide publication, a speech, or an appearance if: (1) the subject of the article or speech or purpose of the appearance does not relate primarily to the responsibilities, policies, or programs of the agency or office in which the individual is employed, and does not involve the use of Government time, property, or other resources of the Government, or nonpublic Government information; (2) the reasons for which the honorarium is paid are unrelated to that individual's official duties or status; and (3) the person offering the honorarium has no interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of that individual's official duties. Prohibits the amount of honorarium accepted from exceeding the usual and customary fee for the services for which the honorarium is paid, up to $2,000. Subjects the acceptance of any honorarium to financial disclosure under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. Makes such provisions effective as of January 1, 1991. Requires the rules and regulations of each supervising ethics office (ethics office) designated under the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 to include procedures under which noncareer officers and employees who occupy a senior level position (a position classified above GS-15 of the General Schedule) or a non-General Schedule position for which the rate of basic pay is equal to or greater than 120 percent of the minimum rate of basic pay payable for GS-15 must notify their respective ethics office before accepting any of the honoraria permitted above that, in the aggregate, equal or exceed $200 in value from any one source in a calendar year. Requires each ethics office to compile all notifications received during each calendar quarter. Requires such compilations to be made available to the public in accordance with the guidelines set forth under the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 governing public access to ethics office reports. Requires any person who fails to notify the appropriate ethics office before accepting honoraria to: (1) pay an amount equal to the value of the honoraria involved for deposit in the general fund of the Treasury; and (2) be subject to appropriate disciplinary action in accordance with applicable law. Revises the definition of \"honorarium\" as revised under the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1992 to make such definition applicable to a series of appearances, speeches, or articles under the same provisions applicable to an appearance, speech, or article. Amends the Federal Criminal Code to prohibit the application of the postemployment restrictions on Members of Congress and congressional employees and on certain senior and very senior personnel of the executive branch and independent agencies to a communication or appearance made solely on behalf of a candidate for Federal or State office, in his or her capacity as a candidate, a political party, or certain political organizations, with specified exceptions, such as in the case of any communication to, or appearance before, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) by a former FEC officer or employee. States that a former officer or employee who is subject to the restrictions on Members of Congress and officers and employees of the legislative branch, as in effect before January 1, 1991, shall, notwithstanding such prohibitions, be permitted to make such a communication and appearance as though such restrictions in effect on or after January 1, 1991, were applicable to such former officer or employee. Provides that the new financial disclosure thresholds under the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1992 for reporting gifts and travel reimbursements will take effect with respect to gifts and reimbursements received on or after January 1, 1992."
