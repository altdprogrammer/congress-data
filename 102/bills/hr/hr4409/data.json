    "text": "National Marine Sanctuaries Reauthorization Act - Amends title III (Marine Sanctuaries) of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to modify: (1) various definitions; (2) the factors to be considered, and the procedures to be used, in designating sanctuaries; and (3) provisions relating to certain access and use rights. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to carry out research, monitoring, and education activities. Declares that proceeds from forfeiture actions constitute a separate recovery in addition to any amounts recovered as civil penalties or damages. Declares that specified other provisions of Federal law limiting the liability of a vessel owner do not limit recovery under the Act. Removes provisions regulating the use of civil penalties. Modifies the required use of other recovered amounts. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes establishment of advisory councils to assist in the management of sanctuaries. Prohibits: (1) destruction or injury of any marine sanctuary resource; (2) possession, sale, or transportation of any sanctuary resource taken in violation of these prohibitions; and (3) any violation of the title amended by this Act. Designates title III as the National Marine Sanctuaries Act."
