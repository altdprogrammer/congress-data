Requires the Director of the Service (Director) to appoint a Wilderness Division Chief to supervise management of its portions of the System. Requires the President's budget to the Congress for each fiscal year after the enactment of this Act to identify specifically, in a line item separate from other U.S. Fish and Wildlife programs, funds to be expended by the Service on wilderness management. Declares that such appropriated funds shall be spent on wilderness management only. Requires the Director to establish and maintain a national wilderness monitoring system, based on the best available science, to monitor the condition of the wilderness resource within the Service's portions of the System. Requires the Secretary, beginning in 1995 and every five years thereafter, to report to the President and specified congressional committees on the condition of the wilderness resource on the Service's lands, identifying steps the Secretary plans to take to reverse any degradation or deterioration. Requires the Director to: (1) develop guidelines for a personnel evaluation system for each line officer with wilderness management responsibilities; and (2) establish a field wilderness ranger program for each national wildlife refuge with wilderness. Requires the Service: (1) to complete Wilderness Management Plans for each wilderness area designated on or before the enactment of this Act; and (2) within two years after non-designated areas have been designated, to complete such plans for them. Requires the Secretary and other U.S. departments that manage wilderness to establish a national wilderness education program to educate the American people on wilderness laws and policies, values of wilderness, wilderness ecological processes, and ways to minimize visitor impacts on the wilderness resource. Requires the Secretary to: (1) protect cultural resource sites in wilderness areas; (2) encourage specified scientific research in them; and (3) establish wilderness research programs within the Service. Requires the President's budget to the Congress for each fiscal year after the enactment of this Act to identify specifically, in a line item separate from other research programs, funds to be spent by the Agency on wilderness research. Authorizes appropriations."
