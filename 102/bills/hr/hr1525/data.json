    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require States to adopt 20-year solid waste management plans. Authorizes a State which has adopted such a plan to enact and enforce laws imposing fees on, and regulating the treatment and disposal of, solid waste within such State that was generated in another State. Requires States, at least once every five years, to report to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the implementation of plans. Grants congressional approval to two or more States to enter into compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in solid waste management. Authorizes the EPA Administrator to promulgate regulations exempting waste types or recycling practices from management under this Act if such exemption promotes the development of an interstate market for recyclable materials or environmentally sound waste disposal practices. Permits any person to petition for the promulgation of such regulations."
