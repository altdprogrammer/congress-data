Directs the Attorney General to establish guidelines for the reporting of child abuser information, including procedures for: (1) establishing a national centralized source of information on child abusers; (2) assisting in the prevention of second incidents of child abuse by providing information about child abusers to child welfare organizations; and (3) providing statistical and informational data on child abuse to the Department of Justice, the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, and the Congress. Requires the Attorney General to publish an annual statistical summary of the child abuser information reported under this Act. Provides for: (1) a reduction by 25 percent of formula grants under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 for States not complying within three years with the reporting requirements of this Act; and (2) the reallocation of such funds to States in compliance."
