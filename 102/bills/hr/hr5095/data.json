Revises the definition of civilian service includable in the calculation of a participant's period of service. Prohibits certain prior service credit unless retirement deductions or a deposit have been made.

Provides that, unless otherwise expressly provided by a spousal agreement or court order, a qualified former spouse of an employee covered under FERS is entitled to a share of the balance in the employee's account in the Thrift Savings Fund on the date of divorce equal to 50 percent of the account balance that accrued during the period of the marriage. Specifies that: (1) the qualified former spouse's benefit is to be paid in a lump sum upon receipt by the DCI of the divorce decree or any applicable court order or spousal agreement, together with any information or documentation that the DCI may require; (2) if the qualified former spouse dies before payment of the benefit to which he or she is entitled, payment is to be made to the estate of the qualified former spouse; (3) payment to one individual bars recovery by any other individual; and (4) no payment may be made by the DCI if the date on which the divorce becomes final occurs after the date the account has been closed or an annuity contract has been purchased. Specifies that, in the case of any employee or retired employee who has a qualified former spouse who is covered by a court order or who is a party to a spousal agreement, any right of the qualified former spouse to retirement and survivor benefits, to any TSP benefit, and to any lump-sum credit under CIARA, and the amount of any such benefit or payment, shall be determined in accordance with such agreement or order if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of such agreement or order that are not inconsistent with requirements under CIARA. Directs that the sums deducted from the salary of a reemployed annuitant be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the Fund. Sets forth the interest rate applicable to voluntary contributions after December 31, 1984.
