    "text": "Aviation Noise Limit Act of 1992 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to develop a staged plan to reduce by at least 75 percent on or before January 1, 2001, the number of individuals residing in residential areas in the vicinity of an airport who are exposed to a yearly day-night average sound level of 60 decibels or above. Requires the Secretary in developing such plan to consider various methods for aviation noise reduction, including soundproofing, relocation incentives, use of quieter aircraft, operations restrictions, and revision of air routes. Authorizes the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to make airspace traffic changes in residential areas if they will not result in an increase in aviation noise. Requires the Secretary to assume responsibility for compliance with the requirements of this Act with respect to all non-military aviation activity."
