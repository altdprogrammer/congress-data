    "text": "Abandoned Infants Assistance Act Amendments of 1991 - Amends the Abandoned Infant Assistance Act of 1988 to revise and extend various grant programs. Adds as a goal of the comprehensive services under such Act support of families to prevent abandonment of infants and children. Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) from making any demonstration grant (for projects regarding abandonment of infants and young children in hospitals, under title I of such Act) unless the grant applicant agrees to give priority to abandoned infants and young children who: (1) are infected with, or have been perinatally exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); or (2) have been perinatally exposed to a dangerous drug (hereinafter referred to as priority abandoned children). Adds provisions for demonstration project grants for comprehensive service centers. Authorizes the Secretary to make such grants to model programs providing health, educational, and social services at a single site in a geographic area in which reside a significant number of priority abandoned children in order to prevent abandonment and to care for those who have been abandoned. Includes the provision of services to all members of the natural family for any condition that increases the probability of abandonment of an infant or young child, under such demonstration projects to prevent abandonment. Specifies that the abandoned infants and young children who are to be given particular consideration under residential care programs are those who are unable to reside with their families or to be placed in foster care. Revises provisions for a study and report on numbers of abandoned infants and young children. Extends until April 1, 1992, the deadline for the Secretary to complete a study and report to the Congress on: (1) the number of infants and young children abandoned in hospitals in the United States and the number of such infants and young children infected with or perinatally exposed to HIV or perinatally exposed to a dangerous drug (priority abandoned children); and (2) an estimate of the annual cost to Federal, State, and local governments in providing housing and care for such infants and young children. Defines the terms dangerous drug and natural family for purposes of such Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1995 for: (1) carrying out programs under such Act in general; (2) dissemination of information for individuals with special needs; and (3) administrative expenses, with specified limitations. Requires such funds to remain available until expended. Repeals a provision for program termination which prohibited any demonstration grant after FY 1991."
