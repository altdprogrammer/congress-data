    "text": "Chief Big Foot National Memorial Park and Wounded Knee National Memorial Establishment Act of 1992 - Establishes the Big Foot National Memorial Park in South Dakota to protect the historical significance of the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre site and to protect and promote Sioux history and culture. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to acquire lands for the Park by: (1) accepting leasehold interests in tribal trust lands located on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation offered by the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, under specified conditions; and (2) purchase, donation, or condemnation of all surface and subsurface rights to any tract of fee patented land which the Director of the National Park Service deems necessary to include in the Park. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to provide all assistance necessary (including financial assistance) to the Oglala Sioux Tribe in acquiring lands within the Wounded Knee Massacre site as defined in the 1990 boundaries studies authorized by the National Park Service. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to manage such leasehold lands as a unit of the National Park System. Exempts all enrolled members of specified tribes from admission fees into the Park. Directs the Secretary to collect such fees from all other persons entering the Park. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the Oglala Sioux Tribe to provide training to tribal members on the interpretation, management, protection, and preservation of historical properties and in the provision of public services on their respective Reservation. Directs the Secretary to give preference to employing qualified members of such Tribes in the development, interpretation and management of the Park and in related activities. Requires the Secretary to plan, design, and construct, within the boundaries of the Park, the Wounded Knee National Memorial (a suitable and appropriate memorial dedicated to the Indian victims of the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre). Vests responsibility in the Secretary, acting through the National Park Service, for the operation, maintenance, upkeep, and repair of the memorial and the related structure located on the Cheyenne River Reservation. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on the feasibility of: (1) establishing and marking the route taken by Chief Big Foot and his band from the Cheyenne River Reservation to Wounded Knee as a national historic trail; (2) establishing an information/orientation center on Interstate 90 at Cactus Flats and a visitor center on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation; and (3) establishing the Crazy Horse Memorial Highway (a scenic two lane highway) from Interstate 90 to Wounded Knee and westward from Wounded Knee to Highway 79. Prohibits a Federal agency from issuing a license or permit to any persons to conduct any activity within the Park which could affect the resources or values of it unless the Secretary determines that such proposed activity will be conducted in a manner consistent with the standards and criteria established pursuant to the general management plan required by this Act and will not have a significant adverse effect on the resources or values of the Park. Makes these provisions applicable only with respect to activities commencing and licenses or permits issued after the enactment of this Act. Establishes the Chief Big Foot National Memorial Park Advisory Commission within the Department of the Interior to advise the Director of the National Park Service on the planning, management, and administration of the Park. Requires the Secretary, acting through the National Park Service, to develop and transmit to specified congressional committees a general management plan for the park describing the appropriate uses and development of it. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with tribal organizations or nonprofit corporations to raise funds from private sources to: (1) supplement Federal funds authorized by this Act; and (2) plan, design, construct, operate, and maintain specified projects. Authorizes appropriations."
