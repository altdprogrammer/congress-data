    "text": "NOAA Fleet Modernization Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to implement a 15-year program to replace and modernize the fleet of research vessels owned or operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Mandates a plan for the program and preparation of requirements for each class of vessels to be constructed or converted. Authorizes, subject to conditions, multiyear contracts for: (1) acquisition of the vessels; and (2) oceanographic research, fisheries research, and mapping and charting services to assist in fulfilling NOAA missions. Prohibits awarding a contract for the construction, repair, or alteration of any NOAA vessel in a foreign shipyard if the foreign shipyard benefits from excessive subsidies. Requires, for the fleet replacement and modernization program, use of excess capacity of University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System vessels. Mandates consultation regarding interoperability of NOAA and Navy vessels. Authorizes appropriations. Requires unobligated amounts appropriated for fleet modernization, shipbuilding, and conversion under the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1992 to be obligated in accordance with this Act."
