    "text": "Canyon Ferry Recreation Management Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), to enter into cooperative management agreements with Montana and any other entity deemed necessary to manage the recreational resources of the Canyon Ferry Recreation Area, Montana. Directs that such management agreement provide that the management responsibilities given to the BLM for lands withdrawn or acquired for reclamation purposes shall be accomplished in accordance with the statutory authority generally exercised by BLM in the management of public lands. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to change, modify, or expand the authorized purposes of the Canyon Ferry Unit. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to manage recreation facilities at Canyon Ferry Reservoir pursuant to the Canyon Ferry Resource Plan prepared by Montana and approved by the BOR and the BLM. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Federal Water Project Recreation Act to remove the limitation on authorized appropriations for the Secretary to provide for public outdoor recreation and fish and wildlife enhancement facilities projects at Federal reservoirs, with an exception. (Currently, the maximum appropriation is $100,000 per project.)"
