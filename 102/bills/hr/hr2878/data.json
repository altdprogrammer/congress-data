    "text": "Magnetic Levitation Research, Development, and Construction Act of 1991 - Establishes a national magnetic levitation design program to be managed jointly by the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works (Assistant Secretary). Directs the Secretary and Assistant Secretary to establish a National Meglev Joint Project Office. Requires them to develop and transmit to appropriate congressional committees a national strategic plan for the design and construction of a prototype magnetic levitation system. Authorizes eligible participants to submit to the Meglev Project Office a proposal for research and development of a conceptual design for a magnetic levitation system and an application for a grant to conduct such research and development (R and D). Directs the Secretary and Assistant Secretary to: (1) award one-year phase-one R and D to grants to no less than six applicants which agree to report the results to such Office and provide for the ten percent non-Federal share of the grant costs; (2) select not more than three participants to receive one-year phase-two grants for R and D leading to a final design for a magnetic levitation system if they agree to provide for the 20 percent non-Federal share of such grant costs; (3) select, after receiving such final design, one design for development into a full scale prototype magnetic levitation system; and (4) award, after selection of such design, one prototype construction grant to a State, local government, organization of State or local governments, consortium of U.S. private businesses, or any combination of such entities in order to construct a prototype magnetic levitation system in accordance with such design. Requires the Secretary and Assistant Secretary to provide to appropriate congressional committees periodic reports on progress made with regard to such systems. Prohibits the disclosure of trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential which is obtained from a U.S. business, research, or education entity as a result of activities under this Act. Subjects the research, development, and use of any technology developed pursuant to agreement under this Act, including the terms under which any technology may be licensed and resulting royalties distributed, to the provisions of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980. Authorizes the Secretary and Assistant Secretary to require grant recipients to assure that research and development be performed and that products of inventions made under such agreeement be manufactured substantially in the United States. Amends the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1987 to require the Secretary (current law authorizes the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration) to authorize States to make available without charge, to a publicly or privately owned authority or company, any lands and rights-of-way, where sufficient, within the publicly acquired rights-of-way of highways built with Federal funds in order to accommodate passenger or commuter rail, high speed ground transportation systems (including magnetic levitation systems or steel-wheel high speed rail systems), or highway public mass transit facilities. Authorizes States to permit governmental use, use by public or private entities for high speed ground transportation systems (including magnetic levitation systems), or other transit utility use and occupancy of airspace rights-of-way, without charge, for transportation projects funded under such Act or this Act. Authorizes appropriations from the Highway Trust Fund."
