Exempts from Federal regulation the sale or transportation of natural gas in closed containers by any person who is not otherwise a public utility to another person for the use as vehicular fuel. States that a company shall not be considered to be a gas utility company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 solely because it owns or operates vehicular natural gas distribution facilities. Permits a company registered under such Act solely because of its ownership of gas utility company voting securities to acquire any interest in any company that is not a public utility company and whose primary business relates directly to specified vehicular natural gas activities."
