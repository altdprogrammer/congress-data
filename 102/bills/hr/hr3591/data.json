Subrogates to the United States any insurance claim such an entity or person has. Terminates the inclusion after a specified date. Prohibits grants under provisions relating to migrant or community health centers, health services for the homeless, or health services for residents of public housing unless the applicant has: (1) implemented policies and procedures to assure against malpractice and the risk of lawsuits; (2) reviewed the professional credentials, claims history, and other information regarding its licensed health care practitioners; (3) no history of claims against it (or its officers, employees, or contractor) under such provisions relating to officers and employees of the Public Health Service, or has cooperated with the Attorney General in defending against such claims and has taken corrective action; and (4) has cooperated with the Attorney General in providing information relating to an estimate of expected claims. Empowers the Attorney General, if certain conditions are met, to determine that an individual physician or other practitioner not be deemed a Public Health Service employee for purposes of these provisions. Prohibits hospitals from denying admitting privileges to an otherwise qualified health care provider who is an officer, employee, or contractor of such an entity. Mandates an annual estimate of the amount of expected claims and withholding that amount from the appropriation for each involved grant program."
