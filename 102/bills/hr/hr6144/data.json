    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-10-05", 
    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a program to assist eligible members of the armed forces after their separation from active duty to: (1) obtain certification in the occupations of the allied health professions, nursing, and social work; and (2) fill employment vacancies in such occupations existing in community health centers that serve medically underserved populations, other nonprofit community health centers, and nursing homes that participate in State Medicaid (title XIX of the Social Security Act) programs (underprivileged and Medicaid health services). Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a survey to identify those States with alternative certification requirements for allied health professionals, nursing professionals, or social workers; and (2) periodically request information from such States to identify underprivileged and Medicaid health services that are experiencing a shortage of allied health professionals, nursing professionals, or social workers. Makes eligible for the program members of the armed forces who: (1) during the five-year period beginning on October 1, 1992, are discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions after two or more years of continuous active-duty service immediately before such discharge; (2) have received a minimum of a high school diploma or its equivalent; and (3) are certified as allied health professionals, nursing professionals, or social workers or are determined by the Secretary as likely to obtain such certification within a reasonable time after discharge or release. Authorizes the Secretary to accept program applications from members discharged or released during the period between October 1, 1990, and October 1, 1992, if other eligibility conditions are met. Outlines application requirements. Requires the Secretary to give priority to members who have educational or military experience related to health care or social work or in another subject area identified by the Secretary as important for national health care objectives. Requires sufficient appropriated funds before program operation. Requires members chosen for the program to enter into an agreement with the Secretary in which the member agrees to either obtain certification as a health or nursing professional or social worker within a reasonable time period or, within such time period, to obtain full-time employment within the underprivileged and Medicaid health services. Directs the Secretary to pay a stipend to participating members during their period of obtaining certification or while seeking employment. Requires stipend reimbursement upon failure to meet program agreement conditions, with exceptions. Sets forth similar provisions requiring the Secretary to establish a program to assist eligible civilian employees of the Departments of Defense and Energy to either obtain certification in such fields or to obtain employment in the underprivileged and Medicaid health services. Makes eligible for such program employees who were terminated (no two-year minimum service requirement necessary) from such employment as a result of reductions in defense spending or the closure or realignment of a military installation. Provides similar provisions as under the armed forces program with respect to applications, participant selections, priorities in employment, required appropriations, agreement conditions, and stipend payments."
