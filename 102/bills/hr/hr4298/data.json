Establishes the Abandoned Mine Remediation Trust Fund consisting of a Federal Account and a State Account to share equally in revenues from the excise tax on cyanide used in mining or mineral activities. Authorizes expenditures from the Federal account for the reclamation and restoration of land and water resources adversely affected by past mineral (other than coal or fluid minerals) and mineral materials mining. Authorizes expenditures from the State Account for mining-related cleanup, research into the consequences of intensive metals production, and monitoring and enforcement."
