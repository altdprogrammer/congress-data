    "text": "Health Care Fraud Prosecution Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide penalties for fraud by health care providers in connection with the provision of, or payments or reimbursement for, health care services or suuplies, when: (1) the loss caused by the fraudulent conduct exceeds $10,000; or (2) the offender has previously been convicted of fraud in Federal or State court. Limits such penalties to ten years' imprisonment, unless the offense caused serious physical injury to, or endangered the life of, a patient (up to 20 years' imprisonment) or caused the death of a patient (up to life imprisonment). Specifies that the sentencing court: (1) shall order the offender to pay restitution to the patient and to the United States as payor for losses sustained as a result of the offender's fraudulent activity; and (2) may order the offender to pay restitution to others who sustained losses as a result of such activity. Provides for civil and criminal forfeiture of the proceeds of health care fraud. Authorizes the Attorney General to make payments of up to $10,000 to persons who furnish information unknown to the Government relating to a possible prosecution for health care fraud, with exceptions. Authorizes appropriations for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Attorneys, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to hire, equip, and train personnel in connection with the investigation and prosecution of health-care fraud cases. Includes within the scope of the mail fraud statute cases involving matter to be sent or delivered by any private or commercial interstate carrier."
