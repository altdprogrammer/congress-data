    "text": "Interstate Banking Efficiency Act of 1992 - Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to permit interstate banking acquisitions and branching by a bank holding company or foreign bank, subject to certain concentration and consolidation limitations. Preempts certain state statutory proscriptions against such interstate transactions. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and other specified Federal banking law to permit interstate branching by national banks, subject to State imposed conditions upon such branching. Sets forth bank concentration limitations. Permits a State to prohibit out-of-State national and State banks from establishing branches within such State, but only if it passes a law expressly doing so within the three years after enactment of this Act. Amends the International Banking Act of 1978 to permit interstate banking operations by foreign banks. Prescribes operational parameters. Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to prescribe guidelines for the permissible consolidation of subsidiary banks of bank holding companies. Sets forth minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions to engage in interstate banking and branching operations. Amends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to set forth State-by-State evaluation guidelines for branches of interstate banks. Requires Federal banking regulatory agencies to prescribe regulations prohibiting interstate branching operations undertaken primarily for the purpose of deposit production. Requires such regulations to include guidelines for: (1) meeting community and market area credit needs; and (2) limiting out-of-State loans. Retains the rights of State and local subdivisions to impose non-discriminatory franchise taxes or other non-property taxes. Grants States and local governments visitorial powers over any Federal depository institution for tax compliance purposes."
