    "text": "Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require air carriers that have acquired a certificate transferring air route authority from another air carrier to hire from such air carrier, in order of seniority, no less than the number of employees required to operate such route. Affords such hired employees seniority integration protections provided in Tiger International Seaboard Acquisition Case, CAB Docket 33712. Provides for the enforcement of such seniority protections by U.S. district courts. Amends the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 to declare that air carrier employees who are furloughed or terminated by an air carrier (other than for cause) prior to the last day of the 17-year (currently, ten-year) period beginning upon enactment of such Act shall have first right of hire, regardless of age in his or her occupational speciality by any other air carrier that is hiring additional employees."
