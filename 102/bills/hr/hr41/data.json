Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary), within 90 days, to study and report, with recommendations, to the Congress on: (1) the numbers of mentally and physically impaired individuals in the United States who are employed and not employed; and (2) the extent to which such individuals who are not employed are potentially capable of performing some type of labor. Title II: Program for Disadvantaged Persons - Directs the Secretary, within one year, to study and report to the Congress on: (1) the number of unemployed individuals in the United States who are disadvantaged because of poverty, geographical residence, or other causes; and (2) the feasibility of securing employment for such individuals through federally-subsidized employment opportunities (assisted by private enterprise and State and local governments), relocation assistance, if desired, and Federal employment when no other employment opportunities can be developed."
