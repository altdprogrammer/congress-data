    "date": "1991-09-24", 
    "text": "State Solid Waste Management Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize each State to enact and enforce laws: (1) regulating the treatment, disposal, and other disposition of solid waste within such State, including imposing fees; and (2) banning the importation of solid waste beginning five years after enactment of this Act if the State has an approved solid waste management plan. Authorizes two or more States to negotiate an agreement or compact, not in conflict with a Federal law or treaty, to provide for the treatment, disposal, or other disposition of solid waste (but no such agreement or compact shall take effect until approved by the Congress). Exempts specified waste from such regulation. Requires State solid waste management plans to require that the State: (1) identify the amount of solid wastes by waste type that are reasonably expected to be generated within the State or accepted from another State during the 20-year period following enactment of this Act; (2) identify the amount of solid waste to be reduced during such 20-year period through source reduction, recycling, and resource recovery; and (3) establish a process to assure the availability of solid waste treatment storage and disposal facilities permitted under such Act. Requires a State, when identifying the amount of solid waste management capacity necessary for the solid waste identified, to take into account solid waste management compacts in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act within the State and one or more States. Requires that a State solid waste management plan: (1) include procedures for the development of new and expanded solid waste management facilities, including the establishment of a process for the siting, and a schedule for the approval and construction, of such facilities; (2) describe solid waste management practices and programs, based on the State's environmental and economic conditions, to promote source reduction and recycling; (3) set forth specified recycling goals; (4) identify existing State and regional markets for recyclable materials and actions that the State will take to promote and develop recycling markets; (5) provide for a program requiring all solid waste management facilities to register with the State and that only registered facilities may manage solid waste identified in the plan; (6) identify and coordinate the responsibilities of State, local, and regional authorities; (7) provide for technical and financial assistance to local communities to meet plan requirements; and (8) specify the conditions under which the State will authorize a person to accept solid waste from other States, for purposes of solid waste management other than transportation, and ensure that such waste is managed in accordance with the plan and that acceptance of such waste will not impede the ability of the State of final destination to manage solid waste generated within its borders. Sets forth additional plan requirements, unless the State demonstrates that their inclusion is impracticable, including: (1) a policy requiring the State and its political subdivisions to procure products made with recyclable materials; and (2) a program to encourage composting. Sets forth plan submission and approval procedures. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a plan for any State that fails to do so. Requires the Administrator to provide financial assistance to States for solid waste management, source reduction, or recycling activities. Authorizes the Administrator to award matching grants for creating and supporting innovative techniques for the recycling of solid waste. Prohibits the receipt of more than one grant and places a ceiling on the amount for a single recipient. Authorizes appropriations."
