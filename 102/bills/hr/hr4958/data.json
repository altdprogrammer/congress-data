    "text": "Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 - Prohibits, as of four years after enactment of this Act, the U.S. importation of any exotic bird species which is not included in an approved species list to be established by the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) or otherwise permitted by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to establish specific annual species quotas based upon specified criteria. Requires the Secretary, in the absence of any specific quota, to establish general quotas which shall reduce imports by 25 percent during each year of the four-year phase-in period. Directs the Secretary to establish an approved list of exotic birds which may be imported without an import permit. Sets forth inclusion criteria. Authorizes any person to petition the Secretary to establish or remove a quota, restriction, or moratorium under this Act. Makes it unlawful to import into the United States a species subject to a moratorium, or to import beyond permitted limits a species subject to import restrictions. Authorizes the Secretary to allow, through the issuance of import permits, the importation of any exotic bird upon determination that such importation is not detrimental to the species' survival and that the bird is being imported for one of the following reasons: (1) scientific research; (2) a personal pet; (3) zoological display; (4) religious purposes; or (5) cooperative breeding programs. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties. Authorizes the Secretary to take specified action with regard to the conservation or conditions for international trade of other wildlife and plant species. Establishes the Exotic Bird Conservation Fund. Authorizes the Secretary to review opportunities for a voluntary program of bird labeling, retail outlet and breeding facilities certification, and privately run foreign technical assistance. Authorizes appropriations."
