    "text": "Workplace Education Act of 1992 - Amends the National Literacy Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-73) (the Act) to direct the Secretary of Labor to establish in the Employment and Training Administration an Office of Workplace Education (the Office) to provide workplace education services for small businesses. Requires the Director of the Office to make grants to States to establish workplace education programs to improve the productivity of small businesses in such States. Requires each State receiving such a grant to establish a State office of workplace education in one of the following: (1) a State agency responsible for education, training, or economic development policy; (2) a State literacy resource center; or (3) an institution of higher education. Requires such State office to: (1) establish workplace education districts throughout the State; (2) hire workforce specialists; and (3) place one of them, including necessary support staff, in one of the institutions of higher education located in each district. Sets forth duties of each specialist and the State office. Sets forth requirements for such districts. Requires the State office to make demonstration grants to eligible small businesses to pay the cost of instructional services and course materials of any such workplace education program attributable to the employees of such businesses. Sets forth limitations on the amounts and uses of such demonstration grants and on administrative costs. Sets forth requirements for non-Federal matching funds. Requires grant allocations to States to be based on population, but limits the percentage of funds which may go to any one State. Requires annual grant program reports and evaluations by the Secretary to the President and the Congress. Defines workplace education as employer-sponsored formal instructional programs for workers which: (1) must include programs to improve at least one or more academic skills, including reading, writing, mathematics, or English as a second language; and (2) may include programs to improve one or more process skills, including problem-solving and interpersonal skills (such as effective communication and analytic reasoning). Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to require a specified portion of JTPA funds for training services for the disadvantaged to be made available for the Office of Workplace Education and the workplace education grant program under the Act. Reduces the percentage of non-economically disadvantaged individuals allowed to participate in JTPA training services for the disadvantaged."
