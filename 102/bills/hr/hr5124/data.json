Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to prohibit the Civil Aeronautics Board (sic) from taking action with respect to deceptive advertisement violations committed by such air carriers if such violation also constitutes a violation under the Federal Trade Commission Act and this Act. Requires the FTC to issue a final rule which at a minimum provides that dissemination of any advertisement for air transportation between two points by an air carrier which contains a rate for such transportation shall constitute an unfair or deceptive practice affecting commerce, unless: (1) the advertisement clearly and conspicuously discloses all material restrictions governing the rate offered; (2) the rate includes all costs for obtaining such air transportation (including taxes, fees, fuel, and other surcharges) and is the round trip rate (if a round-trip ticket must be purchased to obtain such rate); and (3) the advertisement also contains the minimum number of seats per flight to which such rate applies."
