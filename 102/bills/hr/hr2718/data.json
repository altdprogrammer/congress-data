Makes changes to the composition and the term of appointment of the members of the board of directors of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. Requires such members to hold elective political office while serving on the board (currently, members cannot hold elective or appointive political office). Requires certain board and Airports Authority actions to be reviewed by specified congressional committees. Prohibits board actions which could result in a change in the impact of aircraft noise in the vicinity of a Metropolitan Washington Airport from taking effect unless the board notifies, and submits such actions for review by, a specified committee of the Washington Council of Governments."
