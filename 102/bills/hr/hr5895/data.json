Authorizes appropriations. Provides for contributions by developing countries as a condition of participation in Foundation programs. Directs the Foundation's Board of Governors to designate between four and ten regional centers of excellence to encourage the provision of U.S. environmental technology, environmental education and training, and other environmental assistance to developing countries.
