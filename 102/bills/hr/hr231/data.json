    "text": "National Solid Waste Minimization Act - Declares as national goals: (1) no increase in the generation of solid waste over the level generated in the year of enactment of this Act; and (2) recycling of at least 25 percent of the municipal solid waste stream by the end of 1994 and 40 percent by the end of 2000. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to report to the Congress annually on: (1) the amount and composition of municipal solid waste generated in the United States and the methods used to manage such waste; and (2) the progress made in achieving the source reduction and recycling goals of this Act, the impediments to the attainment of such goals, and recommendations on the regulatory or legislative initiatives necessary to attain such goals. Directs the Administrator to develop a list of categories of commonly used products and packaging which are discarded into the municipal solid waste stream. Requires the Administrator, with respect to each category, to determine: (1) the percentage of recovered materials used in the manufacture of products or packaging of each category; and (2) the percentage of products or packaging of each category that is recycled upon discard. Directs the Administrator to identify categories of products or packaging that shall be targeted for regulatory action. States that such regulatory action may include either or both of the following: (1) the required use of recovered materials in the product or packaging; or (2) a ban on the use of certain materials in the product or packaging. Directs the Administrator and the Secretary of Commerce to develop a voluntary system of packaging standards with respect to materials contained within the packaging and the recyclability of the packaging upon discard. Provides that packaging that meets such standards shall be eligible to use a label indicating compliance with the standards. Authorizes the Administrator to promulgate regulations to: (1) require any products or packaging that are recyclable to be so labeled; and (2) establish requirements for labels that indicate that a product or packaging is made of recycled materials or is recyclable. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress on the costs and difficulties encountered by States and local communities in closing landfills."
