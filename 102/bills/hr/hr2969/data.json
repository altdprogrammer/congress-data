Exempts the District of Columbia courts and the District of Columbia Council from coverage under this Act. Permits the District government to separate an officer or employee subject to its merit system if: (1) such officer's or employee's position is determined by the District of Columbia Council to be excessive; and (2) the separation is implemented during the 18-month period that begins on the date of enactment of the Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act Emergency Amendment Act of 1991. Authorize the District of Columbia to issue general obligation bonds to finance its outstanding general fund deficit for FY 1990. Ceases the issuance of such bonds after September 30, 1992. Waives the period for congressional review for the General Fund Recovery Act of 1991. Makes such Act effective upon its enactment or the enactment of this Act."
