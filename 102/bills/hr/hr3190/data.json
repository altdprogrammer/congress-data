    "text": "Replacement and Alternative Fuels Act of 1991 - Requires the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) to establish a program to: (1) promote the development and use of domestic-produced replacement and alternative fuels to replace conventional petroleum motor fuels; and (2) ensure the availability of those replacement and alternative motor fuels which will have the greatest impact in improving air quality. Prescribes development plan and production goals. Sets a timetable by which the Secretary must prescribe the minimum percentage of domestic-produced replacement and alternative fuels on an energy equivalent basis to be sold in specified calendar years by any refiner for use as a motor fuel. Prescribes minimum percentages of domestically produced replacement fuel to be sold in specified calendar years, if such requirements appear feasible based on a required updated review. Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations for the exchange of marketable credits among: (1) refiners; (2) persons who first sell alternative motor fuels into interstate commerce for transportation purposes; and (3) manufacturers of electricity-powered vehicles. (Provides for a three-year exemption from, and further adjustments of, such minimum percentage requirements in the case of domestic refineries of crude oil with a daily capacity below a specified level.) Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress upon completion of a specified review. Requires each refiner to report annually to the Secretary the percentage of domestic-produced replacement fuel, on an energy equivalent basis, contained in the total quantity of motor fuel sold during the preceding calendar year, and the amount of alternative motor fuels, sold or credited to such refiner during such year. Requires each person who first sells alternative fuels to report annually to the Secretary the amount of alternative fuel sold into interstate commerce for transportation purposes, and the amount of credits sold to refiners. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to report annually to the Secretary (of Energy) the number of dual fuel and dedicated alternative fuel vehicles manufactured and sold into interstate commerce by each manufacturer each year. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to report to the Congress on the environmental impact potential of developing replacement fuels and alternative fuels. Establishes civil penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Secretary to issue regulations requiring certain motor fuel retailers to have alternative motor fuels available for sale."
