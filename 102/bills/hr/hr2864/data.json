Directs the Administration to establish and operate the National Ombudsman Resource Center to assist State Long-Term Care Ombudsmen and the representatives of the Ombudsmen in carrying out State long-term care programs. Directs the Commissioner of the Administration on Aging to establish a National Center on Elder Abuse to: (1) compile an annual summary of recently conducted research on elder abuse; (2) develop and maintain an information clearinghouse on all programs for the prevention and treatment of such abuse; (3) compile training materials for personnel engaged in elder abuse prevention; (4) provide technical assistance for the planning and implementation of programs relating to the problems of elder abuse; and (5) conduct research and demonstration projects regarding the causes and national incidence of elder abuse. Authorizes the Commissioner to operate such Center directly or through a grant or contract. Extends the deadline for the annual Administration report to the Congress on complaints and conditions in long-term care facilities. Requires a Commission study of the effectiveness of State long-term care ombudsman programs.

Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1995 to carry out such parts. Requires States, in order to be eligible to receive allotments under title VII, to submit a plan to the Commissioner with assurances that the State will establish the programs listed above in accordance with specified requirements outlined in this title. Authorizes State agencies to enter into agreements with public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations to carry out activities under such programs to protect the rights of the vulnerable elderly who reside in long-term care facilities. Reauthorizes and extends ombudsman and advocacy demonstration projects under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act and the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986.
