    "text": "Defense Production Act Extension and Amendments of 1991 - Amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to extend its expiration date to October 20, 1991. Authorizes appropriations and sets spending limits on such Act through FY 1991. Repeals a provision of such Act which grants immunity from civil and criminal suits and a defense to antitrust law actions for those persons engaging in voluntary agreements for defense preparedness programs and expansion of production capacity and supply. Authorizes the President, with respect to certain Defense Production Act activities, to exempt persons who are employed without compensation and participating in a voluntary agreement on behalf of the United States from Federal antitrust laws or any similar State law for activities engaged in as part of such voluntary agreement. Requires an individual designated by the President to administer such a voluntary agreement or plan of action to provide prior written notice of the time, place, and nature of any meeting to carry out such agreement or plan to the Attorney General, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and the Congress. Outlines requirements for, and limitations to, the antitrust defense for participants in such voluntary agreements or plans of action. Exempts any activity or provision of such agreements or plans from the Federal Advisory Committee Act and other Federal law relating to advisory committees. Authorizes the President to order a priority in the allocation of materials, facilities, and services (currently, only materials and facilities) when requirements of national defense cannot otherwise be met. Requires the President to reach certain determinations concerning the critical shortages of such materials, facilities, and services before exercising such authority."
