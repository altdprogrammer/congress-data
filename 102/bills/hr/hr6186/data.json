    "text": "Establishes the Jemez National Recreational Area in New Mexico. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a management plan for the Area as an amendment to the Santa Fe National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan. Requires the Secretary to: (1) protect religious and cultural sites in the Area; and (2) provide access to such sites by Indian peoples for traditional cultural and religious purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to permit timber harvesting in the Area for commercial purposes as long as it is compatible with the Area's purposes. Continues: (1) timber sales already under contract on enactment of this Act; and (2) the Los Griegos timber sale in a specified area of the Santa Fe National Forest. Directs the Secretary to manage the Los Griegos timber sale by using uneven aged management including the individual tree selection method. Requires the Secretary to prepare a transportation plan to provide for the most efficient use of existing roads and trails, including a comprehensive system for dispersed recreation which minimizes its impact on significant archaeological and religious sites. Directs the Secretary to provide for recreational facilities within the Area and establish a visitor center. Authorizes the Secretary to permit under certain conditions: (1) a utility corridor for high power electric transmission lines; and (2) scientific investigations. Prohibits the issuance of any mining location or claim patents after May 30, 1991, with respect to the area. Permits any party who has been deprived of any property rights by such prohibition to file a compensation claim against the United States in the U.S. Claims Court within one year after enactment. Withdraws lands within the Area from U.S. mining, mineral leasing, and related laws. Declares that any requirements imposed by the Secretary on certain mining activities within the Area shall include requirements for reasonable reclamation of disturbed lands to a visual and hydrological condition as close as practicable to their premining condition. Directs the Secretary to expedite a program to determine the validity of all unpatented mining claims within the Area (incuding those for which a patent has been filed). Requires the Secretary to declare any invalid claims null and void. Authorizes the Secretary to use, under specified conditions, mineral materials from within the Area for public purposes such as maintenance and construction of roads, trails, and facilities. Directs the Secretary to evaluate and make recommendations to the Congress about lands adjoining the Area (including specified privately-owned land) for possible inclusion in it. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to convey the Old Taos Ranger District Office and Warehouse to the town of Taos, New Mexico. Sets forth the terms and conditions of such conveyance. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to contract with the Smithsonian Institution for the completion of the prehistoric trackways study required under a specified Act."
