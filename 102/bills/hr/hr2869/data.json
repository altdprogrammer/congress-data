Includes bicycle and pedestrian transportation within a declaration encouraging transportation planning in certain urban areas. Requires each State to: (1) take specified actions with respect to roadside obstacles and unmarked or poorly marked roads which may constitute a danger to bicyclists (currently, motorists and pedestrians only); and (2) establish in its highway department a position of bicycle and pedestrian coordinator. Specifies that if a bicycle project is part of another Federal-aid highway project the Federal share on account of such part of the project shall be 100 percent. Repeals specified funding and obligation limitations with respect to bicycle transportation and pedestrian walkways. Authorizes participation by representatives of bicyclists and pedestrians on the Department of Transportation's National Highway Safety Advisory Committee."
