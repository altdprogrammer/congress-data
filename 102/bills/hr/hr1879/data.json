Requires the Director of the Foreign Commercial Service to appoint a permanent cultural representative to each of the Baltic States to expand U.S.-Baltic commercial relations. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the President should appoint a special envoy to encourage Baltic-Soviet negotiations leading to independence for each of the Baltic States; and (2) the United States should raise the question of Baltic independence during the September 1991 session of the United Nations General Assembly. Makes each Baltic State eligible for assistance established under the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 and the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1991."
