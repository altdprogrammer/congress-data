Subtitle B: Capital Gain Provisions - Requires indexing, based on the consumer price index, of the adjusted basis of certain assets (corporate stock and tangible property that is a capital asset or property used in a trade or business) acquired on or after February 1, 1992, and held for more than one year at the time of sale or other transfer, solely for the purpose of determining gain. Provides that gains and losses from the disposition of indexed assets are not taken into account as investment income in computing the limitation on the deductibility of investment interest.

Allows noncorporate taxpayers to elect to recognize gain on readily tradable securities held on February 1, 1992. Permits both corporate and noncorporate taxpayers an income tax exclusion of 50 percent of the net capital gain from an investment in the stock of a qualified small business if the stock is issued after February 1, 1992, and held for at least five years.

Part III: Miscellaneous Simplification - Revises the definition of a leased employee to mean one whose services are performed under the control of a service recipient, instead of one whose services are historically performed by employees. Modifies the two-part nondiscrimination test for elective contributions under cash or deferred arrangements by permitting the use of the average deferral percentage for nonhighly compensated employees for the preceding year to be used in determining the permitted average deferral percentage for highly compensated employees for the current year. Provides alternative methods of satisfying the special nondiscrimination requirements applicable to elective deferrals and employer matching contributions. Redefines the term \"highly compensated employee\" for pension, profit sharing, stock bonus plan, etc. purposes. Makes such an employee one who is a five-percent owner (as under current law) or who has compensation from the employer in excess of $50,000 (or $62,345, as adjusted for 1992). Provides a special rule where no employees are treated as highly compensated.

Establishes special rules for partnerships holding oil and gas properties. Establishes simplified audit procedures for large partnerships.

Specifies certain restrictions on such adjustments. Provides for judicial review of such adjustment with the Tax Court, the appropriate district court, or the Claims Court. Prohibits any adjustments from being made three years after the later of the date on which the return was filed, or the last day for filing such return, except in specified cases. Allows a partnership to file a request for an administrative adjustment of partnership items during such time periods and provides for judicial review where such request is not allowed in full. Requires large partnerships to furnish information returns to partners by the first March 15 following the close of the partnership's tax year. Authorizes the Secretary to require large partnerships, or any other partnership with 250 or more partners, to file their returns on magnetic media. Part II: Provisions Related to TEFRA Partnership Proceedings - Revises and sets forth new provisions relating to TEFRA (Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982) partnership proceedings. Provides for a declaratory judgment procedure in the Tax Court for treatment of non-partnership items with respect to an oversheltered return. Describes an oversheltered return as one which shows no taxable income and shows a net loss from partnership items. Provides for the partnership return to be determinative of the audit procedure to be followed. Suspends the period of limitations for making assessments for a partner who is named in a bankruptcy petition. Provides a special rule for a tax matters partner in bankruptcy. Permits a small partnership to have a C corporation as a partner and remain exempt from unified audit rules. Excludes a partial settlement agreement from the one-year limitation on assessment.

Provides a prepayment forum and a refund forum for raising the innocent spouse defense in TEFRA cases. Provides that partnership level proceedings include a determination of the applicability of penalties at the partnership level. Allows partners to raise any partner-level defenses in a refund forum.
