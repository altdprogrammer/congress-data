Directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop a comprehensive plan for the long-range management and protection of the conservation area. Designates the following lands in the State of Oregon as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) Little Blitzen Gorge Wilderness; (2) Blitzen River Wilderness; (3) Home Creek Wilderness; and (4) High Steens Wilderness. Releases certain portions of the conservation area not designated as wilderness from further study and requires them to be managed as part of the conservation area. Declares that the Congress does not intend the designation of any wilderness areas to lead to creation of buffer zones around them. Establishes the Steens Mountain National Conservation Area Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary with respect to the preparation and implementation of the comprehensive, long-range plan. Terminates the Committee within three years after development of the management plan. Disclaims any reservation of water rights by this Act, but permits Federal acquisition of such rights. Authorizes appropriations."
