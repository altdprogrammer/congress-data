    "date": "1992-03-20", 
    "text": "Tax Fairness and Economic Growth Act of 1992 - Title I: Middle Class Tax Relief - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a credit for 20 percent of a taxpayer's social security taxes, limited to $150 ($300 in the case of a joint return) and applicable to years beginning after December 31, 1991, and before January 1, 1994. Increases the earned income tax credit and repeals its interaction with the medical expense deduction, the deduction for health insurance costs of the self-employed, and the supplemental young child credit. Allows a credit for interest paid or incurred on a qualified education loan for a 48-month period (whether or not consecutive). Limits such credit to $400 per individual whose education expenses are being financed by such loan. Sets forth limits on the gross income of taxpayers eligible for such credit. Requires identifying information with respect to the individual for whom higher education expenses were paid by redeeming U.S. savings bonds. Eliminates the age restriction on the issuance of such bonds, the limitations on the eligible individuals, and the limitations based on modified adjusted gross income.
