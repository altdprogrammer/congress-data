Specifies that the quantity of each material acquired under such program during each of FY 1993 through 1999 shall be approximately equal, except that acquisition may occur at a faster rate to take advantage of purchase or barter opportunities that may arise. Requires the President to acquire such strategic and critical materials by using funds in the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund or by barter, subject to limitations provided in appropriations Acts."
