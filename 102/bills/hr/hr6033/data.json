    "text": "Interstate Transportation of Municipal Waste Act of 1992 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize a State Governor, if requested by an affected local government or local solid waste planning unit, to prohibit the disposal of out-of-State municipal waste in the following landfills or incinerators subject to the jurisdiction of the Governor or the affected local government: (1) landfills that begin operations after this Act's enactment date; (2) existing landfills that did not receive out-of-State municipal waste in 1991 or are not in compliance with State laws relating to design and locational standards, leachate collection, groundwater monitoring, and financial assurance for closure and post-closure and corrective action; and (3) existing incinerators that did not receive such waste during 1991, are not in compliance with standards and monitoring requirements under the Clean Air Act, or are not in compliance with State laws relating to facility design and operations. Authorizes State Governors, if requested by an affected local government or local solid waste planning unit, to limit the amount of out-of-State municipal waste received at landfills or incinerators that received shipments of such waste during 1991 or the first six months of 1992. Permits State Governors, effective in 1993, to limit the disposal of such waste at any landfill or incinerator that receives, on an annual basis, shipments totaling more than 100,000 tons of such waste (that represents more than 30 percent of all municipal waste received during such period) by prohibiting the disposal of out-of-State waste in an annual amount greater than 30 percent of all municipal waste received during the later of 1993 or the first year in which more than 100,000 tons of out-of-State waste was received. Authorizes Governors, if requested by an affected local government or local solid waste planning unit, to further limit the disposal of such waste by reducing the 30 percent annual volume limitation to 20 percent in 1998 and 1999 and to ten percent in succeeding years. Authorizes a State to impose a fee on the combustion or disposal of out-of-State waste. Prohibits Governors from exercising authority under this Act if such action would result in the violation of a legally binding contract, with exceptions."
