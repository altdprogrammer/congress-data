Sets forth revenue and cost criteria. Exempts the following timber sales from such requirement: (1) other purpose sales; (2) personal use sales; and (3) salvage sales. Directs the Secretary to: (1) estimate above-cost areas for each unit of the National Forest System; (2) based upon such estimate, ensure that all staff and administrative costs directly associated with commercial timber sales are offset by revenues; and (3) take steps to avoid reducing the timber harvest as a result of below-cost timber sales prohibitions. Makes such prohibition effective January 1, 1995, but permits specified levels below-cost sales for FY 1992 through 1994."
