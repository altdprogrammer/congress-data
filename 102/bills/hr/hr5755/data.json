    "text": "John F. Kennedy Center Act Amendments of 1992 - Amends the John F. Kennedy Center Act (the Act) to extend the authorization of appropriations for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (the Center). Revises provisions for the Center's Board of Trustees (the Board). Provides for the appointment (as ex officio members of the Board) of: (1) the Secretary of State (to replace the Secretary of Health and Human Services); (2) the Superintendent of Schools of the District of Columbia (to replace the Chairman of the District of Columbia Recreation Board); and (3) additional members of the Congress. Shortens the length of terms of general trustees (who are appointed by the President) from ten to six years. Revises Board duties to include: (1) a leadership role in national performing arts policies and programs; (2) a comprehensive and broad program for national and community outreach; (3) joint initiatives with the affiliated Very Special Arts for model programs in the arts for disabled individuals; (4) ensuring excellence and cultural diversity in the Center's education and outreach programs and policies; and (5) annual comprehensive Center building needs planning. Revises Board powers to provide for appointment of a Center chairperson (rather than a director and assistant director). Authorizes the Board to negotiate any contract for any capital improvement to the Center with selected contractors, and to award the contract on the basis of contractor qualifications as well as price. Requires the Board to transmit annually to specified congressional committees a five-year comprehensive building needs plan for the Center. Requires the Board to designate the maintenance, repair, alteration, and other services to be performed for the Center in order to ensure that such services will meet Board requirements for high quality operations. Requires the Board and the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the National Park Service, to provide for such services under a cooperative agreement. (Currently the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the National Park Service, provides such services without the Board's designation or cooperation.) Directs the Board to develop a Center capital projects implementation plan. Requires the Board to submit such plan and quarterly progress reports to the Secretary of the Interior. Authorizes the Board to make whatever plan modifications it determines necessary and appropriate after considering the Secretary's comments and recommendations. Prohibits use of funds under such plan for any capital projects to expand the Center's existing facilities. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the Center for: (1) maintenance, repair, alteration, and other services, and for capital projects (these funds go to the Secretary of the Interior to cover the Board expenses, and their use is prohibited for performing arts related production expenses; and (2) education and outreach programs (these funds go to the Secretary of Education to cover Board expenses)."
