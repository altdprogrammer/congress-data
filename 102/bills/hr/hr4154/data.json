    "text": "Emergency Climate Stabilization and Earth Regeneration Act of 1992 - Declares that the purpose of this Act is to establish a process through which the Congress and the President shall cooperate in a national and international program to: (1) reduce heat, drought, famine, and forest fires and to decrease the freezing extremes, snow buildup, flooding, cloud cover, and storms in the winter; (2) regenerate the earth through reforestation, soil and ocean remineralization, conservation, and alternative energy technology development; (3) maximize food and agricultural security through research on soil remineralization and other environmentally sound, sustainable means; and (4) create and develop a secure, environmentally sustainable way of life consistent with long-term climate stabilization. Sets forth specific ways to achieve reduction of carbon dioxide. Recognizes that the U.S. contribution to the global program to reduce greenhouse gases and stabilize the world's climate should be at least proportional to the United States' past and current emissions of such gases relative to other nations. Directs the President to promulgate a regulation providing for a climatic stabilization program and for information development and processing centers to process data concerning world climatic conditions. Requires the regulation to include a plan that provides for: (1) Federal, State, and local climate stabilization plans; (2) specified remineralization goals for the United States; (3) international cooperation to maximize the activities of soil, forest, and energy work and the reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide; (4) the curtailment of counterproductive technological practices, including reduction in the use of fossil fuels and toxic and radioactive materials and guidelines for the cutting of trees; (5) support for ecologically sound technology and practices; (6) employment and community requirements; and (7) the implementation of specified articles of the United Nations Charter that require the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means and promote higher standards of living, full employment, and conditions of economic and social progress. Directs the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate to take steps to establish a Joint Committee on Climate Stabilization. Establishes a Council on Climate Stabilization and Earth Regeneration as an independent Federal agency. Encourages the establishment of State and local councils to assure implementation of the climate stabilization program. Requires the President to provide for a unified crisis management operation through international, Federal, State, and local activity to minimize damage from, and to maintain agricultural and industrial production under, changing atmospheric conditions that cause natural disasters. Provides for ongoing evaluation of the climate stabilization program. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a corporate tax surcharge. Terminates such tax after December 31, 1996. Establishes a Climate Stabilization Trust Fund to be in an amount equivalent to the amount of corporate tax surcharges received in the Treasury. Makes the Fund available to carry out this Act. Requires 80 percent of the funding of any project under this Act to be from Federal sources. Authorizes appropriations."
