    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1992-09-29", 
    "text": "Title I: Fish and Wildlife Law Enforcement - Fish and Wildlife Law Enforcement Clarification Act of 1992 - Authorizes law enforcement officers of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who are performing duties related to enforcement of laws regarding fish, wildlife, or conservation, subject to the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, to: (1) carry firearms; (2) execute and serve any order, warrant, subpoena, summons, or other process issued by an officer or court of competent jurisdiction under Federal law; (3) make an arrest without a warrant for any offense under Federal law committed within the officer's presence, or for any felony cognizable under Federal law if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person arrested has committed or is committing such felony; (4) cooperate with any State or political subdivision in the enforcement of the laws of the jurisdiction; and (5) perform any other law enforcement duty specified by the Secretary of the Interior. Permits such officers, for purposes of law enforcement within any area that is part of the National Wildlife Refuge System or any other area owned or controlled by the Service, to: (1) perform acts to maintain law and order and protect persons and property; and (2) conduct an investigation of any offense under Federal law committed within such area in the absence of investigation by any other Federal law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the offense or with the concurrence of such other agency. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) designate any law enforcement officer of any Federal agency or State to act as a special police officer in areas of the System and to exercise authority established by this Act; (2) cooperate with any State in the enforcement, within the System, of the laws or ordinances of the State; and (3) provide reimbursement to a State for expenditures incurred in connection with activities of the State pursuant to such designation. Sets forth provisions regarding the treatment of special police officers under this Act (in general, not as Federal employees or subject to Federal employment laws) and with respect to tort claims, workers' compensation, and specified provisions of the Federal criminal code. Directs the Secretary to establish within the Service an Office of Permit Assistance to provide information and assistance regarding domestic and international fish and wildlife laws and regulations, permit requirements, and international and interstate transportation of fish and wildlife. Requires the Director of the Service, by January 1, 1993, to assign an inspector to the Port of Hampton Roads, Virginia or take such other action as necessary to authorize the entry of wildlife products into the customs territory of the United States at that port. Prohibits the Director from: (1) decreasing the capability of the Service to authorize the entry of such products at other ports of entry; and (2) collecting any fee or charge for entry of products at Hampton Roads that is not comparable to the fees and charges collected at other ports of entry. Title II: National Fish and Wildlife Foundation - Amends the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act to exempt subgrantees of the Foundation from the audit reporting and compliance requirements of Circular A-133, as published by the Office of Management and Budget on March 16, 1990, for all grants of $100,000 or less. Directs the Foundation to amend its grant contracts to ensure that its subgrantees are advised of and certify compliance with all applicable Federal laws and regulations imposed on individuals or organizations receiving Federal funds. Authorizes the Foundation to continue to draw down Federal funds when matching requirements have been met. Directs that interest earned by the Foundation and its subgrantees on funds drawn down after enactment of this Act, but not immediately disbursed, be used to fund activities that are otherwise authorized by the Act and approved by the Board. Title III: Walter B. Jones Center for the Sounds, Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge - Authorizes the Secretary, subject to the availability of appropriations, to construct and operate the Walter B. Jones Center for the Sounds at the Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in Tyrrell County, North Carolina, to: (1) provide public opportunities, facilities, and resources to study the natural history and natural resources of northeastern North Carolina; (2) offer a variety of environmental educational programs and interpretive exhibits; (3) foster an awareness and understanding of the interactions among wildlife, estuarine and wetland ecosystems, and human activities; and (4) provide office space and facilities for refuge administration, research, education, and related activities. Directs the Secretary to ensure that the design, size, and location of a facility constructed under this title is consistent with the cultural and natural history of the area with which the facility will be concerned. Authorizes the Secretary to accept contributions of funds from non-Federal sources to pay the costs of operating and maintaining the facility authorized under this title. Directs the Secretary to take appropriate steps to obtain such contributions. Sets forth reporting requirements."
