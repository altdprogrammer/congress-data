Amends the Education Amendments of 1972 to prohibit discrimination by an institution of higher education against a student based on protected speech in any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965. Makes such prohibition inapplicable to religious or military institutions. Provides that such prohibition shall not be construed to prevent: (1) imposition of an official sanction on a student determined to have willfully participated in the disruption or attempted disruption of a lecture, class, speech, presentation, or performance made or scheduled to be made under the auspices of the institution of higher education; or (2) actions by such institution that are necessary to ensure the safety of individuals, protection of property, and continuation of the academic and administrative process without interference."
