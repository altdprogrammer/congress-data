Extends the aviation insurance (war risk insurance) program under title XIII of the Act through September 30, 1997. Directs the Comptroller General to review and report to the Congress on the administration of such program during the Persian Gulf conflict in order to determine methods of improving its administration by reducing the paperwork and time period required for provision of insurance under such program."
