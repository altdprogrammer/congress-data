    "text": "Anti-National Health Insurance Act of 1992 - Title I: Tax Provisions Encouraging Low-Cost Health Plans - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for low and moderate-income individuals for health insurance costs. Bases such credit upon the number of personal exemptions of such individual, the contributions of such individual's employer to accident and health plans, and limitations on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income. Provides an inflation adjustment for such credit for calendar years beginning after enactment of this Act. Allows such individuals to elect to take a deduction for qualified health insurance costs. Provides for determining the maximum deduction based upon limitations on the tax credit for such costs. Denies the use of the medical expense deduction for amounts included in the tax credit or the tax deduction. Allows such tax deduction whether or not an individual itemizes other deductions. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a program under which individuals who are allowed the tax credit may obtain health insurance vouchers to be used to make payments for premiums for qualified health insurance. Sets forth administrative provisions for such program. Allows a tax credit for the aggregate amount of health insurance credit vouchers. Increases from 25 percent to 100 percent the allowable deduction for health insurance costs of self-employed individuals. Makes such deduction permanent. Requires the health insurance of the self-employed to provide basic benefits. Creates health care spending accounts under provisions relating to cafeteria plans. Allows employees to retain any unspent funds in such accounts at the end of the taxable year. Limits the amount excludable from gross income for contributions by employers to accident and health plans to the value of the coverage under the lowest-cost accident or health plan available to the employer which provides basic benefits. Title II: State Requirements Relating to Access and Cost Containment - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish requirements for basic benefit plans offered by health insurance plans. Limits the noneconomic damages that may be awarded to an individual and the family members of such individual for losses resulting from an injury in medical malpractice liability actions to $250,000. Preempts State law to the extent that State law permits the recovery of higher amounts. Prohibits State law from requiring the offering, as part of any health insurance plan for individuals enrolled under the plan, of any services, category of care, or services of any class or type of provider. Preempts State law with respect to: (1) reimbursement rates or selective contracting; (2) differential financial incentives; and (3) utilization review methods."
