Part B: Rights of Inspection, Correction, Notice, and Authorized Disclosure - Requires a Government agency to permit an individual to inspect and have a copy of any genetic information the agency maintains about the individual. Sets forth procedures for correcting or supplementing genetic information held by an agency. Requires each agency to prepare, and on request provide a copy of, a written notice of genetic information practices. Prohibits an agency from disclosing genetic information except to the individual or the individual's representative, when the individual has authorized disclosure, or as otherwise authorized under the Act. Sets forth procedures for authorized disclosures. Requires an agency that provides by contract or grant for the maintenance, development, analysis, or identification of genetic information to cause the requirements of certain provisions of this Act to be applied to such information. Provides for the rights of incompetents and minors. Part C: Disclosure of Genetic Information Without Authorization - Allows unauthorized disclosure: (1) within an agency for official use; (2) to a medical professional for use in connection with care or treatment of the individual; (3) for specified health and safety reasons; and (4) as directed by a court."
