    "text": "Clean Fuels Infrastructure and Incentives Act of 1992 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a program for providing grants to eligible States to fund the construction of clean fuel refueling facilities in ozone nonattainment areas classified as Serious, Severe, or Extreme under the Clean Air Act. Authorizes appropriations. Provides for the distribution of funds based on the pro rata number of licensed motor vehicles in a State. Limits the total amount of funds to be received by a State. Requires recipient States to distribute at least 50 percent of funds to persons for the installation of clean fuel refueling facilities in the private sector. Makes a State eligible for a grant only if it has: (1) submitted a revision of the applicable implementation plan pursuant to the Clean Air Act expressing its intention to adopt standards under the California clean fuel vehicle pilot test program; and (2) has adopted such standards no later than model year 1996."
