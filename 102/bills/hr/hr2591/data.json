    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-06-07", 
    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require: (1) States receiving drug control and system improvement grant program (program) funds to distribute to a unit or combination of units of local government (local unit) in such State that portion which bears the same ratio to the aggregate amount of such funds as the amount expended by such local unit for criminal justice in the preceding fiscal year bears to the aggregate amount expended by the State and all local units in such State for criminal justice in such preceding fiscal year; and (2) each local unit that receives funds under such provision to make a good faith effort to participate in the development, and comply with the principles, of the State plan and priorities. Makes local units ineligible to receive such funds if the aggregate amount distributable to such unit or combination of local units is less than $50,000. Specifies that a local unit is ineligible in a fiscal year to receive funds both in its capacity as a single local unit and as part of a combination of local units. Authorizes the direct distribution of program funds to local units. Directs the chief executive of a local unit to submit to the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance an application for receipt of such funds by local units, including: (1) a certification that Federal funds made available will not be used to supplant State or local funds, but will be used to increase the amounts of such funds that would otherwise be made available for drug law enforcement activities, and that funds required to pay the non-Federal portion of the cost of each program and project for which such grant is made shall be in addition to funds that would otherwise be made available for drug law enforcement by the recipient of the grant; and (2) an assurance that the applicant has submitted a copy of the application to the appropriate State office and that such application and any amendment thereto was made public before submission to the Bureau (and, to the extent provided under State or local law or established procedure, that such applicant provided an opportunity for comment by citizens and neighborhood and community groups). Sets forth: (1) analogous provisions with respect to the allocation and distribution of funds to eligible local units (i.e., those submitting an application for a fiscal year not later than 90 days after the expiration of the preference period for such fiscal year) where a State fails to submit an application; and (2) the preference period for specified fiscal years. Requires applicants (currently, States) to comply with reporting requirements under such Act."
