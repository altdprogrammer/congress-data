    "text": "Workers' Family Protection Act of 1991 - Requires the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (the Director), in cooperation with the Secretary of Labor, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA Administrator), the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and the Secretary of Energy, to study the prevalence of and issues related to contamination of workers' homes with hazardous chemicals and substances transported from their workplace (contamination). Requires the Director to identify industries prone to such contamination, evaluate current statutory and regulatory safeguards, and compile a review of the previous research. Requires the Director to provide grants to eligible States for case studies to evaluate the economic, physiological, and psychological effects on workers and their communities from, and preventive and remediation methods respecting, such contamination. Directs the Secretary of Labor, in cooperation with the EPA Administrator, to: (1) cooperate with and assist the Director and eligible grantee States in such studies; (2) evaluate effectiveness in addressing such contamination under programs established under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986; (3) compile a review of previous related research on indoor air quality; and (4) evaluate whether current occupational safety and health and environmental laws and regulations pose an undue burden on families seeking to redress such contamination. Requires the Director to issue to the Congress an interim report and a final report including recommendations for addressing any overlap in Federal agency jurisdiction over such contamination of the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Energy, the EPA Administrator, and the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Directs the Secretary of Labor to: (1) issue appropriate regulations to prevent release of hazardous chemicals and substances from a workplace or workers' clothing or persons; or (2) report to the Congress on why such regulations are unnecessary. Requires the Secretary, at a minimum, to: (1) determine whether additional regulations are needed to protect workers' families from employee transported releases of lead, mercury, asbestos, pharmaceuticals, and materials that may pose such risks, including commercial pesticide application and manufacture; (2) consider the risk of acute and chronic health effects; and (3) consider other environmental law and regulations. Authorizes appropriations."
