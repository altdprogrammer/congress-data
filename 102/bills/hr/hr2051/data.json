    "text": "Antarctica Tourism Act of 1991 - Directs the Under Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism to issue regulations applicable to tour operators and tourists traveling to Antarctica to prevent or minimize harmful effects from tourism on: (1) native mammals, birds, and plants and the living conditions of such mammals and birds; (2) the scientific value of Antarctica; and (3) the land and marine environment of Antarctica. Lists minimum requirements of such regulations, including: (1) the establishment of qualifications for tour guides; (2) a requirement that tour operators employ a sufficient number of guides to educate, supervise, and monitor tourists; (3) a prohibition on entering specially protected areas; (4) the establishment of specified guidelines for tourist activities; and (5) the establishment of training programs on the requirements of this Act and the Antarctic Treaty System. Requires the Under Secretary, in issuing such regulations, to: (1) consider designating areas of Antarctica for visits by tourists and limiting the size of tourist groups and the number of tours to Antarctica in a specified period of time; and (2) review measures implemented by the National Park Service and the Government of Ecuador (with respect to the Galapagos Archipelago) to control the impacts of tourism. Directs the Under Secretary to issue regulations governing solid waste storage and disposal practices of tour operators. Requires the Under Secretary to issue regulations to: (1) annually determine whether excursions of tour operators will have an impact on Antarctica's environment; and (2) mitigate such impact. Directs tour operators to submit proposed tour itineraries to the Under Secretary and permits the Under Secretary to require adjustments in such itineraries to mitigate negative effects on Antarctica's environment. Requires tour operators, at least 90 days before commencing a tourist excursion to Antarctica, to report to the Under Secretary on: (1) the anticipated number of persons on, and route for, the excursion; (2) points of interest that the excursion will visit; and (3) any other information required by the Under Secretary. Directs tour operators, within 30 days of completing such an excursion, to report to the Under Secretary on: (1) the actual number of passengers on, and the route for, the excursion; (2) the points of interest visited, the length of time spent at each point of interest, and the number of persons visiting each point of interest; (3) any interference with or disruption of native fauna, flora, or habitat that may have occurred on the excursion; (4) any injuries or loss of life or property that may have occurred on the excursion; and (5) any other information required by the Under Secretary. Requires the Under Secretary to issue regulations establishing requirements for licensing tour operators. Prohibits tour operators from providing services for excursions to Antarctica except in compliance with a license. Prohibits any person from constructing, financing, or providing assistance for the development of any land-based tourist facilities in Antarctica. Requires the Under Secretary to establish a program under which a certified observer shall accompany tourist expeditions to Antarctica to monitor tour compliance with specified laws and carry out educational and scientific functions. Directs the Under Secretary to collect annual fees from tour operators to cover the costs of providing observers. Establishes the Antarctica Tourism Observer Fund and provides for the deposit of fees in the Fund. Prescribes civil penalties for violations of this Act. Sets forth provisions concerning citizen suits."
