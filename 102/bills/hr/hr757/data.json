    "text": "Alaska Land Status Technical Corrections Act of 1991 - Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to: (1) modify the Fort Davis land allotment; and (2) subject such land to valid existing rights and an easement for the Iditarod National Historic Trail. Amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) to authorize an allotment applicant who had a valid application pending before the Department of the Interior on December 18, 1971, and whose application remains pending as of the date of the enactment of this Act, to amend the land description to describe land other than that the applicant originally intended to claim if: (1) the applicant filed an allotment application which described land selected by, tentatively approved to, or patented to the State of Alaska; (2) the amended land description describes land tentatively approved or patented to Alaska of approximately equal acreage to substitute for the land originally described in the application; and (3) the Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources for Alaska, acting under the authority of State law, has agreed to reconvey or relinquish the land described in the amended application to the United States. Directs the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to: (1) accept conveyance or relinquishment of the land described in the amended application from Alaska as an allotment for the benefit of the allotment application; (2) upon such acceptance, to issue a Native Allotment certificate, absent any legal defect in the original application; and (3) adjust his computation of the acreage charged against Alaska's land entitlement. Ratifies certain conveyances to the Montana Creek and Caswell Native Associations and declares that such Associations have received their full entitlement of lands pursuant to ANCSA. Authorizes Settlement Common Stock of a Native Corporation to be transferred to a brother or sister of a Native (if the holder has reached the age of majority). Specifies that a real property interest distributed by a Native Corporation to a shareholder of such corporation pursuant to a program to provide homesites to its shareholders shall be deemed conveyed and received under ANCSA, provided that certain conditions are met, including that alienability of the Corporation's Settlement Common Stock has not yet been terminated under provisions of such Act. Directs the Secretary to execute any necessary instruments to release the condition on specified lands (including Beaver Airport) that such lands revert to the United States if they are not developed, or cease to be used, for airport purposes. Modifies the boundary of the Chugach National Forest, Alaska. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to convey specified land in Alaska to the Rabbit Creek Lions Club. Authorizes a Native Corporation to issue additional shares of Settlement Common Stock to descendants of Natives born after December 18, 1971. Authorizes the Village Corporation for the Village of Klukwan to select specified public lands in Haines, Alaska, as part of its 23,040 acre entitlement. Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to prohibit lands conveyed to Iliamna Natives Ltd. from being considered within the boundaries of the Lake Clark National Park or Lake Clark National Preserve. Authorizes the Secretary, if the corporation wants to convey them, to acquire such lands, which shall then become part of the park or preserve. Makes Sitkalidak Island a part of the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska. Directs the Secretary to convey all right, title, and interest of the United States in specified Federal lands in the Nellie Juan Reservation to the Chugach Alaska Corporation."
