    "text": "Marine Mammal Capture, Export, and Public Display Protection Act of 1992 - Amends the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) to require, instead of the penalty applicable under the AWA for a violation regarding a marine mammal, that a person be liable for a civil or criminal penalty under specified provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA). Mandates review and, if appropriate, modifications to AWA standards regarding the care and habitat of marine mammals in captivity. Amends the MMPA to direct the Secretaries of Commerce and Agriculture to jointly establish a system for tracking marine mammals that are taken in waters under U.S. jurisdiction or imported into the United States. Makes it unlawful, notwithstanding any other provision of law or permit under the MMPA, to take any marine mammal before establishment of the system. Makes it unlawful to export a marine mammal from the United States without a permit under this Act. Requires that regulations be issued under the MMPA for exporting as well as for taking and importing marine mammals. Authorizes issuance of export permits under the same requirements as taking and importing permits. Allows issuance of an export permit only: (1) to maintain or improve the health and well-being of the mammal; and (2) if the permit prohibits use of the mammal for any other purpose. Limits the effective period of permits for scientific research to a specified number of years. Regulates the release of such research mammals. Requires the permanent marking of any such mammal."
