    "text": "Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate certain segments of the Great Egg Harbor River and its tributaries in New Jersey as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to manage the designated segments through cooperative agreements with the political jurisdictions within which such segments pass, except that pubicly owned lands shall continue to be managed by the agency having jurisdiction over such lands. Directs the Secretary to review local river management plans to assure that their proper implementation will protect the values for which the segments were designated. Deems such plans, if they meet protection standards, to be local zoning ordinances for purposes of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, thus prohibiting Federal acquisition of lands by condemnation pursuant to such Act. Requires the Secretary to review compliance with such plans biennially and to report to specified congressional committees on any deviation from such plans which could result in any diminution of the values for which a segment was designated. Authorizes the Secretary to provide planning assistance to political subdivisions through which designated segments flow and to enter into memoranda of understanding or cooperative agreements with Federal or State agencies to ensure that Federal and State programs are carried out in a manner consistent with the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and applicable river management plans. Authorizes appropriations."
