Makes the Authority responsible for operating and maintaining facilities upon completion of construction and testing. Requires the Authority to advance all costs of construction of project facilities as the non-Federal contribution. Declares the Federal share to be all project costs for verification, design preparation, and construction management. Provides for transferring control of the project works to the Authority (or to a bona fide entity agreeable to New Mexico and Texas) upon completion of construction and testing, or upon termination of activities at the request of the Authority. Authorizes appropriations."
