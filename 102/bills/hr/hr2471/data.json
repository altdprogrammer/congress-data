Provides that the Land and Resource Management Plans and their associated environmental impact statements for National Forests in North Carolina (including such decisions to allocate roadless areas to wilderness or nonwilderness categories) shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in North Carolina which were reviewed by the Department of Agriculture from further review by such Department prior to the revision of the plans. States that the provisions above shall also apply to national forest system roadless lands in North Carolina which are less than 5,000 acres in size."
