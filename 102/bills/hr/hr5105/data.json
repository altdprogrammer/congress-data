    "text": "Environment and Economic Stability Act of 1992 - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to require an analysis of the economic costs and benefits of determining that a species is endangered or threatened before including it on either of such lists. States that such analysis shall be separate from any determination of a species' endangered or threatened status. Prohibits the regulatory taking of private property under such Act unless the Attorney General has certified that the issuing agency is in compliance with a specified executive order or a similar procedure regarding such assessments. Transfers authority of the Endangered Species Committee (Committee) to grant Federal agency exemptions to the appropriate Secretaries (Interior, Commerce, or Agriculture). Establishes a right of appeal to the Committee for the denial of an exemption permit. Revises provisions regarding: (1) prohibitions with respect to endangered species; and (2) status determinations, including data collection, peer review, and species estimation. Requires the Secretary to make certain determinations before a subspecies or distinct population segment of a species may be considered endangered or threatened. Transfers authority to develop and implement species recovery plans from the Secretary to the appropriate Secretaries (Interior, Commerce, or Agriculture). Provides for the consideration of alternatives and public participation in the development of such plans. Provides, with regard to experimental populations, for: (1) release in National Park or National Wildlife Refuge lands whenever possible; and (2) efforts to protect public and domestic animal safety and welfare in cases of release outside such lands."
