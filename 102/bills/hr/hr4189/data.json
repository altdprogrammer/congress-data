Requires education funds to be used for instructional and educational purposes, unless a certificate of need has been approved for capital or infrastructure improvements. Requires local educational agencies, in order to be eligible for such funds, to have a substance abuse prevention program available to students in kindergarten through 12th grades and an education program on substance abuse available to parents. Declares that, for purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act), all funds transferred shall continue to be counted in the international category of discretionary appropriations and not be counted against spending limits for the domestic category."
