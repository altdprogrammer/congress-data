    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criminal penalties for failure to obey an order by a Federal law enforcement officer enforcing controlled substances laws to land an aircraft which has crossed the border with, or is subject to U.S. jurisdiction operating outside of, the United States. Authorizes a foreign nation to consent or waive objection to the United States enforcing U.S. laws by radio, telephone, or similar oral or electronic means. Specifies that an aircraft used in violation of this Act is: (1) liable in rem for a fine imposed under this Act; and (2) may be seized and forfeited. Makes laws relating to seizure and forfeiture for violation of customs laws, including defenses such as innocent owner provisions, applicable to aircraft seized or forfeited under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Transportation to delegate Federal law enforcement officer seizure and forfeiture responsibilities to other law enforcement officers. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require: (1) the immediate revocation of the aircraft registration when the pilot or operator of an aircraft intentionally fails to obey the order of an authorized Federal law enforcement officer to land; (2) the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to notify the owner of the aircraft as soon as possible that the owner no longer holds U.S. registration for such aircraft; and (3) the Administrator to establish procedures for such owner to show cause why the registration was not revoked, as a matter of law, by operation of such provision, or why circumstances existed pursuant to which the Administrator should determine that it would be in the public interest to issue a new registration certificate to the owner, to be effective concurrent with the revocation. Authorizes the Coast Guard to issue orders and make inquiries, searches, seizures, and arrests, and take other lawful action, relating to violations of U.S. laws occurring aboard an aircraft over the high seas or waters over which the United States has jurisdiction. Makes a master, operator, or person in charge of a vessel, or a pilot or operator of an aircraft, who intentionally fails to comply with an order of a Coast Guard commissioned officer, warrant officer, or petty officer to stop or land, liable for a civil penalty of up to $5,000. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to: (1) specify what constitutes an \"authorized place\" for purposes of customs enforcement provisions; and (2) make a pilot or operator of an aircraft who intentionally fails to comply with a customs officer's order to land an aircraft liable for a civil penalty of up to $5,000."
