    "text": "Telephone Toll Fraud Remedies Act of 1992 - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish regulations protecting customers against toll fraud. Requires such regulations to include provisions: (1) mandating that manufacturers and dealers of customer premises equipment disclose prominent warnings that advise of the possibility of toll fraud and precautions to minimize fraud; (2) permitting common carriers to share information regarding potential toll fraud activity; (3) establishing customer premises equipment security guidelines for use in guarding against toll fraud; (4) requiring common carriers to offer capability to block international calls on customer-specified customer premises equipment lines and to place security mechanisms on the public switched network; (5) describing methods by which dealers and manufacturers of such equipment can decrease the incidence of toll fraud; and (6) establishing arbitration procedures for billing disputes involving allegations of toll fraud. Directs the FCC to ensure that all pending toll fraud cases exceeding $50,000 in charges relating to disputed fraudulent calls are adjudicated within a specified time frame. Exempts small carriers from this Act if the FCC determines it necessary and in the public interest."
