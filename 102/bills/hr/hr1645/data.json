Requires that coverage continue until the 23rd birthday, or 36 months after the qualifying event, whichever is later, for an individual who is a dependent child beneficiary at the time of such an event involving a covered employee 50 years old or older. Amends the Acts to modify: (1) the termination of extended coverage for disability and the general rule for other qualifying events, as they relate to the maximum required period of continuation coverage; and (2) dates by which certain notices must be given. Amends the Acts to require that notice of the option to enroll under a conversion plan be given during the 120-day period ending 60 days before the expiration of the continuation coverage. (Current law requires such notice be given during the 180-day period ending on the expiration date of the continuation coverage.)"
