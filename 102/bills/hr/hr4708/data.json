    "text": "Housing Improvement Act for Land Management Agencies - Authorizes the Secretaries of Agriculture and of the Interior (Secretaries) to make available employee rental or leasing housing on or off lands under each Secretary's jurisdiction. Authorizes joint public-private competitive leases for construction of field employee quarters. Allows for: (1) Federal contributions; (2) occupancy guarantees; (3) joint development authority by the Secretaries; and (4) contracts for field employee quarters management. Authorizes the sale of field employee quarters, or the lease of land for such quarters, to agency employees or to a cooperative made up exclusively of such employees. Authorizes the leasing of seasonal employee quarters where the need is temporary and leasing is more cost effective than construction. Allows nongovernmental leasing when not required for agency use. Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with regard to the rollover of gain on the sale of a principal residence, to suspend (for up to six years) the two-year residential repurchase period for Department of the Interior or the Forest Service field employees. Requires each of the Secretaries to: (1) survey and prioritize for repair existing employee housing for land management agencies under their respective jurisdictions; and (2) submit such survey to the appropriate congressional committees. Requires housing funds to follow such priority survey. Requires rental income to be deposited in an agency special fund. Authorizes cooperative agreements with Federal, State or local, Indian, or private entities to provide utility and other infrastructure facilities necessary to field employee housing. Authorizes appropriations."
