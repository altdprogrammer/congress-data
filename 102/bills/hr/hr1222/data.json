    "text": "Community Police Partnership and Drug Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 1991 - Directs the Attorney General to make grants to units of general local government that establish or expand community-oriented policing programs and complementary, comprehensive services (such as neighborhood centers, mentoring programs for youth, career development and summer job programs, comprehensive drug treatment programs, and community-based crime prevention programs) to reduce and prevent drug abuse and crime, particularly among youth and adolescents, offenders, and other populations at high risk for involvement in drug abuse and crime. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) allocate not less than 60 percent of the funds available under this Act to large units of general local government, defined as counties with a population of 500,000 or more and cities and towns of 300,000 or more; and (2) use five percent of such funds for administration, technical assistance, and evaluation. Sets forth provisions with respect to grant renewal. Specifies that each applicant for a grant shall provide $1 from non-Federal sources for every $3 received. Sets forth application procedures. Specifies that each applicant must submit a comprehensive plan, including: (1) a description of the drug abuse and crime problems within the areas targeted for assistance and the community-oriented policing and other crime and antidrug prevention activities the applicant will develop and implement; (2) an inventory of community resources available to implement the plan, gaps in the plan that cannot be filled with existing community resources, and how grant funds will be used to fill such gaps; (3) a description of the coordinated, community-wide system the applicant will establish to prevent and reduce drug abuse and crime; and (4) an evaluation component, including performance standards and quantifiable goals (such as reduced teen pregnancy, high-school dropouts, or unemployment). Sets forth additional provisions with respect to: (1) the coordination of programs through establishment of a community-wide task force and a citizens group; and (2) planning the implementation of funded programs. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) appoint a panel of experts (excluding Government officers or employees) to review applications and annual reports and make recommendations to the Attorney General for selection and renewal of grant awards; (2) consider, in awarding grants, need and the applicant's ability to provide the proposed services, to coordinate a community-wide response, and to maintain a program to control and prevent crime and drug abuse after funding under this Act is no longer available; and (3) attempt to achieve an equitable geographic distribution of grant awards. Sets forth reporting requirements."
