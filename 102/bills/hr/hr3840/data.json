    "text": "Rainforest Protection Act of 1991 - Title I: Foreign Assistance to Protect Rainforests in Developing Countries - Authorizes the Administrator of the Agency for International Development to furnish assistance to developing countries in exchange for commitments by such countries to preserve areas of rainforest for a period of at least ten years. Requires rainforest protection agreements to provide for annual payment of grants and periodic on-site inspections. Authorizes appropriations. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President and the Secretary of State should urge other developed countries to initiate similar programs of rainforest protection. Title II: Duty-Free Status for Products Harvested from Rainforests Using Sustainable Methods - Accords any product certified by the Secretary of the Treasury under this title duty-free treatment upon entry into U.S. customs territory. Requires the Secretary to certify any product upon determining that: (1) the product was harvested from a rainforest using sustainable methods; and (2) the importation of the product does not present a threat to employment in the United States or to the profitability of U.S. production of any product. Directs the Secretary to establish a review board to: (1) determine whether production activities carried out by commercial operations comprise a sustainable use of a rainforest; (2) review any product for consideration for duty-free status; and (3) provide for on-site inspections of commercial operations submitting products for review."
