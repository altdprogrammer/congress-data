    "text": "Bars the Secretary of Defense from approving the full-scale engineering development, or the production and deployment, of a major defense acquisition program unless specified requirements are met (as under current law) and unless all the requirements specified in Department of Defense (DOD) regulations with respect to independent cost estimates and supporting documentation that are applicable to the program have been met. Specifies that: (1) an independent cost estimate prepared with respect to such program may not be prepared by, or with the assistance of, a contractor that is under the supervision, direction, or control of the military department or defense agency that is responsible for the program; (2) a highly sensitive classified program shall be considered to be a major defense acquisition program if it meets specified criteria; and (3) the office (or other entity) within the Office of the Secretary that has responsibility for the preparation of cost estimates for the Secretary may not be assigned any program analysis and evaluation functions. Establishes a $20,000 civil penalty for any DOD civilian officer or employee who provides the Secretary a cost estimate for purposes of such provisions that is not an independent cost estimate."
