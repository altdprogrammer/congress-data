Prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from harvesting timber within 100 feet of any river or stream within the national forest. Directs the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on the type of original forest and plains natural to the area of the national forest at the time of settlement by non-Native peoples. Requires the national forest to be managed in a manner that recreates, as closely as possible, the status of the original forest and plains. Authorizes appropriations."
