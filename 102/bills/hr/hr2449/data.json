Requires that: (1) to the extent practicable, funds under this authorization be used to procure items which are common to other spacecraft being procured by specified agencies; and (2) if the Government fails to provide additional funding for the development and launch of a follow-on satellite to Landsat 6 during FY 1993, then the long-lead items procured be made available for other U.S. satellite programs. Requires the National Space Council to establish policy recommendations for carrying out the President's commitment to maintaining the continuity of Landsat data. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of the Interior to preserve early Landsat data which may be lost due to tape degradation and to make the data accessible for global change research and other purposes."
