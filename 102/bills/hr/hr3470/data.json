Sets forth the required training and instruction activities to be provided to employees by grant or loan recipient. Requires States, in awarding such grants or loans, to give priority consideration to applications for programs that: (1) use world-class occupational standards; (2) serve small businesses or underserved sectors of industry; (3) involve labor organizations or other means of involving the workforce; (4) leverage other public employment and training resources (such as providing job openings for referrals from the Job Training Partnership Act system when training has upgraded existing employees' skills); or (5) show the employers' commitment to develop their own training capacity and invest further resources in on-going training.
