Provides for State programs, including monitoring, classifying, and closing growing and harvesting areas and certification of shippers. Authorizes a memorandum of understanding with any country with a program at least equivalent to the Program providng for specified matters, including requiring the country to certify shippers and make available a list of waters classified as open to harvest. Deems adulterated, for purposes of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, shellfish: (1) grown or harvested in a country without such a memorandum; (2) grown or harvested in a State without an approved program; (3) harvested from waters not classified as open; or (4) shipped by an uncertified shipper. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to evaluate the potential for removing restrictions on growing and harvesting areas. Authorizes cooperative agreements with States for restoration of such areas."
