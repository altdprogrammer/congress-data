    "text": "Federal Facilities Community Oversight for Public Health Act of 1992 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to establish a citizens advisory board for each Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear weapons facility, whose duties shall be to: (1) evaluate DOE performance of environmental restoration, waste management, and health activities at the facility; (2) evaluate the exercise of regulatory authority by certain Federal and State agencies; (3) submit annually to certain Federal and State agencies an independent policy and technical evaluation of significant decisions made by them with respect to environmental restoration, waste management, and health activities at such facilities; (4) forward community views regarding such activities to the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Governor of the State in which the facility is located; and (5) submit an annual status report to the Congress and the Governor of the State in which the facility is located. Establishes the National Citizens' Advisory Board for DOE Nuclear Weapons Facilities to: (1) annually submit to DOE, EPA, and the National Governors' Association national policy and technical recommendations on environmental restoration, waste management, and health activities occurring at those facilities; and (2) submit an annual status report to the Congress. Directs the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to perform public health actions in accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 for each DOE nuclear weapons facility included in certain DOE programmatic environmental impact statements. Permits any person to petition the ATSDR Administrator for public health assessments. Directs the ATSDR Administrator to: (1) establish and maintain an integrated data base (with specified contents) that is specific to DOE nuclear weapons facilities that are the subject of a health assessment under this Act; (2) report annually to the Congress on how the data base will be used to conduct health assessments and protect human health and the environment; and (3) establish and maintain a registry of persons exposed to hazardous substances as a result of a release from a DOE nuclear weapons facility where the inclusion of such persons would be valuable for specific scientific studies. Directs the Secretary of Energy to submit a priority list to the ATSDR Administrator of hazardous substances most commonly found at DOE nuclear weapons facilities. Directs the ATSDR Administrator to ensure the timely completion of a toxicological profile of such substances. Requires the ATSDR Administrator to submit a comprehensive plan to the Congress for implementing this Act and for ensuring the substantive involvement of affected States, Indian tribes, communities, and the public in the conduct of ATSDR activities. Requires the Secretary of Energy to provide information to the ATSDR Administrator that may be helpful to implement this Act. Requires such Secretary and Administrator to enter into a memorandum of understanding regarding implementation of this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
