    "text": "Head Start Improvement Act of 1992 - Amends the Head Start Act (the Act) to revise various provisions for the Head Start program (the program). Extends for one additional year the formula for distribution of certain quality improvement funds allocated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), thus extending local determination of the use of such funds over that period. Requires early childhood intervention programs under the program to include parental literacy training among the services they provide for parents. Establishes guidelines which the Secretary must consider in determining whether a local Head Start agency may receive a waiver or reduction of required non-Federal matching funds. Includes consideration of community lack of resources, whether the community is adversely affected by a major disaster, impacts of program costs in initial years or unanticipated increases in operating costs, and impact on the community if the program were forced to close there. Directs the Secretary to issue transportation safety regulations for all Head Start programs. Prohibits the Secretary from giving priority (for previous Head Start grantee experience) to any agency whose Head Start grant has been terminated or whose application for refunding has been denied. Directs the Secretary to review each newly designated Head Start agency immediately after completion of its first year, and to conduct followup reviews of Head Start agencies when appropriate. Revises provisions for designation of Head Start agencies to include consideration of the applicant agency's effectiveness based on: (1) its plan to provide, directly or through referral, child development and literacy skills training to parents of participating children; and (2) its plan (if it chooses to do so) for assisting younger siblings of participants to obtain health services from other sources. Authorizes the Secretary to appoint an interim grantee to carry out the Head Start program in a community served by such a program until a qualified applicant is designated, if there is not an applicant qualified for such designation. Requires Head Start agencies to provide, directly or through referral, child development and literacy skills training to parents of participating children. Requires such agencies to consider providing services to assist younger siblings of participants to obtain health services from other sources. Directs the Secretary to establish uniform procedures for Head Start agencies to request approval to purchase facilities to be used to carry out Head Start programs. Requires such request applications to include: (1) facility site description; (2) facility plans and specifications; (3) information demonstrating either that the purchase will result in a cost savings (compared to an alternative facility) or that there are no alternative facilities available; and (4) additional information and assurances that the Secretary requires. Makes certain technical amendments to the Act and to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990."
