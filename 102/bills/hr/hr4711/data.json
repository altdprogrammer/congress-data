Authorizes the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to make grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to conduct VTC authorized activities, as follows: (1) informational and outreach programs leading to development of programs designed to inform U.S. military veterans about teaching opportunities and necessary qualifications; (2) programs to create teaching opportunities for veterans; (3) support for programs to assist veterans to meet teacher qualifications; (4) information dissemination on the VTC program and on sources of student assistance under title IV of HEA and under programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and other Federal agencies; and (5) (from up to 65 percent of VTC program funds) scholarships for veterans under the same terms and conditions as the Paul Douglas Teacher Corps Scholarships program under subpart 1 of part B of title V. Sets forth grant application requirements for LEAs. Limits the amount and duration of each grant. Gives priority to LEA applications evidencing commitments of support for the program from veterans and teacher organizations in the applicant's jurisdiction. Requires evaluations and reports by grant recipients. Authorizes appropriations."
