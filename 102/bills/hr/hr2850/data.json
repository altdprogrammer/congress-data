Amends the Federal Law Enforcement Pay Reform Act of 1990 to provide that in the case of any area slated for a special pay adjustment that includes a portion, but not all, of a county, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may, at the request of the head of one or more law enforcement agencies, extend such area to include the entire county if the Office determines that such extension would be in the interest of good personnel administration. Makes miscellaneous and conforming amendments to various other civil service and postal service provisions, including those under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 with respect to benefit portability and cost of living adjustment funding, in order to correct technical errors. Amends the National Film Preservation Act of 1988 to repeal restrictions on the term of office of certain appointees to the Library of Congress' National Film Preservation Board. Makes technical corrections to the law making technical corrections to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990.

Amends the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act to repeal provisions regarding critical-position pay authority and reemployment of retirees. Provides that, notwithstanding provisions under FEPCA concerning locality-based comparability payments, for purposes of any comparability payments scheduled to take effect under such provisions during calendar years 1994 and 1995, respectively: (1) the report by the President's pay agent may be submitted not later than one month before the start of the calendar year for purposes of which it is prepared; and (2) the surveys conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for use in preparing any such report may be other than annual surveys, and shall, to the greatest extent practicable, be completed no later than four months before the start of the calendar year for purposes of which the surveys are conducted. Amends Federal law to direct OPM to prescribe regulations necessary for the administration of provisions concerned with the employment of experts and consultants by the Federal Government.
