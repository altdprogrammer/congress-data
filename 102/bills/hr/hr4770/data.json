Expresses the sense of the Congress that the exchange shall be completed by December 31, 1994. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to determine the value of Federal mineral interests exchanged pursuant to this Act by deducting the State's share in all royalties, sales, bonuses, interest charges, penalties, and rentals collected pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act from the appraised value of such mineral interests. Specifies that the revenues received by the State from Federal mineral leasing shall be recognized in the appraisal process as a matter of equity and not as a legal property right. Authorizes appropriations."
