Requires any educational agency that releases directory information to: (1) give public notice of the categories of such information to be released; and (2) allow a reasonable period of time after such notice has been given for a student or a parent (in the case of an individual younger than 18 years of age) to inform the agency that any or all of such information should not be released without obtaining prior consent from such student or parent. Specifies that nothing in this Act shall be construed to require students to attend recruitment events."
