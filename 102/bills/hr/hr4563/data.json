Permits the Government to seek one 12-month extension of the 12-month waiting period upon a showing that the additional period is necessary for the Government to decide whether or not to file a false claims suit. Allows a court to consider such a motion in camera. Eliminates the limitation on qui tam awards. Recasts the categories of lawsuits that are jurisdictionally barred. Excludes from False Claims Act coverage certain violations under the Agricultural Adjustment Act. Provides that whistleblower cases under the False Claims Act shall be governed by the same standard that generally applies to Federal employees under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. Establishes the applicability of various provisions of this Act and amendments to the False Claims Act enacted in 1986 and 1988."
