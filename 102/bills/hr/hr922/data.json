    "date": "1991-02-06", 
    "text": "Congressional Campaign Reform Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to: (1) increase from $1,000 to $2,000 the amount a person may contribute to a candidate and his authorized political committees for an election for Federal office; and (2) decrease from $5,000 to $1,000 the amount a multicandidate political committee may contribute to a candidate and the candidate's political committees. Requires multicandidate political committees and separate regulated funds to: (1) provide a method so that each person contributing to such committee or fund may specify to which Federal candidate or national political party organization such contribution is being made; and (2) provide each contributor with a list of the names and addresses for the authorized committee of every candidate and for each national political party organization. Requires corporations and labor organizations to report to the Federal Election Commission (Commission) payments or services they furnish which are directly attributable to a registration or get-out-the-vote campaign if the aggregate of such payments and the fair market value of such services exceeds $2,000 for any election. Deletes the exception to the reporting requirement for communication costs incurred by a membership organization (including a labor organization) or by a corporation primarily devoted to subjects other than the express advocacy of the election or defeat of a candidate. Sets forth disclosure requirements for independent expenditures through broadcast communications on any radio or television station. Provides that an expenditure is not an independent expenditure where the person making it is in cooperation, consultation, or concert with a candidate. Requires the Commission to provide a hearing within three days after receiving an allegation that an expenditure was made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with a candidate. Requires a candidate, within 15 days of qualifying for a primary election ballot, to file with the Commission and each other qualifying candidate a declaration stating whether or not such candidate intends to expend funds and incur personal loans for the primary and general election in the aggregate of $250,000 or more from the following sources: (1) personal funds; (2) family funds; and (3) personal loans incurred in connection with the campaign. Allows the opponents of such candidate to accept larger contribution amounts from individuals. Requires a candidate who files a declaration of intent not to expend more than $250,000 and who subsequently does exceed such amount, to file an amended declaration within 24 hours after exceeding it. Allows a candidate to repay a personal loan in connection with the candidate's campaign from contributions made to such candidate or his authorized committee. Prohibits the repayment of any interest on the principal amount of such loan. Prohibits a candidate from making expenditures from personal funds or family funds, or from incurring personal loans in connection with the election campaign at any time within 60 days before such election. Prohibits a candidate who makes expenditures from his personal funds or those of his immediate family to his campaign committee, or makes a loan from such funds to such committee, from using post-election contributions made by any other person to repay any such expenditure or loan. Increases the limit on expenditures made by the national committee of a political party on behalf of the general election campaign of a candidate for the Senate or an at-large House seat to five cents from two cents multiplied by the voting age population of the State, and to $25,000 from $10,000 for candidates running in multi-district States. Expands the definition of the term \"national committee\" to include the Democratic and Republican National Committees as well as their respective House and Senate campaign committees. Requires a national committee to report: (1) all contributions, loans, transfers, and other receipts from any source to the committee; (2) the identification of each person who provides such contribution in excess of $200 within the calendar year; and (3) all disbursements made by the committee. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to: (1) limit the cost to qualified candidates of broadcasting time for pre-election political advertising to the lowest rate charged for any time in the same period; and (2) prohibit any broadcast licensee from preempting the use of any such time purchased by a qualified candidate. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act to provide that contributions to candidates made payable to an intermediary or made to an intermediary other than the candidate's authorized committee shall be treated as contributions of the intermediary. Requires contributions that are solicited and contributed to a candidate or his authorized committee or agent to be made payable to a specific payee by the original payer."
