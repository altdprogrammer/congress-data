Authorizes appropriations for related remaining provisions. Authorizes appropriations for: (1) special projects to increase nursing education for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds; (2) traineeships for nurse anesthetists; and (3) loan repayment programs for nurses providing service in certain health facilities. Reallocates certain returned funds to such loan repayment programs rather than to programs for the undergraduate education of professional nurses. Includes schools of nursing as eligible for grants and contracts relating to geriatric education centers."
