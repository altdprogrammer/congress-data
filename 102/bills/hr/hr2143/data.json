    "text": "Indian Environmental Consolidated Grant Program Act of 1991 - Amends Federal law to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to consolidate any or all grants made to an Indian tribe under any law administered by the agency for any fiscal year or years. Prohibits the amount of a consolidated grant for any Indian tribe under this Act from being less than the aggregate sum of all grants consolidated. Authorizes the Indian tribe receiving such consolidated grant to determine the proportion of its proceeds to be allocated among the pertinent programs. Requires the Administrator to issue regulations establishing procedures for an Indian tribe to apply for such grants. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) waive any or all requirements for matching funds required by law to be provided by an Indian tribe in connection with such consolidated grant; (2) waive any requirement that an Indian tribe submit an application or report in writing with respect to the grant; and (3) adjust or modify maintenance or level of effort requirements for any Indian tribe with respect to it."
