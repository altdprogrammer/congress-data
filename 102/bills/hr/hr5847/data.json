Allows such exemption if: (1) the student is enrolled and is regularly attending classes in a nurses' training school; (2) the service performed by a nursing student is substantially less than full-time; (3) the total amount of annual earnings is less than 50 percent of the average annual earnings of a full-time registered nurse; and (4) the service fullfills a mandatory requirement of the employee's nurses' training school, qualifies the employee for credit toward a nursing degree or nursing certificate, or falls within the class of services typically performed by nurses in the course of their duties or by nursing students in a clinical work training program."
