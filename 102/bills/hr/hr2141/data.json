Requires the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to finalize, and review and revise at least once every four years, the comprehensive management plan developed for the conservation area. Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), to establish a visitor center designed to interpret the history and the geological, ecological, natural, cultural, and other resources of the area and the biology of the raptors and their relationships to man. Authorizes the Secretary to permit visitor use of the public lands in the conservation area in a manner that is consistent with the protection of raptors and their habitats, public safety, and the conservation of the area. Requires the Secretary to permit continued use of the conservation area's Orchard Training Area by the Idaho National Guard. Authorizes the continued grazing of domestic livestock within such area. Declares that nothing in this Act shall affect: (1) recognized agricultural practices or other activities on private land adjacent to the conservation area; or (2) the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with respect to the continued operation of hydroelectric facilities located within such area. Provides that lands acquired by the Secretary within the conservation area shall become a part of such area. Requires the Secretary to study, identify and, where appropriate, initiate land exchanges to resolve ownership conflicts within the area. Releases lands within the Snake River Birds of Prey National Area that have been found unsuitable for wilderness designation from further management pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Declares that nothing in this Act shall constitute a Federal reservation of water rights in such area. Authorizes appropriations."
