    "text": "Security Officers Quality Assurance Act of 1992 - Makes a State ineligible for certain funding under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 or under the Crime Control Act of 1990 unless such State has in effect or establishes pursuant to this Act a program to license and control security officers and employers of security officers. Directs the Attorney General of each State to report the provisions of the State's program to the Attorney General of the United States as part of the grant process under such Acts. Requires each State to establish requirements and procedures for the licensing and review of operations of security contractors and employers of proprietary security officers within two years. Authorizes the licensing agency of each State to charge a reasonable fee for applicants and licensees to offset administrative costs of the program, subject to specified requirements. Directs that State requirements and procedures, at a minimum, provide that employers, including security contractors, permanently deploy a person as a security officer only after completion of preemployment screening, training, and licensing under guidelines specified in this Act. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) preemployment screening, including background checks; (2) security officer training and employer certification; (3) State licensing procedures for such officers; and (4) a prohibition on an employer's contracting with such an officer to limit the employee's right to seek other employment as a security officer following termination. Requires the State to establish procedures regarding criminal charges against a security officer, based on specified minimum guidelines. Provides penalties for violations of this Act."
