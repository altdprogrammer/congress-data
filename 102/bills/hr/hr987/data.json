Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to: (1) exclude from the annual limitation on total individual contributions those contributions to national, State, and local committees of political parties that, in the aggregate, do not exceed $25,000 in a calendar year; (2) remove the limitations on contributions by the national or State committee of a political party or by a House or Senate campaign committee of a political party to candidates in general elections for Federal office; (3) allow national and State committees of a political party to match the total amount of independent expenditures made against their respective candidates in congressional elections; (4) establish guidelines for determining the Federal election portion of amounts paid by national and State committees of a political party for a mixed political activity (an activity, such as a voter registration program, for both influencing an election for Federal office and for other purposes); (5) subject such payments to the limitations and reporting requirements for expenditures; (6) require such payments to be made only from an account subject to the requirements of that Act; (7) repeal provisions excluding funds for constructing or purchasing office facilities from the definition of a \"contribution\"; (8) define \"local committee\" as an organization that is responsible for the daily operation of a political party at the local level; and (9) allow such local committees to make contributions and expenditures without limitation to any candidate who is affiliated with the party the committee represents and who is a candidate for Senator or Representative in the State involved."
