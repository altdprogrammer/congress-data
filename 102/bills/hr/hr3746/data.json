    "text": "Nuclear Weapons Material Production Termination Act - Prohibits after August 1, 1992, the expenditure of funds by any Federal department or agency for: (1) the production of tritium, plutonium, or weapons-grade uranium; or (2) the development, procurement, or construction of equipment or facilities for such production. Directs that savings achieved as the result of such prohibition shall be used for FY 1993 and thereafter for environmental restoration activities at Department of Energy nuclear weapons facilities. Directs the President to conduct five-year studies on the quantity of tritium needed by the United States and on the costs and environmental impacts of alternative methods of obtaining it. Requires the President to report study results to the Congress. States that the prohibition will no longer be in effect if the Congress, after receiving a report from the President, adopts a joint resolution which finds an overriding need to produce tritium."
