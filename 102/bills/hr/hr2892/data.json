    "text": "Terrorist Alien Removal Act of 1991 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality to establish removal procedures for alien terrorists, including a special removal hearing open to the public. Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) the introduction of evidence; (2) the burden of proof; and (3) appeals. Directs the Chief Justice of the United States to designate five district court judges from five of the U.S. judicial circuits, to serve five-year terms, who shall constitute a court with jurisdiction to conduct all matters and proceedings authorized under this title. Sets forth provisions with respect to the retention of an alien in custody (including affording a reasonable opportunity for such alien to communicate with and receive visits from family members, to communicate with an attorney, and to contact an appropriate diplomatic or consular official of the alien's country), the deportation of such alien to the alien's or a third country, and the transfer of such alien to the custody of State authorities, as appropriate. Grants exclusive jurisdiction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review excludability orders. Provides for a ten-year prison sentence, to run concurrently with any other sentence, and a fine, for entering (or attempting to enter) the United States subsequent to exclusion or removal."
