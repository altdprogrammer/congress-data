Requires inspections to be conducted as part of a heavy maintenance check, on or after the first day of the 15th year in which such aircraft is in service. Requires air carriers, at a minimum, to demonstrate to the Administrator that maintenance of the aircraft's structure, skin, and other age-sensitive components has been adequate to ensure the highest degree of safety. Directs the Administrator to establish certain aircraft maintenance safety programs, including one for the training of inspectors and engineers. Requires the Administrator to encourage foreign governments and relevant international organizations to develop requirements for inspections which will ensure the continuing airworthiness of aging foreign carrier aircraft to and from the United States and which will afford passengers of such aircraft the same level of safety as afforded passengers of U.S. aircraft. Title V: Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing - Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to establish a program requiring domestic and foreign air carriers to conduct preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, recurring, and post-accident testing of airmen, crewmembers, airport security screening contract personnel, and other air carrier employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions for use of alcohol or a controlled substance. Requires the Administrator to establish the same program for FAA employees. Sets forth guidelines for such program. Prohibits such employees from serving in safety-sensitive functions unless they have completed a rehabilitation program established under FAA auspices. Prohibits such individuals from performing air transportation-related duties if they: (1) engaged in such use while on duty; (2) prior to such use had undertaken or completed a rehabilitation program; (3) refuse to undertake such rehabilitation program; or (4) fail such rehabilitation program. Requires domestic and foreign air carriers to maintain a rehabilitation program for the identification and treatment of their employees who need assistance in resolving substance abuse problems.

Outlines the requirements of such program. Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 to direct the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to issue regulations that establish a program which requires railroads to conduct preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, recurring, and post-accident testing of railroad employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions for use of alcohol or a controlled substance. Outlines the requirements for such testing program. Requires each railroad to maintain a rehabilitation program for the identification and treatment of their employees who need assistance in resolving substance abuse problems. Amends the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 to direct the Secretary to establish a program requiring motor carriers to conduct preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident testing of commercial motor vehicle operators for use of alcohol or a controlled substance. Mandates that such program include post-accident testing of a commercial motor vehicle operator in any accident involving loss of human life, serious bodily injury, or significant property damage. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations setting forth the requirements for a rehabilitation program for the identification and treatment of commercial motor vehicle operators who are determined to have used alcohol or a controlled substance. Sets forth the requirements of the testing procedures. Requires the Secretary to: (1) determine appropriate sanctions against operators who are determined, as a result of such tests, to have used alcohol or a controlled substances without lawful authorization (but who are not under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance); (2) design and implement a pilot test program (as part of the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program) for the random testing of commercial motor vehicle operators to determine the use without lawful authorization of alcohol or a controlled substance; (3) solicit (and select) State participation in such a program; and (4) submit a comprehensive report to the Congress setting forth the pilot program results.
