Requires that members with lower income levels receive first priority in the provision of such services. Directs the Secretary to establish a voucher system for partial payment by the Department of Defense (DOD) of the expenses of such services provided by an entity other than DOD. Sets voucher amounts as the difference between the amount paid for such services by the member and the amount that would have been paid had such services been provided at a military child development center. Requires FY 1992 DOD funding levels to be adjusted so that the total amount appropriated for national defense does not exceed required Federal spending limits."
