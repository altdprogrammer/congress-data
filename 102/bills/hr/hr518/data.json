    "text": "Provides that, notwithstanding the current $50,000 limit on the amount of life insurance available to active-duty military personnel under the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance Program, a policy purchased by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for military personnel assigned to active duty in the Persian Gulf in connection with Operation Desert Shield shall automatically provide such member an additional $50,000 coverage. Allows such member to elect in writing not to receive such additional insurance, or to receive such additional insurance in increments of $10,000. Terminates the additional insurance when such duty in the Persian Gulf is completed. Extends such insurance for an additional period if the member sustains an injury or illness in connection with such duty."
