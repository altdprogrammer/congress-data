    "text": "Supplemental Compensation Act of 1991 - Establishes a Federal supplemental unemployment compensation program. Allows any State to enter into and participate in an agreement with the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) under which the State agency which administers the State unemployment compensation law will make payments of Federal supplemental compensation: (1) to individuals who have exhausted all rights to regular compensation under State law, have no rights to such regular compensation or any additional State or Federal compensation, and are not receiving Canadian compensation; and (2) for any week of unemployment beginning in the individual's eligibility period. Sets forth provisions relating to exhaustion of regular benefits and the weekly amount of supplemental benefits equal to regular benefits. Requires a State, under such an agreement, to establish a Federal supplemental compensation account with respect to the benefit year of each eligible individual who files an application. Limits benefit payments to not more than the amount in the individual's account. Sets forth formulas for determining the amount in such account. Provides that such amount shall be equal to the lesser of: (1) 100 percent of the total amount of regular compensation (including dependents' allowances) payable to the individual with respect to the most recent regular benefit year; or (2) 26 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount for the benefit year. Coordinates the Federal supplemental compensation program with the trade readjustment allowance program under the Trade Act of 1974. Sets forth general, special, and transitional rules for supplemental benefit periods, individual eligibility periods, State on and off indicators, and a temporary national trigger. Sets forth provisions for payments to States having such agreements for Federal supplemental compensation. Sets forth provisions relating to fraud and overpayments. Repeals the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Act of 1970, and references to the extended unemployment compensation program (established by such Act) in the Federal Unemployment Tax Act provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and in the Social Security Act."
