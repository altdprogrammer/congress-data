    "text": "Enhanced Safety in Foreign Interdiction Efforts Act of 1991 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to furnish assistance described by this Act to eligible countries to assist in the interdiction of drug traffickers in such countries. Permits funds for such assistance to be drawn from funds provided for drug interdiction and counter-drug activities of the Department of Defense (DOD). Authorizes such assistance to consist of: (1) defense articles; (2) intelligence information and support regarding the location and movement of drug traffickers; and (3) members of the U.S. armed forces or other DOD personnel assigned to perform duties of a noncombatant nature. Makes a country eligible for assistance if: (1) the country is provided more than a specified amount of international narcotics control assistance; (2) the country is under a significant terrorist or security threat from drug traffickers; and (3) substantial airborne drug trafficking is carried out in the country. Prohibits a country from receiving such assistance unless the country agrees to: (1) limit the use of force against drug traffickers; (2) accept members of the U.S. armed forces and other DOD personnel to provide training to personnel of such country to enhance the safety and accuracy of interdiction of drug traffickers; (3) prohibit the use of deadly force against civilian aircraft in international airspace or the airspace of another country; and (4) comply with other conditions on the use of such assistance, as appropriate. Prohibits members of the U.S. armed forces or DOD personnel from using deadly force against drug traffickers. Terminates assistance to countries failing to comply with conditions of such assistance. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should work with the other signatories of the Convention on Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention) to amend the Convention to authorize the use of force under controlled circumstances in the interdiction of airborne drug traffickers in countries under siege by drug traffickers."
