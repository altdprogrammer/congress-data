Requires the Secretary to make such identifications and to review such RTC inventory. Requires RTC updates of such inventory and prohibits disposition of such property for a specified period. Provides that upon expression of serious interest in such property by a qualified land steward (any governmental entity or private nonprofit organization) the RTC is precluded from disposing of it to any other person. Prescribes guidelines for such property transfers to qualified land stewards."
