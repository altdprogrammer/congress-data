Establishes a spending allowance, in lieu of the Official Mail Allowance, for postage for official mail of the House. Makes such allowance available to members in the same manner and to the same extent as the Official Mail Allowance with specified exceptions. Directs the Postmaster of the House to take necessary actions to provide for use of postage meters to record the cost and volume of mail paid for from such spending allowance for postage. Transfers all amounts, but for the enactment of this Act, that would have been available to pay for franked mail of the House to the spending allowance for postage."
