Authorizes Washington State to develop and submit to the Secretary of the Interior a management and research plan for the Olympic Experimental State Forest that: (1) is based upon certain recommendations of the Commission on Old Growth Alternatives for Washington's Forest Trust Lands; (2) is developed by the State land management agency in consultation with the State wildlife agency and the Olympic Natural Resources Center; (3) provides for research-management integration; (4) provides for the conservation of the northern spotted owl, other sensitive species, and the Forest's ecology; and (5) provides a decision-making framework. Directs the Secretary to: (1) review (including a public comment period) a management and research plan within 90 days of submission, and notify the State upon approval; and (2) periodically review the implementation of an approved plan."
