Describes such health professional as: (1) one with at least 75 percent of gross income attributable to primary health services performed for a medically underserved group pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services; (2) any physician, dentist, certified nurse midwife, certified nurse practitioner, or physician assistant; and (3) one who has not received any scholarship or loan repayment under the National Health Service Corps Program. Describes primary health services as family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, dentistry, or mental health. Limits such deduction to $10,000. Extends student loan deferments for borrowers serving in an accredited internship or residency program."
