(Current law authorizes the Capitol Police to enforce such laws within the U.S. Capitol Buildings and Grounds only.) Changes the composition of the Capitol Police Board. Directs the Chairman of the Committee on House Administration of the House of Representatives and the Chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate to alternate, by session of Congress, as Chairman of the Board. Requires the payroll administration for members and civilian support personnel of the Capitol Police to be carried out on a unified basis by a single disbursing authority. Requires the Capitol Police Board, with the approval of specified congressional committees, to provide for such payroll administration. Makes such unified payroll administration effective as of FY 1993. Title II: Lump-Sum Payment Provisions - Provides that an officer or member of the U.S. Capitol Police who separates from service within two years of the enactment of this title, and who satisfies the age and service requirements for an immediate annuity pursuant to Federal law, shall be entitled to receive a lump-sum payment for his or her accumulated and current accrued annual leave attributable to service performed by such individual as an officer or non-civilian member of the Capitol Police Force. Sets forth disbursement procedures for such lump-sum payments."
