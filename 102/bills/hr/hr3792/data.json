    "text": "D-Day 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the 50th anniversary of the allied landings at Normandy should not go unrecognized; and (2) the United States should recognize this anniversary by minting and issuing coins to commemorate such event. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue a maximum specified number of one dollar silver coins to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the landings. Requires surcharges from the sale of such coins to be deposited in a coinage profit fund and held in a segregated account until the Congress authorizes the establishment of a memorial on Federal land in the District of Columbia or its environs to honor members of the Armed Forces who served in World War II and to commemorate U.S. participation in such war. Requires any funds not needed for the memorial to be used for the maintenance of other specified memorials and exhibitions. Requires all of the funds to be used for such maintenance if the Congress does not authorize such memorial by December 31, 1993. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on activities under this Act by June 30, 1993, and semiannually thereafter."
