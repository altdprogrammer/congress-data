Title II: Water Utility Corporations - Allows private businesses to construct and operate water projects as public utilities, subject to specified terms and conditions. Title III: General Provisions - Overrides State laws made inconsistent by the enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this Act."
