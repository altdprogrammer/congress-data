    "text": "Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 - Title I: Judicial Naturalization Ceremonies Amendments - Judicial Naturalization Ceremonies Amendments of 1991 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended by the Immigration Act of 1990, to grant eligible Federal and State courts exclusive jurisdiction to administer naturalization oath of allegiance ceremonies during the 45-day period beginning on the date on which the Attorney General certifies to the court that an applicant is eligible for naturalization if the court has notified the Attorney General prior to the date of certification of eligibility of the days scheduled for oath ceremonies. Requires the Attorney General to issue a certificate of naturalization at the time of such ceremony. Provides for both a judicial and administrative expedited naturalization oath ceremony upon demonstration of sufficient cause (such as illness, disability, exigent travel or employment circumstances). Directs the Attorney General to pay courts a specified annual percentage of all fees with respect to persons administered the oath by the respective courts. Title II: O and P Nonimmigrant Amendments - O and P Nonimmigrant Amendments of 1991 - Revises provisions with respect to the admission of O and P visa nonimmigrants (aliens of extraordinary ability, entertainers, and athletes). Repeals the 25,000 annual cap on P-1 and P-3 visas. Requires the General Accounting Office to submit a report regarding O and P admissions and foreign treatment of U.S. artists and entertainers to the appropriate congressional committees, who shall then hold a related hearing. Revises P-1 classification standards. Establishes exceptions to the requirement that a P-1 alien must have at least one year's membership with his or her group, including: (1) certain alien circus personnel; (2) automatic waiver for 25 percent of a group; and (3) replacement due to exigent circumstances. Authorizes P-1 groups to be \"nationally recognized\" in lieu of \"internationally recognized\" under special circumstances. Revises consultation requirements to: (1) require specified O or P aliens to submit advisory opinions regarding expertise from peer groups or labor unions; (2) permit the Attorney General to adjudicate a visa petition without an advisory opinion if no appropriate peer group exists; (3) direct the Attorney General to establish an expedited consultation procedure; and (4) waive the consultation requirement for an 0-1 alien readmission if such alien has had a consultation within the previous two years. Defines extraordinary ability in the arts for an O visa to mean \"distinction.\" Makes O visa revisions regarding paperwork requirements, and multiple events. Repeals the three-month out of country waiting time for P-2 and P-3 readmissions. Makes P visa revisions regarding treatment of foreign organizations and performance of teaching and coaching functions. Establishes a return transportation requirement for O and P aliens (employer and petitioner jointly and severally liable for such cost). Treats fashion modeling as a specialty occupation for nonimmigrant admissions purposes. Directs the Attorney General to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees regarding O, P, H, and Q visa petitions. Title III: Miscellaneous and Technical Corrections - Immigration Technical Corrections Act of 1991 - Provides for a FY 1993 carryover of unused family- and employment-based visas. Permits a widow or widower whose U.S. citizen spouse died before enactment of this Act to file for immediate relative status within two years of enactment (rather than two years from the spouse's death). Substitutes percentages in lieu of the specified numbers in the distribution formula used for employment-based visas.
