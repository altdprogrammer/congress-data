    "text": "United States-Mexico Border Environmental Zone Protection Act - Establishes the United States-Mexico Border Environmental Zone Protection Fund to be used by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to investigate and respond to conditions which present a threat to the land, air, or water resources of the United States-Mexico border region (Border Environmental Zone). Authorizes the Administrator, whenever conditions exist which present a substantial threat to the land, air, or water resources in such region, to declare an environmental emergency. Permits the Governors of the States of Arizona, California, New Mexico, or Texas or the governing body of a federally recognized Indian tribe to petition for the declaration of an environmental emergency in such region. Prohibits the Administrator from declaring an emergency if the condition is within the sole jurisdiction of the International Boundary and Water Commission. Authorizes the Administrator to establish a system for information sharing and for early warning to the United States and affected States, political subdivisions, and Indian tribes of environmental problems affecting the Border Environmental Zone. Requires the Administrator to establish a United States-Mexico Border Environmental Zone Protection Advisory Committee to: (1) monitor and study environmental conditions within the Border Environmental Zone; and (2) make recommendations for ongoing environmental protection in such zone. Directs the Secretary of State, acting through the United States Commissioner, International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico, to conclude agreements with the Ministry of Foreign Relations of Mexico for: (1) the correction of border sanitation problems in international streams forming or crossing the boundary between the United States and Mexico; and (2) a joint response through the construction of works, repair of existing infrastructure, and other measures to correct border sanitation emergencies in such streams. Defines such emergencies as situations in which untreated or inadequately treated sewage is discharged into surface waters or streams that form or cross the U.S.--Mexican boundary. Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner, to correct border sanitation emergencies in such streams in the United States. Permits the Secretary to enter into agreements with Mexico to establish a binational advisory committee to: (1) assist EPA and the Mexican environmental agency (SEDUE) in the monitoring and study of environmental conditions within the Zone; (2) make recommendations for ongoing environmental protection within the Zone; and (3) carry out other functions prescribed by EPA and SEDUE. Prohibits the expenditure of U.S. funds for emergency investigation or remediation in Mexico without a cost-sharing agreement unless the Secretary can demonstrate that the expenditure of such funds would be cost-effective and in the U.S. interest. Establishes the United States International Boundary and Water Commission Fund to carry out this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
