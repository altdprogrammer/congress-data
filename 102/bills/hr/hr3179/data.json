    "text": "Cooperative Education Amendments Act of 1991 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise the programs for cooperative education, and to authorize appropriations for them. Reserves 50 percent of such funds for grants for new programs of cooperative education to institutions of higher education (and combinations of such institutions) which have not received such funds for the administration of the cooperative education program for the ten preceding years. Reserves 25 percent of such funds for grants for established programs of cooperative education to institutions of higher education (and combinations of them) that have received such assistance for at least five fiscal years and meet other specified requirements. Limits established program grants to a maximum of five years. Decreases the percentage of the reservation for demonstration projects, and increases those for training and resource centers and for research. Decreases, by specified amounts for each grant year, the Federal share of cooperative education grants. Limits to three percent of such program funds the amount which the Secretary of Education may use to enter into administrative contracts to carry out the program for demonstration and innovation projects, training and resource centers, and research."
