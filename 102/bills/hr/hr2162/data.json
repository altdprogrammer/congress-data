Requires NASA to report to the Congress on the use of such provisions. Requires the Comptroller General to: (1) report annually to the Congress, reviewing such determinations by NASA's administrator; and (2) conduct a Government-wide study and report to the Congress on the use of such provisions in saving costs to the Government and on the availability of private insurance for contractor negligence in research and development projects."
