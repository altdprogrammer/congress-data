    "date": "1991-06-27", 
    "text": "Amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to increase penalties for: (1) distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or manufacturing a controlled substance in or near a school (\"drug-free\" zone); and (2) specified offenses relating to listed precursor chemicals. Eliminates the exemption from regulatory provisions under such Act with respect to listed chemicals for any transaction in such a chemical that is contained in a drug that may be marketed or distributed lawfully in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Provides for a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years' imprisonment for drive-by shootings. Bars the court from suspending such sentence, placing the person convicted of such violation on probation, or allowing the term of imprisonment to run concurrently with any other term imposed on such person. Establishes within the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) the National Center for Outlaw Street and Motorcycle Gang Anaylsis to identify gangs that engage in drug-related and other violent crime, to gather and share intelligence on illegal drug activities undertaken by such gangs, to increase public awareness, to establish a national hotline for the public to report unlawful gang activity, to conduct seminars and conferences for law enforcement and correction agencies and community leaders, and to publish an annual report on gang identification, the incidence of gang use of explosives and firearms, and the results of Federal outlaw gang eradication efforts. Authorizes appropriations. Makes the Director of the BATF responsible for: (1) providing national oversight in the accumulation and dissemination of gang-related information; and (2) coordination of gang-related investigations by Federal law enforcement agencies. Amends: (1) the CSA to provide for enhanced penalties for distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or manufacturing a controlled substance in or near public housing; and (2) the Public and Assisted Housing Drug Elimination Act of 1990 to authorize the use of grant funds for the determination by the public housing agency of the geographical boundaries of, and the posting of signs identifying the property of the projects as, drug-free zones. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to require each public housing agency to post notices regarding the penalty imposed by this Act in common areas and at other appropriate locations in public housing projects of the agency. Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties for persons who: (1) actively participate in a pattern of criminal street gang activity by an ongoing organization or association of three or more persons; and (2) travel, or use any facility, in interstate or foreign commerce (including the mail) with intent to promote, further, or assist in the commission of such activity by such an organization or association."
