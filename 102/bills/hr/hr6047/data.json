    "text": "Amends the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 to authorize the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) to enter into contracts for the construction of Voice of America facilities in Sri Lanka, Sao Tome, and Kuwait. Amends the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 to permit funds authorized to be appropriated for any account of USIA in the Department of State and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, for the second fiscal year of any two-year authorization cycle, to be appropriated for the second fiscal year for any other USIA account. Prohibits amounts appropriated for the salaries and expenses and educational and cultural exchange programs accounts from exceeding by more than five percent (ten percent for any other account) the amount authorized to be appropriated for such accounts in a fiscal year. Terminates such amendments after September 30, 1993. Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to require deductions from the basic pay of Foreign Service criminal investigators/inspectors of the Office of Inspector General of the Agency for International Development (AID) in amounts equal to amounts deducted for retirement purposes from the pay of civil service law enforcement officers. Provides for the deposit of deducted amounts, along with an equivalent amount contributed by the Department of State, into the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund. Requires a special contribution for past service as an AID investigator/inspector which would have been creditable toward civil service law enforcement retirement and for which a contribution has not been made to equal the difference between the amount actually contributed under Foreign Service retirement provisions and the amount that should have been contributed under civil service provisions. Increases the mandatory retirement age for AID criminal investigators/inspectors to 57 (currently, 55). Amends the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1991 to provide that U.S. hostages paid salaries in amounts that were not adjusted to compensate for a devaluation of the Lebanese pound during their captivity shall not be considered to have received such salaries for purposes of eligibility for Federal benefits."
