    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the President to waive specified conflict of interest statutes with respect to an individual if the President determines and certifies in writing that, in order to deal with an emergency that threatens public health or safety, national security, or national defense preparedness: (1) it is in the public interest to grant the waiver; (2) the services of the individual are critically needed for the benefit of the Government; and (3) the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for a conflict of interest. Makes such waiver effective for a period of not more than 90 days, subject to renewal, with exceptions. Requires that: (1) a copy of each certification made under this Act be transmitted to the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, unless the President determines that public availability of such certification would jeopardize national security; and (2) the Director make a copy of such certification available to the public (but authorizes the Director to withhold from disclosure any information which would be exempt from disclosure under provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act). Bars the President from delegating the waiver authority provided under this Act. Repeals provisions which authorize the President to grant a waiver of restrictions with respect to the disqualification of former executive branch officers and employees and their partners where in the public interest and when critically needed for the benefit of the Government."
