    "text": "Telephone Network Reliability Act of 1991 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to prescribe regulations to: (1) establish such network reliability and quality standards for common carriers as are necessary to ensure the reliable delivery of basic telephone service; and (2) continue the development and deployment of advanced network features. Specifies that such standards shall establish: (1) a quantitative scale for measuring the impact of service outages on customers affected, the capacity of the network to continue provision of services through redundant facilities, and the impact of the outage on emergency communications services; (2) requirements for common carriers to notify the FCC immediately and effectively of significant outages; and (3) procedures for the evaluation of each outage on the basis of such quantitative standards, and for improving communication among common carriers concerning the occurrence of, reason for, and techniques and devices to prevent, such outages. Directs the FCC, in prescribing any regulation or issuing any order under such Act, to: (1) evaluate the impact of such regulation or order on network reliability and quality; and (2) include in the record of any proceeding to presribe such regulation or issue such order a statement of the results of such evaluation. Requires the FCC to establish one or more advisory committees to recommend appropriate steps, for both government and industry, to assure the reliability and quality of the telephone network. Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) the composition of such committees; and (2) reporting requirements. Directs the FCC to conduct a study on the role of the FCC in ensuring network reliability. Sets forth reporting requirements."
