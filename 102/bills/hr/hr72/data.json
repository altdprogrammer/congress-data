    "text": "Defense Consultant Registration and Reform Act of 1991 - Prohibits defense agencies from awarding a contract for advisory and assistance services to any consultant unless: (1) such consultant complies with the registration requirements of this Act; and (2) the contracting officer has reviewed the registration information and determined that such consultant does not have a conflict of interests that could be prejudicial to the United States. Prohibits defense agencies from awarding a contract to any person submitting a bid to such agencies unless such person certifies that each consultant that has assisted in the preparation of such bid has complied with the registration requirements of this Act. Requires each consultant who has submitted a bid or who has been retained in connection with the preparation of a bid for a Department of Defense (DOD) contract to register with the DOD Office of Standards of Conduct. Requires such consultants to update the registered information upon submitting a bid or being retained for the preparation of a bid for another DOD contract. Directs the DOD Inspector General to monitor the compliance of consultants with the registration requirements of this Act and to report annually to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees on the extent of such compliance. Subjects any consultant who intentionally fails to comply with such registration requirements to suspension and debarment proceedings. Provides that this Act shall not apply to contracts which, as determined by the Secretary of Defense, involve: (1) sensitive foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities; (2) sensitive law enforcement investigations; or (3) special access programs."
