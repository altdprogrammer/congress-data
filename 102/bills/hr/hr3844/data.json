Directs the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs to: (1) assess with the participation of internationally recognized human rights organizations the treatment of returned Haitians, with particular attention to human rights violations; (2) submit preliminary and final reports to the House and the Senate. Directs the President to reallocate 2000 federally funded FY 1992 refugee admissions to Haiti. Urges the President and the Secretary of State to participate with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the member countries of the Organization of American States (OAS) to convene an international conference aimed at resolving the Haitian refugee crisis. Prohibits the admission into the United States of any Haitian national involved in the September 30, 1991, coup which overthrew the Aristide Government, or in subsequent acts against the Haitian people. Authorizes appropriations to reimburse State and local governments for costs associated with Haitians permitted entry under this Act. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should urge the United Nations or the OAS to send a peacekeeping force to Haiti to help keep order and protect repatriated Haitians and human rights monitors. Expresses the sense of the Congress urging the President and the Attorney General to ensure that the entry of Haitian refugees and displaced persons does not disproportionately impact any individual State."
