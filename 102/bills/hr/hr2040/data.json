Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for a limited amount of adoption expenses. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 to extend to October 1, 1993, the termination date of a test program for reimbursement of adoption expenses of members of the armed forces. Amends Part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance Program) of title IV of the Social Security Act to prohibit payments to a State under provisions relating to foster care and adoption assistance if any public agency responsible for adoption placement has failed to fully disclose to prospective adoptive parents all information regarding the child's health. Amends the Public Health Service Act to mandate grants to two States to establish demonstration programs to provide maternal health certificates to low-income pregnant females residing or awaiting residence in a maternity home. Requires eligible maternity homes to provide specified services, including room and board, medical care, and counseling and services concerning health, adoption, education, vocation, or employment. Requires that such homes accept the certificates as full payment. Directs the Secretary of Education to develop a model curriculum for educating individuals on issues of adoption that are relevant to the field of social work. Requires the curriculum to be appropriate for secondary, postsecondary, and continuing education settings. Authorizes appropriations."
