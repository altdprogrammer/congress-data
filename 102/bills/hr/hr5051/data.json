    "text": "Prescription Accountability and Patient Care Improvement Act of 1992 - Title I: Assisting in Implementation of Controlled Substance Accountability Prescription Systems - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make funds available to at least ten States: (1) for electronic prescription accountability and patient care improvement programs under this Act; (2) to supplement State electronic claims management systems under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act; (3) for the operations of existing triplicate systems under this Act; and (4) to supplement the implementation of guidelines developed by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and accepted drug utilization review principles to improve patient care and physician prescribing practices. Authorizes appropriations, to be derived solely from fees imposed under the Controlled Substances Act, as amended by this Act. Amends the Controlled Substances Act to authorize fees for registration to manufacture controlled substances in certain schedules and relating to the administration of programs to prevent and detect illegal and inappropriate drug distribution by allowing information on prescriptions of drugs that are controlled in Schedules II, III, and IV to be electronically transmitted to State health agencies. Describes a controlled substances electronic accountable prescription system, including requirements that it electronically report the dispensing of certain drugs. Requires the State health agency to: (1) pay transmittal costs; and (2) make all necessary transmittal equipment available to dispensers without charge. Requires each State system to provide for the maintenance of information in a central repository meeting certain requirements. Requires each State to designate a State agency to administer the collection of system information, control information access, and produce reports of aggregated data that indicate that a substance has been dispensed for a period outside the expected standards. Provides for confidentiality and disclosure of information. Requires the Director of a State agency to appoint a Prescription Accountability and Patient Care Improvement Board. Mandates disclosure to: (1) the State narcotics control agency and medical boards or licensing agencies only when there is reasonable cause for further inquiry into the illegal diversion or illegal prescribing of controlled substances; and (2) State medical boards and licensing agencies, and State medical societies only when there is reasonable cause for further inquiry of a medically inappropriate prescribing of controlled substances, for developing rules and procedures to improve physician prescribing practices and patient care. Requires the State health agency to: (1) appoint a Practice Parameter Advisory Panel; and (2) develop procedures to address the needs of individuals in need of substance abuse treatment counseling for controlled substances. Title II: Reports and Studies - Establishes a nationwide patient care improvement telephone hotline to respond to questions from patients, physicians, pharmacists, and any other health care practitioner involved in the dispensing or regulation of drugs. Requires that the hotline collect fees through \"1-900\" technologies to cover all hotline costs. Establishes the National Commission on Special Medical Needs to: (1) develop new initiatives regarding the appropriate prescribing of medically necessary drugs, including addressing both underprescribing and overprescribing; and (2) establish a system for identifying physicians needing further education on the needs of severely ill patients. Mandates regular consultation between certain officials of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regarding the annual quota for legal manufacture of schedule II controlled substances. Directs the Secretary to regularly advise the DEA of: (1) continuing medical developments in the therapeutically-effective prescribing of schedule II controlled substances; and (2) any developing shortages of schedule II controlled substances for pain or narcolepsy patients. Requires ongoing studies and reports to the Congress of the costs and benefits of existing electronic data transfer and multiple-copy prescription programs relating to controlled substances, including programs implemented under title I of this Act. Mandates ongoing efforts to identify prescription drugs which are not schedule II-IV controlled substances but which are subject to illegal diversion or needless addiction. Requires development and distribution of a brief information brochure regarding proper prescribing of controlled substances for specialty treatment. Mandates development of printed patient inserts regarding controlled substance use, including listing the hotline number. Requires the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to develop computer software to administer this Act, taking all steps to ensure compatibility with the Medicaid Audit Data Accounting Systems (MADAS)."
