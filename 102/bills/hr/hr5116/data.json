    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Defense Economic Adjustment, Conversion, and Reinvestment Act of 1992 - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer funds appropriated pursuant to this Act to the head of another Federal agency to carry out this Act. Title I: Assistance for Defense Workers - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act to expand the definition of \"eligible employee\" to include an employee at a substantially and seriously affected business or at a military facility scheduled to be closed, even if the employee has not yet been terminated. Amends the Defense Economic Adjustment, Diversification, Conversion, and Stabilization Act of 1990 to extend the authorization of appropriations for adjustment assistance for defense employees. Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish a Skills Conversion Program to re-educate, retrain, and reorient scientific and technical personnel who are displaced or threatened with displacement by defense budget reductions to fill positions in industries that can utilize such skills. Title II: Community Economic Adjustment Assistance - Prohibits the Secretary of Commerce, in making assistance available to communities through the Economic Development Administration, from giving a preference to substantially and seriously affected communities affected as a result of military installation closures over communities affected as a result of the curtailment, completion, elimination, or realignment of a defense contract. Extends the authorization of appropriations for such assistance through FY 1993. Title III: Small Business Programs - Amends the Small Business Act to increase the amounts authorized to be made by the Small Business Administration in: (1) deferred participation loans and other financing; and (2) guarantees of debentures for programs related to small business investment companies. Directs Federal agencies required to establish small business innovation research programs to expend at least .65 percent of their extramural budgets in FY 1993 for entering into funding agreements to assist small business concerns adversely affected by reductions in the Federal defense budget. Title IV: Economic Adjustment Committee Programs - Requires the Economic Adjustment Committee to implement programs under which: (1) the Federal Government guarantees loans made to a seriously and substantially affected business that is engaged in the production of military products or the provision of services to the military to assist the business in producing commercially viable products and services through the acquisition or construction of facilities, the purchase or reconfiguration of equipment, or the opening of new markets; (2) the Committee may provide assistance to public and private entities for the construction of physical infrastructure facilities which support the defense conversion purposes of this Act; and (3) the Committee identifies the relevant skills of defense civilian and military employees and military personnel who are displaced by defense budget reductions for purposes of filling positions for the infrastructure program. Requires the Secretary of Defense to provide for feasibility studies on military installations scheduled to be closed or realigned before December 31, 1997, to examine potential uses for such installations. Authorizes appropriations. Title V: Assistance for Exports of United States Products and Services - Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to require the Export-Import Bank to develop a program for providing guarantees and insurance with respect to the export of high technology items to eligible East European countries (as defined by the Support for Eastern European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989). Directs the Bank to inform interested U.S. high technology companies, particularly small business concerns, about such program. Amends the International Finance Corporation Act to authorize the U.S. Governor of the International Finance Corporation to vote for and make a specified contribution to an irrevocable trust fund for paying the costs of consultants to facilitate projects designed to raise the standard of living in developing countries by developing capital markets, privatizing public enterprises, and developing private businesses. Reserves 90 percent of fund expenditures for consultants who are U.S. citizens and businesses or joint ventures owned or controlled by such citizens. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to make a similar amendment urging the development of and contribution to trust funds by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to: (1) pay consultants to facilitate Bank projects designed to raise the standard of living in developing countries through the use of state of the art goods and services (with the same reservation of expenditures for U.S. citizens); and (2) promote energy efficiency and environmental objectives. Authorizes appropriations."
