Authorizes the Secretary to provide marriage and family counseling services that the Secretary determines, based on an assessment by a mental-health professional, are necessary for the amelioration of psychological, marital, or familial difficulties resulting from such active-duty service. Outlines provisions concerning the manner in which such services will be furnished, as well as qualifications required of the marriage and family counselors performing such services. Directs the Secretary of Defense to transfer to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs specified funds for each of FY 1992 through 1994 to carry out this Act. Terminates the program at the end of FY 1994. Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to report to the Congress on such program."
