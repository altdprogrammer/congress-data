Grants a Federal banking agency regulatory authority to grant exemptions according to prescribed guidelines. Exempts from such guidelines sales transactions by registered brokers and dealers whose sales practice standards are consistent with this Act and are in the public interest. Sets a deadline by which each appropriate Federal banking agency must prescribe implementing regulations."
