Directs the Attorney General to: (1) establish standards and procedures governing the imposition of civil penalties for such violations which provide for the imposition of a penalty only after the person has been given an opportunity for a hearing on the record; and (2) issue any regulations necessary to carry out this Act. Makes the remedies provided under this Act in addition to the remedies provided by any other law."
