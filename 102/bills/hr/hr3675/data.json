    "text": "Nonproliferation and Export Control Act of 1991 - Directs the President to use the authorities of the Export Administration Act of 1979 to control the export of goods and technology that would assist the government of any foreign country in acquiring the capability to develop, produce, stockpile, deliver, or use chemical or biological weapons. Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to require the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other appropriate departments and agencies, to establish and maintain a list of goods and technology that would directly and substantially assist a foreign government or group in acquiring the capability to develop, produce, stockpile, or deliver chemical or biological weapons, the licensing of which would be effective in barring acquisition or enhancement of such capability. Requires a validated license for any export of goods or technology on the list to any country of concern. Provides that a determination of the Secretary of Commerce to approve such an export license for chemical, biological, or nuclear items may be made only after consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State for a period of 20 days. Requires the participation of the Secretary of State before the approval of export licenses for missile equipment or technology. Requires the participation of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State in decisions concerning the list of goods and technology subject to export controls (control list). Provides for withholding license application information from public disclosure before the determinations to approve or deny such applications are made. Provides for the sharing of export control information with departments and agencies with enforcement responsibilities."
