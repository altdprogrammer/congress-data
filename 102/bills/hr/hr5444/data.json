Makes a country eligible for designation as an \"Economy in Transition\" if, and only if: (1) nondiscriminatory treatment is in effect with respect to the products of such country; (2) such country has held free elections or has established guidelines for the conduct of such elections; (3) it has developed either a market economy or a transitional economy that will lead to a market economy; and (4) it has eliminated subsidies and other market distortions. Requires annual reports on such countries to the Congress. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to provide for congressional disapproval of \"Economy in Transition\" designations."
