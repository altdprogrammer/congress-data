Exempts the fund from sequestration orders. Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to prohibit the Senate or the House of Representatives from considering any concurrent resolution on the budget or reconciliation bill that would treat the Airport and Airway Trust Fund as part of the Federal budget. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to repeal the increase in taxes on the rates of transportation of persons and property by air and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund financing rate (for the aviation fuel tax). Provides for a credit or refund of excess taxes paid for floor stocks of aviation fuel held prior to the effective date of this Act."
