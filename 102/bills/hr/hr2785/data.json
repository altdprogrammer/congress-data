    "text": "Considers China to have met certain internationally recognized human rights and other objectives with respect to the extension of certain trade benefits and the implementation of scientific and cultural exchanges with the United States when it: (1) accounts for and releases prisoners (including student leader Wang Dan, human-rights advocate Ron Wanding, and intellectuals Wang Tuntao and Chen Ziming) who have been detained and imprisoned as a result of their nonviolent expression of political beliefs in Tiananmen Square on June 3, 1989; (2) permits access to the places of detention (including the provinces of Qinghai and Xinjiang) for political dissidents; (3) ensures freedom from torture and from inhumane conditions in such places; (4) ends prohibitions on peaceful assembly and demonstrations imposed after June 3, 1989; and (5) releases specified political prisoners. Considers, in addition, such objectives to have been met only when China makes significant progress in: (1) reversing the pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights (including in Tibet); (2) permitting foreigners, including human rights organizations access to individuals imprisoned in China and Tibet for expression of their political beliefs, and permitting them to observe the trials of such prisoners; (3) terminating martial law in both places; (4) removing restrictions on freedom of the press, on broadcasts by the Voice of America, and on the importation of foreign publications; (5) terminating acts of intimidation and harassment of Chinese citizens in the United States; (6) permitting freedom of emigration and removing obstacles to study and travel abroad for students and other citizens; (7) taking action to improve the observance of internationally recognized human rights and greater opportunities for freedom and democracy; (8) ending religious persecution (including in Tibet) and releasing of members of religious groups detained or imprisoned for expression of their religious beliefs; (9) ceasing support of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and participating in the negotiation of a settlement to the conflict there; (10) halting sales of nuclear technology to Algeria and Pakistan; (11) terminating sales of ammunition and weapon parts to Iraq; (12) easing import restrictions on U.S. products; (13) terminating the use of prisoners to produce goods; (14) allowing the International Red Cross to visit detention and reeducation centers and prisons; (15) granting internationally recognized worker rights; (16) providing protection of intellectual property rights, including patent protection for pharmaceuticals and other chemicals; and (17) acceding to the Bern Convention of 1886. Requires the President to take the following action until a determination is made, and reported to the Congress, that China has met such conditions: (1) expedite the accession of Taiwan to the General Agreement or Tariffs and Trade (GATT); (2) suspend action relating to China's accession to GATT; (3) reduce or eliminate scientific, technological, and cultural exchange and cooperation; (4) urge the Board for International Broadcasting to make radio broadcasts to China; (5) encourage U.S. nationals conducting industrial cooperation projects in China or Tibet not to use convict or forced labor manufactured merchandise; and (6) direct the United States Trade Representative to give particular attention to whether or not trade sanctions should be imposed on China under the \"special 301\" provision of the Trade Act of 1974 for denial of adequate protection of market access for intellectual property rights. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should take the following action, upon the determination duly reported to the Congress, that China has met such conditions: (1) extend trade benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences of the Trade Act of 1974; (2) expedite the accession of China to the GATT; (3) implement programs of scientific, technological, and cultural exchange and cooperation between it and the United States; (4) rescind specified actions taken against China for noncompliance with the conditions of this Act; and (5) implement other arrangements of mutual benefits to both China and the United States. Requires the President to file interim compliance reports to the Congress. Radio Free China Act of 1991 - Amends the Board for International Broadcasting Act of 1973 to authorize the use of funds for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty for radio broadcasting to China (to be known as Radio Free China)."
