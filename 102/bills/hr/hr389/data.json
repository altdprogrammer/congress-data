    "text": "Title I: Amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to define a qualifying House of Representatives candidate as one whose principal campaign committee includes in its statement of organization a declaration of the candidate's intention to abide by expenditure limitations under such Act, and to use broadcast time under the Communications Act of 1934 or to receive reduced postal rates. Prohibits a qualifying House candidate from making expenditures in excess of $50,000 of such candidate's personal funds for an election. Prohibits such candidate from spending in excess of $200,000 with respect to an election. Removes such limitation for all House candidates in an election if any candidate receives contributions or makes expenditures aggregating more than 50 percent in excess of the limitation applicable to a qualifying House candidate. Provides that the term contribution does not include the value of any advertising rate reduction made available to a qualifying House candidate by a newspaper or magazine, if such reduction is made available to any qualifying candidate and such reduction is made available during the 90-day period before the election. Prohibits a candidate for Federal office from establishing, maintaining, or controlling a political committee, other than an authorized committee of the candidate or a committee of a political party. Reduces from $5,000 to $1,000 the aggregate amount a multicandidate political committee may contribute to any candidate and his authorized political committee with respect to any election for Federal office. Provides for the accountability of contributions made by intermediaries or conduits. Prohibits a candidate for the office of Representative from accepting any contribution from a nonparty multicandidate political committee which exceeds: (1) $100,000 ($125,000 under certain circumstances) for a primary, general, or special election; and (2) $40,000 for a runoff election. Requires, when independent expenditures are made for television broadcast communications, that a statement appear continuously during such broadcast showing the name of the person or committee making such expenditure. Requires any type of general public communication to include such statement. Requires that any radio and television advertisement of a candidate for the House of Representatives include a statement indicating that such candidate has reviewed and approved the advertisement. Prohibits a multicandidate political committee from making contributions to more than one candidate in a general election for the House. Provides that a multicandidate political committee may make contributions with respect to a general election for the House of Representatives only in the year of the election. Directs that any person making a contribution to a multicandidate political committee with respect to a general election for the House shall have the right to designate that such committee use the amount to support: (1) a specific candidate; or (2) any candidate of a specific political party in the State where the contributor resides. Requires the committee, in the event of no designation by the contributor, to use at least 50 percent of such contribution in support of a candidate in the contributor's congressional district. Title II: Amendments to the Communications Act of 1934, Title 39, United States Code, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize the Federal Communications Commission to revoke any station license or construction permit for willful or repeated discrimination against a candidate for Federal office in the amount, class, or period of time made available to such candidate on behalf of such candidacy. Requires broadcast stations to publish broadcast media rates which will be applicable to specified election periods. Requires such stations to give priority to legally qualified candidates in providing access to the use of such station. Prescribes broadcast media rates for non-qualified House candidates. Provides for reduced postage rates for qualified House candidates. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide individuals with a tax credit of up to $100 per taxable year for House of Representatives candidate contributions. Requires verification of such contributions. Disallows the credit if the contributions are transmitted through an intermediary group, organization, or committee."
