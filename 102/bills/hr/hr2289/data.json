Establishes a cooperative fishery research, restoration, and enhancement program for depleted, nationally significant fish stocks in LIRS. Requires the FWS Director to: (1) invite State agencies, Indian tribes, and Federal agencies to participate in program activities of interest to them; and (2) enter into a memorandum of understanding with each such participating entity describing the responsibilities and authorities of each party. Sets the Federal share of any program activity at a specified percentage. Requires the FWS, in administering its programs related to LIRS, to seek to achieve specified goals. Requires the FWS Director, after completion of the study, to establish: (1) a center for large rivers research; (2) an office or coordination mechanism for transferring scientific information to the States, Indian tribes, and other Federal agencies; and (3) such fishery assistance offices as necessary for each LIRS. Authorizes appropriations."
