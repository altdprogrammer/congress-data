Prohibits an agency, except as specifically authorized by statute, from charging: (1) more than the incremental cost of disseminating an information product or service; or (2) any royalty or other fee for any use or redissemination of Government information. Directs the Archivist of the United States and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to jointly issue and periodically revise model performance standards under which agencies shall be encouraged to provide access to public records."
