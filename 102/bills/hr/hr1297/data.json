Directs coastal States, on the basis of such surveys, to submit to the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency: (1) a plan for construction and renovation of pumpout stations and waste reception facilities to ensure that such stations and facilities will be adequate to meet recreational vessel needs; and (2) a list of all stations and facilities which are usable on the date the plan is submitted. Requires the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere to indicate the locations of such stations and facilities on charts for the use of operators of recreational vessels. Directs the Administrator to publish in the Federal Register: (1) guidance regarding the types of stations and facilities that are appropriate for construction or renovation and appropriate location of such stations and facilities within a marina or boatyard; (2) guidance defining what constitutes adequate stations and facilities in boating areas; (3) guidance on appropriate methods for disposal of vessel wastes received at such stations and facilities; (4) guidance on appropriate connector fittings to facilitate the sanitary and expeditious discharge of human body waste from the vessels; and (5) other information to promote the establishment of such stations and facilities. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to notify coastal States that funding is available for the construction and renovation of such stations and facilities. Makes survey and plan requirements inapplicable to a coastal State if the Administrator certifies that the State is implementing a plan adequate to meet the needs of recreational vessels or has adequate stations and facilities."
