    "text": "Landfill Conservation and Community Recycling Act of 1991 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize a State that is in compliance with an approved solid waste management plan under this Act to: (1) impose fees on the disposal or incineration of solid waste generated outside the State; (2) prohibit the disposal or incineration of solid waste generated outside the State in a landfill or incinerator if such waste contains materials that could be composted or recycled; and (3) enact laws that authorize solid waste planning districts to impose fees on, and prohibit, the disposal or incineration of waste generated outside such districts. Permits such districts to exercise such authority only if they have solid waste management plans in compliance with the State plan. Directs States to submit solid waste management plans to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Requires such plans to include capacity estimates, permit programs, overall strategies, waste inventories, prohibitions on open dumps, source reduction, recycling, and composting elements, personnel training and public education provisions, and reporting requirements. Makes plans subject to the Administrator's approval. Requires the Administrator to collect: (1) a 50 cent per ton fee on solid waste that is generated in one State and disposed of or incinerated in another State; and (2) a 50 cent per ton surcharge on solid waste that is generated by a State that is not in compliance with a management plan and that is disposed of or incinerated in another State. Provides for the deposit of such fees in the Community Recycling Fund. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants from the Fund to local communities for purposes of establishing or expanding recycling or source reduction programs."
