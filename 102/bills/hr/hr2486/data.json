Authorizes an airport operator to charge a fee to off-airport operators provided it is reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and related to the use of the roadways and facilities built primarily to meet the operator's special needs. Amends the Clayton Act to make it unlawful for any city or governmental unit operating an airport that receives Federal assistance or issues tax-exempt airport improvement bonds to impose an unreasonable discriminatory fee on non-tenant, non-aeronautical commercial users of such airport where the effect of the fee substantially lessens competition or tends to create a monopoly in any line of commerce."
