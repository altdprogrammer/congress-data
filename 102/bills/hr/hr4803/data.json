    "text": "Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1992 - Title I: International Development Institutions and Export-Import Bank - Prohibits the provision of any Federal funds to any international development institution if the Secretary of the Treasury's most recent determination is that a member country of the institution: (1) is either capable of producing, or seeking to produce, a type of weapon that is a subject of a regime for controlling weapons of mass destruction; and (2) is not adhering to the regime. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) to report to a certain congressional committee: (1) the member countries capable of either producing, or seeking to produce, a weapon that is a subject of a regime for controlling weapons of mass destruction; (2) the international institutions of which such countries are members; and (3) whether or not such member countries are adhering to the weapons regime. Directs the Secretary to instruct the United States Executive Director of each international development institution to urge it to amend its charter to require that each appropriate member country adhere to the weapons regime. Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to prohibit the Export-Import Bank from granting any credit assistance for exports to any country that is not adhering to the weapons regime. Title II: Banking Law Enforcement Provisions - Amends the International Banking Act of 1978 to mandate that the U.S. offices of foreign banks submit an annual report to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board) listing the name of each depository institution which holds their deposits. Prohibits a foreign bank controlled by a foreign government from: (1) accepting deposits in the United States; or (2) engaging in any financial transaction in the United States, or with any U.S. person, including making any extensions of credit. Cites exceptions for trade-related financing under Board-prescribed regulations. Provides for application of bank acquisition guidelines of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to a foreign government which meets certain statutory criteria for a bank holding company of a foreign bank. Requires the Board to prescribe regulations: (1) establishing the criteria to be used in determining whether a credit extension qualifies as trade-related financing; and (2) determining whether a foreign bank is controlled by a foreign government. Amends the Revised Statutes, the Home Owners' Loan Act, the Federal Credit Union Act, and the Federal Reserve Act to authorize the Comptroller of the Currency to declare the forfeiture of: (1) all rights, privileges, franchises, and charters of the institutions under their jurisdiction, upon written notice from the Attorney General that the directors or senior executive officers have been found guilty of an export control offense. Sets forth procedural guidelines. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to authorize the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to terminate the insured status of insured State depository institutions convicted of an export control offense. Sets forth procedural guidelines. Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to provide for termination of insurance for State chartered credit unions in similar circumstances. Amends the International Banking Act of 1978 to authorize the Board to limit the banking activities of certain State agencies and uninsured State branches (including any foreign banks operating such entities) upon written notice from the Attorney General that such entities and their directors or senior executive officers have been convicted of an export control offense. Sets forth procedural guidelines. Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 to require specified Federal agencies to include in their annual reports to the Congress the names of institutions against which they have intiated an enforcement action for an alleged violation in connection with any international transaction or any deposits of a foreign person or government at such institutions."
