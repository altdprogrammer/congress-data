    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1992-10-06", 
    "text": "DNA Identification Act of 1992 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the use of drug control and system improvement grants to develop or improve in a forensic laboratory a capability to analyze deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for identification purposes. Requires State applications for grant funds to certify, if any part of such grant is to be used to develop or improve a DNA analysis capability in a forensic laboratory, that: (1) DNA analyses performed at such laboratory will satisfy or exceed the current standards for a quality assurance program for DNA analysis, issued by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); (2) DNA samples obtained by, and DNA analyses performed at, such laboratory will be accessible only to criminal justice agencies for law enforcement identification purposes, to any defendant (who shall have access to samples and analyses performed in connection with the case in which such defendant is charged) for criminal defense purposes, and if identifiable information is removed, for a population statistics database, for identification research and protocol development purposes, or for quality control purposes; and (3) such laboratory and each analyst performing DNA analyses at such laboratory will undergo, at regular intervals of not to exceed 180 days, external proficiency testing by a DNA proficiency testing program meeting the standards issued under this Act. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Director: (1) within 180 days, to appoint an advisory board on DNA quality assurance methods to develop, and (if appropriate) periodically revise, recommended standards for quality assurance, including standards for testing the proficiency of forensic analysis in conducting DNA analyses; and (2) after taking into consideration such recommended standards, to issue standards for quality assurance including standards for testing the proficiency of forensic laboratories in conducting such analyses. Mandates that such standards: (1) specify criteria for quality assurance and proficiency tests to be applied to the various types of DNA analyses used by forensic laboratories; and (2) include a system for grading proficiency testing performance to determine whether a laboratory is performing acceptably. Specifies that the board shall cease to exist five years after the initial appointments are made, unless extended by the Director. Authorizes the Director to establish an index of DNA identification records of persons convicted of crimes, and of analyses of DNA samples recovered from crime scenes and from unidentified human remains. Specifies that such index may include only information on DNA identification records and analyses that are: (1) based on analyses performed in accordance with publicly available standards that satisfy or exceed specified guidelines for the quality assurance program for DNA analysis; (2) prepared by labs and DNA analysts that undergo regular external proficiency testing; and (3) maintained by Federal, State, and local criminal justice agencies pursuant to rules that restrict disclosure of stored DNA samples and analyses. Makes the exchange of DNA identification records subject to cancellation if the quality control and privacy requirements of this Act are not met. Requires: (1) FBI personnel who perform DNA analyses to undergo, at regular intervals of not to exceed 180 days, external proficiency testing by a DNA proficiency testing program meeting the standards issued pursuant to this Act; and (2) the Director to submit an annual report on the results of such tests to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees for five years after enactment of this Act and to arrange for periodic blind external tests to determine the proficiency of DNA analysis performed at the FBI laboratory within one year. Defines \"blind external test\" as a test that is presented to the laboratory through a second agency and appears to the analysts to involve routine evidence. Restricts disclosure of DNA tests performed for a Federal law enforcement agency: (1) to criminal justice agencies for law enforcement identification purposes; or (2) for criminal defense purposes, to a defendant, who shall have access to samples and analyses performed in connection with the case in which such defendant is charged. Authorizes disclosure of test results for a population statistics database, for identification research and protocol development purposes, or for quality control purposes if personally identifiable information is removed. Sets fines of up to $100,000 for individuals: (1) having access to individually identifiable DNA information indexed in a database created or maintained by a Federal law enforcement agency by virtue of employment or official position who willfully disclose such information to any person or agency not entitled to receive it; and (2) who, without authorization, willfully obtain DNA samples or such individually identifiable DNA information. Authorizes appropriations."
