Makes this Act applicable to the following individuals: (1) Members of Congress; (2) an employee or officer of either House of Congress, of a committee of either House, or a joint committee of the two Houses; (3) an employee of a Member if the pay of the employee is paid by the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House; and (4) an employee of an Instrumentality of the Congress. Directs the House, the Senate, and the Instrumentalities of the Congress to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out this Act as it applies to the respective Houses and to such Instrumentality of the Congress.
