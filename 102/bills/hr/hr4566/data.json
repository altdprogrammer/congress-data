Directs the General Accounting Office to report to the Senate and House of Representatives on services and benefits that are available to such officials and employees or relatives that are not equally available to all other persons and on the manner in which each service or benefit contributes to the performance of the duties of the Government, if at all. Requires the Senate and House of Representatives' committees of jurisdiction over this subject matter to introduce a resolution that: (1) identifies services and benefits that may properly be made available at Government expense and those that may not; and (2) directs the appropriate executive and judicial agency officers to make arrangements for the provision of those services and benefits that may appropriately be made available at the expense of officials and employees at fair market value. Directs that all payments for services and benefits received from officials and employees or their relatives, and all rent or other payments received from private contractors that provide such services and benefits, be paid into a specified account to reduce the public debt."
