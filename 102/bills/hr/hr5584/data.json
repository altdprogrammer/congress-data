    "text": "Harold T. \"Biz\" Johnson Memorial Dam Act - Title I: Sacramento and American Rivers Flood Control Project - Authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Army (Secretary) to carry out a project for flood control and recreation on the Sacramento and American Rivers. Requires the project to: (1) include the construction of a pumping plant and facilities to fulfill certain Federal water supply requirements; and (2) be designed so as not to preclude future expansion for water, power, and other beneficial purposes. Directs the Secretary to cooperate with the State of California to establish an independent consulting board (composed of recognized dam engineering experts) to review the design and construction effort and to provide technical confirmation that the project will create no significant impediments to the construction of a contemplated multi-purpose project. Directs the: (1) Secretary to consider certain pre-project construction work of non-Federal sponsors to protect the Natomas area as part of the non-Federal share of the project's costs; (2) United States to receive credit as part of its Federal share of project costs for any lands acquired and works constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation which are incorporated into the project; (3) Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to cooperate with the Corps of Engineers and make lands available for project purposes; and (4) Secretary of Transportation to participate in, and provide appropriate Federal financial assistance for, studies for the alternate relocation of a specified California highway which will be affected by the project. Requires the title I facility to: (1) be designed and operated to minimize its adverse effects on soils and vegetation resulting from inundation and release of flood waters; and (2) include measures to mitigate unavoidable adverse effects on aquatic, riparian, and upland habitat and on fish and wildlife resources. Authorizes appropriations for the project, construction, operation, and maintenance. Redesignates the Auburn Dam as the Harold T. \"Biz\" Johnson Memorial Dam. Title II: Auburn Dam Water Conservation Project - Authorizes and directs the Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior to enter into agreements with non-Federal interests within specified California counties and with California for the transfer of lands, rights-of-way, water rights, and facilities constituting and adjacent to the Auburn Dam portion of the Auburn-Folsom unit of the Central Valley Project in order to promote the further development and operation of such lands and facilities in the public interest for the development of water supply, recreational values, fish and wildlife, flood control, and hydroelectric power generation. Requires such agreements to include an annual U.S. contribution equal to the cost of operation and maintenance of the title I project facilities. Conditions any agreement on the non-Federal interests developing and operating without cost to the United States a multipurpose Auburn Dam water storage project and on completion of all applicable environmental reviews mandated under specified California law. Recognizes the substantial national interest in the earliest feasible development of a multipurpose Auburn Dam to provide conserved water to local public entities within specified California counties, instream requirements for American river flows and winter run Chinook salmon, Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta environmental needs, and other beneficial uses. Directs the Secretaries of the Army and the Interior to accordingly enter into agreements without compensation to the United States for the interests transferred."
