    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-04-17", 
    "text": "Budget Simplification and Reform Act of 1991 - Title I: Biennial Budget Cycle - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the Rules of the House of Representatives and other Federal law to revise the Federal budget process by establishing a two-year timetable, beginning on October 1, 1993. Title II: Restricted Uses of Continuing Resolutions - Amends rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit the consideration of any joint resolution continuing appropriations which: (1) exceeds the rate it would have been at assuming the continuation of current law; or (2) changes existing law. Title III: Expedited Rescissions - Modifies the rescission process and provides for expedited consideration in the House and Senate of certain proposed rescissions. Title IV: Budget Baseline Reform - Requires the President to draft a budget based on estimates of current fiscal year spending, proposing increases or decreases based on this level (rather than on an estimated baseline). Requires the Congressional Budget Office to use such a current fiscal year baseline in its report to the congressional budget committees, projecting growth for entitlement and discretionary spending based on current fiscal year spending. Title V: Binding Budget Resolution - Replaces the concurrent resolution on the budget with a joint resolution on the budget. Title VI: - Truth in Legislating - Amends rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives to require each report or joint explanatory statement accompanying each bill or joint resolution to contain: (1) an identification of each provision which benefits only ten or fewer beneficiaries; (2) the name of each beneficiary; (3) the name of the Member who sponsored such provision and an identification of each such provision requested by a Federal agency or Federal officer; and (4) an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office or the Joint Committee on Taxation of the costs or loss in revenues resulting from such provision. Title VII: Budget Impact on State and Local Governments - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to provide that it shall not be in order for either House of Congress to consider any legislation which would impose any requirement on State or local governments which is likely to result in an annual cost to them of $50,000,000 or more for any particular program, project, or activity, except for legislation which complies with any sequestration order issued under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act). Requires the report of the Committee on the Budget of each House accompanying the concurrent resolution on the budget to identify changes in Federal aid programs for State and local governments on a program-by-program basis. Title VIII: Pay-As-You-Go-Budget Resolutions - Prohibits the President's budget and that adopted by the Congress in a joint resolution on the budget from including: (1) total budget outlays that exceed those for the preceding fiscal year, unless at least equivalent revenue increases and their sources are identified; and (2) a reduction in revenues from the preceding fiscal year, unless at least equivalent reductions in outlays are identified, along with the affected programs. Authorizes the Congress to waive the prohibition with respect to its budget resolution by a two-thirds vote. Makes it out of order in both the Senate and the House of Representatives to consider a joint budget resolution under which fiscal year revenues exceed outlays, unless the purposes for which the excess is to be allocated are specified."
