Sets forth participation requirements including: (1) the submission of a State comprehensive financial institution reorganization plan which meets the Secretary's approval; (2) obtaining Federal deposit insurance by a financial institution that has resumed business as a result of receiving State emergency loan assistance; and (3) loan repayment guidelines for recipient States."
