    "text": "Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Act - Directs the Attorney General to develop a national voluntary motor vehicle theft prevention program under which: (1) the owner of a motor vehicle may voluntarily sign a consent form with a participating State or locality in which the motor vehicle owner states that the vehicle is not normally operated under specified conditions and agrees to display program decals or devices on the owner's vehicle and permit law enforcement officials in any State to stop the vehicle and take reasonable steps to determine whether such vehicle is being operated by the owner or with the owner's permission, if the vehicle is being operated under such conditions; (2) participating States and localities authorize law enforcement officials in the State or locality to stop motor vehicles displaying program decals or devices under such conditions and take reasonable steps to determine whether the vehicle is being operated by or with the permission of the owner; and (3) Federal law enforcement officials are authorized to stop such vehicles under such conditions and make such determination. Requires such program to include a uniform design or designs for decals or other devices to be displayed by motor vehicles participating in the program which shall: (1) be highly visible; and (2) explicitly state that the motor vehicle to which it is affixed may be stopped under the specified conditions without additional grounds for establishing a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle is being operated unlawfully. Sets forth requirements with respect to the voluntary consent form. Directs the Attorney General to promulgate rules establishing the conditions under which participating motor vehicles may be authorized to be stopped under this Act, such as the operation of the vehicle during certain hours of the day or under circumstances that would provide a sufficient basis for establishing a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle was not being operated by, or with the consent of, the owner. Sets forth provisions with respect to the establishment of more than one set of conditions under which participating motor vehicles may be stopped. Requires the notification of lessees of motor vehicles for hire of participation in the program, as specified. Sets penalties for failure to comply with such notice provisions. Authorizes a State or locality to participate in the program by filing an agreement to comply with the terms and conditions of the program with the Attorney General. Specifies that, as a condition of participation, a State or locality must agree to take reasonable steps to ensure that law enforcement officials throughout the State or locality are familiar with the program and with the conditions under which motor vehicles may be stopped under the program. Authorizes appropriations. Includes within the scope of a provision setting penalties for the removal of or tampering with an identification number for a motor vehicle or motor vehicle part, removal or tampering with a decal or device affixed pursuant to this Act, with exceptions. Sets forth penalties for the unauthorized application of a theft prevention decal or device, or a replica thereof."
