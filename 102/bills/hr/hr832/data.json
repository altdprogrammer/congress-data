States that the written consent may be required as a condition of enlistment or appointment of an only child as a member of the armed forces. Provides that if a member becomes an only child after being assigned to such duties, the member: (1) may consent in writing to continue such duty; or (2) shall be reassigned upon request to noncombat duty as soon as practicable. Allows a member who requests such reassignment to be discharged or released from the armed forces at such time in lieu of such reassignment for the convenience of the Government in the discretion of the Secretary of the military department concerned."
