    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-05-09", 
    "text": "National Institutes of Health Revitalization Amendments of 1991 - Title I: General Provisions Regarding Title IV of Public Health Service Act - Subtitle A: Research Freedom - Part I: Review of Proposals for Biomedical and Behavioral Research - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require review and approval, by an Institutional Review Board, a peer review group, or other entity, of research before the Secretary of Health and Human Services may approve the research or fund applications. Prohibits the Secretary from withholding funding, on ethical grounds, from research which has been so approved unless an ethics advisory board recommends withholding. Part II: Research on Transplantation of Fetal Tissue - Allows the Secretary to conduct or support research on the transplantation of human fetal tissue for therapeutic purposes, regardless of whether the tissue is obtained from a spontaneous abortion, an induced abortion, or a stillbirth, in accordance with State and local law. Establishes criminal penalties for knowingly acquiring, receiving, or otherwise transferring any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration. Excludes from the term \"valuable consideration\" reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue. Prohibits any official of the executive branch from imposing a policy that prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from conducting or supporting any research on the transplantation of human fetal tissue for therapeutic purposes. Prohibits the Secretary from withholding funds for research which meets requirements of this subtitle. Deems a specified report of the Human Fetal Tissue Transplantation Research Panel to: (1) be issued by an ethics advisory board under provisions of this subtitle; and (2) find that there are no ethical grounds for withholding funds for research on transplantation of human fetal tissue for therapeutic purposes. Subtitle B: Clinical Research Equity Regarding Women and Minorities - Part I: Women and Minorities as Subjects in Clinical Research - Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA), in conducting and supporting research, to ensure that: (1) women and minorities are included as subjects in each project; and (2) research is conducted so as to provide for a valid analysis of whether the variables being tested affect women or minorities differently than other research subjects. Requires technical and scientific peer review to include an evaluation of compliance with these requirements. Part II: Offices of Research on Women's Health - Establishes within each of the Office of the Director of NIH and the Office of the ADAMHA Administrator an Office of Research on Women's Health to identify projects of women's health (and, for ADAMHA, mental health) research and promote sufficient resource allocation for the conduct or support of the projects by NIH and ADAMHA. Requires the Directors of each Office to establish a Coordinating Committee on Research on Women's Health and an Advisory Committee on Research on Women's Health. Includes in the Coordinating Committee's duties determining the extent women are represented among senior physicians and scientists of NIH and ADAMHA and among physicians and scientists conducting research with NIH or ADAMHA funding and carrying out activities to increase such representation. Requires the Director of NIH to: (1) establish a single data system regarding research on women's health conducted or supported by NIH or ADAMHA; and (2) establish and operate a program to provide information on research and prevention activities of NIH and ADAMHA relating to research on women's health (and, for ADAMHA, mental health) and gender differences. Mandates a biennial report by each Director with specified contents, including analyzing the professional status of women physicians and scientists at NIH and ADAMHA and identifying advancement barriers. Directs the Secretary: (1) through the Directors of the Offices of Research on Women's Health, to contract for a study of how research on women's health can be facilitated by the NIH Director and the ADAMHA Administrator; and (2) to request the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences to enter into the contract. Subtitle C: Scientific Integrity - Amends provisions relating to scientific fraud or scientific misconduct to establish within the Office of the Director of NIH the Office on Scientific Integrity. Provides for termination and recovery of financial assistance, provided for certain biomedical or behavioral research, if there is retaliation against a scientific misconduct whistleblower. Prohibits grants to or cooperative agreements or contracts with entities that fail to follow procedures to prevent or respond to such retaliation. Directs the Secretary, with regard to any entity receiving assistance for research to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a drug, medical device, or treatment, to establish criteria for preventing or responding to any financial interests which will or may create a conflict of interest. Requires the criteria to be uniformly applicable to each entity. Allows individual variation in implementation. Prohibits allowing each entity to develop individual criteria. Allows the Secretary, where such a conflict of interest exists, to take certain actions, including disapproving an application, terminating assistance, and recovering assistance obligated while the conflict exists. Directs the Secretary to require the entity to disclose the conflict in each public presentation of the research results. Prohibits the Secretary, in fiscal years after regulations establishing the criteria are issued, from making a grant, cooperative agreement, or contract for biomedical or behavioral research unless the entity seeking assistance agrees to be subject to the regulations. Mandates a study by the Comptroller General on the extent to which the activities of the Director of the Office of Scientific Integrity have been effective in investigating and preventing scientific fraud and other misconduct. Directs the Secretary, through the National Library of Medicine, to develop guidelines for use by scientific and medical journals to protect against publication of manuscripts involving scientific misconduct. Subtitle D: Indirect Costs - Allows the Secretary, in providing financial assistance through NIH for a research project, to authorize an entity to make expenditures from the assistance for administrative and nonadministrative indirect costs. Limits indirect cost expenditures to a percentage of direct costs.
