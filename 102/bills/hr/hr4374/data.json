    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the base tax amount on ozone-depleting chemicals. Imposes an additional tax on the sale or use of such chemicals after 1992. Eliminates: (1) the scheduled phase-in of such tax rates; and (2) the different rates for initially listed chemicals and newly listed chemicals. Repeals the phase-in of such tax on certain substances. Makes certain hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) subject to the tax on ozone-depleting chemicals at 50 percent of the base rate. Imposes a new floor stock tax on ozone-depleting chemicals and repeals the existing floor stocks tax."
