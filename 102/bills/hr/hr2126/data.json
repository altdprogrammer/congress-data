    "text": "Title I: Combined Sewer and Storm Water System Overflow Control - Estuarine Zone and Marine Waters Combined Sewer Overflow Control Act - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to issue regulations setting forth permit requirements for discharges from combined storm water and sanitary sewer overflows into the estuarine zone and marine waters. Directs the Administrator, in determining the content of such regulations, to take into account; (1) the expected composition, frequency, and volume of each discharge; (2) the anticipated effect of each discharge on the environment, economy, and aesthetic and recreational values of the receiving waters; and (3) the need for a flexible approach in minimizing such discharges. Authorizes the Administrator to issue permits after 1999 for such discharges only if the permittee has taken reasonable efforts to eliminate dry weather discharges and to minimize wet weather discharges. Requires the Administrator to provide technical assistance to State and local governments issued permits under this Act. Directs permittees, as a condition for permit issuance or renewal, to budget and expend an amount of funds for: (1) identifying all discharges of overflows into the estuarine zone and marine waters; (2) implementing water quality-based limitations of such discharges; and (3) limiting such discharges. Waives such requirement if the Administrator determines that the permittee or the State in which such permittee is located has begun to implement a plan that will result in the cessation of dry weather discharges and minimization of wet weather discharges by the year 2000. Makes funds available to permittees to address water quality problems resulting from such discharges, including the implementation of control strategies to eliminate dry weather discharges and minimize wet weather discharges. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress on: (1) the feasibility and cost of establishing a technological clearinghouse to make available to States and local governments information on, and assistance in, controlling and ceasing discharges of overflows from combined storm water and sanitary sewers into the estuarine zone and marine waters; and (2) the major components of discharges which contribute significantly to floating debris and debris which washes up on shores and ways to eliminate the introduction of such debris into combined storm water and sanitary sewer systems. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: National Estuary Program Amendment - National Estuary Program Amendment Act - Requires the Administrator to: (1) identify estuaries where overflow discharges from combined storm water and sanitary sewer systems constitute a major source of pollution; (2) urge that the management conference for each estuary develop a priority action plan to address such overflows; and (3) report to the Congress on the extent of such discharges and the anticipated Federal cost of addressing the problem. Title III: Marine Pollution Discharge Abatement - Marine Discharge Abatement Act - Prohibits the issuance or renewal of permits for pollutant discharges into estuaries, the oceans, or other navigable waters (at the discretion of the Administrator): (1) if the applicant has failed to demonstrate the need for the discharge and the lack of reasonable alternatives to it; or (2) for any discharge for which insufficient information exists to determine its environmental impact based on the guidelines published under the Clean Water Act. (Current law bars discharges in any event where insufficient information exists to make a reasonable judgment based on such guidelines.) Prohibits the waiver of permit requirements for discharges into specified estuaries or the territorial sea. Directs the Administrator to review existing guidelines and to revise guidelines as necessary to prevent the degradation of such waters."
