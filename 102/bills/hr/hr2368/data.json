    "text": "Reclamation Recreation Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal Water Projects Recreation Act to require non-Federal public bodies to agree to bear at least half (currently, all) of the costs of operation, maintenance, replacement, and expansion (currently, excludes expansion) allocated to fish and wildlife enhancement of Bureau of Reclamation project land and water areas. Provides that, if such bodies execute an agreement after initial operation of the project (currently, within ten years after initial operation) the remainder of the costs of lands, facilities, and project modifications provided under Federal provisions shall be non-reimbursable. Authorizes recreation facilities constructed under such Act to be expanded if the facilities were designed for less use than they actually receive and an approved resource management plan recommends expansion. Limits the Federal share of expanding a facility to 50 percent of the cost of such expansion. Repeals a limitation of $100,000 for any one reservoir for project purposes. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to establish reasonable filing, use, recreation, and user fees, reasonable charges, and commissions with respect to applications, agreements, contracts, and other documents relating to reclamation lands and their use. Directs the Secretary to: (1) prepare and issue rules and regulations as the Secretary deems necessary to implement this Act with respect to the management, use, and protection of reclamation lands and facilities, for the protection, comfort, and well-being of the public, and to protect public safety and resource values; (2) prepare and maintain on a continuing basis an inventory of resources and uses made of Reclamation lands and resources deemed to be suitable and appropriate for public use, keep records of such inventory, and make the records available to the public; (3) ascertain the boundaries of reclamation lands and provide a means for public identification; and (4) develop, maintain, and revise resource management plans for all reclamation lands determined by the Secretary to be suitable and appropriate for resource management. Requires that resource management plans: (1) be consistent with all relevant statutes, rules, regulations, and executive orders and be developed in consultation with appropriate Federal and non-Federal agencies and appropriate public participation; (2) provide for the development, use, conservation, protection, enhancement, and management of resources on reclamation land in a manner and to the extent compatible with the original authorized purposes of the reclamation projects; and (3) be prepared within ten years. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) acquire property and dispose of interests in reclamation lands; (2) manage recreational, fish and wildlife, and other resources on reclamation lands consistent with resource management plans, applicable State law, and contractual obligations; (3) enter into agreements for appropriate land management activities; and (4) authorize the use of resources by means of easements, permits, and other forms of conveyance instruments as appropriate (and where a nonpublic entity is authorized to provide services or facilities for which a fee is charged, the Secretary is authorized and directed to seek adequate compensation for the use of reclamation resources). Specifies that: (1) nothing in this Act shall be construed to change the authorized purposes of any reclamation project, or authorize or allow any reduction in the availability of the water supply from a reclamation project to project beneficiaries; and (2) this Act shall not result in any increase in the cost of operation, maintenance, and repair of the water supply or water delivery to reclamation project beneficiaries of contracting entities without their express agreement, with exceptions."
