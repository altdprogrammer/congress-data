Increases the withholding rate on supplemental wage payments to 24 percent if an employer elects to determine such amounts under a specified Treasury regulation (otherwise such withholding rate is 20 percent). Provides for the taxation of the income from the merger of Federal land bank associations and farm credit associations, except for income, gain, loss, or deduction properly allocable to loans made by the Federal land bank associations that have an initial term of at least ten years."
