Delays the effective date of any pay increase for a Member of the House until the beginning of the Congress after the one in which the law authorizing the increase is enacted. Requires the committees of the House having jurisdiction over specified labor, health, and safety laws to report measures to the House that subject it to the coverage of such laws. Provides that, to the extent that the House is already subject to such laws, the committees shall review their scope, enforcement procedures, and remedies, to ensure that these are as similar as constitutionally permissible to those applied to the private and noncongressional public sector. Amends rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives to limit the length of time a Member may serve on a standing committee to six years. Amends rule XI to prohibit the Committee on Rules from reporting any rule or order which would waive specified requirements with respect to a conference report or a Senate amendment in disagreement unless determined by a minimum two-thirds vote of the Members voting. Expresses the sense of the Congress that any money returned to the Treasury as a result of this Act should be deposited in the general fund to be applied against expenses associated with servicing the national debt."
