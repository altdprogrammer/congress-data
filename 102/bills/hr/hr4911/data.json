    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a deduction for depreciation under the accelerated cost recovery system for any qualified automobile (whether or not such automobile is used in a trade or business or held for production of income). Exempts such deduction from the limitation on depreciation for luxury automobiles and for certain property used for personal purposes. Describes a qualified automobile as: (1) one manufactured in the United States and purchased in the first retail sale; and (2) a four-wheel fuel-propelled vehicle manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways. Treats an automobile as manufactured in the United States if at least 75 percent of the cost to the manufacturer is attributable to value added in the United States or Canada."
