Reduces from 1.25 percent to .50 percent of the total loan amount the loan fee charged to veterans for refinancing a loan made, insured, or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Increases the loan guaranty amount of such refinanced loans to either the original loan guaranty amount (current law) or 25 percent of the new loan amount, whichever is greater. Increases by the same amount the loan guaranty amount on the refinancing of loans made to veterans for the purchase of manufactured homes and lots. Extends through December 31, 1995, the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to set qualifications and choose appraisers for the appraisal of property under the veterans' home loan program."
