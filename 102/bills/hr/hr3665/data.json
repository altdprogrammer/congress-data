Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) permit hunting, trapping, and fishing on lands and waters under the Secretary's jurisdiction within the Preserve in accordance with applicable Federal and State laws (but allows the Secretary to designate zones where, and establish periods when, such activities will not be permitted, and to restrict hunting in areas within the Preserve that are adjacent to the boundaries of the Preserve where necessary or appropriate to protect public safety); (2) enter into a cooperative agreement, upon request, with the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources for the continued management by the Department of the lodge and other facilities which are part of the DeSoto State Park if it is acquired by the Secretary for the Preserve; and (3) develop and conduct a program to promote and encourage awareness and participation in the development of the general management plan for the Preserve by persons owning property in the vicinity of the Preserve, other interested groups and individuals, State, county, and municipal agencies, and the general public (and, prior to final approval of the plan, to hold public meetings in DeKalb and Cherokee Counties). Makes restrictions of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act on construction projects licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission applicable to that portion of the Little River that flows through the Preserve. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with: (1) the State of Alabama or any political subdivision of the State, in administering the Preserve, for the rendering of rescue, fire fighting, and law enforcement services; and cooperative assistance by law enforcement and fire preventive agencies located in the vicinity of the Preserve; and (2) such State and directly affected political subdivisions of the State to provide professional assistance in the preparation of the management plan for the Preserve. Extinguishes all rights and obligations of the Alabama Power Company, pursuant to a specified agreement, to lands within the boundaries of the preserve which contain the Green Pitcher Plant (Sarracenia oreophila) upon the transfer of such lands to the United States by the Company. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire lands, waters, and interests in lands and waters within the boundaries of the Preserve (such lands) by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange, only with the consent of the owner. Specifies that such lands that are owned by the State, or any political subdivision of the State, may be acquired only by donation or exchange. Directs the Secretary: (1) immediately after publication of a description of the boundaries of the Preserve, to commence negotiations for the acquisition of such lands; (2) within one year, to submit a detailed schedule of actions and a progress report regarding the acquisition to specified congressional committees; and (3) within two years, subject to the availability of funds, to substantially complete such acquisition in accordance with the purposes of this Act. Requires: (1) the Secretary, promptly following completion of any environmental audit performed by or on behalf of the Secretary with respect to any property proposed to be acquired for the purposes of the Act, to make available to the owner of the property a copy of the audit; and (2) that any such audit and any environmental audit performed by the owner of the property and submitted to the Secretary prior to the date of the acquisition be included as part of the documents transferring title to the United States. Specifies that no lands or interest in lands may be added to the Preserve after the date of enactment without specific authorization by the Congress and the consent of the owner of the lands or interest. Authorizes appropriations."
