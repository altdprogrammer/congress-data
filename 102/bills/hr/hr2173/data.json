Specifies actions to be taken by the Secretary as part of such R&E program, including: (1) assessing the risk of Lyme disease at military installations; (2) providing lab support for identifying and assaying deer ticks for Lyme disease; (3) providing information regarding Lyme disease to military personnel at installations at which there are sizable populations of deer ticks, as well as to dependents of such personnel; (4) establishing and maintaining a data repository on information collected by the Department of Defense regarding the disease; (5) conducting operational testing; and (6) testing candidate deer tick repellent compounds for effectiveness and toxicity to humans. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for conducting the R&E program. Earmarks specified amounts of such appropriations for each of the R&E activities undertaken. Directs the Secretary to print and distribute to appropriate military personnel wallet-sized cards that identify the ticks that transmit Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, listing symptoms and methods of prevention. Allows the Secretary to make 25 percent of such cards available to Federal health agencies and the public. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research to conduct research to develop a ribosomal RNA probe to detect Borrella burgdorferi in arthropods, animal reservoirs, and laboratory samples. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Defense for such research."
