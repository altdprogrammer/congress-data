    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise the definition of highly compensated employee for pension plan purposes to mean any employee who receives compensation for a year in excess of $75,000 (adjusted for inflation). Provides a uniform definition of compensation as wages and earned income. Allows an employer to treat as compensation any amount: (1) which is not includible in gross income under deferred compensation plans of State and local governments and tax-exempt organizations; or (2) which is not allowable as a deduction for retirement savings. Allows collectively-bargained (union) employees to be included in applying minimum coverage requirements."
