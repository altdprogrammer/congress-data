Provides that in the case of Hurricane Hugo, September 1989, appropriations for any fiscal year shall not exceed 25 percent of the estimated aggregate amount of grants to be made for such disaster. Requires the President to provide technical assistance to insular areas which lack specific capabilities in responding to disasters. Requires the Secretary, in cooperation with the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to report to specified congressional committees on the status of the recovery efforts in such areas. Requires that the total contributions under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act for hazard mitigation in insular areas not exceed ten percent of the estimated aggregate amount of grants to be made under such Act for any disaster. Directs the President to require a 50 percent local match when making grants in excess of the ten percent ceiling. Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to make the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands eligible for relief and assistance. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Secretary to: (1) study or review and update existing studies to determine the current and long-term water, power, and wastewater needs of American Samoa; and (2) report to specified congressional committees on the results. Authorizes American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Virgin Islands to make purchases through the General Services Administration. States that a Freely Associated State Air Carrier shall not be precluded from transportation of persons and property procured, contracted for, or otherwise obtained by a Federal agency or instrumentality under an agreement whereby the agency or instrumentality pays for such transportation without provisions for reimbursement. Amends the Compact of Free Association Act of 1985 to extend the Marshall Islands agricultural and food assistance programs for an additional five years. Amends Federal law to authorize the Northern Marianas College to receive the same $3,000,000 endowment authorized for land grant institutions in other insular areas. Title III: Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve at St. Croix, Virgin Islands, Act of 1991 - Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve at St. Croix, Virgin Islands, Act of 1991 - Establishes the Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve at St. Croix, Virgin Islands. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit the Virgin Islands government from acquiring land or interest in land within the boundaries of the park. Prohibits acquisition without owners's consent of lands or interests containing dwellings lying within the park boundary as of July 1, 1991, unless the Secretary determines that the land is being developed or proposed to be developed in a manner detrimental to specified values for which the park was established. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with the Virgin Islands or local governments for the management of the park. Directs the Secretary, with public involvement, to develop and submit a general management plan for the park to specified congressional committees. Directs the Secretary for a ten-year period to: (1) provide up to 50 percent of funds to train employees of the Virgin Island government directly engaged in the joint management of the park; and (2) implement a program under which Virgin Islands citizens may be trained in all phases of park operations and management. Establishes the Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve at St. Croix, Virgin Islands, Commission.
