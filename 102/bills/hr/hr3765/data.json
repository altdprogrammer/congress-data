    "text": "Suspends from October 31, 1990, until November 1, 1992, a provision of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 which prohibits a deceased veteran's spouse or child from regaining eligibility for veterans' dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) after the termination of a remarriage occurring after the death of the veteran. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to notify eligible persons. Reimposes the prohibition against such eligibility for months beginning on or after 180 days after the date on which the award of such benefit takes effect. States that, after such date, recognition for such DIC benefits will be determined in accordance with appropriate provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990."
