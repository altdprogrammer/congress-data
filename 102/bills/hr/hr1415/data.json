Prohibits an account from being increased by more than ten percent (five percent for the salaries and expenses account and the acquisition of foreign buildings account) through such a transfer. Revises provisions concerning accounts subject to percentage limitations to permit funds authorized to be appropriated for the Department of State in the Department of State Appropriations Act, for the second fiscal year of a two-year authorization, to be appropriated for the second fiscal year for any other account. Applies account increase limitations for funds transferred for emergency purposes to such transfers of appropriations. Requires Federal agencies that obtain administrative services from the Department of State to make full and prompt payment for such services through an advance of funds or reimbursement.

Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to redesignate the Office of Munitions Control of the Department of State as the Office of Defense Trade Controls and increases the amount of registration fees collected by the Office that is required to be credited to a Department of State account. Directs the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees each time a consular post denies a visa on the grounds of terrorist activities or foreign policy. Prohibits the Secretary from including in the Automated Visa Lookout System or in any system that maintains information about the excludability of aliens the name of any alien who is not excludable under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Requires the Secretary to correct such systems by deleting the names of aliens who are not excludable under such Act. Authorizes the Secretary to add to or retain in such system the names of aliens who are not excludable only if they are included for law enforcement purposes or lawful purposes of the Department of State. Directs the Secretary to: (1) immediately undertake negotiations to seek an end to the policy of the majority of Arab League nations of rejecting passports of, and denying entrance visas to, persons whose passports or other documents reflect that they have visited Israel; and (2) report to specified congressional committees on the status of efforts to secure an end to such policy. Prohibits the Secretary from issuing any passport that is designated for travel only to Israel. Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations for the cancellation of existing passports designated for travel only to Israel. Prohibits the Secretary from issuing more than one official or diplomatic passport to any U.S. Government official for purposes of enabling such official to acquiesce in or comply with the Arab League's passport policy concerning persons who have visited Israel. Part C: Diplomatic Reciprocity and Security - Amends the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 to raise the threshold (from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000) on diplomatic construction or design projects on which only U.S. persons may bid. Directs the Secretary to: (1) submit to specified congressional committees a plan which sets forth current and future space requirements for the U.S. mission in Moscow; and (2) make available to such committees copies of all agreements necessary to implement such plan. Requires the Secretary and the Director of Central Intelligence to report to the appropriate congressional committees on alternative approaches to the reconstruction of the new chancery building at the U.S. embassy in Moscow. Directs the Secretary, in carrying out the reconstruction project, to ensure that extraordinary security safeguards are implemented. Prohibits the Soviet Union from using any new chancery building in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area until: (1) the new chancery building at the U.S. embassy in Moscow is ready for occupancy; (2) the Secretary and the Director certify that such building provides a secure working environment for all sensitive diplomatic activities, provides adequate office space for future mission needs, and can be safely and securely occupied by the United States and used for its intended purpose; and (3) the Soviet Union agrees to provide full reimbursement to the United States for costs incurred as a result of noncompliance with specified reciprocal allocation of land agreements and other activities that have impeded use of the unfinished new office building. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on: (1) plans for the establishment of additional U.S. missions in the former Soviet Union; and (2) the extent to which U.S. assets were compromised by Soviet firefighters in the March 1991 fire at the U.S. embassy in Moscow. Requires the Attorney General and the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees a report and recommendations regarding whether special agents of the Diplomatic Security Service should be authorized to make arrests without warrants for offenses against the United States committed in their presence or for any felony if they have grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing a felony. Increases the amount authorized to be appropriated for the reimbursement of State and local governments in connection with Secret Service functions with respect to foreign diplomatic missions located in metropolitan areas. Adds to the list of authorized Secret Service functions the protection of visits of foreign government officials to metropolitan areas (other than the District of Columbia) where at least 20 consular or diplomatic missions are located. Requires the Secretary to: (1) report to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Speaker of the House on security needs for diplomatic construction; and (2) review the Inman Report and address whether changing budgetary and foreign policy priorities continue to justify the Report's recommendations. Part D: Personnel - Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to permit members of the Senior Foreign Service who are appointed to positions in the executive branch to continue to receive the Foreign Service salary, performance pay, and leave in lieu of the salary and leave of the appointed position. Revises provisions concerning the salaries of chiefs of mission. Permits the Secretary to suspend without pay a Foreign Service member who has been convicted of a crime. (Current law permits such suspensions if there is reasonable cause to believe that a member has committed a crime.) Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to grant access to commissaries to American citizens hired to serve as teaching staff for dependents of employees abroad. Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to extend the period of temporary storage of personal effects of Foreign Service employees for an additional 90 days in extraordinary circumstances. Authorizes the Secretary to pay for the transport of the remains of a Foreign Service member to the designated home in the United States if the death of such member occurs in the United States. (Current law authorizes payment only for the transport of the remains of a member or family member who dies while abroad or in travel status.) Provides for payment for up to 60 days to Federal employees whose families or dependents are required to evacuate a post (even if the employee remains at such post). Revises Federal provisions regarding quarters, education, and cost-of-living allowances for Federal employees stationed in foreign countries. Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to offer former presidential appointees reassignment to the Foreign Service.

Requires local compensation plans to be established for U.S. citizens employed in the Foreign Service abroad who were hired while residing abroad. Includes within the definition of \"grievance\" under the Foreign Service Act of 1980 certain discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Bars a grievance based solely on allegations of discrimination under such Acts unless filed within 180 days after the occurrence giving rise to the grievance. Sets forth remedies, filing procedures, and judicial review provisions with respect to grievances based on discrimination. Directs the Department of State to report to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Speaker of the House on a mechanism to compensate Department employees who have claims resulting from loss of personal property under circumstances set forth in the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees Claims Act of 1964 whose losses exceed the amounts covered in such Act.
