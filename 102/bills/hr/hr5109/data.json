    "text": "Defense Diversification and Community Adjustment Act of 1992 - Title I: Improved Activities Under the Defense Economic Adjustment, Diversification, Conversion, and Stabilization Act of 1990 - Amends the Defense Economic Adjustment, Diversification, Conversion, and Stabilization Act of 1990 to lower the numbers of employee reductions required to meet the definition of a substantially and seriously affected community. Declares that one of the Assistant Secretaries of Defense shall be the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Economic Adjustment who shall be responsible for the U.S. economic conversion program. Directs the Assistant Secretary, acting through a Director of Community Assistance Grants, to facilitate the development of community adjustment plans for substantially and seriously affected communities by community members to reduce the adverse effects of defense downsizing. Requires the Director to aid in the formation of community adjustment committees. Makes grants and assistance available to such committees to provide for: (1) a business expert to examine the potential market needs of the region to identify economic adjustment and conversion opportunities for defense facilities in the community; and (2) a technological expert to determine the feasibility of adjustment and conversion alternatives for such facilities. Makes communities that have committees and are ready to implement adjustment plans eligible for grants to implement such plans. Extends through FY 1997 the authorization of appropriations for economic assistance under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 for substantially and seriously affected communities. Requires the Director of Dislocated Workers to: (1) develop a method of identifying substantially and seriously affected businesses and qualified small buinesses in order to provide for sufficient time to allow workers to enroll in adjustment programs; and (2) work in coordination with the Secretary of Labor to facilitate the development of a grant system to provide States with resources to assist defense workers eligible to participate in the defense conversion adjustment program under the Job Training Partnership Act. Makes the Assistant Secretary, acting through a Director of Diversification and Adjustment, responsible for assessment and conversion possibilities for defense contractors, subcontractors, and qualified small businesses in substantially and seriouly affected communities. Requires the Director to use technical assistance to assist in the conversion and retention of defense capabilities, the retooling of defense infrastructure to commercial use, and research and development related to conversion. Provides that the Director will work with the Secretary of Defense to provide grants and technical assistance to aid in the retention of critical technologies that have a chance to be lost due to downsizing. Authorizes qualified small businesses to apply to the Director for assistance to aid in conversion to nondefense activities. Permits the Director to assist employees or former employees of defense contractors or subcontractors to establish small business concerns. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Improvements to the Employment and Training Assistance for Dislocated Workers Under the Job Training Partnership Act - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act to require the Secretary of Labor to: (1) allot 20 percent of the amount appropriated for employee adjustment assistance under the Defense Economic Adjustment, Diversification, Conversion, and Stabilization Act of 1990 to States most adversely affected by reductions in expenditures for defense or by closures of military facilities in accordance with an expedited assistance formula; (2) make grants, from the remaining amount, for training, adjustment assistance, rapid response assistance, and employment services to eligible employees; and (3) develop a formula for providing expedited assistance to employees in the most adversely affected States. Authorizes appropriations."
