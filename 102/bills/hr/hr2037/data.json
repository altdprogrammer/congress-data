    "text": "Airline Competition and Passenger Protection Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require each air carrier to submit monthly to the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) a list of each airport which served as a hub for it, together with the percentage of passengers who missed a scheduled transfer from one aircraft to another at such airport. Requires the Secretary after receiving missed transfer information to report to the Congress on the quality of service provided by each air carrier to passengers at such airports, including recommendations on methods to improve such service. Sets forth the circumstances under which an agreement involving the use of expansion of gates or other airport facilities between an air carrier and a hub airport may become effective. Requires air carriers: (1) to submit to the Secretary a monthly list of flights that arrive more than 15 minutes after their scheduled time of arrival; and (2) which know of flight delays of one hour or more to notify passengers of the length of and reasons for such delay, with an offer to refund the ticket purchase price. Authorizes airports to impose a higher fee, on a nondiscriminatory basis, for landing of aircraft during peak hours of air traffic in an effort to reduce delays and congestion at such airport. Requires the Secretary to revise the air carrier baggage reporting system of the Department of Transportation (DOT) to require air carriers to submit to the Secretary reports on list or mishandled passenger baggage. Prohibits an air carrier from limiting its liability for damages for lost or damaged baggage to less than $2,500. Sets forth time limits within which air carriers must process a passenger's claim for lost or damaged baggage. Makes an air carrier liable for damages resulting from lost or damaged passenger baggage that has been transferred from to a code sharing partner of such air carrier. Sets forth penalties for persons who make false claims to an air carrier. Requires air carriers to submit to the Secretary a monthly list of cancelled flights, including cancelled flights of code sharing partners of the air carrier, together with the reasons for such cancellations. Prohibits an air carrier from cancelling a scheduled flight within 72 hours of its scheduled departure time for any reason, other than safety or complete absence of passengers. Requires such air carrier to compensate passengers holding an airline ticket whenever it cancels a flight for non-safety reasons. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations to enable aircraft passengers to file more expeditiously any air carrier service complaints with the DOT. Directs the Secretary to establish DOT offices at hub airports to receive such complaints. Requires the Secretary to develop a system for ranking air carriers on the basis of quality of services they provide. Requires air carriers that provide air transportation between the same locations as air carriers that become debtors under the bankruptcy laws to provide, on a space available basis, air transportation for persons holding airline tickets sold by such a debtor air carrier. Sets forth air carrier advertising requirements with respect to air fares. Requires the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to consider: (1) methods of ensuring that each air carrier provides enough seats for persons redeeming frequent flyer awards; and (2) whether or not frequent flyer mileage obtained under one air carrier's frequent flyer program should be transferable to another air carrier's frequent flyer program, or from one passenger to another as a means of reducing the anticompetitive effects of such programs. Requires air carriers to permit the transfer of nonrefundable airline tickets and airline tickets with a cancellation penalty from one passenger to another. Requires the Secretary to establish an advisory committee on air carrier passenger services. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Requires the Secretary to issue a final regulation to eliminate the anti-competitive effects of computer reservation systems. Directs the Comptroller General to report to the Congress on its effectiveness. Prohibits the transfer of a certificate to provide interstate or overseas air transportation without approval of the Secretary as consistent with the public interest. Prohibits the transfer of a certificate to provide foreign air transportation unless: (1) the air carrier has provided such service for at least one year; (2) the Secretary has provided other air carriers an opportunity to bid on providing such service; and (3) the Secretary determines such transfer is in the public interest. Requires the Secretary to take action to ensure that the proceeds from the transfer of any certificates are used to enhance the competitive strength of the air carrier receiving such proceeds, including requiring the submission to, and approval by, the Secretary of a financial plan for the use of such proceeds."
