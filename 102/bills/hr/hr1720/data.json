    "text": "District of Columbia Mental Health Program Assistance Act of 1991 - Amends the Saint Elizabeths Hospital and District of Columbia Mental Health Services Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide funds to the Mayor of the District of Columbia for the completion of repairs and renovations to Saint Elizabeths Hospital and for other capital improvements necessary for the safe and cost effective delivery of mental health services. Earmarks specified funds for capital improvements to: (1) facilities not located at Saint Elizabeths Hospital; and (2) housing facilities for seriously and chronically mentally ill individuals. Extends from October 1, 1991, to October 1, 1993, the deadline for District of Columbia assumption of mental health functions, resources, and programs for its residents. Requires the Mayor to submit a master plan to specified congressional committees by October 1, 1992 (currently, October 1, 1991), for the use of that portion of Saint Elizabeths Hospital not yet transferred to the District of Columbia. Directs the Congress to approve such plan within two years, rather than one year, after it is submitted to the committees. Directs the Mayor to insure that the requirements of the Buy American Act of 1933 as amended (the Act) apply to all procurements made under this Act. Requires the U.S. Trade Representative to rescind any waiver of the Act with respect to certain types of products of a foreign country if the Mayor determines that the country has violated a trade agreement with the United States by discriminating against those same types of products produced in the United States and covered by the agreement. Directs the Mayor to report to the Congress on the amount of purchases from foreign entities under this Act for FY 1992 through 1993. Prohibits awarding a contract or subcontract with authorized funds for the procurement of any article, material, or supply produced or manufactured in a foreign country whose government unfairly maintains in its procurement a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination against U.S. products or services which results in identifiable harm to U.S. businesses. Provides that if a court or Federal agency determines that any person intentionally affixes a \"Made in America\" label to any product sold or shipped to the United States that is not made in America, such person shall be ineligible to receive any contract or subcontract under this Act."
