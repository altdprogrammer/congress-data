    "text": "Modifies the boundaries of the Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site and Preservation District in Atlanta, Georgia. Transfers appropriations from the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for the Study of Nonviolent Social Change to the National Park Service for rehabilitation of the birth home of Martin Luther King, Jr. and to provide for a landscaped parking lot for the Site and the Preservation District. Amends the Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations and Transfers, Urgent Supplementals, and Correcting Enrollment Errors Act of 1989 to repeal provisions authorizing the King Center and the National Park Service to locate an additional parking site for the Martin Luther King National Historic Site. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to reconvey at no cost to Atlanta for its use in furthering the purposes of this Act, a portion of the area known as Community Center Plaza (originally donated to the National Park Service by the city). Reverts the title or interests to such property to the Federal Government to be administered by the National Park Service as a part of the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site and Preservation District when the property is no longer utilized for authorized purposes. Removes limitations on appropriations for the Site and Preservation District with respect to: (1) development; (2) local planning; and (3) acquisition of lands and interests."
