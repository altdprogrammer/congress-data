    "text": "Family Leave Act of 1991 - Title I: General Requirements for Family Leave - Entitles employees to unpaid family leave for specified periods in cases involving the birth or adoption of a child. Requires the eligible employee to exhaust all accrued sick leave, vacation leave, or other paid leave before using such family leave. Reduces the ten consecutive weeks of unpaid family leave entitlement by the amount of such substituted paid leave. Requires the eligible employee to notify the employer of intent to use leave and to return to work. Sets forth employment and benefits protections relating to such leave. Allows employers to require medical certification that an employee can resume work. Permits an employer to deny restoration of position to certain highly compensated employees in certain circumstances. Reduces certain health care continuation coverage if an employee fails to return to work after such leave. Permits more protective, and prohibits less protective, maternity benefits than this Act requires under a collective bargaining agreement or employment benefit program or plan. Provides that: (1) this Act does not preempt State or local laws that require more extensive maternity leave; and (2) compliance with this Act shall not be considered a violation of certain Federal antidiscrimination laws. Sets forth special rules relating to employees of local educational agencies. Title II: Enforcement - Provides for administrative enforcement of this Act by the Secretary of Labor, as well as enforcement by civil action. Title III: Coverage of Congressional Employees - Applies the rights and protections under titles I and II of this Act to employees of the House of Representatives, except for the exemption concerning highly compensated employees. Requires that the remedies and procedures under the Fair Employment Practices Resolution be applied in administering such coverage."
