Expresses the sense of the Congress that each State should review and reform its child abuse and neglect system, and implement formal interagency, multidisciplinary teams to review and make final recommendations regarding: (1) certain child death cases; and (2) cases where there is evidence of negligent handling by the State in order to hold such State accountable."
