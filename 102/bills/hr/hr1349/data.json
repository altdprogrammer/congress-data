    "text": "House of Representatives Campaign Cost Control Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to define a \"qualifying House of Representatives candidate\" as one who agrees to: (1) accept $180,000 from the House of Representatives General Election Trust Fund; and (2) be subject to specified statutory limitations. Sets a general election expenditure limitation of $540,000. Prohibits acceptance of contributions by such candidates from any sources except: (1) multicandidate political committees (PACs); (2) individuals; and (3) the House of Representatives General Election Trust Fund. Limits the total of all such contributions to $180,000, but provides for waiver of such limit in certain circumstances. Authorizes civil penalties for non-compliance with such limitations. Establishes the House of Representatives General Election Trust Fund for payments to qualifying House of Representatives candidates. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to authorize the designation of income tax payments by individuals to be used for the House of Representatives General Election Trust Fund. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to provide that the broadcast media unit charge for: (1) qualifying House of Representatives candidates with respect to any segment one minute or more in length in which the candidate appears personally shall not exceed 50 percent of the usual unit charge; and (2) non-qualifying candidates, regardless of segment length, shall be 150 percent of the usual unit charge."
