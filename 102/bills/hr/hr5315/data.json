    "date": "1992-06-03", 
    "text": "Farm and Rural Medical Equity Reform Act of 1992 - Title I: Deductibility of Health Insurance Expenses for the Self-Employed - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the deduction for health insurance costs of self-employed individuals from 25 percent to 100 percent. Title II: Medical Savings Accounts - Allows individuals a tax deduction for contributions made to a medical care savings account established for the benefit of an eligible individual. Defines an eligible individual as: (1) one who is not covered by an employer-provided group health plan; or (2) one who is covered by such a plan which is a qualified catastrophic coverage health plan and is not covered by an other health plan. Makes such accounts tax-exempt, but subject to taxes imposed on unrelated business income of charitable, etc. organizations. Allows such deduction in arriving at adjusted gross income. Establishes an excise tax for excess contributions to medical care savings accounts and makes such accounts subject to the tax on prohibited transactions. Allows the transfer of unused amounts in flexible spending accounts of cafeteria plans to medical savings accounts. Provides special rules for transfers to cash or deferred arrangements. Allows the full deduction for medical, dental, etc., expenses for amounts paid for qualified catastrophic coverage health plans. Title III: Uniform Claims; Electronic Cards; Electronic Billing - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an Advisory Council on Health Claim Processing Standardization to submit recommendations to the Secretary concerning: (1) standards for uniform health claim reimbursement forms for hospitals and physicians and the information to be contained on such forms; (2) standards for electronic cards that could be used to store a patient's insurance information and medical records; and (3) the computerization of health claim billing and the use of electronic means to transmit billing information from hospitals and physicians to insurers and the Secretary. Requires the Secretary, taking into account such recommendations, to specify a uniform health claim reimbursement form for use by hospitals and such a form for use by physicians. Title IV: Health Insurance Portability Provisions - Prohibits an insurance carrier from imposing (or requiring an employer to impose through a waiting period for coverage under a group health plan or similar requirement) a limitation or exclusion of benefits under a group health plan for a pre-existing condition under specified circumstances. Provides for the continuity of coverage through the previous satisfaction of a pre-existing condition requirement. Limits the amount by which premiums previously charged a small employer may be increased for a newly covered employer. Imposes an excise tax for violation of such provisions. Title V: Improved Access to Rural Health Services - Subtitle A: Rural Emergency Medical Services Amendments - Amends title XII (Trauma Care) of the Public Health Service Act to apply the title to emergency medical services (including trauma care) and to modify the duties of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the title. Establishes the Office of Emergency Medical Services. Authorizes grants to States to improve the availability and quality of emergency medical services through the operation of State offices of emergency medical services. Requires projects under existing provisions to include demonstration projects to establish telecommunications between rural medical facilities and medical facilities that have expertise or equipment useful to the rural facilities through telecommunications. Authorizes appropriations for carrying out specified provisions of the title. Subtitle B: Extension of Special Treatment Rules for Medicare-Dependent, Small Rural Hospitals - Amends title XVIII of the Social Security Act to extend through March 31, 1994 (currently, 1993) special payments under part A of Medicare for the operating costs of inpatient services of small, rural Medicare-dependent hospitals. Subtitle C: Outreach Grants Program - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize grants to demonstrate new and innovative models of outreach and health care services delivery in rural areas that lack basic health services. Conditions grants on formation of consortia of at least three health care providers or at least three social service providers. Authorizes appropriations."
