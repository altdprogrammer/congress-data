    "text": "Colorado Wilderness Act of 1991 - Designates certain lands in Colorado as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Repeals provisions of Federal law with respect to review of specified lands by the Secretary of Agriculture for inclusion into the System. Reaffirms the Congress' commitment to ensuring reasonable access to certain valid existing rights within designated wilderness areas in Colorado. Amends the Endangered American Wilderness Act of 1978 to release a specified wilderness study area from the administration of the Secretary. Releases all public lands in Colorado, administered by the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior, not designated as wilderness by this Act, or previous legislation, from certain management provisions relating to wilderness study areas. Prohibits any further studies of public lands in Colorado by the Departments, unless expressly authorized by the Congress. Provides that the land and resource management plans (including the wilderness evaluation and environmental disclosure regarding wilderness evaluation for roadless lands) for public lands in Colorado shall not be subject to judicial review."
