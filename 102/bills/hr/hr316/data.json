    "text": "Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act - Authorizes appropriations for grants to the State Election Commission of Puerto Rico to hold a referendum on September 16, 1991, or on a later date in 1991 agreed upon by the Dialogue Committee on the Status of Puerto Rico (Dialogue Committee), on the following political status options: (1) independence; (2) statehood; (3) a new commonwealth relationship; or (4) none of the above. Earmarks specified funds for conducting the referendum and for disbursement to the Dialogue Committee to inform the people of Puerto Rico regarding the three status options. Sets forth certain eligibility requirements a recipient must meet to receive payments under this Act. Authorizes the Government of Puerto Rico, subject to the plan provided by this Act, to enable nonresident Puerto Ricans (including those born in Puerto Rico or those who have at least one parent who was born in Puerto Rico) to register and vote in the referendum without being present in Puerto Rico. Requires the Dialogue Committee to submit to the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico for its ratification a plan to permit nonresident Puerto Ricans to vote in the referendum. Declares that if such plan is ratified it shall have the force of law. States that it is the intent of the Congress that the remaining provisions of this Act shall continue in full force and effect if: (1) any provision of this Act is held invalid; (2) the Dialogue Committee does not submit a plan; or (3) the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico fails to ratify such plan within 120 days before the referendum. Requires specified congressional committees to draft legislation implementing the selected status and addressing specified aspects of it. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth procedures for consideration of legislation implementing Puerto Rico's new status. Requires the enacted legislation to be submitted to the Puerto Rican people for ratification within 60 days after enactment. Provides that the legislation, if approved, shall take effect in accordance with its terms. Requires the same committees to make appropriate recommendations to facilitate the exercise of self-determination by the people of Puerto Rico if: (1) the referendum provided by this Act does not result in a majority for one of the three status options; or (2) the legislation drafted does not come into effect."
