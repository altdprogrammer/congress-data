    "text": "Amends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (the Act) to revise conditions under which a tribe may receive certification for certain types of gaming activities on Indian lands. Allow a State the option to consent to enter into negotiations with a tribe to enter into a class III gaming certification compact. (Current law requires such negotiations.) Allows a tribe to apply to the National Indian Gaming Commission (the Commission) for a class III gaming certificate if a State fails to consent to Federal court jurisdiction or raises a defense against such jurisdiction, or the Federal court finds it lacks such jurisdiction, for any reason not curable by the tribe. Directs the Commission to approve the application if such gaming will be conducted in accordance with a tribal ordinance or resolution and will be located in a State that permits such gaming for any purpose, by any person, organization, or entity. Authorizes the Commission to add regulatory or licensing provisions as a condition of such approval and to impose annual fees to defray reasonable costs of regulation. Declares that this Act shall not impair the validity of any tribal-State compact entered into under specified provisions of the Act."
