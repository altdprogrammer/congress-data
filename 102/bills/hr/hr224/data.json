Provides that payments to institutions be used for the establishment and maintenance of separate Federal student loan funds for graduate and undergraduate students at such institutions. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1997, to be available for award until the close of the succeeding fiscal year. Title II: Definitions and Other Provisions Applicable to Entire Act - Sets forth the manner of Federal administration of such program (including the appointment of advisory committees by the Secretary) and the method of payment to institutions. Authorizes appropriations for administration for FY 1992 through 1997.
