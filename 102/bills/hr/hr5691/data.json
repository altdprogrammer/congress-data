Urges such provisions at a minimum, to provide for the elimination of: (1) differing tariff levels on furniture trade between the United States and Mexico; and (2) any Mexican nontariff barrier to U.S. furniture products. Sets forth specified factors to be taken into account in negotiating such agreement. Sets forth applicable tariff rates on Mexican furniture products if a trade agreement with the aforementioned objectives is not entered into under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 before June 1, 1993."
