Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire lands and interests in land which, as of August 1, 1990, were owned by the Upper Peninsula Energy Corporation. Directs the Secretary to retain and manage such lands as part of the Ottawa National Forest. Directs the Secretary to study certain rivers for possible designation as wild and scenic rivers and to establish for each such river a River Study Committee to provide advice in the preparation of a study report to the Congress. Deems any reference in this Act to Michigan to be a reference to Michigan and Wisconsin with respect to the Brule River Study Committee. Terminates each such Committee after submission of its report.
