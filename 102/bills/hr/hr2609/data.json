Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to implement a milk supply management program if estimated annual Commodity Credit Corporation milk and milk product purchases exceed 5,000,000,000 pounds. Sets forth related provisions concerning milk marketing base, history, allocation factor, transfer, and set-aside. Requires that through December 31, 1991, the minimum formula price for class 1 milk shall not be less than the August 1990 formula price. Sets forth minimum solid content for beverage milk (whole, lowfat, and skim). Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a research program to investigate milk's health and nutritional benefits; and (2) submit a report to the Congress describing ways (other than advertising and, promotional activities) to increase U.S. milk consumption."
