Requires the combining of corn and grain sorghum bases for each of 1992 through 1995. States that reduced acreage 50 percent cover crop requirements shall not apply to arid areas.

Limits the milk price support program to the 48 contiguous States. Provides that if a natural disaster (occurring between October 1, 1990, and February 1, 1991) renders a farm's land or milk production facilities unusable, the Secretary shall allow such production unit to be transferred to a farm idled under the milk production termination program. Title II: Conservation - Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to: (1) make technical amendments; and (2) direct the Secretary through the Extension Service to operate an education program in each State regarding the handling of agricultural chemicals and containers.

Amends the Tobacco Adjustment Act of 1983 to exempt from certain reporting and recordkeeping requirements cigars, cigar tobaccos, pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, and snuff in retail packaging. Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to replace the current agricultural expertise program with the E.

Amends the Farm Credit Act of 1971 to establish within the Farm Credit Administration the Office of Secondary Market Oversight (Office) to monitor the safe and sound performance of the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Corporation). Requires the Director of the Office to establish a risk-based capital test for the Corporation sufficient to maintain ten-year positive capital based upon credit risk and interest rate risk components (with adjustments for foreign exchange risk and management and operations risk). Provides for test review and revision as necessary five years after enactment of this Act. Establishes: (1) the minimum capital level for the Corporation based upon specified percentages of assets and obligations; (2) an 18-month transition minimum capital level; (3) linked portfolio asset levels; and (4) critical capital levels. Requires the Director to classify the Corporation on a quarterly basis according to enforcement levels I, II, III, or IV based upon regulatory capital and minimum capital levels. Requires the Corporation, if classified as level II or III, to implement a capital restoration plan and restrict dividends as necessary.
