    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "National Energy Policy Act of 1991 - Title I: Provisions Related To Fuel Economy Standards - Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to prescribe minimum average fuel economy standards for passenger and non-passenger automobiles manufactured in model years 1996 through 2000, and 2001 and beyond. Requires a 20 percent increase in average fuel economy over model year 1988 by 2000, and a 40 percent increase thereafter. Prescribes guidelines under which the Secretary of Transportation may consider petitions to modify such standards. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (the Administrator) to conduct an ongoing study of the accuracy of fuel economy testing of passenger automobiles as compared to actual performance under average driving conditions. Requires the Administrator to report study results annually to certain congressional committees. Requires the Secretary of Energy to annually distribute at least 100 fuel economy data booklets to each dealer, and as many as are additionally requested. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to report to the Congress the results of a National Academy of Sciences: (1) review of the current state of research and development in the fuel economy of light trucks and passenger automobiles; and (2) assessment of the remaining potential for improving their fuel efficiency and reducing their energy consumption. Doubles the civil penalties for repeated violations of average fuel economy standards. Title II: Other Provisions Related to Energy Conservation and Provisions Related to Energy Research and Development - Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to provide that the rates allowed to be charged by a State-regulated electric utility shall be such that its investments in and expenditures for energy conservation, energy efficiency resources, and other demand side management measures are at least as profitable as its investments in and expenditures for the construction of new generation facilities. Requires the Secretary of Energy to report to the Congress and the President regarding a survey of State rules and policies under which State regulatory authorities: (1) require or permit gas and electric utilities to recover their investments in end-use energy efficiency improvements and their lost net revenues from the reduced energy sales caused by such improvements; and (2) assign a positive dollar value to environmental costs and benefits when evaluating gas and electric utilities' resource planning and acquisition processes. Requires such report to evaluate to what extent each State has adopted regulatory and incentive policies to ensure that end-use energy efficiency improvements will compete on equal terms with additional energy production for gas and electric utilities' future investments in energy supply. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1996 for: (1) energy conservation; (2) solar and alternative energy; (3) enhanced oil recovery; and (4) fuel cells. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to authorize appropriations for the alternative fuels bus program from for FY 1992 through 1996. Directs the Secretary of Energy to provide funding for the purchase of alternative-fueled vehicles by State and local government agencies as well as by private entities. Sets forth a percentage schedule for Federal purchase of alternative-fueled vehicles. Requires the President to report annually to the Congress on implementation of the alternative-fueled vehicle purchase program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1996 for: (1) energy conservation programs for schools and hospitals; and (2) the weatherization assistance program. Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to direct the Secretary of Energy to establish a revolving loan fund for loans to Federal agencies to implement the Federal energy management program. Requires loan recipients to give priority to reducing the use of refined petroleum products. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1996. Title III: Provisions Related to Increased Petroleum Production Capacity - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Secretary of Energy to: (1) take expedited measures so that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will have an increased petroleum storage capacity for one billion barrels of petroleum product by September 30, 1996 (including the acquisition and leasing of private capacity); and (2) continue acquisition, transportation, storage, and injection activities until the quantity of petroleum product in the Reserve is two billion barrels by the end of FY 2002. Directs the President to report to the Congress on Western Hemisphere cooperation in energy production and conservation. Title IV: Provisions Related to Duties and Taxes - Amends the Additional U.S. Notes to chapter 27 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to direct the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy to determine offset amounts (the difference between $16 and any lower weighted average international price of a barrel of crude petroleum), according to prescribed guidelines. Authorizes the President to exempt petroleum goods from any Western Hemisphere country from offset amounts if the President considers that the exemption would foster cooperation among the other Western Hemisphere countries with respect to energy resources development and utilization. (This provides for an automatic increase in import duties on petroleum and petroleum products to make up for any drops in the weighted average international price of a barrel of crude petroleum below $16.) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe gasoline tax rates in lieu of certain fuel deficit reduction rates for any month in which certain gasoline tax rates are in effect. Sets forth rate guidelines. (This provides for a standby contingency gasoline conservation tax if the price of crude oil falls below a certain average real price of crude petroleum. Sets a ceiling on any such tax increase equal to one-half of the price fall.) Imposes a tax for the removal of crude oil from specified Federal and State Outer Continental Shelf, submerged lands, or other lands subject to competitive lease. Excepts the Strategic Petroleum Reserve from such tax. Declares that gross income shall not include certain energy and water conservation subsidies provided consumers by public utilities. Establishes the Energy Security Trust Fund to implement this Act. Establishes as a separate account in such Fund the \"Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Account\" to implement the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981."
