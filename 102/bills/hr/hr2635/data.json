Expresses the sense of the Congress that no amendment be made to legislation regarding location and disposition of minerals on public lands until the Commission has reported its findings and recommendations. Mandates that Federal entities cooperate with Commission requests and that those entities having an interest in or responsibility with respect to public lands appoint a liaison officer to work closely with the commission. Provides for termination of the Commission. Authorizes appropriations."
