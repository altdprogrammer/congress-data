    "text": "Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to direct the Secretary of Energy to promulgate regulations which prohibit a Department of Energy (DOE) contractor from discharging or otherwise discriminating against any employee with respect to compensation or terms and conditions of employment because such employee (or any person acting at the employee's request) discloses to an appropriate Government official information concerning a contract between the contractor and DOE which the employee reasonably believes evidences a violation of any Federal law or regulation relating to DOE procurement or the subject matter of the contract. Applies such prohibition to each contract relating to an atomic energy defense activity which DOE enters into for an amount greater than $500,000, except where the price is based solely on established catalogue or market prices of commercial items sold in substantial quantities to the general public. Requires the regulations to include specified provisions for the filing of a complaint and its investigation, administrative remedies, review of a final order, and enforcement."
