  "summary": {
    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-02-04", 
    "text": "Economic Growth Act of 1992 - Title I: Enhanced Economic Recovery Act of 1992 - Enhanced Economic Recovery Act of 1992 - Subtitle A: Provisions Relating to Capital Gains - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a capital gains deduction for noncorporate taxpayers for assets held from one to three years. Provides special rules for the gain or loss from the sale or exchange of collectibles and sales of interest in partnerships. Disallows such deduction in computing the alternative minimum tax, except with respect to gains realized on the sale, exchange, or other disposition of a direct or indirect interest in real estate or in closely held business. Revises the formula for determining gain from the dispositions of certain depreciable realty to take into account depreciation adjustments (adjustments allowed or allowable for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, or certain amortization). Subtitle B: Provisions Relating to Passive Losses and Depreciation - Treats the real estate development activity of a taxpayer as a single trade or business activity that is not a rental activity. Allows an additional depreciation allowance for the purchase of new equipment as investment property after February 1, 1992, and placed in service before July 1, 1993. Reduces the basis adjustment of such property by the amount of the additional allowance. Requires application of such allowance in determining the alternative minimum tax. Restricts the determination of adjusted current earnings for purposes of computing alternative minimum taxable income to property placed in service after 1989 and prior to February 1, 1992. Subtitle C: Provisions Relating to Real Estate Investments by Pension Funds - Modifies exceptions to the meaning of acquisition indebtedness. Makes certain exceptions inapplicable to sales out of foreclosure by a financial institution. Makes exceptions to acquisition indebtedness inapplicable to certain large partnerships where the principal purpose of partnership allocations is not tax avoidance. Repeals the special rule for publicly traded partnerships under provisions concerning unrelated business taxable income. Subtitle D: Provisions Affecting Homebuyers - Allows a tax credit to a first-time homebuyer who purchase a principal residence of ten percent of the purchase price, not to exceed $5,000. Limits such credit to one residence and requires acquisition on or after February 1, 1992, and January 1, 1993. Allow such credit to be carried forward for up to five years. Allows penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement plans for a first-home purchase. Limits such distribution to $10,000, or other applicable amount if previous distributions have been made. Title II: Tax Relief for Families - Tax Relief for Families Act of 1992 - Subtitle A: Provisions Relating to Education and Savings - Allows a deduction for interest on education loans for the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or child. Requires such loans to be for tuition and related expenses at certain higher education institutions.

Makes provisions of this Act (with respect to attorneys' fees in diversity cases) inapplicable to actions removed from State court or to the United States or any State, agency of the United States or any State, or any official, officer, or employee of a Federal or State agency. Amends the Equal Access to Justice Act to bar the award of attorney fees in excess of $75 per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living, as reflected by the change in the CPI-U (currently, unless the court determines that such an increase, or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved) justifies a higher fee.

Specifies that in the event that the district court finds that such requirements have not been fulfilled by the claimant, and such defect is asserted by the defendant within 60 days of service of the summons or complaint upon such defendant, the claim shall be dismissed without prejudice and the costs of such action, including attorneys fees, shall be imposed upon the claimant. Permits the claimant, under such circumstances, to refile such claim within 60 days after dismissal regardless of any statutory limitations period if, during the 60 days after dismissal, notice is effected as provided by this Act, and the original action was timely filed.

Specifies that such designation, and the program established by this provision, shall terminate at the expiration of a three-year period following such designation, unless renewed by an Act of the Congress. Requires every court which has been designated as a MDC, within six months, to establish an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) plan, including: (1) procedures for limited discovery; (2) confidentiality of proceedings as to possible subsequent pretrial and trial actions; and (3) the selection, use, and payment of nonjudicial personnel who may be selected to conduct ADR procedures. Specifies that such plan shall also establish standards for determining which cases are appropriate for ADR, considering such factors as whether factual issues predominate over legal issues, whether the case involves complex or novel legal issues requiring judicial action, and any other factors the court considers relevant. Requires that each plan: (1) provide that each Federal judge or, in a case assigned to a magistrate judge, magistrate judge in a MDC conduct a conference with counsel within 120 days after a complaint is filed to review nonbinding, voluntary ADR procedures that may be used in lieu of litigation to resolve the claims in controversy; and (2) authorize the parties, if they agree, to utilize nonbinding ADR procedures that may be used in lieu of litigation to resolve the claims in controversy, such as early neutral evaluation, traditional mediation, outcome-determinative mediation, minitrials, summary jury trials, and arbitration. Sets forth additional plan requirements. Authorizes: (1) the district courts, in carrying out their plans, to use the volunteer services of nonjudicial personnel to conduct ADR procedures; and (2) the courts to establish and pay, subject to limits set by the Judicial Conference of the United States, the amount of compensation, if any, that each neutral shall receive for services rendered in each case. Authorizes the Chief Justice of the United States to designate and assign temporarily a district judge of one circuit for service in another circuit, either in a district court or court of appeals, whenever the business of that court so requires (under current law, upon presentation of a certificate of necessity by the chief judge or circuit justice of the circuit wherein the need arises). Includes among the duties of the Director of the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts to secure information as the courts' need for temporary judicial resources to ease overcrowded dockets (including information on delays being encountered in the maintenance of civil suits) and prepare and transmit annually to the Chief Justice, the chief judges of the circuits, the Congress, and the Attorney General, statistical data, reports, and recommendations summarizing the results of this inquiry. Provides that: (1) no State judicial officer shall be held liable for any costs, including attorneys' fees, in any proceeding in vindication of civil rights brought against such officer for an act or omission taken in an official capacity (act); and (2) in any civil action for deprivation of rights brought against a judicial officer for such an act committed in such officer's official capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable. Amends the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act to provide that, in actions brought by any adult convicted of a crime confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility, the court shall (under current law, if the court believes that such a requirement would be appropriate and in the interests of justice) continue such case for a period not to exceed 180 (currently, 90) days in order to require exhaustion of remedies. Requires the Attorney General, upon request of a State or local corrections agency, to provide such agency with technical advice and assistance in establishing plain, speedy, and effective administrative remedies for inmate grievances. Amends the Federal judicial code to authorize the court, with regard, to proceedings in forma pauperis, to dismiss the case if satisfied that the action fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Directs the Board of the Federal Judicial Center to study and determine ways in which case and docket management (including ADR) techniques may be applied to improve the cost-effectiveness of litigation and to eliminate unjustified expense and delay, and include in the annual report of the activities of the Center details of the results of the studies and determinations made pursuant to this provision.

Allows the employer or workers' compensation insurer to intervene in the action to prove that fact. Prohibits a third party tortfeasor, where workers' compensation is involved, from maintaining any action for implied indemnity or contribution against the employer, any coemployee, or the exclusive representative of the injured person.
