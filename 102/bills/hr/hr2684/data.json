Authorizes the construction of recreational facilities in excess of the amount required to replace or relocate existing facilities. Provides that the costs of such construction shall be borne equally by the United States and Wyoming. Repeals a prior authorization of appropriations and authorizes to be appropriated for the Federal share of the construction of the Buffalo Bill Dam and Reservoir modifications and recreational facilities the sum of $80,000,000 (October 1988 price levels). Repeals a requirement that such sums authorized to be appropriated for construction, operation, maintenance, and replacement be reduced by the amounts of certain contributions. Declares that titles II through VI of this Act may be cited as the Central Utah Project Completion Act. Title II: Central Utah Project Construction - Authorizes additional appropriations for the Colorado River water storage project (CRSP), to be available solely for design, engineering, and construction of the facilities identified in this title, the planning and implementation of certain fish and wildlife and recreation mitigation and conservation projects and studies, and the Ute Indian Rights Settlement authorized under this Act. Requires the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to implement specified recommendations prepared by the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior with respect to the financial management of the CRSP. Prohibits funding for specified reclamation projects and features within Utah. Permits counties in which such projects and features were proposed to be located to participate in certain local development projects. Provides for the termination of the authorization of appropriations for construction of any CRSP participating project located in Utah five years after the enactment of this Act unless the Secretary: (1) executes a cost-sharing agreement with non-Federal entities for construction of such project; and (2) has requested construction funds for such project. Directs the Secretary to: (1) make appropriated funds available in their entirety to non-Federal interests as provided for pursuant to the provisions of this Act; and (2) report to the Congress on the status of CRSP participating projects for which construction has not begun as of October 15, 1990.
