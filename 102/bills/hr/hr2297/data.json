Authorizes appropriations. Transfers to a State any payments for services covered under the State plan which would otherwise have been paid to residents or health care providers under: (1) the Medicare (title XVIII), Medicaid (title XIX), or Maternal and Child Health Services (title V) programs of the Social Security Act; or (2) any other Federal health care program providing health care services to qualified recipients within the State. Declares that these provisions supersede any provisions of law that otherwise entitle individuals or providers to payment under such programs."
