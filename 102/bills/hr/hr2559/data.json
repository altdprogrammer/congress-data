Requires the United States Trade Representative to enter into discussions with representatives from member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and to report to the Congress on the extent to which: (1) the secondary boycott of Israel has distorted trade; (2) members of and observers to the GATT encourage actions, including the furnishing of information or entering into agreements, which support the boycott; (3) the GATT should work to eliminate the secondary boycott; and (4) GATT articles can be used to eliminate compliance with such boycott. Requires the President to report to the Congress on progress made to end the boycott. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to report to the Congress on OECD countries that encourage or fail to discourage compliance with such boycott."
