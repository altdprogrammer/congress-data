    "text": "Title I: Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion Act Amendments of 1992 - Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion Act Amendments of 1992 - Amends the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 to include within the definition of \"airport development\" certain projects to improve passenger and freight airport access. Extends: (1) airport improvement grant authority; (2) specified funds for airport noise reduction activities; and (3) authorization of appropriations for air navigation facilities. Authorizes appropriations to be available if the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) determines that its Capital Investment Plan is in need of substantial modification. Authorizes appropriations for research, engineering, and development demonstration projects. Requires that the total annual amounts appropriated from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (Trust Fund) for airport and airway improvement programs shall equal 85 percent of the FAA's annual budget, except for liquidating aircraft loan guarantees. Extends weather services reimbursement authority. Increases the noise set-aside. Obligates such increases on a priority basis to sponsors of primary airports and to contiguous political jurisdictions where compatible land use control measures have been adopted. Amends the military airport program to: (1) increase funding set-asides; (2) increase the number of program airports; (3) repeal the airport designation deadline; and (4) set aside funds for construction and improvement of parking lots, fuel farms, and utilities. Sets aside funds for integrated urban transportation planning. Increases the scope of activities within the disadvantaged small business set-aside requirement. Authorizes up to 50 percent funding increases for certain nonprimary airports' land acquisition costs. Authorizes a State block grant program for projects at general aviation airports. Permits States which have successfully administered such block grants for at least one year to administer block grants for reliever and small commercial service airports. Title II: Federal Aviation Act of 1958 Amendments - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to permit: (1) sole source contracts with States or political subdivisions for certain air traffic control tower operations; and (2) limited source procurement on the same basis as certain other Federal agencies. Authorizes travel and per diem reimbursement for non-Federal personnel providing aviation security training. Military Air Traffic Controller Transition Act of 1992 - Authorizes the hiring of retired military air traffic controllers under the age of 46 as FAA controllers in auxiliary flight service stations and at specified terminal facilities. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to apply FAA safety certification requirements to airports that serve aircraft designed for ten or more (currently 30) passenger seats. Amends the civil penalty assessment program to: (1) repeal the monetary assessment ceiling; (2) give deference to FAA rules interpretations in hearings before the National Transportation Safety Board; and (3) make the program permanent. Requires the FAA to be notified of adjacent sanitary landfill establishment or expansion. Extends aviation insurance authority. Authorizes the FAA to use certain aviation related fees collected outside the United States."
