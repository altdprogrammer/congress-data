Bars the building of such a facility within a two-mile radius of a residential neighborhood. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to publish guidance to assist States and local governments in siting such facilities that: (1) are protective of human health and the environment; and (2) consider the cumulative impact of the siting of multiple facilities on the health and well-being of nearby residents and local property values. Makes the prohibition on building such facilities within a two-mile radius of a residential neighborhood effective January 1, 1992, and applicable to facilities for which construction is completed after such date."
