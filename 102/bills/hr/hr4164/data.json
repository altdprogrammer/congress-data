Prohibits such land transfer until 180 days after the submission to specified congressional committees of a required appraisal and land use plan. Requires the conveyance document for any land transferred within six nautical miles of an airport to require a determination of no hazard to air navigation. Authorizes the Administrator to disallow transfer of any parcel on which there is severe contamination, the remedy of which would require the United States to incur extraordinary costs. States that all Federal and territorial environmental laws and regulations shall apply to parcels transferred under this Act during and after such transfer."
