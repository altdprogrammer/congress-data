Restricts such deduction: (1) to a lifetime limitation of $400,000; and (2) to taxpayers whose adjusted gross income does not exceed $200,000. Requires the substitution of the indexed basis of property for its adjusted basis in determining qualified gain from the sale or exchange of real property. Disallows such deduction in computing the alternative minimum tax. Increases the income tax rate for certain high-income individuals."
