Provides for updates of the report every five years and distribution to the Congress, Federal agencies, and the public. Requires the Secretary to use the report to educate the public on the importance of river systems and the issues and threats related to river systems nationwide. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop a standard methodology describing items needed for an information system relating to river and riparian zone resources; and (2) establish a central repository for such information. Provides for technical and financial assistance to States to permit States to compile, update, and provide such information to the central repository. Makes the information system available to the public. Authorizes appropriations."
