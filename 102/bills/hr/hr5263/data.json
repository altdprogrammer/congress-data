    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, through September 30, 1995, to carry out at three to seven health-care facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs a demonstration project to test the capability of the Department to provide cost-effective health care to persons who: (1) are eligible for health care under both title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act and a health-care program of either the Department or the Department of Defense (DOD); and (2) are generally not able to gain access for needed Department or DOD health care due to the relatively low priority of treatment of non-service connected diseases or disabilities. Requires as part of the criteria in the selection of participating facilities that each facility be in the same geographic region as a DOD medical facility scheduled for closure pursuant to the base closure laws. Directs the Secretary, in carrying out the project, to consult with veterans' organizations and the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees (veterans' committees). Deems any medical facility chosen for participation under this Act to be a Medicare participating provider entitled to reimbursement under Medicare for covered hospital care or medical services provided. States that: (1) a person receiving care under the project shall not be liable for the payment of any coinsurance or deductible under Medicare with respect to the care and services provided; and (2) the Secretary may waive in whole or in part any financial liability a veteran would otherwise incur for participation in the project. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to establish mechanisms to evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of the project and the satisfaction of the patients served. Directs: (1) the Secretary to report to the veterans' committees; and (2) both Secretaries to report jointly to the Congress the findings of the evaluation."
