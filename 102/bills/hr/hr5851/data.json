    "text": "Title I: Commission on Information Technology and Paperwork Reduction - Establishes the Commission on Information Technology and Paperwork Reduction in order to minimize the information reporting burden imposed by the Federal Government, consistent with the needs of the Government for information for policy purposes. Lists specific Commission functions, which include the study and review of former Commission on Paperwork recommendations for paperwork reduction. Requires a final Commission report to the Congress and the President with a review of both its findings and recommendations for statutory and other changes needed to minimize Federal reporting requirements. Requires action by the Office of Management and Budget with respect to Commission recommendations. Title II: Nondevelopment Items Acquisition - Nondevelopmental Items Acquisition Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to require the Federal Acquisition Regulation issued under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Act to require that: (1) supply procurement requirements of Federal agencies are stated in terms of functions to be performed, performance required, or essential physical characteristics; (2) such requirements are defined so that nondevelopmental items (NDIs) (commercial items already available in the marketplace) may be procured to fulfill such requirements; (3) such requirements are fulfilled through the procurement of NDIs where practicable; and (4) prior to developing new specifications, executive agencies conduct market research to determine whether NDIs are available or could be modified to meet agency needs. Requires the Federal Acquisition Regulation to require simplified contracting procedures for commercial items. Specifies that such items must be items which are sold or traded to the general public in significant quantities in the course of normal business operations. Includes items which require only minor modifications to meet the needs of the procuring agency. Allows the Department of Defense to use procedures under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 in lieu of such simplified contracting procedures. Requires the Federal Acquisition Regulation to require that: (1) Federal agencies take advantage of warranties offered by commercial contractors and use such warranties for the repair and replacement of commercial items; and (2) agencies require offerors, where appropriate, to demonstrate that products being offered are suitable for agency use and meet required product specifications. Requires the Federal Acquisition Regulation to provide guidance to agencies on the use of past performance of products and sources as a factor in award decisions. Requires the Administrator of OFPP to issue guidelines for the training by executive agencies of appropriate personnel in the acquisition of NDIs. Amends the OFPP Act to make the advocate for competition for each procuring activity responsible for promoting full and open competition and the acquisition of NDIs and for challenging barriers to such acquisition. Directs the Comptroller General to report to specified congressional committees on the use of market research in support of procurement of NDIs. Title III: General Accounting Office Bid Protest System - Amends the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 to revise provisions authorizing the Comptroller General to award bid and proposal preparation and protest costs to companies that file bid protests to make the payment of such costs, as well as compliance with other recommendations by the Comptroller General in the General Accounting Office (GAO) bid protest process, discretionary for the contracting agency. Sets forth procedures for determining the amount of costs to be paid upon a GAO recommendation. Requires costs paid as recommended by GAO to be paid out of the judgment fund, subject to agency reimbursement. Requires the Comptroller General to report to appropriate congressional committees in any case in which a Federal agency fails to implement a GAO recommendation, along with recommendations regarding legislative action to correct any inequity or to preserve the integrity of the procurement process."
