Requires all foreign travel regulated by this Act to be accomplished by the most economical means conveniently possible. Provides for reimbursement of the costs of any transportation and lodging provided by the Government from the specific travel appropriation. Requires congressional committees to: (1) establish guidelines for foreign travel by their members and employees to avoid unnecessary trips; and (2) file quarterly reports with respect to such travel which shall be made available for public inspection. Requires such reports to be destroyed six years after being filed unless they are required in an ongoing investigation. Makes it unlawful for any person to obtain or use a report for: (1) any unlawful purposes; (2) any commercial purpose other than by news and communications media for dissemination to the general public; or (3) use in the solicitation of money for any political, charitable, or other purpose. Sets forth penalties for violation of this Act."
