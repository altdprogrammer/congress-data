Authorizes the Commission to investigate persons who have violated or are about to violate any provision of this Act. Authorizes any person who has been injured by a violation of this Act to commence a civil action: (1) for actual damages resulting from such violation and, in the case of any knowing, willful and reckless violation, punitive damages up to $50,000; or (2) to enjoin any person alleged to be in violation of such provision. Authorizes the Commission to secure information and employee services from government agencies and entities. Directs the Commission to consult with appropriate organizations with respect to the international regulation of professional boxing. Requires the Commission to report annually to the Congress.
