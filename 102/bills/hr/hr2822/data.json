    "text": "Rio Grande del Norte National Conservation Area Establishment Act - Establishes the Rio Grande del Norte National Conservation Area, New Mexico. Directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and of the Interior (the Secretaries) to develop and transmit a general management plan to specified congressional committees for the portion of the conservation area managed by each Secretary. Requires the general management plan prepared by the Secretary of the Interior to include a review or recommendation for suitability or nonsuitability for specified lands to be preserved as wilderness. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, to manage such lands to maintain their potential for inclusion within the National Wilderness Preservation System, pending submission of a recommendation or until directed by an Act of the Congress. Directs the Secretaries to assure nonexclusive access to the conservation area by native people for traditional cultural and religious purposes (including the harvesting of pine nuts). Withdraws certain lands from U.S. mining and mineral leasing laws. Prohibits commercial harvesting of fuelwood in the conservation area. Requires steps toward enhancement of the woodland resource to include reforestation and erosion control. Directs the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service to inform local businesses of economic opportunities and required procedures for competition in awarding concessions and contracts within the National Conservation Area. Gives preference to small businesses in the award in such contracts. Establishes the Rio Grande del Norte National Conservation Area Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary of the Interior with respect to the preparation and implementation of the general management plan. Directs the Secretaries to request the United States Man and Biosphere Committee to study the conservation area and surrounding private and Federal lands for the feasibility of designating this area as a Biosphere Reserve under the Man and the Biosphere Programme of United Nations Educational and Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Directs the Secretaries to study the feasibility of establishing an Arid Land and Western Mountains Research Institute in the conservation area to serve as a cooperative management resource base and educational facility for the gathering and sharing of pertinent information for the benefit of all who live in similar areas across the Western mountains of North America and throughout the world. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Land Management, to study the Rio Grande in the conservation area to assess minimum flow and water quality requirements to protect the resources of the conservation area. Requires the Secretary to recommend corrective measures if deficiencies are found. Designates the segments of certain rivers in New Mexico study for potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic River System. Requires such study to be completed and the report submitted within three years after enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
