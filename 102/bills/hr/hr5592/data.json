    "text": "Veterans' Health Care Financing Reform Demonstration Act of 1992 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a demonstration program to test the feasibility and desirability of requiring that, whenever the Department of Veteran Affairs provides hospital care or medical services for a non-service-connected disability to an individual who is also entitled to such care or services from another Federal department or agency, such department or agency shall reimburse the Department for the provision of such care or services. Requires the demonstration project to be conducted at three Department medical centers selected by the Secretary. Outlines health care programs of the Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs as covered programs under which such reimbursement shall take place. Allows the Department to recover the cost of care or services provided to an individual for a non-service-connected disability, reduced by any appropriate unpaid deductible, to the extent that the individual would be eligible to receive such care or services from another department or agency. Directs the Secretary to establish a central electronic billing system for such amounts. Subrogates the Secretary to any right or claim that the veteran may have against another department or agency. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations to determine the amount to be recovered for such care or services, taking into account the geographic area involved. Directs the Secretary to establish mechanisms to evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of the demonstration project and the satisfaction of the patients served. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress after one year of the project, describing the findings of the evaluation."
