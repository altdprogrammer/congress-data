Admits New Columbia into the Union on an equal footing with the other States in all respects. Reserves Federal title to certain lands and property, the National Capital Service Area. Directs the Governor to report to the Congress, within seven months before the beginning of each fiscal year, on the effects of the revenues and expenditures of the State by the presence of the Federal Government's seat within or adjacent to it. Requires the report to contain information on services rendered to the Federal Government, potential revenues lost because of the presence of the Federal Government, and potential revenues gained because of the presence of the Federal Government. Prohibits the State from changing any provision of its Constitution concerning height limitations on buildings without the consent of the Congress. Declares that nothing in this Act or the Constitution or laws of the State may be construed to permit it to refuse to allow an individual to serve as a qualified registered elector of the State solely because the individual resides in the National Capital Service Area. Sets forth election protocol for popular ratification of statehood. Provides for election of one member of the House of Representatives as well as two Senators. Maintains the laws that were territorially in effect. Continues any law suits already pending in District of Columbia courts. Establishes a Statehood Transition Commission."
