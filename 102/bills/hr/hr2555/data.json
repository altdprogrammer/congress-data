    "text": "Youth Summer Camp and Conservation Act of 1991 - Directs the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture (the Secretaries) to jointly establish a summer camp program for children from low-income families in areas eligible for assistance under the urban park and recreation recovery program under the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Act of 1978 (which is title X of the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978). Requires such program to provide for contracts with private, nonprofit youth-oriented organizations under which funding will be provided to assist eligible children to attend summer camps, operated by such organizations, for recreational enjoyment and environmental education. Directs the Secretaries to expand the Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) program to offer youth opportunities for summer employment in a healthful outdoor atmosphere of the National Park System, the National Forest System, or other public land and water areas. Allows such program expansion to include both residential and non-residential camp opportunities. Requires allocation of such program expansion funding: (1) by the Secretary of the Interior among agencies of the Department of the Interior operating a YCC program, giving priority to those with existing programs; and (2) by the Secretary of Agriculture to the Forest Service to expand its existing YCC program. Provides for funding of programs under this Act by requiring additional fees to be paid by concession contractors of the National Park Service and special use permittees of the Forest Service, if their annual gross receipts or sales to the recreating public exceed $2,000,000. Sets such additional fees at two percent of the annual gross receipts or sales. Divides such funds as follows: (1) two-thirds for the summer camp program; and (2) one-third for the YCC program expansion for summer employment."
