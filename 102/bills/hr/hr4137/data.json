Establishes a maximum capital gains rate of 17 percent on the sale or exchange of real property held for more than one year. Allows a tax credit for individuals for the purchase of a personal residence. Limits such credit to $2,000, if the individual is a first-time homebuyer, and $1,500, if the individual is not a first-time homebuyer but the residence is newly constructed. Allows an itemized deduction for losses incurred in the sale or exchange of a principal residence."
