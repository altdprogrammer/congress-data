    "text": "Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 - Amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the Act) to revise and extend various vocational rehabilitation programs. Title I: Administration and Vocational Rehabilitation Services - Subtitle A: Administration - Revises provisions for findings, purpose, and policy under the Act. Revises or adds definitions of community rehabilitation programs (this term replaces rehabilitation facilities), employment outcomes, individuals with disabilities, personal assistance services, rehabilitation technology (replaces engineering), individuals with severe disabilities supported employment, assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs, assistive technology devices and services, disability, extended services, impartial hearing officers, independent living services, ongoing support services, supported employment services, and transition services. Sets the Federal share at 78.7 percent. (Currently the Federal share is 80 percent for payments less than or equal to the 1988 payment to the State, and 75 percent of any excess over the FY 1988 payment for FY 1993.) Revises provisions for administration of the Act. Includes training for the personnel of community rehabilitation programs, centers for independent living, and other providers of services (including job coaches) under the short-term training and technical instruction which the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) (the Commissioner) is authorized to provide. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to promulgate regulations regarding requirements for implementation of an order of selection for vocational rehabilitation services if these cannot be provided to all eligible individuals with disabilities who apply for them. Requires the Secretary, within 120 days after enactment of this Act, to receive public comment and promulgate regulations establishing criteria pertaining to selection of vocational rehabilitation services and services providers, by an individual with a disability, consistent with that individual's individualized written rehabilitation program. Requires such regulations to include specified types of procedures, standards, and guidelines. Requires annual reports to include information on types of rehabilitation technology services provided to each client in the preceding fiscal year. Revises provisions for program and project evaluation. Makes the Secretary, in consultation with the Commissioner, responsible for such evaluation. (Current law gives the Commissioner this responsibility). Requires such evaluations to include the employment outcomes attained. Directs the Secretary to continue to conduct a longitudinal study for a national sample of applicants for vocational rehabilitation services, to assess linkages between such services and economic and non-economic outcomes. Requires such study to address specified factors, make appropriate comparisons, and cover specified minimum periods. Raises the cap on costs of review of applications. Sets forth the compensation rate for non-Federal reviewers. Allows recipients of grants under specified programs under the Act to carry over such funds for use in the next fiscal year, to the extent the recipient complied with non-Federal share requirements applicable to the program for the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated. Adds client assistance information requirements. Requires all programs that provide services to individuals with disabilities under the Act to advise such individuals or their parents, guardians, or legal representatives of the availability and purposes of the client assistance program, including information on how to seek assistance under it. Directs the Commissioner to develop and implement a policy to prepare minorities for careers in vocational rehabilitation, independent living, and related services. Requires such policy to focus on: (1) recruitment of minorities into the field of vocational rehabilitation counseling and related disciplines; and (2) financial assistance to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions of higher education, and other institutions of higher education whose minority enrollment is at least 50 percent, to prepare students for vocational rehabilitation and related service careers. Directs the Commissioner to develop a plan to provide outreach and related services to increase the participation of such institutions, as well as of nonprofit and for-profit agencies that are minority-owned or -controlled and underrepresented populations, in competitions for grants and contracts under titles I through VIII of the Act. Requires reservation of one percent of funds for titles II, III, VI, VII, and VIII of the Act to implement such plan for FY 1993 through 1997. Requires annual progress reports by the Commissioner to the Congress, beginning in FY 1994. Requires specified demonstrations by applicants for grants and contracts under titles II, III, VI, VII, and VIII of the Act with respect to how they will address the needs of individuals with disabilities from minority backgrounds. Subtitle B: Vocational Rehabilitation Services - Revises provisions for findings, purpose, and policy under title I (Vocational Rehabilitation Services) of the Act. Extends through FY 1997 the authorization of appropriations for: (1) basic grants for vocational rehabilitation services (in necessary amounts, but at least equal to the immediately preceding fiscal year, plus indexing for inflation); and (2) innovation and expansion grants (in necessary amounts). Revises the formula for determining amounts under specified provisions for extension of authorization or duration. Revises requirements for State plans under the Act to allow their submission to coincide with the intervals at which State plans are to be submitted under other Federal laws, such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Requires State plans to include certain provisions, as follows. Requires explanation of the methods by which the State will provide vocational rehabilitation services to all eligible individuals with disabilities. (Provides that State criteria shall determine those with the most severe disabilities, who are to receive such services first.) Requires description of how rehabilitation technology services will be provided at each stage of the rehabilitation process and on a statewide basis, and of the training to be provided for vocational rehabilitation counselors and client assistance and other related personnel. Requires assurance that facilities will comply with provisions for nondiscrimination under Federal grants and programs under the Act and with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Requires a comprehensive system of personnel development for professionals and paraprofessionals employed by the State agency, standards to ensure appropriate and adequate training of personnel, and minimum standards to ensure availability of personnel trained to communicate in the native language or mode of communication of the client. Provides that determinations regarding availability of comparable services and benefits under any other program are not required prior to the provision of services if an immediate job placement would be lost due to a delay in the provision of comparable benefits. Requires use of existing information available from other programs and providers (particularly education officials and the Social Security Administration) and information that can be provided by the individual with a disability or that individual's family in determining eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services and choosing rehabilitation goals, objectives, and services. Requires that State reports to the Commissioner include information on: (1) number of individuals evaluated and number of individuals rehabilitated; (2) costs of administration, counseling, provision of direct services, development of community rehabilitation programs, and other functions under the Act; and (3) use of other programs by individuals. Revises provisions for interagency cooperation to specifically include arrangements for coordination of services to individuals eligible under Federal law which created the Committee on Purchases of Blind-made Products (the Wagner-O'Day Act). Provides that interagency cooperation includes, if appropriate: (1) establishing interagency working groups; (2) entering into formal interagency cooperative agreements that identify policies, practices, and procedures that can be coordinated and describe available resources and financial responsibilities of each agency; and (3) training staff of other agencies as to the availability, benefits, and eligibility standards of vocational rehabilitation services. Changes references to rehabilitation facilities and their condition to community rehabilitation programs and their effectiveness. Requires annual (currently periodic) review and reevaluation of the status of individuals placed in extended employment settings in community rehabilitation programs, including workshops, or other employment under specified provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 for special certificates for employment of individuals with disabilities. Requires such review and reevaluation to: (1) include individual or family input; and (2) determine such individuals' interests, priorities, and needs for their employment, or training for competitive employment, in integrated settings in the labor market. Requires maximum efforts, including provision of vocational rehabilitation services, designed to promote movement from extended employment to integrated employment, including supported employment. Permits use of funds under title I of the Act for facilities construction, but only under special circumstances. Includes the views of the Director of the client assistance program among those that are to be considered in State and local policy planning under the Act. Requires that continuing studies and annual evaluation also form the basis for developing and updating a required strategic plan. Requires that public comment precede the development of the State plan. Requires assurances that the State agency will consult with the Director of the client assistance program in the formulation of policies governing the provision of vocational rehabilitation services consistent with the State plan and other revisions. Requires the State agency to establish plans, policies, and procedures (including entering into a formal interagency agreements with education officials responsible for public education of individuals with disabilities) to facilitate: (1) development and accomplishment of long-term and intermediate goals and objectives, as well as those related to independent living before a student leaves a school setting, including coordination plans for transition services; and (2) transition from public education by an educational agency to vocational rehabilitation services by the designated State unit, including coordination plans for transition services. Requires: (1) provisions for determining State lead agencies and qualified personnel responsible for transition services; (2) procedures for outreach to and identification of youth in need of such services; and (3) a timeframe for evaluation and followup of youth who have received such services.
