    "text": "Reclamation Drought Act of 1991 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) perform studies to identify opportunities to augment, make use of, or conserve water supplies available to Federal reclamation projects and Indian water resource developments, and for fish and wildlife habitat, maintenance, and enhancement; (2) undertake management and conservation activities to reduce the impacts of temporary drought conditions; (3) provide information or technical assistance to willing buyers in their purchase of available water supplies from willing sellers and in the delivery of such water; (4) prepare drought contingency plans for Federal reclamation projects which incorporate water conservation measures in the operations of non-Federal recipients of water from Federal reclamation projects; and (5) enter into agreements with Federal agencies, State and local governments, Indian tribes, and such other public and private entities and individuals as necessary to carry out this Act. Authorizes the Secretary, for the purpose of reducing impacts of temporary drought conditions, to make available, by contract, water and facilities at Federal reclamation projects for the storage or conveyance of project or non-project water for use both within and outside an authorized project service area. Sets forth requirements for contracts signed under this Act, such as requiring that the price for water or for the use of facilities be at least sufficient to recover all Federal operation, maintenance, and administrative costs and an appropriate share of capital costs. Specifies that such contracts shall terminate one year from the date of execution or upon a determination by the Secretary that water supply conditions no longer warrant such contracts remaining in effect, whichever occurs first. Authorizes the Secretary to make available, on a temporary basis, water for the purpose of reducing impacts to fish and wildlife resources caused by temporary drought conditions. Requires the Secretary to submit annual reports to the President and the Congress on expenditures and accomplishments under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to implement drought-related assistance under this Act only after a determination by the Secretary that such actions are merited. Authorizes appropriations."
