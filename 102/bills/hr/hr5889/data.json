Applies the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to: (1) the Congressional Budget Office; (2) the General Accounting Office; (3) the Government Printing Office; (4) the Library of Congress; (5) the Office of Technology Assessment; and (6) the U.S. Botanic Garden. Requires the Architect of the Capitol to report to the Congress on steps taken pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1989 relating to the minimum wage rate of its employees. Expresses the sense of the House that the Committee on House Administration should review the Occupational Safety and Health Act and make recommendations regarding the application of such Act to the House. Authorizes any individual who occupies an employment position or is an applicant for employment in the House and has been aggrieved by a violation of the Fair Employment Practices Resolution (relating to nondiscrimination), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Fair Labor Standards Amendment of 1989, or the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to petition for review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit of the final decision regarding such violation pursuant to the Fair Employment Practices Resolution. Expresses the sense of the House that the Rules of the House should be amended to address the issue of the source of payments made by the House to satisfy a judgment against a Member of the House who has been found guilty by the Court of a violation of one of such Acts. Gives employees of instrumentalities of the Congress who have been aggrieved by the violations of the following Acts the right to petition for judicial review, subject to specified conditions: (1) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (excluding Library of Congress employees); (2) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; (3) the Civil Rights Act of 1991; and (4) the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (excluding employees of the Architect of the Capitol)."
