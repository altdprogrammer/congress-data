Amends the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 to establish milk producer and handler trusts. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to direct the CCC to carry out a dairy heifer export program. Modifies the dairy termination program to permit a producer whose facilities have been rendered unusuable by a natural disaster to transfer such production facilities to an idled farm under specified conditions. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to require: (1) annual CCC milk purchase estimates to include estimates of dairy cattle slaughtering; and (2) additional Department of Agriculture beef purchases if any year in which dairy cattle slaughtering exceeds specified levels."
