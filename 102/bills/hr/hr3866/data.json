Title II: Merchant Marine Provisions - Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carrier Act of 1991 - Amends the Shipping Act of 1984 to require each non-vessel-operating common carrier to furnish a bond, insurance, or other security (currently, a bond) to insure financial responsibility. Makes the surety available to pay judgments for damages from transportation-related activities under the Act (currently, from transportation-related activities). Amends Federal law (commonly referred to as the Johnson Act) to modify the circumstances under which a gambling device may be repaired, transported, possessed, or used on a vessel. Title III: Implementation of Maritime Boundary Agreement - Amends the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to add to the coverage of the Act special areas referred to in certain provisions of a specified agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union regarding the Maritime Boundary. Authorizes negotiations with the Soviet Union on a fishery agreement containing certain elements. Amends the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982, the Fur Seal Act of 1966, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, the Pacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985, the National Sea Grant College Program Act, and the Sea Grant Program Improvement Act of 1976 to add references to the special areas. Requires the special areas to be considered places subject to U.S. jurisdiction for purposes of the Endangered Species Act of 1973."
