Title II: Amendment to Public Health Service Act Concerning Federally Negotiated Bulk Rate - Amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit the Secretary from procuring a vaccine that may be used to immunize children under the age of 13 from any person who does not agree as a condition to the procurement to sell the vaccine to a State at the same price as the person offers the Secretary. Title III: Immunization Registry Grant Program - Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States for the establishment and operation of State immunization registries by State agencies with legal responsibility for disease control under State law. Allows the Secretary to make such grants to two or more cooperating States for regional immunization registries.
