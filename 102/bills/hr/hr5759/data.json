    "text": "Information Infrastructure and Technology Act of 1992 - Amends the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 to require the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, through the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology, to establish an Information Infrastructure Program and five-year implementation plan that shall provide a coordinated interagency effort to develop technologies needed to apply high-performance computing and high-speed networking in education, libraries, health care, manufacturing, and other appropriate fields. Requires the plan to take into consideration the activities of the Library of Congress. Directs the establishment of an advisory committee, consisting of qualified industry and academia representatives, on high-performance computing and high-speed networking communications to independently assess plan progress. Requires Federal agency plan participants to report annually on high-performance computing activities. Directs the National Science Foundation and other appropriate agencies to provide for the development of advanced technologies for use in education, including pilot projects connecting primary and secondary schools to the Internet and the National Research and Education Network. Directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish an Advanced Manufacturing Systems and Networking Project to create a collaborative multiyear technology development program. Directs the National Institutes of Health to develop technologies for applications in the health care sector, including application of testbed networks linking medical facilities and schools for the sharing of medical data and imagery. Calls for the development of technologies for digital libraries of electronic information, including the development of advanced data storage systems. Directs the National Science Foundation, working with the supercomputer centers it supports, to develop prototype digital libraries of scientific data, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop databases of software and remote-sensing images. Authorizes appropriations."
