Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop and report to the Congress on a plan for obtaining such information with respect to State and local law enforcement actions; and (2) implement any part of the plan that can be carried out without further legislative action. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on information that would be needed to determine: (1) the extent to which Federal Reserve notes in denominations of $50 and $100 are being used for illegal, drug-related transactions; and (2) the feasibility of withdrawing legal tender status of such notes or replacing such notes with new notes of a different design and the deterrent effect such withdrawal or replacement would have on such transactions. Requires the Secretary to collect and maintain such information. Sets forth biannual reporting requirements with respect to the information collected under this Act."
