Requires any licensee that permits a broadcasting station to be used in a manner not in accordance with such requirement to provide to the candidate to whom the reference was made the opportunity to use, without charge, an equal amount of time. Makes this Act equally applicable in the case of an authorized committee speaking on behalf of or against a legally qualified candidate."
