    "text": "Antarctica World Park and Protection Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the National Park Service, to prepare an inventory of resources and values of Antarctica. Requires the inventory to: (1) identify areas that should be managed to preserve natural ecological systems or to avoid interference with scientific research; and (2) identify areas where past actions have resulted in damage to resources or values requiring restoration or mitigation. Directs the Secretary to: (1) identify the claims asserted with respect to Antarctica by the United States and other nations, as well as existing and proposed international agreements affecting Antarctica; and (2) assess the extent to which such claims could affect this Act and the adequacy of such agreements to achieve management of Antarctica's resources in a manner consistent with this Act. Requires the Secretary, acting through the National Park Service, to prepare a plan for the management of Antarctica as a world park. Directs the Secretary to incorporate relevant international agreements into such plan. Requires the Secretary of State to submit the plan to other nations and international organizations and to report to the President and the Congress on modifications of international agreements and new agreements necessary to manage Antarctica as a world park. Requires the plan to: (1) identify areas in Antarctica appropriate for public education, interpretation, and visitation by tourists and specify conditions on such visitation to assure protection of resources and values; (2) identify areas most valuable for environmental monitoring and other scientific research and specify conditions on such research to assure protection of resources and values; and (3) identify areas requiring restoration or mitigation and the steps necessary to achieve restoration or mitigation. Prohibits U.S. citizens from entering any area not identified in the plan or appropriate for activities in conformance with the plan. Provides for public participation in the preparation of the inventory and plan. Provides for interim protection of Antarctica until the plan is completed. Amends the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 to apply the Environmental and Historic Preservation Laws to actions in or affecting Antarctica by U.S. entities. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to be kept informed of proposals or projects by U.S. or foreign agencies that could affect Antarctica. Applies recommendations adopted by parties to the Antarctic Treaty to protect the values of Antarctica to all U.S. entities unless the United States formally exempts itself from such recommendations. Requires the Secretary of State to provide the following information to the President and the Congress: (1) information concerning actions by any nation to exempt itself from recommendations of such type; and (2) information that any nation intends to seek voting status under the Treaty. Directs the President, through the Secretary of State, to negotiate with other parties to the Treaty to establish agreements to: (1) prevent activities inconsistent with managing Antarctica as a world park; (2) prohibit mineral development or exploration in Antarctica; and (3) minimize adverse impacts on the values of Antarctica. Requires U.S. officers or agents having reliable information on activities to obtain data on Antarctica's mineral resources to provide such information to the Secretary of the Interior. Directs the President, through the Secretary of State, to request all nations whose citizens or nationals are believed to have carried out such activities to provide such data to the Secretary of the Interior. Requires the President to instruct U.S. officers to report on sanctions that could be applied to any nation failing to comply with such request. Authorizes appropriations."
