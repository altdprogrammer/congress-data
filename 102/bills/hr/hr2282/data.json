    "text": "National Science Foundation Authorization Act Amendments of 1991 - Amends the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1988 to authorize appropriations to the National Science Foundation (the Foundation) for FY 1992 and 1993 for: (1) research and related activities (including these subcategories: mathematical and physical sciences; engineering; biological, behavioral, and social sciences; geosciences; computer and information science and engineering; and scientific, technological, and international affairs); (2) education and human resources; (3) Antarctic Program; (4) academic research facilities modernization; (5) Academic Research Instrumentation Program; (6) salaries and expenses; and (7) Office of the Inspector General. Prohibits funds authorized under this Act for FY 1992 from being available for construction of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. Permits financial assistance provided by the Foundation to an institution of higher education to provide amounts for administrative indirect costs of the institution and for non-administrative indirect costs of the institution. Requires the chief financial officer of an institution of higher education to certify to the Director of the Foundation that all expenditures reported to substantiate indirect costs were appropriate. Provides for the recovery, by the Foundation, from an institution of improperly spent funds. Instructs the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to: (1) establish a committee to identify and examine specified costs associated with federally funded projects of institutions of higher education; and (2) make recommendations. Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to remove provisions declaring ineffective, after the end of FY 1989, provisions: (1) allowing the National Science Foundation (NSF) Board to delegate authority to the NSF Director to make grants, contracts, and other arrangements, and allowing the Board to impose conditions on such delegation; and (2) limiting any such delegations and conditions to two years. Prohibits a contract or subcontract made with funds authorized under this Act from being awarded for the procurement of any article supplied or produced in a foreign country which unfairly, in its procurement practices, discriminates against U.S. products or services so that there is identifiable harm to U.S. businesses. Prohibits the use of fraudulent \"Made in America\" labels and provides sanctions applicable to those using such fraudulent labels. Authorizes the Director of the Foundation to award a contract to a domestic firm provided stated conditions are met. Requires the Director of the Foundation to report to the Congress on contracts covered by this paragraph."
