    "text": "Energy Technology Growth Act - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 for the following Department of Energy (DOE) programs: (1) Fossil Energy Research and Development; (2) Nuclear Energy Research and Development; (3) Uranium Supply and Enrichment Activities; (4) the Nuclear Waste Fund; (5) Fusion Energy Research and Development; (6) Renewable Energy Research and Development; (7) Energy Conservation Research and Development; (8) Supporting Research and Technical Analysis; (9) Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Program; (10) Biological and Environmental Research; (11) Environment, Safety and Health; and (12) Steel and Aluminum Research. Makes conforming amendments to the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Technology Competitiveness Act of 1989 and the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) to transfer specified funds from DOE civilian accounts during FY 1992 through 2001 for research and development projects advancing new energy supply, production, distribution, and consumption technologies, and for highly innovative technologies, including those based on yet unproven scientific theory. Directs DOE to continue the first-of-a-kind engineering design program in cooperation with the U.S. utility industry in order to begin the construction of standardized nuclear powerplants by 1995. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to establish the Research Reactor User Complex (RRC), a research, development, and production center. Sets forth implementation guidelines, including the requirement that a contractor retained by DOE to operate the RRC shall maintain and operate the Fast Flux Test Facility for research and development on isotopes and energy. Establishes the RRC Fund to be funded by related user chargers. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish investment tax credits for advanced energy use property and for increased product efficiency."
