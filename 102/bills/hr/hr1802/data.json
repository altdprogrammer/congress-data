Sets forth the eligibility criteria for such grants and the requirements grant applications must meet. Outlines limitations on the use of grant funds. Establishes different priorities for the awarding of grants, with the highest priority for those FQHCs and other entities proposing to expand operations to serve medically unserved populations with the highest degree of unmet need in the most efficient manner. Requires entities and organizations receiving program funds to return excess revenues to the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to terminate grants to entities which fail to meet certain requirements. Directs the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on the relationship between community health centers and hospitals in providing such services."
