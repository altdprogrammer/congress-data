Amends the Social Security Act to include the microloan demonstration program within the services and activities provided under the JOBS program. Permits such microenterprises to participate in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program without adversely impacting upon their Federal benefits. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act and the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to include microenterprises within their purview of eligible participants. Expresses the sense of the Congress that a specified percentage of amounts appropriated under such Acts be reserved for microenterprise assistance. Amends the Job Training and Partnership Act to authorize training activities for microenterprises."
