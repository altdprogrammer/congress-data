    "text": "Presidential Election Campaign Fund Protection Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase from $1 to $3, and from $2 to $6, respectively, the Presidential Election Campaign Fund income tax checkoff amounts for single and joint returns. Provides for an inflation adjustment in such amounts in calendar years after 1992. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make specified expenditures from the Fund only if sufficient amounts are available. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to repeal the limitation on expenditures in a single State by certain Presidential election candidates who accept amounts from the Presidential primary matching payment account. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require the Secretary to take into account the amounts estimated to be transferred to the Fund during the calendar year of the election before determining whether to make pro rata reductions in such payments. Increases from $5,000 to $12,500 the contribution threshold for eligibility for payments from the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account. Declares that candidates with felony convictions relating to presidential election campaign financing are ineligible for further financing."
