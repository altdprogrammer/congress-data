Excludes the following environmental facilities from the volume cap on such bonds: (1) mass commuting facilities; (2) facilities for the furnishing of water; (3) sewage facilities; (4) solid waste disposal facilities; (5) qualified hazardous waste facilities; and (6) qualified recycling facilities. Exempts such facilities from certain rules relating to acquisition of existing property and restrictions on issuance costs. Excludes from alternative minimum tax the interest on environmental facility bonds. Provides for the treatment of such bonds under advance refunding rules. Excludes such bonds from arbitrage rebate requirements. Repeals the requirement that mass commuting facilities be governmentally owned."
