    "text": "Defense Nuclear Workers' Bill of Rights Act - Considers an individual employed at a defense nuclear facility (DNF) of the Department of Energy an employee for purposes of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. Requires compensation to be payable under such Act if the disability or death of an individual employed in a DNF results from an injury arising out of and in the course of employment. Provides that, in any proceeding for the enforcement of a compensation claim under such Act, if the injured employee is suffering or suffered from one of specified cancers and received ionizing radiation of a specified amount while employed at a DNF, or was employed for five years or more in a facility or building where radioactive materials were stored, handled, processed, or disposed of, then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the disease is work-connected for purposes of coverage under such Act. Excludes certain persons covered by Federal workers compensation provisions from this Act. Provides for the handling of pending and prior claims. Directs the Secretary of Energy to provide for reinsurance for former Department employees who received such ionizing radiation while so employed or who worked for five years or more in a facility which regularly stored, processed, handled, or disposed of radioactive materials. Requires such reinsurance to cover all reasonable expenses for certain health-care services incurred above a specified dollar-amount. Directs the Secretary to develop a plan for restructuring of the work force of Department DNFs. Outlines principles to be included in such restructuring plan, including placing a high priority on retraining current employees for jobs in cleanup and decommissioning."
