    "text": "Rural Telecommunications Opportunity Act of 1992 - Directs the Administrator of the Rural Development Administration to prepare annual reports which: (1) list rural areas in each State that will have advanced telecommunications capability in place within two years, together with the reasons for arriving at such determination; and (2) rank such rural areas in the order in which the Administrator desires data processing (or other telecommunications intensive) (DP) firms to locate in such areas, based on specified projections. Provides a formula for the determination of the number of rural areas to be included on each State's list. Directs the Administrator to provide a copy of each such report to each Federal agency that is considering relocating a DP operation to a new address. Requires each Federal agency, in considering such a relocation, to: (1) select from the list one or more areas considered to best meet the agency's DP needs; and (2) perform a comparative analysis of the costs and benefits of relocation. Requires a Federal agency to report the reasons for a decision to relocate to an area not on the list to specified congressional committees and to the Administrators of the Rural Electrification Administration and the General Services Administration."
