    "text": "Department of Defense Environmental Scholarship, Fellowship and Training Assistance Programs Act - Directs the Secretary of Defense to conduct scholarship, fellowship, and training assistance programs (programs) to enable individuals to qualify for employment in the field of environmental restoration and waste management (ERWM) in the Department of Defense (DOD). Outlines eligibility requirements for participation in such programs, including: (1) acceptance for or current enrollment as a full-time student in an institution of higher education (for the scholarship and fellowship program) or in a vocational school (for the training assistance program); (2) the pursuit of a program of education that leads to a higher education degree in a qualifying field (for the scholarship and fellowship program) or an appropriate degree or certificate after completion of training in a qualifying field (for the training assistance program); (3) signing an agreement; and (4) being a citizen, national, or lawfully admitted alien of the United States. Outlines agreement requirements, including that the individual: (1) complete all required education or training; (2) upon completion, serve as a full-time employee of the Department of Energy in an ERWM position for 12 months for each school year in which a scholarship, a fellowship, or training assistance was provided; and (3) repay to the United States the total amount of such assistance if such individual does not comply with any of the agreement requirements. Provides for setoff of wages for DOD employees failing to fulfill such agreement requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to waive the repayment requirements in whole or in part when they are against equity and good conscience or when they are contrary to the best interests of the United States. Directs the Secretary, when evaluating applicants for the award of a program under this Act, to give a preference to an individual who is or has been employed by DOD, its contractors, and subcontractors. Requires coordination of program benefits with student financial assistance eligibility under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Requires no less than 100 scholarships, 30 fellowships, and 300 training assistance awards to be provided in FY 1993. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on program activities and recommendations. Authorizes appropriations."
