Sets forth enforcement provisions. Requires the Commission to determine an appropriate registration fee for funding the Commission. Directs the Commission to make grants, provide technical assistance, or both, to assist States in: (1) implementing their approved boxing plans; and (2) providing for a life, accident, and health insurance fund for professional boxers and others involved in professional boxing. Requires the Commission to establish a national computer data base for the collection, storage, and retrieval of certain boxing information. Directs the Commission to enter into discussions with foreign professional boxing organizations to propose adoption of standards similar to the minimum Federal boxing standards to professional boxing matches in foreign countries. Requires the Commission to reimburse the United States for amounts appropriated to it. Prohibits the Commission from: (1) entering into contracts for the television distribution of professional boxing matches; or (2) promoting professional boxing matches or rank professional boxers. Sets forth Commission powers. Requires the Comptroller General to: (1) conduct, and to submit to the Congress, a study to recommend to the Commission an appropriate amount for its registration fee; and (2) audit annually the finances of the Commission.
