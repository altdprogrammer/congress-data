Directs the Inspector General of the Agency for International Development to report to the appropriate congressional committees: (1) recommendations for reducing the amount of such unexpended balances; and (2) comments with regard to justifications for funds not having been expended. Requires the President to deobligate and return to the Treasury any foreign economic assistance funds that, as of the end of the preceding fiscal year, have been obligated for a period of more than three years but have not been expended. Authorizes the President, on a case-by-case basis, to waive such requirement if he reports to the appropriate congressional committees that the funds: (1) are being used for a construction project that requires more than three years to complete; or (2) have not been expended because of unforeseen circumstances."
