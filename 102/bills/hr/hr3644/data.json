Directs the Secretary to base deposits into the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account on estimated Fund income. Prohibits presidential and vice presidential candidates from receiving Fund assistance without a certification that any television commercial prepared or distributed by such candidate will readily permit closed captioning of the commercial's oral content by way of a specified broadcast technology. Requires the Federal Election Commission to report to certain congressional committees updated estimates of Fund receipts, disbursements, and balances within seven calendar days after the monthly due date for Presidential candidate submissions for primary matching fund certifications."
