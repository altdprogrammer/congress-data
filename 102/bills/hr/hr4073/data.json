    "text": "Emergency Community Development Act of 1992 - Title I: Temporary Assistance for Community Development Activities - States that the purpose of this Act is to provide temporary assistance to State and local governments to permit them to address vital community needs and to promote the creation of jobs and economic development. Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (Secretary) to make community development grants to States, local governments, and Indian tribes. Authorizes FY 1992 appropriations, with a specified set aside for grants in Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Requires applicants to submit to the Secretary: (1) a statement of projected activities and compliance; (2) a certification of compliance with a residential antidisplacement and relocation assistance plan; and (3) compliance reports. Authorizes the General Accounting Office to audit grantees. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) environmental responsibilities; and (2) protection of individuals engaging in nonviolent civil rights demonstrations. Sets forth the following eligible activities under this title: (1) acquisition of real property; (2) construction of public works and facilities; (3) clearance and rehabilitation of buildings and improvements; (4) provision of public services and housing (limited to not more than 25 percent of assistance provided under this title); (5) reallocation assistance; (6) accessibility projects for elderly and handicapped persons; (7) services for high-risk youth; and (8) administrative expenses. Sets aside one percent of grant funds for Indian tribes. Allocates: (1) 70 percent of the remaining funds for metropolitan cities and urban counties (entitlement areas); and (2) 30 percent to States for nonentitlement areas. Computes assistance allocations upon comparisons of population, extent of poverty, and housing overcrowding, or extent of poverty, housing age, and growth lag (replaced by population in nonentitlement areas). Sets forth allocation criteria for individual entitlement communities and States. Provides that no person shall be discriminated against on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, or sex under any activity funded under this title. Sets forth enforcement provisions by the Governor, the Secretary, or the Attorney General. Requires the payment of wages in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act for construction activities under this title, except for certain residential rehabilitation work. Establishes noncompliance sanctions, including reduction or termination of payment and civil action by the Attorney General. Authorizes interstate agreements in support of community development planning and programs. Directs the Secretary to issue implementing regulations within 45 days of enactment of this Act. Title II: Housing Programs - Authorizes additional FY 1992 appropriations for public housing vacancy reductions. Authorizes the use of funds for assessment team travel and administrative costs.

Amends the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 to require the Secretary to review within 30 days the management improvement and operating plan under such program. Title III: Single Famiy Mortgage Insurance - Amends the National Housing Act to prohibit the Secretary from limiting the amount of financed closing costs under the single family mortgage insurance program. Directs the Secretary to establish and collect (upon execution of the refinancing) a single premium for refinanced Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgages originally executed before July 1, 1991, and covering the same property as the original mortgage. Amends the National Housing Act to permit the Secretary to decrease insurance premium charges.

Increases FY 1992 budget authority for rural elderly and low-income rental housing. Authorizes appropriations for loan obligation costs. Amends the Housing Act of 1949 to prohibit the Secretary of Agriculture, in making such loans, from: (1) refusing to make a loan because the housing is in an excessively remote area; and (2) giving preference because a project is in an area providing essential services (such as postal, health, food, or school services). Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to coordinate processing of rural rental loan applications with other rental assistance with respect to housing units in the same project. Increases FY 1992 budget authority for: (1) housing for rural homeless and migrant farmworkers; and (2) rental assistance payment contracts.
