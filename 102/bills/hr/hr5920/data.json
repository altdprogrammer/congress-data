    "text": "Establishes an 18-month moratorium on the application of the following regulations to public water systems serving fewer than 10,500 individuals: (1) national primary drinking water regulations for lead and copper; (2) Phase II drinking water regulations for 26 synthetic organic chemicals and seven inorganic chemicals; and (3) Phase V drinking water regulations for 18 synthetic organic chemicals and five inorganic chemicals. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to report to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on potential barriers faced by small- and medium-sized public water systems in complying with such regulations. Provides for application of such regulations to systems subject to the moratorium if necessary to protect human health."
