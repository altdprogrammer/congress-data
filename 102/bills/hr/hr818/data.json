Requires an individual, in order to be eligible for the Program, to be accepted for enrollment or enrolled as a full-time student at a qualifying accredited school in a course of post-baccalaureate education or training that is approved by the Secretary and that leads toward completion of a degree in psychiatric nursing, psychology, social work, or psychiatry. Provides a full scholarship for qualifying individuals. Requires each participant receiving such a scholarship to provide service in the clinical practice of such participant's profession as a full-time employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs for a period of 18 months for each academic year for which a scholarship is provided. Authorizes the participant to complete one-half of such required service in a public health facility located in an economically depressed area. Establishes the liability to the United States on a pro rata basis of a participant who fails to meet the required period of service."
