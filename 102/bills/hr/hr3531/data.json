Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 to: (1) repeal the 69 percent surcharge on all Office fees; and (2) require the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks (Commissioner) to establish such surcharges (to meet deficit reduction goals) for FY 1991 through FY 1995. Allows appropriations to remain available until expended. Amends Federal patent law to direct the Secretary of Commerce to furnish certain congressional committees with a financial status report on Office activities. Directs the Commissioner to charge specified patent fees. Authorizes the Commissioner to adjust such fees annually to reflect the Consumer Price Index. Requires the Commissioner to maintain, for use by the public, collections of United States patents, foreign patent documents, and United States trademark registrations. Prohibits the imposition of fees directly for use of either the collections, or for use of the public patent or trademark search rooms or libraries. Authorizes the Commissioner to establish reasonable fees for public access to the Office's automated search systems. Requires the Commissioner to submit an annual status report to the Congress on the Office's automated search systems and upon public access to such systems. Permits the Commissioner to charge reasonable fees for such access. Prohibits the Commissioner from entering into exchange agreements with respect to automatic data processing resources during FY 1992. Exempts from such prohibition agreements relating to data for automation programs entered into with an international entity or foreign government. Authorizes the Commissioner to indemnify Office personnel who participated in the Office's Law School Tuition Assistance Program against tax liability incurred as a result of program payments made to law schools in specified tax years. Includes among the Commissioner's duties the authority to identify, assess, and forecast the technology of patented inventions and their utility to industry. Requires the Comptroller General to report to certain congressional committees at least once every five years (currently annually) on the manner in which agencies implement certain patent rights in inventions made with Federal assistance. Directs the Commissioner to: (1) establish a test program to disseminate certain patent information; and (2) report to the Congress on its implementation within a certain deadline."
