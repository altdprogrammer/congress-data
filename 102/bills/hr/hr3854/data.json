    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to treat produced water which is associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil or natural gas and which meets hazardous waste criteria as a hazardous waste for purposes of such Act. Defines \"produced water\" as water brought up from the hydrocarbon strata during the extraction of oil and gas that may include formation or injection water and any chemicals added downhole or during the oil-water separation process. Makes regulation under this Act inapplicable to produced water regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act or the Clean Water Act. Prohibits the use of produced water for dust suppression or road treatment."
