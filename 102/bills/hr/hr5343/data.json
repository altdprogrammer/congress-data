Repeals section 107 of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991. Makes the labeling amendments under this Act effective as of February 14, 1994. (This was the effective date under section 107 of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991.) States that such amendments shall not: (1) apply to products with labels printed prior to such date; (2) apply to unit pricing, advertising, recipe programs, nutrition labeling, or other general pricing information; and (3) be construed to require package size changes."
