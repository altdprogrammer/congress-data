    "date": "1992-07-08", 
    "text": "International Development, Trade, and Finance Act of 1992 - Title I: International Monetary Fund - Amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to authorize the U.S. Governor of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to: (1) consent to an increase in the U.S. quota in the IMF; and (2) accept the amendments to the Articles of Agreement of the IMF proposed in resolution 45-3 of the IMF's Board of Governors. Appropriates a specified amount for such increase. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the IMF to approve the IMF's pledge to sell a specified amount of the IMF's gold to restore the resources of the Reserve Account of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility Trust to meet obligations to lenders who have made loans to the Trust for financing programs of members who are in arrears to the IMF. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) encouragement should be given to the efforts being made to address the political and economic problems of nations making the transition to more open political and economic systems; (2) consideration should be given to developing relationships between such nations, the IMF, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), and other international financial institutions as part of assisting such nations in making such transitions; (3) continued U.S. support for the utilization of the resources of such institutions should take into consideration the efforts of such nations to move toward more open economic and political systems; and (4) encouragement should be given to the efforts of such nations to promote free enterprise, private property rights, stable legal and monetary systems, and open trading systems. Requires the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the IMF to encourage the IMF to adopt procedures for the publication of economic reviews of the major industrialized nations and other commentary, as appropriate. Expresses the sense of the Congress that procedures should be instituted to review the activities of the IMF and the World Bank for purposes of coordinating the international economic activities of international financial institutions at the Board, management, and staff levels. Directs the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the IMF to: (1) advocate specified actions concerning poverty alleviation and policy framework papers; and (2) urge renewal of debt and debt service reduction programs.

Requires the U.S. Executive Directors of the IMF and the World Bank to oppose loans to a borrowing country unless the IMF has certified that military spending by such country is consistent with sustainable, long-term economic growth. Waives such restriction if the Secretary determines that the country is confronted with a military threat which justifies such level of military spending, the country has made commitments to reduce the level of such spending to a level consistent with such growth, or the country faces exceptional short-term liquidity needs which require bridge financing but not long-term development lending. Supports U.S. participation in a currency stabilization fund for the independent states that have replaced the Soviet Union. Directs the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the IMF to urge the IMF to study the need for and feasibility of a currency stabilization fund for the Ukraine and to make recommendations for the economic and policy conditions required for the success of such a fund.

Authorizes the U.S. Governor of the Corporation to: (1) vote in favor of any increase in the Corporation's capital stock that may be needed to accommodate the requirements of such states; and (2) agree to amendments to the Corporation's Articles of Agreement to increase the votes needed to increase the capital stock and to amend the Articles of Agreement. Authorizes the U.S. Governor of the Corporation to vote for the creation of a trust fund to pay the costs of consultants to facilitate projects to raise the standard of living in developing countries by developing capital markets, privatizing public enterprises, and developing private businesses. Reserves 90 percent of the fund for consultants who are U.S. citizens and businesses and joint ventures owned or controlled by such citizens. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle B: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development - Amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to require the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the World Bank to advocate specified measures to alleviate poverty.

Directs the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the Bank to urge: (1) renewal of debt and debt service reduction programs; (2) the establishment or continuation of a program to provide technical assistance to the Baltic States and the Soviet Union in support of democratic reforms, human rights, the rule of law, and market-oriented reforms; and (3) the coordination of such program with the programs of other donors. Defines \"Soviet Union\" as any successor states to the Soviet Union. Requires the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the Bank to urge the Bank to create two trust funds to pay the costs of consultants to facilitate projects to raise the standard of living in developing countries through the use of state-of-the-art goods and services. Reserves 90 percent of each fund for consultants who are U.S. citizens and businesses or joint ventures owned or controlled by such citizens.

Authorizes appropriations. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Global Environmental Facility should support environmental activities agreed to by the participants in the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development of June 1992 and expand its scope to new program areas consistent with the principles agreed to by such participants. Amends the International Financial Institutions Act to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to report to the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the progress made by the multilateral development banks in achieving objectives concerning debt-for-nature exchanges and lending for the environment.
