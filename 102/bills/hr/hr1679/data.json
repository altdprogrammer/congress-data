    "text": "Fish Habitat Conservation Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), to begin identifying and acquiring lands, waters, and interests in lands and waters that are appropriate for inclusion in the National Wildlife Refuge System for the purpose of protecting fish habitat. Directs the Secretary, in establishing land acquisition priorities for the Service, to give equal consideration to fish habitat as is given to endangered species habitat and migratory bird habitat, and to modify the Land Acquisition Priorities System Application Manual accordingly. Establishes an advisory board known as the Fishery Resource Conservation Board. Requires the Board to submit to the Secretary and to the Chairman of the Board of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation recommendations identifying lands or waters that are appropriate for inclusion in the System or for acquisition by another entity for the long-term protection or enhancement of fishery resources. Amends Federal law (popularly known as the Sport Fish Restoration Act) to authorize the Secretary to enter into agreements with States to finance specified percentages of the costs of acquiring lands and waters identified under this Act."
