    "text": "Authorizes the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to make grants to States, State political subdivisions, and nonprofit organizations for programs that require or encourage individuals under age 16 to wear approved bicycle helmets. Specifies that, in making such grants, the Administrator shall allow grantees to use wide discretion in designing programs that effectively promote increased bicycle helmet use. Permits such grants to be used to: (1) enforce a law that requires individuals under age 16 to wear approved bicycle helmets; (2) assist individuals (particularly low income individuals) under age 16 to acquire such helmets; (3) develop and administer a program to educate individuals under age 16 and their families on the importance of wearing approved bicycle helments; or (4) carry out any combination of such activities. Defines \"approved bicycle helmet\" to mean a bicycle helmet which meets the testing standards of the American National Standards Institute or the Snell Memorial Institute, or which meets any other testing standard that the Consumer Product Safety Commission determines to be appropriate. Authorizes appropriations."
