    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-05-19", 
    "text": "Toll Fraud Oversight and Remedies Act of 1992 - Provides that it shall be considered unjust and unreasonable under the Communications Act of 1934 for any common carrier to assess or collect from any agency or instrumentality of State or local government (agency) any interstate or foreign toll charges for calls fraudulently made through the customer premises equipment (equipment) of such agency. Permits a carrier to assess and collect such a charge if the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) determines that such agency was negligent in the operation of its equipment or failed to provide timely notice to the carrier of the suspected fraudulent calls (but bars a carrier from assessing and collecting charges for fraudulent calls made after the carrier has received notice from such agency that meets the requirements of this Act). Allows an agency to initiate a billing review with respect to a billing statement from a carrier that contains a charge for calls that the agency believes were fraudulently made through such agency's equipment by providing timely oral or written notice to such carrier which: (1) sets forth or otherwise enables the billing carrier to identify the name of the agency or instrumentality and the phone number to which the charge was billed; (2) indicates the agency's belief that the statement contains a charge for calls that were fraudulently made through such agency's equipment; and (3) sets forth the reasons for such agency's belief that the statement contains such a charge. Sets forth time limits for: (1) the agency's submission of notice; and (2) the carrier's response to such notice. Directs the FCC to prescribe regulations to provide an expedited review of any complaint from an agency that it did not obtain an appropriate correction in its account pursuant to this Act. Bars a common carrier from: (1) terminating provision of services to such agency pending resolution of the dispute; and (2) taking action to collect any part of the amount in dispute until the carrier has sent a written explanation to the agency, after having conducted an investigation, within a specified time frame, setting forth why the carrier believes the agency's account was correctly shown in the statement and, upon request, providing copies of documentary evidence of such agency's indebtedness. Sets forth additional requirements regarding collections. Directs the FCC to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to establish standards relating to the prevention of toll fraud through the use of equipment, including private branch exchanges."
