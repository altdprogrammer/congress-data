Sets forth specified grant requirements. Sets at 90 percent for the first year, 80 percent the second year, and 75 percent the third year the Federal share of costs for such program. Requires the Secretary to make such grants on a competitive and formula basis. Requires specified reports. Authorizes appropriations."
