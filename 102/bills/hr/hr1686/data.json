    "text": "Foreign Service Grievance Proceedings Act of 1991 - Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to include under the definition of grievance any discrimination prohibited under: (1) the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (title VII provisions relating to Federal Government employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin); (2) the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (provisions relating to sex discrimination in employment); (3) the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (provisions relating to employment of the handicapped); (4) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (provisions relating to age discrimination in Federal employment); or (5) any rule, regulation, or policy directive prescribed under any such provision. Sets a special limitation on the filing of any such grievance by a Foreign Service employee based on such nondiscrimination provisions. Requires the Foreign Service Grievance Board, with respect to such grievances based on such nondiscrimination provisions, to apply the substantive law that would be applied by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission if a request for review of the alleged discrimination had been filed with that commission. Sets forth procedures for judicial review of such Foreign Service employee grievances based on such nondiscrimination provisions."
