(Currently such recommendations are included in the Federal budget.) Prohibits the House of Representatives and the Senate from considering any bill or joint resolution carrying an appropriation for compensation of Members of Congress for any fiscal year if it carries an appropriation, or a limitation of appropriations, for any other purpose. Requires a recorded vote on such bill or resolution."
