Requires all (Federal or State licensed) warehouses with a central filing system to deliver stored cotton to the registered owner upon request. States that: (1) a holder of an electronic cotton warehouse receipt shall be treated as being in possession of the warehouse receipt under Federal or State law; and (2) such provision shall apply to electronic receipts from all (Federal or State licensed) warehouses."
