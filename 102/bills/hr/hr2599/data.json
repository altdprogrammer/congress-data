Amends the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act to: (1) provide that proposed changes in the quantity of any material to be stockpiled shall take effect 30 days after notification to the Congress; (2) revise the required period of congressional notification before the President may implement certain stockpile actions or changes; (3) repeal a provision prohibiting a disposal which would result in an unobligated balance in the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund (the Fund) in excess of $100,000,000; (4) make appropriations authorized for disposal actions available until expended; (5) authorize the President to rotate materials in the NDS in order to prevent technological obsolescence; (6) allow moneys in the Fund to be used for the maintenance and disposal of strategic and critical materials; (7) change from semiannually to annually the frequency of reports required from the President on operations under such Act; (8) change from annually to semiannually the frequency of reports required from the Secretary of Defense on stockpile requirements; and (9) delete a provision prohibiting a disposal of any stockpiled material specifically authorized by law during a period of vacancy in the position of the NDS Manager."
