    "text": "Amends the National Labor Relations Act to make it an unfair labor practice for an employer to hire or threaten to hire permanent replacement workers during the first eight weeks of an economic strike but provides that this does not prohibit an employer from permanently replacing an employee who engages in violence or threats of violence or who secures employment equivalent to that held prior to such strike. Extends from 12 months to 18 months the period after the commencement of an economic strike during which striking employees who are not entitled to reinstatement are eligible to vote in an election for a collective bargaining representative. Makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to call for an economic strike unless a simple majority of the employees voting in the bargaining units vote by secret ballot to conduct such strike. Declares the sense of the Congress that the National Labor Relations Board should give first priority and use the utmost speed to process unfair labor practice cases that involve the reinstatement of strikers who have been permanently replaced."
