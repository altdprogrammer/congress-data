    "text": "Interstate Municipal Waste Transportation Act of 1991 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit the importation of municipal waste into a State from another State for purposes of disposal in a facility which is not in compliance with a permit or other prior approval or which has not been classified as a sanitary landfill. Authorizes States to enact and enforce laws that: (1) impose bans or restrictions on the treatment or disposal of municipal waste generated in a nonadjacent State; and (2) impose and collect fees in connection with treatment or disposal of such waste. Sets forth further requirements for fees and restrictions. Permits States to enact and enforce laws setting a maximum amount of municipal waste that may be imported annually from an adjacent State at the lesser of the following amounts: (1) the amount established by conditions of contracts for disposal in the State that are in existence, and are consistent with State permit authorizations in effect, on March 11, 1992; or (2) the average daily amount of municipal waste actually imported from adjacent States under contract terms, or otherwise, during the year prior to such date. Terminates the authority to enact State laws (and any laws enacted) pursuant to this Act on September 30, 1995."
