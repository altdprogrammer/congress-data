Authorizes use of a limited amount from the Panama Canal Revolving Fund for administrative expenses, limiting reception and representation expenses of the Board, Secretary, and Administrator of the Commission. Authorizes the purchase of passenger motor vehicles. Modifies requirements regarding the use of Commission funds for health care services for certain individuals. Prohibits the Commission from implementing a toll rate greater than a specified percentage over the toll rate in effect on a specified date. Amends the Panama Canal Act of 1979 to require that tolls for certain types of vessels be based on the Panama Canal net ton, or its equivalency (currently, on net vessel tons of one hundred cubic feet each of actual earning capacity)."
