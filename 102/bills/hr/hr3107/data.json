Directs the FCC to establish regulations for: (1) implementing programs pursuant to this Act that will govern such companies and their affiliates; (2) verifying and determining the eligibility of business enterprises that are owned by minorities and women for procurement contracts; (3) requiring company outreach programs to inform and recruit such enterprises to apply for such contracts; and (4) enforcing this Act. Allows the FCC to waive the provisions set forth above if procurement from such enterprises results in undue hardship or unreasonable expense to a regional holding company. Provides sanctions for the: (1) false representation of a business as a business enterprise owned by minorities or women; and (2) false implementation by holding companies of the programs to be implemented pursuant to this Act. Prohibits discrimination against such qualified business enterprises in procuring contracts from telephone utilities. Allows such enterprises to bring civil actions in appropriate U.S. district courts against any regional holding company which is resisting full compliance with this Act."
