Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to place the following environmental restriction on lands conveyed and leased and rights-of-way granted under the authority of such Act. Requires State approval, through enactment of a State law approving such specific use of such land, before any such land may be used to facilitate construction or development of any facility for management of radioactive or other waste generated outside of the State in which such lands are located. (Includes storage, treatment, incinceration, disposal, or any other form of management of such waste, under such restriction.)"
