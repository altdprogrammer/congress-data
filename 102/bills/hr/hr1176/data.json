Designates such funds as emergency requirements pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act). Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to authorize the Secretary of State to purchase special purpose passenger motor vehicles without regard to price limitations. Declares that the Congress takes note of the efforts of the President and the Secretary to encourage U.S. allies to assist financially in the effort to liberate Kuwait. Calls on the President and the Secretary to ensure that the burdensharing promises made by the allies are fulfilled."
