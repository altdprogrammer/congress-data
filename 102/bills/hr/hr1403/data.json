Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) apportion funds authorized for expenditure under the program according to specified guidelines based on population; and (2) require that projects be selected by the State highway department of each State. Allows up to 25 percent of the amount apportioned in a fiscal year to a State under the program to be transferred for other specified uses if requested by the State highway department and approved by the Governor of such State and the Secretary as being in the public interest. Directs the Secretary to set aside $300,000,000 for discretionary projects. Sets forth criteria which must be met before a State may obtain funding. Specifies factors which the Secretary shall consider in selecting projects, including: (1) project cost; (2) traffic congestion levels; (3) importance of a project to a congestion relief planning effort; and (4) impact of a project on economic development. Specifies that the Federal share shall not exceed 50 percent of the cost of any project. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the use of such funds for public transportation, railway-highway crossings, carpool and vanpool projects, bicycle transportation, pedestrian walkways, and research and planning."
