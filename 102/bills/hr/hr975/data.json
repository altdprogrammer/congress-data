    "text": "Long Distance Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 - Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to submit to the Congress a report on its efforts to prevent unauthorized changes in telephone customer selections of long distance carriers, including: (1) an analysis of the procedures established for customer selection of long distance carriers and any defects in such procedures which permit fraudulent changes in such selections; (2) a description of the extent to which such unauthorized changes have occurred; (3) a statement of the remedies which the FCC has applied to abate and prevent such occurrences; and (4) an explanation of the failure by the FCC to conduct and complete rulemaking procedures to implement requirements that will abate and prevent such occurrences. Directs the FCC to prescribe regulations to require local exchange carriers to submit periodic reports (carrier reports) to the FCC on customer complaints alleging fraudulent changes in customer selections, including: (1) the total number of customer complaints alleging cases of unauthorized switching practices, listed by State and zip code, and identified by long distance telephone carrier; (2) the names and addresses of such long distance carriers, or their sales or marketing representatives, which engage in unauthorized switching practices; (3) a description of the false, misleading, or deceptive sales and marketing techniques made in an attempt to induce long distance telephone customers to change their long distance telephone carrier; (4) an estimate of total damages incurred by such customers from false, misleading, or deceptive sales and marketing practices; and (5) the corrective methods taken by such long distance carriers to avoid fraudulent activities. Requires the FCC to annually submit to the Congress a summary and analysis of carrier reports submitted to it."
