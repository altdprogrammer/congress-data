Prohibits any action from being taken to compel such sale or evict such individual within 120 days after the commencement of such proceeding if the area agency, within 60 days of receiving notice, determines that more time is needed to prevent, or provide social services to such individual in anticipation of, such sale or eviction. Requires the area agency, within 60 days of receiving notice, to consult with the older individual: (1) explaining to such individual his or her situation; (2) identifying Federal, State, or local assistance that may be available to delay or prevent such sale or eviction; (3) identifying alternative housing that may be available if such sale or eviction occurs; and (4) determining whether such individual is capable of understanding his or her situation and, if not, notifying an appropriate social service agency of such individual's need for assistance."
