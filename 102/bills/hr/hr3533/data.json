Requires a foreign person who becomes a five percent shareholder in a U.S. cultural business enterprise, or a corporation which directly or indirectly holds a national landmark, to register such investment with the Chairman of the corporation. Directs the Chairman to apply rules similar to those provided by this Act with respect to an entity that is not a corporation."
