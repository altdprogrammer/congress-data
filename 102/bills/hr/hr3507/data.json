    "text": "American Industrial Quality and Training Act of 1991 - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, through the Technology Administration, to make competitve matching grants to establish and operate American workforce quality partnership programs for workforce training consortia of industry and higher education institutions. Requires such programs to establish partnerships between one or more technology-based or manufacturing sector firms and a local community or technical college to train the industrial partners' employees at all organizational levels through both workplace and classroom training programs. Requires each partnership to establish an advisory board. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to make competitive grants to develop and operate youth technical apprenticeship programs. Gives special consideration to applications providing for non-Federal contributions. Provides, also, for planning grants for such programs. Requires each grant recipient to establish an advisory board. Directs the Secretary of Labor, together with other appropriate entities, to establish and maintain a clearinghouse of youth apprenticeship programs in the United States. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make competitive matching grants to States for statewide technical education and training networks to develop plans or strategies to establish statewide systems to provide technical, technician, or technological skills and education by building upon Federal, State, and local programs through various methods. Requires State Governors to submit evaluation reports within three years of award of such grants. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Labor, in conjunction with the Small Business Administration and other relevant agencies, to compile information and statistics on the total annual expenditure of U.S. industry on formal worker training programs, quantity of training, and other relevant worker training information, by firm size, sector, industry, job classification, and purpose of training (as well as any other available and appropriate data such as international comparative data). Requires a biennial report to the Congress on such information in a useful format. Requires making such information available to U.S. industry. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Education, in conjunction with the Secretaries of Labor and of Commerce, to report to the Congress on the feasibility of encouraging adoption of principles of total quality management to improve the quality and relevance of primary, secondary, and postsecondary education, through the estabishment of an award comparable to the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award."
