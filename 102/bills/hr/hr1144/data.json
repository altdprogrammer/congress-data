Authorizes the Secretary of Education to designate from ten to 100 institutions of higher education that may use a portion of their work-study funds allocations to establish such a pilot program to test the feasibility of using such funds to provide incentives to eligible college students to engage in mentor activities to help disadvantaged youths who are at risk of dropping out of elementary or secondary school. Directs the Secretary to report an evaluation of such program to the Congress within three years."
