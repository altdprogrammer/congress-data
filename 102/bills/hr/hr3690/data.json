Provides that the lowest acceptable domestic product prices shall be considered unreasonable if they exceed the lowest acceptable foreign prices by more than: (1) six percent in the case of a domestic offer from a large business that is not a labor surplus area concern; or (2) 15 percent in the case of a domestic offer from a small business or labor surplus area concern. Terminates such spending requirements after: (1) three years; or (2) specified shorter periods following publication of an unemployment rate of less than five percent for the preceding quarter or of a stable or increasing GNP for two consecutive quarters."
