    "text": "Uranium Enrichment Reorganization Act - Title I: United States Uranium Enrichment Corporation - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to establish the United States Uranium Enrichment Corporation as a wholly-owned Government corporation to conduct uranium marketing and enrichment activities as a commercial, profitable, self-financing enterprise. Provides for a Board of Directors appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Prescribes guidelines for: (1) certain property transfers from the Department of Energy; and (2) the Corporation's capital structure, financing, pricing policies, and user charges for decommissioning, decontamination, and remedial activities. Requires the Corporation to prepare an annual status report for the President and the Congress. Prescribes licensing and taxation guidelines for the Corporation. Sets guidelines for payments in lieu of taxes by the Corporation to States and local governments. Directs the Board to make recommendations to the President regarding the transfer of its functions and assets to private ownership. Requires congressional approval before the Corporation may be sold and its functions transferred. Applies Federal, State, and local environmental and occupational safety and health laws to the Corporation as though it were privately owned. Declares that the Corporation receipts and disbursements shall: (1) not be included in the totals of the President's budget or the congressional budget; (2) be exempt from any general budget limitation imposed by statute on expenditures and net lending (budget outlays) of the U.S. Government; and (3) be exempt from any order issued under a specified section of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act). Requires the Corporation to undertake decontamination and decommissioning activities at the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant, Tennessee. Establishes the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund to cover the Corporation's decommissioning and decontamination expenses, including remedial action activities. Requires the Corporation to study and report to the Congress its recommendations for cost effective decontamination, decommissioning, and remedial action of its facilities. Title II: Remedial Action for Active Processing Sites - Declares that the costs of decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and remedial action at an active uranium or thorium processing site shall be borne by persons licensed under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for any activity at such site which results in the production of byproduct material. Requires the Secretary to reimburse such licensees annually for the portion of such costs that are: (1) attributable to tailings generated as an incident of sales to the United States; and (2) incurred no later than December 31, 2002. Authorizes appropriations."
