    "text": "Child Support Enforcement Improvements Act of 1991 - Makes depository institutions not liable under any Federal or State law to any person for disclosing any financial record of an individual to a State child support enforcement agency attempting to establish, modify, or enforce a child support obligation of such individual. Prohibits such an agency from disclosing such a record for any other purpose and provides for civil damages for unauthorized disclosures. Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to permit credit reporting agencies to grant access to certain consumer reports to a State child support enforcement agency that is seeking to establish, modify, or enforce a child support obligation against the consumer. Amends the Social Security Act to revise requirements for State statutorily prescribed procedures to improve the effectiveness of child support enforcement. Requires such procedures to require, if a State court or administrative agency issues a support order requiring an absent parent to obtain medical insurance coverage for one or more children of a custodial parent, that the absent parent: (1) within 30 days after receiving notice of such order, provide to the custodial parent written documentation that such insurance coverage has been obtained or applied for; (2) upon failure to apply for, obtain, or maintain such coverage, be liable for any reasonable and necessary health or dental expenses, including medical insurance premiums of the child or children incurred by the custodial parent. Sets forth requirements for the insurer if such coverage is obtained. Includes under the incentive payments program any dependent medical insurance coverage which is provided due to the successful application of such enforcement procedures. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to study, and report to specified congressional committees how the successful efforts of States in enforcing obligations of absent parents to pay (and obtain medical insurance coverage with respect to) health and dental expenses of children should be rewarded through an incentive payments program. Amends Social Security Act provisions for collection of past-due child support from Federal tax refunds to require: (1) any State that has a centralized system for collection, recording, and distribution of child support to use such system to verify the existence of all past-due child support (in addition to other support verified by the system); and (2) any State that does not have such a system to make a good faith effort to collect all such past-due child support. Directs the Office of Child Support Enforcement of the Department of HHS to report to the Congress annually on State compliance with specified standards establishing time limits within which the State must respond to requests to provide certain child support assistance, under the Social Security Act. Requires States to assess a $1,000 penalty against any employer who fails to make a payment of withheld wages to pay child support obligations of an employee within the ten-day period required under the Social Security Act. Requires States to expend all such penalties collected for State plan operation within a specified period. Allows delay in such additional requirements if State legislation is required. Directs the Office of Child Support Enforcement of the Department of HHS to develop a national parent locator network which would build on the comprehensive statewide child support enforcement systems and which would allow States to carry on specified parent locator activities."
