    "text": "Television and Radio Broadcast Bulk Time Sale Act of 1991 - Directs the Federal Communications Commission to commence a proceeding to prescribe rules that govern bulk time sale agreements (BTSAs). Specifies that such rules shall: (1) prescribe definitions distinguishing BTSAs from agreements between independently operated affiliates of network organizations; (2) require that all BTSAs be filed with the FCC, be available for public inspection and stipulate that the licensee has the right and obligation to preempt programming provided under such agreement when in the public interest; (3) authorize a licensee to terminate a BTSA whenever the licensee concludes that such agreement is no longer consistent with its responsibilities as an FCC licensee; (4) prohibit a licensee from entering into, and require a licensee to terminate, a BTSA with any person who is not qualified to be licensed by the FCC to operate that station; (5) establish a maximum amount of time that can be transferred by a licensee (up to 25 percent of the amount of time that a station operates) by means of BTSAs; (6) establish a maximum amount of time that can be transferred to any programmer or group of programmers (up to ten percent of operating time) by means of BTSAs; (7) prohibit a licensee from entering into, and require a licensee to terminate, any BTSA with a programmer that has an attributable interest in an application to transfer control of the station pending with the FCC; (8) establish procedures for the effective continued oversight and enforcement of FCC rules governing BTSAs; (9) provide for the expeditious handling of complaints or allegations of violations of FCC rules; and (10) establish procedures whereby licensees can petition the FCC for temporary permission to exceed the maximum time amounts subject to specified requirements (such as giving interested parties an opportunity to comment on the effect that such permission could have on diversity and competition within the local market and providing for periodic review of the decision permitting the licensee to exceed the established limitations). Makes this Act applicable to BTSAs entered into before or after its enactment. Makes provisions with respect to the prohibition or termination of BTSAs with unqualified individuals and the establishment of maximum time amounts that can be transferred by licensees inapplicable with respect to any radio station that enters into BTSAs with programmers that are not related, that provide diverse sources of programming material, and that add significantly to the ethnic and other diversity that is available in that radio market."
