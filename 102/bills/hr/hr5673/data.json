    "text": "Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Reauthorization Act of 1992 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Administrator of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research to provide training grants in the field of health services research. Establishes an information center on health services research and selected technology assessments and clinical practice guidelines at the National Library of Medicine. Directs the Administrator to establish an annual list of health care technology assessments under consideration by the Agency and to develop criteria for determining the priority of assessments. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to, or enter into cooperative agreements with, appropriate entities to conduct assessments of experimental, emerging, existing, or potentially outmoded health care technologies and for related activities. Requires the Administrator to study and report to specified congressional committees on methods for collecting and analyzing data to be used in generating cost estimates of alternative strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, or management of a disease or health condition to be included in guideline documents. Requires the Administrator to carry out provisions relating to the Office of the Forum for Quality and Effectiveness through the Director of the Office. Limits the percentage of members of scientific and technical review groups (regarding applications for a grant, cooperative agreement, or contract under provisions relating to the Agency) who may be U.S. officers and employees. (Current law prohibits such officers and employees from serving as members of those groups.) Revises requirements regarding which groups review which proposals. Authorizes the Administrator to tabulate and analyze statistics and prepare studies at the request of a public or nonprofit entity, with the entity paying costs. Sets forth requirements for the selection of individuals to serve on panels for the development and review of health care guidelines and standards. Requires the Administrator to study and report to specified congressional committees on the process used to develop guidelines, standards, and review criteria. Directs the Administrator to ensure that a set of guidelines, standards, performance measures, and review criteria are developed that address the prevention of no fewer than three conditions that account for significant national health expenditures. Requires evaluations that are conducted of the effect of guidelines on the clinical practice of medicine to be developed prior to the completion of the guidelines so that baseline data concerning practice patterns and health care costs may be obtained as part of such evaluations. Directs the Administrator, with respect to grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts for projects, to define the circumstances that constitute financial conflicts of interest and the actions to be taken in response to such conflicts. Extends the authorization of appropriations for Agency programs and authorizes appropriations for specified activities under this Act."
