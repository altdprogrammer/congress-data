    "text": "Indian Agricultural Resources Management Act of 1992 - Title I: General Provisions - States that existing Federal laws do not sufficiently assure the adequate and necessary trust management of Indian rangelands and farmlands. Sets forth findings, purposes, and definitions. Title II: Rangeland and Farmland Enhancement - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage Indian rangelands and farmlands, using state-of-the-art technology, either directly or through cooperative agreements, self-determination contracts, and grants under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Enumerates management conservation, agricultural production, agribusiness, leasing, and other objectives. Requires a reservation-by-reservation resource management planning program. Requires compliance with tribal laws pertaining to Indian agricultural lands. Establishes a task force to develop a comparative analysis of Federal investment and management efforts for Indian trust lands as compared to federally owned lands managed by other Federal agencies. Authorizes the Secretary to negotiate and lease highly fractionated undivided heirship lands to reduce idle acreage. Title III: Education in Agriculture and Natural Resource Management - Requires the establishment, in the Bureau of Indian Affairs or elsewhere, of at least 20 natural resources intern positions for Indians and Alaska Native students. Requires establishment of a cooperative education program for employment of Indian and Alaska Native students in Federal professional natural resource-related positions. Provides financial assistance under the program. Directs the creation of scholarships, outreach programs, postgraduate recruitment programs, education and training programs, and internships to attract and train Indians and Alaska Natives in careers in Indian natural resources management. Title IV: Authorization of Appropriations - Authorizes appropriations. Title V: Miscellaneous - Provides for regulations and severability of this Act. Prohibits construing this Act as diminishing or expanding U.S. trust responsibility."
