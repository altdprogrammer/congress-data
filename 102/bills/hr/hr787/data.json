Extends such authority from 1992 through 1995. Requires the Secretary of Commerce, upon submission to the Congress of the report identifying priority foreign barriers to U.S. goods and services, to submit to the Congress a supplemental report identifying the trade value of the barriers and identifying those countries and practices that account for more than five percent of the annual U.S. trade deficit."
