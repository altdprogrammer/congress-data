Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue and renew certificates for a specified period of time. Allows the Secretary to approve a private nonprofit organization or State agency to be an accreditation body if it meets certain standards and provides certain assurances. Mandates standards to assure the safety and accuracy of mammograms, including regarding: (1) quality assurance and control programs; (2) radiation doses; (3) equipment used; (4) licensing, certification, and training of personnel; and (5) recordkeeping and retention. Directs the Secretary to conduct annual inspections of certified facilities. Requires, subject to waiver, 48 hours notice of inspections. Provides for: (1) directed plans of correction, on site monitoring costs payment, and civil money penalties; (2) suspension, revocation, and limitation of certificates; and (3) injunctions. Limits State inspection fees to the costs of conducting the inspections. Requires annual publication of a list of facilities convicted of fraud and abuse, false billings, or kickbacks, facilities that have had certificates revoked, suspended, or limited, and facilities that have been the subject of a sanction or other similar matters. Establishes the National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee. Mandates grants to establish surveillance systems to evaluate breast cancer screening programs. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
