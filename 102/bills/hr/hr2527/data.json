Declares that an existing organization meets the requirement that ten-percent of its coverage is provided to individuals and small groups if: (1) 50 percent of its health insurance is provided to Federal, State, and local government employees; and (2) the organization publicizes and promotes by widely accessible means the availability of health insurance to individuals and small groups. Modifies treatment of Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations with respect to reorganizations and premium stabilization reserves. Repeals the current income tax deduction available to such organizations."
