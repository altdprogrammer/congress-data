Requires the Attorney General to report to the Congress on medical malpractice liability claims arising under this subtitle. Title VI: Paperwork Reduction and Administrative Simplification - Preempts State laws that require medical or health insurance records to be maintained in written, rather than electronic form. Requires the National Health Board to ensure the confidentiality of electronic health care information and establish standardization for the electronic receipt and transmission of health plan information. Requires the Board to establish goals and time frames for: (1) the use of uniform health claims forms and identification numbers; (2) achieving uniformity in determining the liability of insurers when benefits are payable under two or more health plans; and (3) achieving uniformity in the availability of information among health plans when benefits are payable under two or more health plans.
