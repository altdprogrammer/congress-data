Establishes a schedule for human drug application and supplement fees, prescription drug establishment fees, and prescription drug product fees. Provides for the annual adjustment of such fees to reflect increases in the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers or increases in Federal pay. Authorizes the Secretary to waive or reduce fees. Prohibits the assessment of fees for a fiscal year after FY 1993 unless appropriations for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are equal or greater than such appropriations for FY 1992. Credits such fees to the appropriation account for salaries and expenses of the FDA. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1997. Provides a mechanism for collecting unpaid fees. Requires the FDA to make annual reports to the Congress on this Act. Requires the Secretary to conduct a study to evaluate whether to impose user fees to supplement appropriated funds to improve the process of reviewing applications for new animal drugs. Requires a report to specified congressional committees on the results of such study."
