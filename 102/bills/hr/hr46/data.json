Establishes six regional primaries to be held in each presidential election year. Sets the dates for such primaries. Sets requirements for voter eligibility in the primaries conducted under this Act. Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil suit in U.S. district court when there is reason to believe that a State is holding a primary in violation of this Act. Requires presidential candidates in a primary, in order to be eligible to receive payments from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, to agree to enter at least one State primary in each of the six regions and to notify the Federal Election Commission of which primaries will be entered. Authorizes appropriations."
