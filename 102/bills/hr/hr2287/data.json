Sets forth application procedures and requirements. Requires the Director to give priority to a community that: (1) provides evidence of significant substance abuse and drug-related crime; (2) proposes a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to eliminating substance abuse and crime; (3) encourages the involvement of businesses and community leaders in substance abuse and crime prevention activities; (4) demonstrates a commitment to, and a high priority for, preventing substance abuse; and (5) demonstrates support from the community and State and local agencies for efforts to eliminate substance abuse and drug-related crime.

Sets forth reporting requirements by each coalition receiving such a grant and by the Director. Authorizes appropriations."
