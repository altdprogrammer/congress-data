    "text": "Safe Drinking Water Act Alternative Compliance Procedures Act - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to direct each State to authorize waivers of monitoring requirements of the following national primary drinking water regulations for designated systems where there has been no previous use of the contaminant at issue within the State, or an area within the State: (1) Phase II regulations for 26 synthetic organic chemicals and seven inorganic chemicals; and (2) Phase V regulations for 18 synthetic organic chemicals and five inorganic chemicals. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a grant program to assist States in carrying out such waivers. Authorizes appropriations. Provides that public water systems that serve 3,300 or fewer individuals and comply with alternative testing requirements shall not be required to conduct any other testing or sampling to determine compliance with such regulations. Requires systems electing to comply with such requirements to: (1) conduct baseline testing with respect to contaminants covered by such regulations; (2) conduct a vulnerability survey with respect to water supplies to determine the potential contamination sources; (3) submit plans for testing potential contaminants and demonstrations that a contaminant source has been removed or remedied; and (4) conduct updated testing and surveys. Requires the Administrator to establish a grant program to assist small public water systems in conducting testing and surveys and developing plans. Authorizes appropriations."
