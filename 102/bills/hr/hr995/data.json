Requires that such volunteer families: (1) be determined by the State to be at risk of entering the program of aid to families with dependent children (AFDC program) under the Social Security Act; and (2) receive Federal rental assistance. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to: (1) consider all applications received from States desiring to conduct such demonstration projects; (2) approve not more than five such applications; and (3) give priority to certain types of applications. Sets forth the duties of States conducting such projects. Provides for Federal reimbursement for expenditures of approved demonstration projects. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to evaluate, by October 1, 1995, the effectiveness of the alternative administrative approaches taken by the States in such demonstration projects. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Social Security Act to provide for participation in the JOBS program of eligible volunteer families who are at risk of entering the AFDC program and who receive Federal rental assistance. Revises State plan requirements to allow such program participation, at the option of the State, beginning with FY 1995. Requires that eligible volunteer families receive payment or reimbursement from the State agency for necessary child care, transportation, and other work-related expenses. Entitles States to specified Federal payments if they elect to administer JOBS program services to such eligible volunteer families. Directs the Secretary to contract with a research organization to conduct, and report to specified congressional committees on the extent to which such provision of JOBS program services to eligible volunteer families has: (1) been cost-effective; (2) helped them avoid requiring public assistance; and (3) increased their income and employment. Makes specified funds under the Social Security Act available for such purposes."
