Allows the private industry council in any eligible area that is substantially the same as a service delivery area under the Job Training Partnership Act to petition the Governor to be designated a DEC if it meets specified requirements. Requires DECs to select projects to be assisted under the Secretary's criteria and to submit project plans and annual reports on their activities. Limits use of grant funds for administrative expenses to ten percent. Requires an eligible area to: (1) be a county or comparable general local government unit; and (2) have no more than 300,000 population, unless granted a waiver by the Secretary.

Limits a household to no more than two eligible participants. Requires testing for basic reading and writing competence prior to a job project employment. Requires that counseling and instruction be furnished to participants who fail to pass such basic competency test.

Prohibits selection of a project if an objection is filed by two DEC members appointed by the State Governor or Mayor, of the largest municipality or two appointed by the chief executives of local governments in the eligible area. Prohibits selection of DEC managers, officers, or employees or project participants on the basis of political affiliation (and limits the number of specified types of DEC members who may be from the same political party). Sets limits on job project: (1) expenses for transportation and equipment (ten percent); (2) number of supervisors (one-to-ten ratio); (3) individual workweek (32 hours); and (4) project duration (18 months). Requires project managers to submit monthly progress reports to the DEC. Requires participants to receive wages equal to the higher of: (1) the minimum wage under specified provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938; (2) the minimum wage established under the applicable State or local minimum wage law; or (3) the amount the participant receives in assistance under the State plan approved under Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or in unemployment compensation, plus ten percent of that amount. Requires that participants be furnished benefits and employment conditions comparable to those of employees in similar occupations employed by a comparable employer, but prohibits any participant from being eligible for unemployment compensation during or on the basis of project employment. Requires participants to be eligible for supportive services necessary for participation. Requires DECs to establish for the eligible area, job clubs to assist participants to prepare resumes, develop interviewing techniques, and evaluate individual job search activities. Sets forth labor standards for job projects, including appropriate conditions of employment and training and health and safety. Prohibits the use of funds for contributions on behalf of any participant to retirement systems or plans. Sets forth displacement rules. Prohibits: (1) any displacing of current employees; (2) impairing of existing contracts or collective bargaining agreements; (3) filling of openings created by related layoffs or terminations; or (4) infringing on promotional opportunities of current employees. Requires that labor organizations representing a substantial number of employees engaged in similar work or training in the same area as that proposed to be funded be given an opportunity to comment on the project proposal at least 30 days before the project is approved. Applies Davis-Bacon Act wage rules to all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors for federally assisted construction and repair work, except with respect to eligible participants in projects assisted under this Act. Sets forth nondiscrimination provisions. Requires DECs to establish and maintain evaluation files for each individual employed on a project assisted under this Act, to be made available to the participant monthly but to no other person without the participant's consent. Provides for allotments to States and substate allocations to DECs for eligible areas. Authorizes the Secretary to waive the following program requirements: (1) testing, for individuals with handicaps; (2) participant maintenance of satisfactory progress toward a high school diploma or equivalent; and (3) the 32-hour per week individual maximum for project employment (for unusual circumstances, subject to a two-thirds vote of each DEC).
