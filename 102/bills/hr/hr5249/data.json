Directs the Administrator to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the status of activities in the Gulf. Requires the Administrator to prepare an assessment of Gulf environmental quality that shall: (1) describe the existing state of knowledge concerning the Gulf's environmental quality; (2) include an inventory of relevant environmental research and monitoring programs; (3) identify gaps in knowledge and research needed for the development of the management plan; and (4) assess the environmental impact of specified types of pollution, erosion, dissolved oxygen, bacterial infection in fish, and oil spill response activities. Directs the Administrator to design a strategy for monitoring the environmental quality of the Gulf. Authorizes the Administrator to carry out the assessment and strategy by making grants to specified public and private entities. Requires the Administrator to develop a management, protection, and restoration plan for the Gulf.
