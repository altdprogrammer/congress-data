Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make the pilot visa waiver program permanent. Authorizes arriving vessels or aircraft to submit electronic passenger manifests to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Reduces the required length of time for the provision of immigration inspection and preinspection services. Changes the reporting date for the annual immigration user fee account report to the Congress."
