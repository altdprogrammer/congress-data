Prohibits the sale and redemption of trust fund assets or the expenditure of trust fund amounts for purposes other than those specified in such titles. Requires members of such trust funds' Boards of Trustees to faithfully execute their duties, but does not impose a fiduciary duty. Requires that, in consideration of the public debt limit, required investment of funds or amounts over which the Secretary of the Treasury has investment authority occur prior to the issuance of other obligations. Requires the Boards of Trustees of the trust funds to meet at least twice each year. Sets forth provisions requiring reports by the Boards of Trustees and the Managing Trustees to the Congress regarding the operation and status of the trust funds."
