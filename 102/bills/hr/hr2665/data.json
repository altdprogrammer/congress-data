Authorizes the Director of the U.S. Marshals Service to provide personnel, facilities, and other administrative services to the Association and to accept voluntary services of the Association. Specifies that no part of the income or assets of the Association shall inure to any member or officer of the Association or Director of the Board or be distributed to any such person, with exceptions for reasonable compensation or reimbursement for actual necessary expenses. Bars the Association from making loans to any Director or officer or employee of the Association, or from issuing stock or declaring or paying dividends. Specifies that the Association and any agent of the Association shall be considered an employer for purposes of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 if the Association is engaged in an industry affecting commerce and meets the minimum employee requirements set forth in such Acts. Makes it unlawful for the Association, on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability, to: (1) fail or refuse to accept an individual into membership; (2) expel such individual from membership; (3) suspend such individual's membership; or (4) discriminate against such individual with respect to any of the benefits or obligations of membership. Authorizes: (1) a right of action to enforce such prohibition; and (2) the court to grant injunctive or other equitable relief. Authorizes the Association to acquire the assets of the United States Marshals Association, a nonprofit organization organized under the laws of the State of Virginia, before the enactment of this Act."
