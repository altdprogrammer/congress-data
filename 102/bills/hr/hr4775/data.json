    "text": "Postal Employees Safety and Health Act - Makes various provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA), including civil and criminal penalty provisions, applicable to the U.S. Postal Service. Directs the Postmaster General to issue standards on ergonomic hazards to protect Postal Service employees from work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Requires the Postal Service to: (1) ensure that, in order to protect the hearing impaired from smoke or fire hazards, warning devices are present in all appropriate postal facilities; (2) prescribe regulations which ensure at least the minimum level of safety provided by the then current national consensus standards under OSHA dealing with smoke and fire warning devices for the hearing impaired and which include criteria for identifying which types of postal facilities shall be subject to particular requirements with respect to such warning devices; and (3) report to specified congressional committees. Authorizes a joint labor-management postal safety committee (committee) to enter into contracts with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to identify any ergonomic or other safety or health hazards which might be associated with any major new mechanization, equipment, or technology (change) being, or proposed to be, implemented by the Postal Service. Requires the Postal Service, to the extent practicable, before awarding any contract for the acquisition, installation, or implementation of any such change, to notify the committee of its intentions, so that the committee may review the design plans for such change and submit written comments relating to any safety or health hazards which might result. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Postal Service should not discharge or in any manner discriminate against an employee for refusing to perform duties if the employee: (1) believes that performing such duties would result in serious injury, where a reasonable person in those circumstances would draw the same conclusion; and (2) has previously sought to have the Postal Service correct the conditions involved."
