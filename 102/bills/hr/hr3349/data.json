Provides that such facilities will recover the costs of such care from Medicare Subvention funding. Provides that the costs of care for members or former members who are not eligible for Medicare will be recovered from the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) Subvention funding. Revises provisions concerning health care for military dependents to provide that the uniformed services facilities providing such care will recover costs from Medicare or CHAMPUS, as appropriate. Prohibits medical or dental care from being provided to an otherwise eligible person at a military treatment facility only if the senior or commanding officer of such facility determines that such facility cannot provide the particular care required because of lack of space or facilities or because such type of care is not provided at such facility. Requires the administering Secretary to be advised immediately when a determination to deny treatment is made, with a verifiable date as to when the restriction will be removed. Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to make Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs treatment facilities eligible for Medicare payments as long as they meet requirements applicable to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities under such title."
