Title II: Strengthening Deposit Insurance Fund - Amends the Federal Depost Insurance Act to include foreign deposits within the insurance assessment rate for depository institutions. Directs the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to establish risk-based insurance premiums for depository institutions according to prescribed guidelines. Prohibits the FDIC from determining on a pro rata or \"pass through\" basis the extent to which any deposit in an insured account is an insured deposit. Exempts certain pension and qualified retirement plans from such proscription. Mandates annual examinations of all insured depository institutions. Specifies exceptions."
