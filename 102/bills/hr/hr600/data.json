Amends the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 to change from discretionary to mandatory the Secretary of Transportation's authority to provide grants for the training and evaluation of dogs for the Explosive Detection K-9 Team Training Program for detecting explosives at airports and aboard aircraft. Requires the Secretary to extend such program to the largest 50 airports, as determined by the number of passenger enplanements in 1990. Authorizes appropriations."
