Allows as a capital gains deduction an amount equal to the sum of: (1) the annual capital gains deduction, plus the lifetime capital gains deduction for nontradable property. Declares the annual capital gains deduction to be the lesser of the net capital gain or $1,000. Declares the lifetime capital gains deduction for nontradable property to be 50 percent of the qualified gain. Makes taxpayers whose incomes exceed $150,000 ineligible for such deduction. Bases the qualified gain on sales and exchanges on or after April 11, 1991. Title II: Depreciation Recapture - Revises provisions concerning the gain from dispositions of certain depreciable realty to provide for the recapture of the total amount of depreciation."
