    "text": "Recreational Hunting Safety Enhancement Act of 1992 - Prohibits knowingly and with intent to obstruct or prevent a lawful hunt: (1) harassing, impeding, or interfering with an individual participating in a lawful hunt of Federal land; (2) scaring, herding, harassing, decoying, dispersing, or disturbing animals or fish subject to such a hunt; or (3) taking or abusing property, equipment, or hunting dogs being used in conjunction with such a hunt (obstructing a lawful hunt). Authorizes the Secretary concerned (the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to Federal land included in the National Forest System or the Secretary of the Interior with respect to Federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management) to impose a civil penalty of up to: (1) $1,000 for each violation; and (2) $5,000 for each such violation if the Secretary concerned determines that the violation involved the use of force or violence, or the threatened use of force or violence, against the person or property of another person. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) hearing requirements; (2) multiple violations; (3) the imposition of such penalties in addition to other criminal or civil penalties that may be levied against the person as a result of the proscribed activity; and (4) a requirement that, after deduction of costs attributable to collection, such moneys be deposited in a trust fund to be used by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to carry out activities of the Foundation and the North American Waterfowl Management Plan described in the North American Wetlands Conservation Act. Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties (a fine, imprisonment of one to three years, or both) for obstructing a lawful hunt. Permits injunctive relief to be sought by: (1) the head of a State agency with jurisdiction over fish or wildlife management; (2) the Attorney General; (3) any individual who intends to participate in a lawful hunt on Federal lands; or (4) a hunting or sportsman's organization to which the individual belongs. Specifies that: (1) this Act is not intended to preempt a State law or local ordinance that provides for civil or criminal penalties for a person who obstructs or otherwise interferes with a lawful hunt; and (2) the bringing of an action pursuant to this Act shall not prevent an independent action against a person under a State law or local ordinance."
