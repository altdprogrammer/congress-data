  "summary": {
    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-06-03", 
    "text": "Defense Workers Economic Reinvestment Act - Title I: Economic Reinvestment Council - Establishes the Economic Reinvestment Council to: (1) administer the National Technology Infrastructure Goals Improvement and Consortia Creation program and the Fast Response State Technological Competitiveness Grant program, both established under this Act; and (2) be empowered to examine and approve or disapprove all other project and program selections made under this Act and funding decisions under this Act exceeding $500,000. Requires reviews of funding requests to be completed within 60 days. Directs the Council to advise the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other Federal agencies on the progress and success of the economic reinvestment programs established under this Act and under the Defense Economic Adjustment, Diversification, Conversion, and Stabilization Act of 1990 in alleviating the adverse economic and social effects of reductions in defense spending. Requires the Council to consult on a regular basis with Governors of States involved in reinvestment activities. Directs the Council: (1) upon receiving notification of the annual defense budget proposal of the Secretary, to commence a preliminary study of the potential adverse economic effects the proposal may have on qualified defense contractors and communities; and (2) to prepare and distribute an economic reinvestment progress report on an annual basis. Requires the latter report to be distributed to State governors, the heads of Federal departments and agencies, and any other interested persons. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: National Technology Infrastructure Goals Improvement and Consortia Creation - Directs the President, in order to exploit the potential of critical technologies that would benefit national infrastructure and create export opportunities, to develop and carry out a program to assist advanced technology projects. Includes the following areas within appropriate investments in advanced technology projects which are in the national interest: space exploration, transportation, environmental restoration, telecommunications, energy efficiency, health care, education, and ocean technology. Directs the Council to solicit, review, prioritize, and select advanced technology projects to benefit the national technology infrastructure. Requires the Council to prepare and disseminate guidelines for qualifying project proposals. Requires specified Federal department and agency heads to submit to the Council proposals for such projects. Allows other Federal departments and agencies to submit proposals. Provides that, once a project is selected, the Council shall review project plans and schedules, provide funds to the project through the Department of Defense (DOD), and oversee implementation of the project. Encourages joint ventures in such projects with combinations of industry, academic, and State and Federal Government partners. Authorizes appropriations to fund such project for FY 1993 through 1996. Directs the Council to coordinate and oversee the creation of one consortium matched to each project, focusing on the basic and applied research for such project. Requires at least 50 percent of the funding for a consortium to derive from non-Federal sources. Limits Federal funding for a consortium to $5,000,000 annually for a period of four years. Requires small business to receive a minimum of 20 percent of the consortium research funding. Requires the Council to solicit and evaluate other proposals for critical technology consortia and to select at least three proposals annually. Places identical limits on the length and amounts of Federal funding for such consortia. Requires activities conducted by such a consortium to include a significant defense component. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1996. Directs the Secretary to reexamine existing procurement contracts to determine whether overly restrictive specifications on systems, supplies, and services that are also available commercially have been made. Directs the Secretary, for contracts exceeding $100,000 where DOD specifications preclude the purchase of commercial sector products, to justify the necessity for developing a different specification and the unsuitability of commercial specifications. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress detailing such justifications for each contract. Requires each defense contract solicitation to include provisions which encourage the use of commercially available systems, supplies, and services. Title III: Relieving Labor Shortages in Selected Civilian Applications - Directs the Secretary to establish an Office of Training Oversight and Administration to coordinate and oversee retraining, placement, and other transition assistance activities for full-time employees of at least three years of a qualified defense contractor (a contractor deriving 30 percent of its annual income from, or using 30 percent of its work force on, defense contracts) who: (1) are directly involved with a DOD funded project which is canceled or which receives at least a 25 percent reduction in Federal funds; and (2) are terminated or likely to be terminated within one year as the result of such cancellation or reduction. Directs the Office to disseminate information concerning such retraining and placement assistance to all qualified contractors and eligible DOD employees. Directs the Office to maintain statistics on the effectiveness of the transition assistance program in order to aid the Council in required activities. Authorizes the Office, in cooperation with other Federal agencies, to enter into agreements for the provision to eligible DOD employees of such transition assistance in skills identified to be in short supply in the area in which the retraining program operates. Authorizes the Office to award one- and two-year scholarships to educational institutions, giving a priority in such scholarships to eligible employees who seek vocational training and for scholarships in certain critical occupations as determined by the Office. Limits the Federal contribution to a training program to 50 percent of its costs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1995. Requires a qualified defense contractor to make a good faith effort to identify as early as possible employees who meet the eligibility requirements of the program, to advise them on options, and to allow them to participate in retraining and other transition assistance programs. Allows certain employees previously terminated under similar conditions within one year before the enactment of this Act to be eligible for such program. Title IV: Commercialization Opportunities - Directs the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary, for purposes of this title) to establish a program to assist U.S. businesses in creating and applying the generic technology and research results necessary to commercialize significant new discoveries and technologies. Requires the program selection board to be modeled after the Advanced Technology Program of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Directs the Secretary to inform the Council of the status of funded projects and on new selections for the Council's approval as required under title I. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with U.S. businesses for commercialization projects to demonstrate the feasibility of a particular technology or process up to the prototype stage, limiting the Federal funds to 33 percent of the project's costs, and limiting a single project to $1,000,000. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for FY 993 through 1996. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans to U.S. businesses of up to $3,000,000 for any one commercialization project. Prohibits more than three loans from being made to any single company or joint venture. Provides loan conditions and criteria. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993. Directs the Secretary of Defense to: (1) encourage the creation of industrial parks or technology incubator centers to transfer and spin off technology from qualified defense contractors to small businesses; (2) use royalties earned from the licensing of certain patents to assist local technology transfer activities; and (3) create and administer an awards program (modeled after an awards program under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980) to foster and encourage innovation and redirection efforts by qualified defense contractors in the area of commercialization. Title V: Fast Response State Technological Competitiveness Grants - States as the purpose of this title to provide Federal assistance directly to States for defense reinvestment programs. Directs the Secretary to allocate amounts authorized for appropriation under this title under a specified funding formula as technological competitiveness grants to States whose defense reinvestment programs meet certain requirements. Directs the Council to develop and disseminate guidelines on State eligibility for such grants. Requires a State, prior to receiving such a grant, to provide the Council information about its defense reinvestment program. Directs each State to report annually to the Council on progress under its reinvestment program, as well as any other data analysis required by the Council for its duties. Directs the Secretary to withhold grant funds from a State if the Council concludes that such State's reinvestment program or its progress is unsatisfactory relative to the published guidelines. Allows a 90-day appeal period during which the State shall be permitted to submit a revised program for Council review. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1995 for such grants."
