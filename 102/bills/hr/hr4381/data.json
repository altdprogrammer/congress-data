Declares that general performance standards applicable to all surface coal mining and reclamation operations shall require such operations to assume the responsibility for successful revegetation for: (1) a two-year period after the last year of specified rehabilitation efforts; or (2) a five-year period where annual average precipitation is 26 inches or less. Declares that surface coal mining operations on lands eligible for remining shall not affect the lands' eligibility for reclamation and restoration after the release of the bond or deposit for such operations. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to publish regulations establishing: (1) environmental protection performance and reclamation standards; and (2) separate permit systems applicable to operations for the on-site reprocessing of abandoned coal refuse, and operations for the removal of abandoned coal refuse."
