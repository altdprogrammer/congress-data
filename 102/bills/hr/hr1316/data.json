Removes the current requirement that employees who are rated two levels above fully successful receive a bonus of at least two percent of their annual rate of basic pay. Allows employees whose performance is rated at the fully successful level or higher to be paid a performance award. Makes the applicable minimum percentage in effect for FY 1991 applicable for each fiscal year through FY 1993, the fiscal year through which the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) is extended by this Act. Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish a Performance Management and Recognition System Review Committee to review PMRS and advise OPM on any improvements needed in PMRS."
