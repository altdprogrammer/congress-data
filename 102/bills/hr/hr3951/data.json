    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-11-26", 
    "text": "Comprehensive Health Care Access Improvement and Cost Containment Act of 1991 - Title I: Improving Access to Health Care - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for a percentage of qualified health insurance expenses for incomes of less than $40,000. Limits such credit to $2,500. Excludes Medicare payments and subsidized expenses from treatment as qualified expenses. Provides for the advance payment of such credit to eligible individuals. Coordinates such credit with the: (1) health insurance credit allowed in determining the earned income credit; (2) deductions for health insurance expenses of self-employed individuals; and (3) itemized deduction for medical and dental expenses. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), to establish a public awareness program to inform the public of the availability of the credit for health insurance expenses. Increases the deductible for health insurance costs for self-employed individuals from 25 percent to 100 percent and makes such deduction permanent. (Currently, it expires December 31, 1991.) Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to prohibit the preemption of State mandated benefits. Directs the Secretary to request the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (Association) to develop a model set of regulations and laws to provide a uniform, low-cost, minimum insurance benefit package to include hospital, physician, primary care, preventive care and other selected services for purchase by individuals, businesses and governmental entities. Directs the Association to submit a copy of such model regulations and laws to specified congressional committees after the enactment of this Act. Provides that if the Association does not develop such a model set of regulations and laws, the Secretary shall develop such a model and submit a copy as required above. Amends title XIX (Block Grants) of the Public Health Service Act to add a new part D under which the Secretary shall allocate funds to States to pay for the Federal share of the costs of establishing qualified State uninsurable pool programs that provide health insurance for medically uninsurable individuals. Provides criminal penalties for false statements made in connection with the furnishing of items or services for which payment may be made by a State from funds allotted to the State under new part D. Authorizes appropriations to carry out new part D. Title II: Containing Costs of Health Care - Directs the Secretary to request the Association to develop a plan for standardizing public and private insurance forms. Directs the Association to submit a copy of the plan to specified congressional committees after the enactment of this Act. Provides that it shall not be considered a violation of the antitrust laws for hospitals to jointly undertake, in the provision of care, the purchasing, contracting for, or sharing of high technology services. Amends title VI (Assistance for Construction and Modernization of Hospitals and Other Medical Facilities) of the Public Health Service Act to add a new part D under which the Secretary shall establish and carry out demonstration projects to assist hospitals in acquiring and sharing high technology equipment and services. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such new part D. Title III: Medical Malpractice Reform - Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of resolving medical malpractice claims in the same manner provided for resolving worker's compensation claims. Requires a report to the Congress on such study. Directs the Secretary to provide for demonstration projects by States that seek to reduce infant mortality by improving access in urban and rural underserved areas to obstetric services for eligible pregnant women under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act. Requires a report to the Congress on the demonstration projects carried out and on how project results may be used to implement programs to lower infant mortality and morbidity through improving the access of pregnant women to obstetric services in urban and rural underserved areas. Amends the Public Health Service Act to provide liability protections for certain health care professionals of community health centers, migrant health centers, and health centers for the homeless. Prohibits the Secretary from making or renewing grants to such centers unless they implement appropriate policies and procedures to assure against malpractice and have no history of having malpractice claims filed against them, or, if such a history exists, they have fully cooperated with the Attorney General in defending against any such claims and either have taken, or will take, such corrective steps to assure against such claims in the future. Directs the Secretary to develop and make available to the public each year a compendium of the various State initiatives undertaken to address the obstetric access crisis in urban and rural areas. Requires the Secretary to provide a grant to a public or private non-profit organization to conduct a study on the rate of medical malpractice actions or claims relating to obstetrical care for patients whose care is paid for by Medicaid as compared to those whose care is paid for by private insurance. Requires a report to the Congress on such study. Title IV: Encouraging Preventive Health Care - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to provide coverage of a comprehensive health assessment and immunizations for prevention or treatment of infectious diseases. Amends the Public Health Service Act to provide additional authorization of appropriations for provision of education and information regarding cancer. Title V: Improving Long-Term Care for the Elderly - Subtitle A: Comprehensive Long-Term Care Services for Individuals With Alzheimer's Disease - Part I: Expanded Medicare Benefits - Amends the Medicare program to add a new part C under which is created a long-term care program for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease. Part II: Expanding Medicaid Buy-In - Amends the Medicaid program to provide for expanding Medicaid buy-in of Medicare cost-sharing to cover long-term care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and additional indigent Medicare beneficiaries. Subtitle B: Tax Incentives to Promote Access to Long-Term Care - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a deduction for qualified elderly care expenses to the extent such expenses exceed five percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. Defines such expenses as non-compensated payments for in-home custodial care provided to a qualifying elderly individual. Describes such an individual as one who has attained 65 years of age and who is a parent, grandparent, or dependent of the taxpayer. Includes the rendering of medical services or goods by a physician or registered professional nurse as a charitable contribution and provides for valuation of such services or goods. Excludes from gross income distributions from individual retirement accounts or annuities to pay long-term care expenses or to purchase insurance covering such expenses."
