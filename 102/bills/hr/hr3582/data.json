Authorizes the District of Columbia to request contributions from the Federal Government and from future users of the expanded landfill to pay for carrying out the environmental impact statement. Directs the Administrator to establish a Metropolitan Area Regional Waste Management Task Force to study the feasibility and desirability of establishing a regional waste management plan and program for the Washington metropolitan area. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Administrator of General Services to conduct a study to determine the feasibility and desirability of establishing a centrally administered solid waste management program for all facilities under the jurisdiction of the General Services Administration (GSA) or Department of Defense in the Washington metropolitan area. Requires the study to: (1) examine whether cost savings can be realized through the consolidation of Federal facility waste management programs in such area through the use of a GSA unit for collection and disposal of waste and recovery of recyclable materials; and (2) integrate waste management of Federal facilities with local and State solid waste management requirements in host jurisdictions."
