    "text": "Brain Injury Rehabilitation Quality Act of 1992 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to provide for optional Medicaid coverage of services provided through a case management program that meets specified requirements to Medicaid-eligible individuals who suffer traumatic brain injuries. Describes the services provided under such a program, which include: (1) rehabilitation services; (2) transitional and independent living services; (3) home care; (4) behavior disorder treatment services; and (5) respite or recreation services to aid the individual and members of the individual's family in adapting to residual deficits resulting from brain injury. Authorizes such program to: (1) obtain for participating individuals other benefits and services for which such individuals are eligible under other Federal, State, or local programs, including employment services, education benefits, old age services, and disability insurance; and (2) waive restrictions on the amount, duration, and scope of services otherwise applicable under State plans. Declares that an individual must reside in a State that has designated a State coordinator for traumatic brain injuries in order to receive services under this Act. Requires such coordinator to establish policies and standards for providing services, make necessary reports to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, supervise and coordinate services for persons with traumatic brain injuries, and perform the duties set out below. Makes such coordinator responsible for a program of activities related to preventing and reducing the rate of traumatic brain injuries in the State. Requires such coordinator to: (1) establish and maintain a central registry of persons who sustain traumatic brain injury in order to collect information necessary to facilitate such programs and ensure the provision to such persons of information on rehabilitative service providers; (2) notify the State employment agency of individuals reported to have suffered a traumatic brain or spinal cord injury; (3) establish standards for marketing of services to traumatic brain injury patients or family members, in consultation with the advisory committee established below; (4) collect and analyze injury incidence information for coordinator studies concerning traumatic brain injury; (5) provide summary registry data to entities to conduct studies; (6) establish an advisory committee to provide recommendations regarding the needs of persons with traumatic brain injuries; (7) adopt such rules as are necessary to carry out this Act; and (8) establish a reporting system that notifies the coordinator of the identity of any person treated for a traumatic brain injury in the State. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish standards for the reporting of data on traumatic brain injuries and the operation of registries on traumatic brain injuries for coordinator use. Requires the Administrator for Health Care Policy and Research to conduct a study on the effectiveness of traumatic brain injury interventions."
