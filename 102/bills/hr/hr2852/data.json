    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-07-10", 
    "text": "Partnerships for Educational Advancement Act of 1991 - Amends title I (Postsecondary Programs for Nontraditional Students) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to add: (1) a new part E program of grants for articulation agreements and planning between parterships of two-year and four-year institutions of higher education; and (2) a new part F program of articulation scholarships for the second through fourth academic years of undergraduate education to encourage students pursuing an associate degree to continue their higher education. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to make such grants to States to make awards to articulation partnerships between qualified institutions, on the basis of either a competition or a formula determined by the State. Provides for allocation of such grant funds to States: (1) by a formula based the relative total amount of student assistance received under HEA title IV by students attending institutions in the State, if the authorization of appropriations for such grants program equals or exceeds a specified amount; or (2) if such authorized amount is less than the specified amount, by competitive grants which the Secretary is authorized to make to States. Sets forth requirements for State and local applications, articulation agreements, and State administrative costs limitation. Requires States to give priority to grant applications for programs which: (1) encourage teacher education; (2) have, as one partner participating in the agreement, an entity meeting a specified requirement for the tech-prep education program consortia (i.e. a local or intermediate educational agency or area vocational education school serving secondary school students, or a secondary school funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs) under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act; (3) contribute their own institutional resources; (4) are not subject to a student loan default reduction agreement under title IV (Student Assistance) of HEA; or (5) encourage articulation in subject areas of national importance as determined by the Secretary. Sets forth requirements for annual State program reports and for program evaluation by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to: (1) report to the Congress by January 31, 1996, on the results of such evaluation; and (2) disseminate findings relating to the most successful programs. Reserves limited amounts for such purposes. Authorizes appropriations for the articulation agreements grants program. Authorizes the Secretary to award articulation scholarships, for the second through fourth undergraduate years, to students who, during the first year of the scholarship award, are enrolled in the second year of an associate degree program all course credits of which may be counted toward a bachelor's degree. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct, either directly or by contract, a national competition to select such scholars. Requires selection procedures to assure at least one scholar shall be selected each year from each State. Requires selection on the basis of superior academic ability and leadership potential. Requires that selected scholars be eligible students under HEA title IV student assistance provisions. Requires the Secretary to give priority to students demonstrating: (1) superior academic ability; and (2) financial need for assistance (i.e. only if eligible for and will receive assistance under the Pell Grants program). Allows an individual selected for such a scholarship award to receive the award only if the institution they will attend: (1) has entered into a HEA title IV student assistance program participation agreement with the Secretary; and (2) has agreed to contribute at least 20 percent of the cost of such award from its own resources (which may include institutional grants or scholarship funds and tuition and fee waivers). Provides that each student awarded such a scholarship shall receive, for each covered year of academic study, an award of $1,000 plus an amount not exceeding the lesser of $10,000 or the total cost of attendance, and which, when combined with the student's estimated financial assistance under title IV, does not exceed such total cost of attendance. Allows such awards to be used to replace an amount otherwise expected to be contributed by the student or their family or to be borrowed under title IV requirements. Provides that such award shall not be taken into account in determining title IV eligibility or amount of aid, except that the total shall not exceed the total cost of attendance. Provides for reductions to avoid such excess amounts. Sets forth scholarship conditions for satisfactory progress and verification. Authorizes appropriations."
