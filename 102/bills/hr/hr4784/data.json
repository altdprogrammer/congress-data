Authorizes the transfer of appropriate programs to the Rural Development Administration. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) reduce Department headquarters personnel (with priority given to attrition rather than reductions-in-force); and (2) establish a centralized data system within the Farm Services Administration, including paperwork reduction and simpler program applications. Reorganizes the local and county committee system. Expresses the sense of the Congress in favor of farm program simplification."
