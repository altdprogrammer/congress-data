    "text": "Incinerator Ash Amendments of 1991 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate regulations governing the management of ash from specified solid waste incineration units. Authorizes such regulations to establish requirements that apply to fly or bottom ash separately or to a combination of fly and bottom ash. Prohibits: (1) except as provided in this Act, the disposal of ash in a landfill unless waste segregation of glass and metal food containers, newspaper, office paper, cardboard, used oil, scrap metal, and used motor vehicle batteries occurs before incineration of the waste that results in the creation of ash; (2) the disposal of ash in a landfill unless the ash was generated at a unit that meets operation and maintenance standards; and (3) the disposal of ash in a landfill unless the management and handling of the ash meets management and handling requirements. Requires ash to be disposed of in a landfill only if the landfill provides for groundwater monitoring and: (1) has two or more liners and a leachate collection system above and between such liners; (2) provides for the placement of ash in a monofill and a single liner to prevent migration of constituents into groundwater or into the liner; or (3) uses an alternative design that prevents the migration of hazardous constituents into groundwater or surface water as effectively as the other design requirements. Directs the Administrator to publish guidelines with respect to: (1) resource recovery from solid waste incineration ash disposed of prior to the effective date of regulations issued under this Act; (2) the use of solid waste incineration ash in the production of products and materials; and (3) the recycling or reuse of tires, paints, solvents, potentially hazardous household chemicals, household batteries, plastics, large household appliances, yard waste, and construction debris. Requires the Administrator to promulgate criteria and testing procedures for identifying the characteristics of ash which may pose a hazard to human health or the environment. Permits persons desiring to dispose of ash in a landfill, in lieu of meeting waste segregation and resource recovery requirements, to test the ash using such procedures. Authorizes such persons to dispose of nonhazardous ash in landfills. Sets forth additional testing requirements. Prohibits a facility from receiving incineration ash for management purposes unless the facility has a permit. Authorizes the Administrator to enforce requirements for States which fail to comply with ash regulations. Provides for public comment prior to the issuance of permits. Authorizes the Administrator to require corrective action or other response measures if a release of a hazardous substance from a regulated facility has occurred. Permits the Administrator to make grants to States for programs to promote the use of waste segregation and resource recovery from incinerator ash. Limits the amount of Federal funds for such programs. Requires the Administrator to conduct a program of research on, and development of, environmentally safe means to reuse incinerator ash. Authorizes appropriations."
