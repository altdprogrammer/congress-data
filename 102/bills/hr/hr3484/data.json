    "text": "Fresh Cut Flower Import Regulation Act of 1991 - Establishes the Fresh Cut Flower Import Regulation Trust Fund within the Treasury. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) to transfer from the Treasury amounts received as duties imposed on certain fresh cut flowers to the Trust Fund. Authorizes the Secretaries of Commerce and of Agriculture to requisition funds from the Trust Fund to defray administrative costs. Authorizes the Secretary to invest a portion of such Fund in interest-bearing U.S. bonds. Title I: Quantitative Limitation of Imports of Fresh Cut Flowers - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to annually determine for each category of fresh cut flowers the domestic consumption in quantity of stems for a 12-month period and the shares of consumption accounted for by domestic shipments and by total imports. Prohibits the share of consumption to be supplied by imports from exceeding specified shares of expected consumption of fresh cut flowers. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to allocate the increase or decrease in the global import quota for such categories among supplying countries in proportion to their shares of domestic consumption. Title II: Reallocation of Unused Country Quotas - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to reallocate the unused portion of the prior calendar quarter quotas to other supplying countries if a determination is made that any country has not filled its quota of a particular category of fresh cut flowers by 50 percent or more of its quota. Title III: Country of Origin Identification of Imported Fresh Cut Flowers - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require each imported fresh cut flower to conspicuously indicate the English name of the country of origin of such flower. Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, to make it an unfair act or practice for anyone to sell such flowers without the English name of the country of origin. Title IV: Monitoring of the Prices of Imported Fresh Cut Flowers by the Secretary of Commerce; Self-Initiation by Him of Antidumping Duty Investigations of Imports Being Offered or Sold Below Their Fair Value - Requires the Secretary of Commerce to monitor the prices at which imported fresh cut flowers are sold in: (1) the United States; and (2) the principal export markets other than the United States in order to determine the fair value of such flowers. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to commence an antidumping duty investigation whenever it is determined that a specific category of fresh cut flowers from one or more supplying countries has been sold at less than their fair value by greater than de minimis margins."
