    "text": "Small Community Environmental Infrastructure Grants Act of 1992 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to make grants to States for the establishment of small community environmental infrastructure funds. Makes such funds available to small communities for the construction of wastewater treatment works, public water systems, and solid waste management facilities and for assuring that underground storage tanks are in compliance with the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Sets forth provisions concerning grant payment schedules and allotment and reallotment requirements. Requires States to establish funds to receive such grants. Sets forth specific requirements for the use of such funds and for the grants to be provided to small communities. Permits States to provide assistance only to community wastewater treatment and solid waste management facilities and public water systems that are in compliance with plans under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as appropriate. Requires States to submit plans to the Administrator that identify the intended use of the funds. Directs States to reserve the greater of one percent of fund sums or $100,000 to carry out planning. Provides for the withholding of grant payments if a State is not in compliance with this Act's requirements. Requires the Administrator to establish an Office of Small Community Environmental Infrastructure Assistance to: (1) oversee and manage the grants and funds made under this Act; and (2) provide specified environmental and financial information to small communities. Authorizes the Office to provide grants to States, Indian tribes, and not-for-profit organizations to assist small communities in assessing issues related to the financing of environmental facilities, compliance with environmental laws, and the construction, operation, and rehabilitation of environmental infrastructure facilities. Requires such grants to be matched by non-Federal funds. Directs the Administrator to: (1) establish a program and plan to provide financial assistance to Indian tribes for carrying out the same environmental infrastructure projects on Federal Indian reservations; and (2) administer an environmental infrastructure fund for providing such assistance. Sets forth a matching requirement for such assistance. Authorizes and allocates appropriations."
