Establishes the Energy Security Investment Fund for: (1) acquisition of crude petroleum and petroleum products (including home heating oil) in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; (2) low-income weatherization; and (3) the promotion of energy efficiency, energy efficiency commercialization, and domestic oil and gas recovery. Authorizes the President to waive import duties from Western Hemisphere countries under specified circumstances. Directs the President to report to the Congress on ways in which the United States and the Western Hemisphere petroleum producing countries can cooperate regarding energy production and conservation."
