Allows States to provide Medicaid home and community-based services to children who have the HIV virus and an abnormally low immune function for which medical intervention is indicated to prevent hospitalization. Applies the same income and resource eligibility standards as would apply if such children were hospitalized. Includes as federally-qualified health centers an entity receiving a grant under the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990 for the provision of early intervention services to individuals who have the HIV virus. Authorizes States to provide Medicaid coverage of the early intervention services provided by federally qualified health centers under such grant program to low-income individuals who have the HIV virus. Authorizes a Health and Human Services residential care facility demonstration program for certain Medicaid-eligible individuals who have the HIV virus and need housing or attendant care to allow them to remain at home."
