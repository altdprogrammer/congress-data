    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-10-17", 
    "text": "Emergency Unemployment Benefits and Congressional Spending Priorities Act of 1991 - Title I: Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program - Establishes an emergency unemployment compensation program. Allows any State to enter into and participate in an agreement with the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) under which the State agency which administers the State unemployment compensation law will make payments of emergency unemployment compensation: (1) to individuals who have exhausted all rights to regular compensation under State law, have no rights to such regular compensation or any additional State or Federal compensation, and are not receiving Canadian compensation; and (2) for any week of unemployment beginning in the individual's eligibility period. Sets forth provisions relating to exhaustion of regular benefits and weekly amount of emergency benefits equal to regular benefits. Authorizes a State Governor, in a period of a seven or eight percent total unemployment rate in that State (as defined under this Act), to elect to trigger an extended compensation period to provide emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who have exhausted their rights to regular compensation under State law. Requires a State, under such an agreement, to establish an emergency unemployment compensation account with respect to the benefit year of each eligible individual who files an application. Limits benefit payments to not more than the amount in the individual's account. Sets forth formulas for determining the amount in such account. Provides that the applicable limit in such account shall be equal to: (1) 20 for an eight-percent period, i.e. one triggered by an average unadjusted total unemployment rate (TUR) of eight percent or more in the State for the most recent six calendar months with published data; (2) 13 for a seven-percent period; and (3) seven for a six-percent period or for any other period. Sets forth special rules relating to such applicable limits. Requires reduction in such account by the amount of extended benefits received by the individual relating to the same benefit year under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. Sets the weekly benefit amount at the amount of regular compensation (including dependents' allowances) payable under the State law to the individual for such week for total unemployment. Provides for determination of periods and applicable triggers. Provides for a minimuim period of at least 13 weeks. Provides, in general, that no emergency unemployment compensation shall be payable to any individual under this Act for any week beginning: (1) before the later of the day after the enactment date of this Act or the first week following the week in which an agreement under this Act is entered into; or (2) after July 4, 1992. Sets forth transition and reachback provisions for the eligibility of certain individuals for such benefits, as exceptions to such general rule. Provides for payments to States having such agreements for emergency unemployment compensation. Sets forth financing provisions. Requires that funds in the extended unemployment compensation account of the Unemployment Trust Fund be used to make payments to States having agreements under this Act. Sets forth provisions relating to fraud and overpayments. Defines the eligible period under this Act. Provides that in no event shall an individual's period of eligibility include any weeks after the 39th week after the end of the benefit year for which the individual exhausted rights to regular compensation or extended compensation. Title II: Other Provisions - Amends specified Federal law to repeal certain limitations on payment of unemployment compensation to former members of the Armed Forces. Reduces the length of required active duty by reserves for purposes for such payment. Directs the Secretary of Labor to give consideration to providing services to dislocated workers in the timber industry in determining specified programs and activities to be funded under the Job Training Partnership Act in FY 1991 and 1992. Title III: Financing Provisions - Subtitle A: Electromagnetic Spectrum Function - Emerging Telecommunications Technologies Act of 1991 - Requires the Secretary of Commerce and the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to conduct biannual joint electromagnetic spectrum planning meetings with respect to: (1) future spectrum needs and the allocation actions to accommodate those needs; and (2) actions to promote the efficient use of the spectrum. Requires an open process and joint annual reports to the President. Directs the Secretary to submit reports to the President that identify frequency bands that: (1) are allocated on a primary basis for Government use and eligible for licensing pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act); (2) are not required for the present or identifiable future Government needs; (3) can be made available for use under the Act for non-Government users; (4) are likely to have significant value for such users; and (5) will not result in excessive costs to the Government. Sets forth criteria for identifying, and recommending for reassignment or sharing, such frequency bands. Requires such reports to make an initial identification of 50MHz of spectrum for immediate reallocation and distribution by the FCC pursuant to competitive bidding procedures, and preliminary and final identifications of additional reallocable frequency bands. Directs the Secretary to convene a private sector advisory committee to: (1) review frequency bands identified in the preliminary report; (2) advise the Secretary with respect to those bands which should be included in the final report; (3) receive public comment on the reports; and (4) prepare and submit to the Secretary and specified congressional committees a report on recommendations for the reform of allocating the spectrum between Government and non-Government users. Directs the President to: (1) withdraw or limit the assignment to a Government station of any frequency recommended in the initial identification report for rellocation; (2) withdraw or limit the assignment to a Government station of any frequency recommended in the final report for reallocation or mixed use; (3) assign or reassign other frequencies to Government stations as necessary to adjust to such withdrawal or limitation of assignments; and (4) publish in the Federal Register a notice and description of such actions taken. Authorizes the President to substitute alternative frequencies in the interests of national security, important Government needs, public health or safety, or Federal financial considerations. Provides that any Government licensee, or non-Government entity operating on behalf of a Government licensee, that is displaced from a frequency pursuant to this Act may be reimbursed not more than the incremental costs it incurs, in such amounts as provided in advance in appropriation Acts, that are directly attributable to the loss of the use of the frequency pursuant to this Act. Authorizes appropriations to affected licensee agencies to cover such costs. Directs the FCC to form a plan to assign the spectrum identified in the initial report pursuant to competitive bidding procedures during FY 1994 through 1996. Directs the FCC to submit to the President a plan for the distribution of the remaining reallocated frequency bands. Authorizes the President to reclaim reallocated frequencies for reassignment to Government stations. Sets forth procedures for reclaiming frequencies. Amends the Act to require the FCC to use competitive bidding for awarding all initial licenses and new construction permits, subject to specified exclusions. Outlines criteria for awarding licenses and permits under competitive bidding procedures. Prohibits licensing by lottery when competitive bidding is required. Subtitle B: Rescission of Unnecessary Spending - Rescinds, except to the extent obligated, specified amounts which were set aside or otherwise made available (and the underlying appropriations for such amounts) under specified 1991 Appropriations Acts for: (1) the Department of Interior and Related Agencies (for: Native Hawaiian artifacts sales development; projects at America's Industrial Heritage Park, Pennsylvania; museum construction at Cordell Hull residence, Tennessee; restoration of Keith Albee Theatre, Huntington, West Virginia; and locomotive artifacts restoration at Steamtown, Pennsylvania); (2) Department of Transportation and Related Agencies (for: a bicycle transportation project in Macomb County, Michigan; and Biscayne Boulevard renovation in Miami, Florida); (3) Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies (for a performing arts and cultural center in North Miami Beach, Florida); (4) the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs (for: the International Fund for Ireland; and retiring the debt owed by the University of Central America to the Inter-American Development Bank); (5) the Legislative Branch (for the layout of fitness facilities for House office buildings; upgrading the Senate subway system; and modular furniture for Senate office buildings; (6) the Rural Development, Agriculture, and Related Agencies (for a fish farming station in Stuttgart, Arkansas); and (7) the Department of Defense (for design and construction of a parliament building in the Solomon Islands). Subtitle C: Presidential Authority to Ensure Budget Neutrality - Directs the President, upon determination that the new outlays resulting from the preceding provisions of this Act in FY 1992 exceed the sum of the reduction in outlays and increase in receipts resulting from such provisions in such fiscal year, to issue certain sequestration orders which cancel, in the following order, as necessary: (1) up to 30 percent of the FY 1992 budgetary resources for budget accounts in the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1992; (2) any FY 1992 congressional pay raise made by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989; (3) any FY 1992 congressional foreign travel budgetary resources provided by the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1992; and (4) any FY 1992 congressional operations budgetary resources provided by the latter Act. Requires the President to obtain the recommendations of specified congressional officials before cancelling such budgetary resources relating to congressional pay, foreign travel, or operations. Subtitle D: Budgetary Treatment - Requires that all reductions in budgetary resources made by subtitles A through C of this title be considered to be reductions in direct spending accounts for purposes of applying specified provisions of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act)."
