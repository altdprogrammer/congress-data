Increases specified Federal penalties relating to the introduction of plant or animal pests. Directs: (1) the Postmaster General to offer to enter into a two-year cooperative agreement with Hawaii to enforce specified postal restrictions on mailed plants; (2) the Secretaries of the Interior and of Agriculture to enter into similar agreements with Hawaii to enforce laws under their respective jurisdictions; and (3) the Postmaster General, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of the Interior to jointy establish a public information program about the prohibitions and penalties against shipping alien species into Hawaii and other areas of the United States."
