Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, 60 days after enactment, to instruct the United States executive directors of the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the International Development Association to oppose any loan or other utilization of the funds of their respective institutions to or for Hong Kong. Allows the President to waive such restrictions if it is determined that: (1) Hong Kong has agreed to be a country of first asylum for asylum seekers fleeding Vietnam by boat or land; and (2) Hong Kong has terminated the practice of forced repatriation of asylum seekers."
