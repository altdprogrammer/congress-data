    "date": "1992-08-12", 
    "text": "Emergency Jobless Benefits and Transitional Employment Act of 1992 - Title I: Modifications to Unemployment Compensation Programs - Subtitle A: Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program - Amends the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-164, as amended) to increase the number of weeks for which emergency unemployment compensation program benefits are payable (by an additional 13 weeks for individuals who received such benefits before July 5, 1992). Makes similar adjustments to the program of benefits for railroad workers. Modifies eligibility requirements under such Act. Sets forth a special rule under which an individual's unemployment benefits under such Act will not be denied or reduced because of qualified services under the transitional employment program (established under title III of this Act) which the individual performs on a part-time basis while participating in a job search assistance program (established by the State employment service or pursuant to the Job Training Partnership Act). Revises financing provisions under such Act to include amendments made by this Act. Subtitle B: Reemployment Assistance Programs - Amends Internal Revenue Code provisions relating to Federal unemployment tax (also known as the Federal Unemployment Tax Act or FUTA) to allow the employer-taxpayer to take as an additional credit against the FUTA tax the amount contributed into a reemployment assistance fund maintained under a State law certified by the Secretary of Labor. Limits the total credit allowed to a taxpayer to not more than 12 percent of the FUTA tax against which such credits are taken. Provides for approval of such State law by the Secretary if: (1) it establishes a reemployment assistance program for eligible workers; (2) the program is funded by requiring additional contributions from employers subject to State unemployment compensation law; and (3) such additional contributions are deposited in a special fund used solely for such assistance to such workers (including administration costs). Defines reemployment assistance as any of the following: (1) counseling and testing services; (2) intensive job search assistance; (3) job search vouchers; (4) retraining assistance; (5) retraining vouchers; (6) job search and relocation allowances; (7) self-employment assistance; (8) cash allowances to individuals participating in training; and (9) wage subsidies. Defines eligible workers as any individual receiving unemployment compensation under State law during any benefit year if such individual: (1) has received compensation during such benefit year for at least four consecutive weeks; and (2) had at least 78 weeks of employment at wages of $30 or more a week during the three-year period ending on the last day of the base period for such benefit year. Makes specified certification procedures applicable. Sets forth a transitional rule for 1993. Amends the Social Security Act to require establishment of a program to evaluate State reemployment assistance programs and make such evaluation results available to the States and the public. Authorizes appropriations for such evaluation. Subtitle C: Other Provisions - Amends the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 to increase the amount of the Federal reimbursement to States for extended unemployment compensation benefits. Modifies the rate of the Federal unemployment tax (FUTA). Title II: Modifications to Trade Adjustment Assistance Program - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to expand workers' group eligibility under the trade adjustment assistance program. Title III: Elementary and Secondary School Facility Repair and Renovation Employment Activities - Part A: General Purpose and Authority - Establishes one-year program to employ unemployed individuals in repair or rehabilitation of elementary and secondary school facilities. Makes an individual eligible to participate in a program or activity under this title only if that individual: (1) has exhausted all rights to unemployment compensation under Federal and State law; (2) is currently receiving emergency unemployment compensation; or (3) is eligible for activities under dislocated worker provisions of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). Limits such individual eligibility to 26 weeks. Sets forth equal employment opportunity requirements for programs under this title. Sets forth requirements for: (1) eligible administrative entities and eligible jurisdictions; and (2) limitations on use of funds (requiring at least 75 percent for participant wages and benefits, and including an exception for training and related support costs). Part B: Elementary and Secondary School Facility Improvement Jobs - Provides for public school facility repair, renovation, or rehabilitation projects employing eligible participants. Requires the eligible administrative entity to use program funds to contract with one or more eligible local educational agencies in an eligible jurisdiction to carry out such projects. Requires use of such funds, to the maximum extent feasible, for quick-start projects or activities on which on-site labor can begin within 30 days of receipt of funds. Authorizes the use of project funds, with respect to public school facilities, to: (1) bring such facilities into conformance with laws relating to individuals with disabilities, environmental protection, or health and safety; (2) repair, renovate, or rehabilitate (including electrical rewiring for new technology); (3) convert presently unused structures into adult training centers; (4) remodel or renovate for energy efficiency; or (5) detect, remove, or otherwise contain asbestos in facilities used by students. Sets forth program requirements for Indian tribal school facilities projects. Sets forth requirements for allotment of funds by the Secretary of Labor to eligible jurisdictions. Requires quarterly reports by eligible administrative entities. Requires the eligible administrative entity to give priority to projects and activities designed by the local administrative entity on the basis of specified factors. Requires coordination of employment opportunities established with funds under this title with other Federal, State, and local activities. Part C: General Provisions - Sets forth general requirements for programs under this title, including: (1) nondiscrimination provisions; (2) use of funds only for supplementary activities; (3) prohibition on substitution for other government programs; (4) resident participation in services (with an exception for homeless individuals who cannot prove residence in the jurisdiction); and (5) prohibition on political activities. Requires minimum or prevailing hourly wage rates with: (1) a maximum average rate limitation; (2) permission for wage supplementation from sources other than this title; and (3) part-time, flex-time, work-sharing allowed (if customarily offered by the employer and if customary benefits are provided). Requires program maintenance of individual work records. Requires recipient expenditure of allotted funds during the one year from the date of payment. Sets forth reallotment provisions. Requires Selective Service System compliance by individual participants.

Provides for protection of existing workers, including prohibitions against: (1) displacement; (2) impairment of contracts and agreements; (3) filling of laid-off positions; and (4) promotional infringement. Requires transmission of quarterly compliance reports by the program funding recipient to any labor organization representing government employees engaged in work similar to that performed by employees whose wages are subsidized under this title. Requires such reports to include analyses if job reductions of unsubsidized employees reach specified levels for specified periods. Sets forth compliant procedures. Prohibits the use of program funds to assist, promote, or deter union organizing. Requires that a concerned area labor organization be given an opportunity to comment on a proposed project under this title.
