Requires the Commission to: (1) survey the private sector to determine which Federal regulations are duplicative or impede competition; (2) conduct in-depth reviews of regulations promulgated by executive agencies; (3) review existing Government Accounting Office, Congressional Budget Office, Inspector General Reports, and other governmental and nongovernmental recommendations for reducing duplicative or noncompetitive Federal regulations, and, based on such review, periodically report to the President and the Congress on those recommendations, with estimated savings, that the Commission determines are most significant; and (4) submit to the President and the Congress recommendations for streamlining Federal regulations and reducing costs and unnecessary paperwork that result from such regulations for both the Federal Government and the private sector."
