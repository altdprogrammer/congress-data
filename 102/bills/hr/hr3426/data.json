    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-09-26", 
    "text": "Postsecondary Opportunities for Students with Disabilities - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to improve access to postsecondary education for students with disabilities. Requires that student literacy corps tutoring services be located in public community agencies which serve individuals with disabilities (as well as in those which serve educationally or economically disadvantaged individuals). Requires college work-study program grant agreements to provide assurances that employment made available from such program funds may be used to support programs for supportive services for students with disabilities. Authorizes the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to award a three-year grant or contract on a competitive basis to establish a National Clearinghouse for Postsecondary Education Materials (the Clearinghouse) in an accessible form, including audio and digital for students with disabilities. Sets forth required uses of such funds and Federal share limitations. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1995. Revises terminology under priority provisions for student support services to refer to individuals with disabilities (rather than physically handicapped individuals). Revises HEA title I (Postsecondary Programs for Nontraditional Students) to add a new part E, Partnerships, to encourage partnerships between institutions of higher education and secondary and vocational students with disabilities to improve their academic and vocational skills and to increase their opportunities for continued education, independent living, and employment after secondary school. Directs the Secretary to provide funds to ten demonstration grant programs in ten States between local education agencies (LEAs) and higher education institutions or consortia that submit joint applications to develop, implement, and improve systems to provide postsecondary educational opportunities to students with disabilities from age 12 until they exit secondary school. Sets forth required uses of such funds. Allows students with disabilities who participate in such projects to be paid stipends. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1997. Directs the Secretary to use a portion of such funds to: (1) provide for independent evaluation of such programs, with specified criteria for such evaluations; (2) report to the Congress by June 30, 1994, on such evaluations; and (3) disseminate such evaluations. Defines \"auxiliary aid\" and \"disability,\" for HEA purposes, the same as under the American with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Provides that nothing under HEA shall be construed to limit the rights or responsibilities of any individual under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or any other law. Revises need analysis provisions to include an allowance for expenses required for attendance of students with disabilities, including costs of: (1) special services, personal assistance, equipment, assistive technology services and devices (for both the Pell Grant program and other student assistance programs generally under HEA title IV); and (2) transportation and supplies (for such other student assistance programs). Requires that students with disabilities who are taking six or more credit hours at a postsecondary institution be considered as full-time students for purposes of receiving Pell Grants. Requires that the Federal student aid information toll-free telephone number refer students with disabilities and their families to the postsecondary clearinghouse authorized under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act."
