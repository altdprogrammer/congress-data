Prohibits U.S. assistance to any government in the Soviet Union which: (1) has not been freely and democratically chosen and is not moving toward a free society and market economy; (2) is providing military or economic assistance to Cuba, Vietnam, Angola, North Korea or any organization in any country which seeks the violent overthrow of a democratically-elected government or which is associated with the communist party of such country; or (3) devotes more than 15 percent of its annual expenditures to military activities, unless the President reports to the Congress that such expenditures are justified by extraordinary defense or security requirements."
