    "text": "Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire the Elwha River and Glines Canyon Hydroelectric Projects in Clallam County, Washington. Prohibits such acquisition unless the Secretary determines that removal of the Project dams is necessary for the full restoration of the Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries and that funds will be available for such removal within two years after acquisition. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on the plans for the full restoration of the Elwha River ecosystem and the native anadromous fisheries. Directs the owners and the local industrial consumers of the Projects to tender title to the Projects to the United States upon appropriation for payment of a specified sum and the Secretary's determination that the dam removal is necessary. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to take actions necessary to implement: (1) the Elwha River ecosystem and fisheries restoration plan and removal of the dams; (2) management of lands acquired pursuant to this Act which are located outside the exterior boundaries of the Olympic National Park (Glines Project lands are located within and without the boundaries of the Park); and (3) protection of the existing quality and availability of water from the River for municipal and industrial uses from adverse impacts of dam removal. Provides for the continuance of existing licenses or authorizations for the Projects until: (1) the date the Secretary has acquired title; or (2) five years after the expiration of the current license or authorization if the Secretary's report does not provide for dam removal. Directs the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration, following acquisition of the Projects, to deliver all project replacement power required by the operating facilities of the local industrial consumer through the local preference customer at a rate equal to the priority firm rate. Authorizes the Secretary, after funds are appropriated for the conveyance and removal of the dams, to lease certain lands located on Ediz Hook in Clallam County to the city of Port Angeles and to the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe (for the construction of a tribal cultural facility). Authorizes the Secretary, after funds are appropriated for the conveyance and removal of the dams, to acquire and hold in trust in reservation status for the Tribe certain lands in Clallam County for housing, economic development, and morrage for the tribal commercial fishing fleet. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
