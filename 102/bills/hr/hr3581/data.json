Makes budget provisions that are disapproved by the Mayor, but reenacted by two-thirds of the Council or not resubmitted to the Council in a timely manner, part of the budget Act without their transmittal to the President. Revises Federal authority with respect to the budget-making process for the District of Columbia government. Waives the period of congressional review required before District of Columbia Acts take effect. Repeals certain rules governing congressional consideration of District of Columbia Council actions."
