Earmarks observation and assessment funds for such a model. Title II: National Marine Fisheries Service - Amends the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Marine Fisheries Program Authorization Act to authorize appropriations to the Department of Commerce for the National Marine Fisheries Service for: (1) information collection and analysis; (2) conservation and management; and (3) State and industry assistance.

Directs the Secretary to provide at least one NWS liaison officer for each area receiving such public institution liaison and community preparedness services, as of the date of enactment of this Act, from a Weather Service Office (WSO), a Weather Service Meteorological Observatory (WSMO), or an Agricultural Weather Service Center (AWSC). Requires such officer to be provided for at least two years after the WSO, WSMO, or AWSC is closed, consolidated, automated, or relocated. Directs the Secretary to provide such areas with sufficient personnel to ensure that modernization and restructuring of the NWS do not result in degradation in public institution liaison and community preparedness of such areas. Requires the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to identify areas for which there is significant doubt that the Secretary will be able to make a certification that such actions regarding a WSO or a Weather Service Forecast Office will not result in degradation of weather services to the affected area. Requires the Comptroller General to report to specified congressional committees regarding any areas certified by the Secretary which are listed by the NAS as significantly doubtful of certification. Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 to add removal of any NWS radar to the list of actions requiring such certification by the Secretary. Modifies the required contents of the certification and associated procedure. Title V: National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service - Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for NOAA for: (1) satellite observing systems; and (2) completion of the procurement of specified Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites and Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites and the launching and supporting ground systems for each; and (3) data and information services. Amends the Land Remote-Sensing Commercialization Act of 1984 to mandate that any license issued under specified provisions of that Act specify that the licensee shall promptly make available all unenhanced data which the Secretary of the Interior (currently, the Secretary of Commerce) may request under specified provisions of the Act relating to archiving of data. Amends provisions of the Act relating to archiving in order to transfer from the Secretary of Commerce to the Secretary of the Interior responsibility for: (1) providing for long-term storage, maintenance, and upgrading of the basic, global, land remote-sensing data set; (2) requesting data needed for the basic data set from a system operator; (3) making data which is in the public domain available to requesting parties; and (4) using existing Government facilities, to the extent practicable, to carry out these functions. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to consult with the Secretary of Commerce to ensure that archiving activities are consistent with the terms and conditions of any contract, agreement, or license under specified provisions of the Act. Title VI: Buy America Provisions - Sets forth Buy American provisions regarding any contract or subcontract made with funds authorized under this Act for articles, materials, or supplies. Declares ineligible for any contract or subcontract from NOAA any person determined by a court or Federal agency to have affixed a fraudulent \"Made in America\" label to any product. Authorizes awarding to a domestic firm a contract under this Act for goods that, under competitive procedures, would be awarded to a foreign firm, if certain circumstances exist. Title VII: Tropical Cyclone Research Program - Tropical Cyclone Research Act of 1991. Directs the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Commerce to establish a five-year joint program, which expands on the plan established in provisions of this Act relating to Atlantic tropical cyclones, for collecting operational and reconnaissance data, conducting research, and analyzing data on tropical cyclones to assist the forecast and warning program and increase the understanding of the causes and behavior of tropical cyclones. Sets forth the responsibilities of each Secretary. Directs those Secretaries to jointly develop and submit to the Congress management plans for: (1) the program established by this Act; and (2) continued tropical cyclone surveillance and reconnaissance which will adequately protect the citizens of U.S. coastal areas. Mandates that the management plan and program: (1) provide for a minimum of the same level and quality of protection as the current tropical cyclone surveillance and reconnaissance program; and (2) in no way allow any reduction in the level, quality, timeliness, sustainability, and area of served of both the existing principal and back-up severe storm reconnaissance and tracking systems. Title VIII: Program Support - Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for NOAA for: (1) executive direction and administrative activities; (2) acquisition, construction, maintenance, and operation of facilities; (3) marine services; and (4) reactivation and operation of a specified research vessel. Directs the Secretary to acquire space from the Administrator of General Services that meets the long-term needs of NOAA on Near Island in Kodiak, Alaska, provided the annual lease costs do not exceed a specified amount. Prohibits deactivation of any NOAA research vessel until an equivalent replacement is operational. Prohibits construction of any NOAA vessel or its major components in a foreign shipyard. Prohibits NOAA vessels homeported in the United States from being overhauled, repaired, or maintained in a foreign shipyard, except for voyage repairs.
