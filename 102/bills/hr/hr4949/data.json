    "text": "Ozone Protection and Clean Technology Competitive Enhancement Act of 1992 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit: (1) the production of class I or II ozone depleting substances (defined under the Clean Air Act) after 1992; (2) the production and use, within 30 and 90 days of this Act's enactment, respectively, of methyl bromide; and (3) the production of methyl chloroform after 1992. Makes exemptions to such prohibition for pharmaceutical applications and, in the case of class I or II substances, for critical fire protection. Prohibits: (1) the use of chlorine or other chlorinated oxidizing agents in the pulp and paper industry within five years of this Act's enactment; (2) the use of mercury as a biocide and in batteries after 1994; and (3) the sale or promotion of any packaging or product in packaging which includes additives containing lead, cadmium, mercury, or hexavalent chromium after 1994. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to report to the Congress on: (1) sunset candidates (toxic substances with a capacity for bioaccumulation or persistence in the environment), along with a list of alternatives to such substances and recommendations for their phaseout; (2) organochlorines and organobromines produced in quantities of more than 25,000 pounds per year, uses of such substances, and recommendations for eliminating their use; and (3) uses of elemental chlorine and chlorinated oxidizing agents of more than 1,000 tons per year, alternatives for such substances, and recommendations for eliminating their use. Prohibits any facility from replacing the manufacture, import, processing, use, or sale of any sunset candidate with any substitute toxic substance with a known or probable carcinogen, teratogen, or mutagen or with any alternative product or process that creates new public health or environmental risks. Directs the Administrator to establish a fee on the manufacture, import, or sale of sunset candidates. Requires fee proceeds to be used solely for worker retraining, adjustment, and education, and for jobs development programs for workers displaced by the phaseout of sunset candidates."
