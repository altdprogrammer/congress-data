Directs the President, if such an agreement has not been reached or the Japanese Government is failing to comply with such an agreement, to impose additional duties on Japanese imports. Requires such duties to be structured to generate, within five years after the end of the Persian Gulf conflict, revenue in an amount equal to that required under the agreement. Continues such duties until the earlier of: (1) the date on which the required revenue is generated; and (2) the date on which the President determines that Japan is complying with such an agreement."
