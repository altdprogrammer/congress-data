Requires that the yard waste (leaves and grass trimmings) and cafeteria waste (food waste) at such installation be composted, rather than be disposed of in a landfill or by other conventional means. Requires the compost produced to be used for soil amendment or in another appropriate manner as determined by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on the implementation of the pilot program, including a recommendation as to whether similar programs should be carried out at other military installations."
