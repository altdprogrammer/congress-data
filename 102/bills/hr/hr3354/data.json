Makes eligible for independent status also any student with a history of self-sufficiency or a history of having been a victim of child abuse or spouse abuse (as well as other unusual circumstances), as determined and documented by a financial aid administrator. Applies such revised independent student definition to the Pell Grant program as well as to other student assistance generally. Makes less-than-half-time students eligible, under specified conditions, under the guaranteed student loan (Stafford) program and under the Pell Grant program. Applies provisions for repayment grace periods and deferrals to less-than-half-time students under the guaranteed student loan (Stafford) and the direct student loan (Perkins) programs."
