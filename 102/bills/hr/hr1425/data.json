    "text": "Improved Rural and Short Line Railroad Service Act - Amends Federal transportation law to prohibit the Interstate Commerce Commission from approving an application for abandonment or discontinuance of railroad lines and rail transportation in rural and agricultural areas unless the rail carrier can demonstrate that good faith efforts have been made to transfer or sell the line to an operator having the good faith intent to operate it as an ongoing railroad. Requires a rail carrier when filing an application and notice of intent to list a railroad line for abandonment or discontinuance to include in such notice evidence of dry bulk agricultural commodity shipments for the preceding ten years in cases where such abandonment or discontinuance would occur at facilities that originate shipments of such products. Requires such rail carriers to make specified records and justifications available to government agencies or local governments. Grants lessees of property or facilities owned by a rail carrier proposing an abandonment or discontinuance the right of first refusal to buy a facility served by the line to be abandoned or discontinued."
