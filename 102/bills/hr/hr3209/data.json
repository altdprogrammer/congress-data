Provides that if a career Senior Executive Service appointee performs any military service for which such special pay is applicable, that period of military service shall be disregarded in determining: (1) the due date for meeting recertification requirements; (2) the period for meeting recertification after being conditionally certified; and (3) the period permitted for filing appeals of certification questions with the Merit Systems Protection Board. Permits such employees and any other employees who leave Federal service in order to perform military service and who are subsequently reemployed by the Federal Government to elect to participate in, and to make retroactive contributions to, the Thrift Savings Plan. Provides that the life and health insurance benefits of such an employee who enters on leave without pay status as a result of being ordered to active duty during the Persian Gulf Conflict shall continue for the duration of such duty. Requires the employing agency to pay both the employee's and Government's share of the employee's health insurance premium during such period. Allows individuals who are separated from Government service voluntarily, who were members of the armed forces ordered to active duty before December 1, 1990, in connection with Operation Desert Shield, who are entitled to an annuity 90 days after termination of the period of active duty, and who could have elected as of November 30, 1990, an alternative form of annuity, to make such an election within 90 days of termination of active duty."
