    "text": "Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to revise the definition of a \"contribution or expenditure\" by a national bank, corporation, or labor organization to: (1) include communications to influence any election for Federal office by a corporation to its stockholders and executive or administrative personnel and their families or by a labor organization to its members and their families; and (2) repeal provisions excluding non-partisan registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns. Requires any payments by corporations or labor organizations for all other communications and for the establishment of, and solicitation of contributions for, a separate segregated fund for purposes relating to any such election to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission in the same manner as for contributions or expenditures. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to subject to the limitations and reporting requirements for expenditures any payment for a mixed political activity by a national or State committee of a political party. Requires such payment to be made only from an account subject to the requirements of that Act."
