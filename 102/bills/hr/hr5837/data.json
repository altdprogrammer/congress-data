Requires: (1) the Federal Health Board established by this Act to provide, subject to certain requirements, for copayments and out-of-pocket limits; and (2) the Federal Health Priorities Council established by this Act to study: (1) whether out-of-pocket limits should be modified to take into account family size and composition; (2) whether co-payments effectively contain costs and whether they are an administrative burden on providers; (3) the effects of the continuation of duplicative private insurance on the quality, access, and cost of the public insurance program; and (4) whether cost sharing should be different for individuals who engage in practices deemed to increase the likelihood of service use. Subtitle B: Long-Term Care Services - Requires that the Board set standards for eligibility, long-term care services coverage, income protection, and case management. Requires that long-term care include at least home- and community-based services, nursing home care, hospice care, home medical equipment, and services for individuals with developmental disabilities and mental illness. Requires the Board to establish an income-related cost sharing schedule. Requires reduction of cost sharing to ensure that the income and assets of the individual using long-term care services under this Act are sufficient to: (1) cover all items needed in addition to those provided by the long-term care facility; (2) maintain the individual's primary residence; and (3) maintain the individual's independence once the individual no longer needs long-term care services. Requires a reduction in cost sharing to ensure that the income of the spouse, dependent, parent, or guardian of the individual using long-term care services is not reduced below certain levels. Provides for the appointment of a Long-Term Care Services Assessment Commission to make recommendations annually regarding specified aspects of long-term care under this Act. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle C: Modification of Services - Requires annual recommendations by the Priorities Council regarding changes in services under this Act.

Requires computation of national average per capita costs, adjustments for risk groups, and adjustments for specified factors in each State. Provides for determination by the Board of the Federal and State shares of expenditures, subject to congressional disapproval. Entitles each State with an approved State program to a Federal contribution of the Federal share plus that State's total projected expenditures for services under this Act. Prohibits a State, either by intention or as an unstated consequence of budget allocations, from restricting timely access to medically necessary and appropriate services under this Act or permitting queues to form that have the potential to be life threatening. Subtitle B: Payments to Providers - Provides for State payments to hospitals and other health care and long-term care institutions for the areas of operating, capital, and health training expenses. Sets forth principles for guiding State reimbursement negotiation boards in each such area. Requires the State practitioner reimbursement negotiation board to negotiate with the State organizations representing each of the practitioner disciplines to derive a relative value scale fee schedule fulfilling specified principles. Sets forth principles for negotiating reimbursement rates for nonphysician providers. Declares payment by a State program to be payment in full. Subtitle C: Revenues - Requires the Board to develop a mechanism for determining and collecting a premium from individuals and employers. Requires the Board, subject to congressional disapproval, to collect premiums from individuals and employers according to certain requirements, including that the premiums from: (1) individuals be income-based and progressive; and (2) employers be based on each employer's ability to pay.

Authorizes and appropriates: (1) amounts equal to appropriations under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act and under provisions of Federal law relating to the Civilian Health and Medical Plan of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) and relating to health insurance for Federal officials and employees; (2) additional sums as required to cover administrative expenses and grants; (3) payments to each State for the Federal share of expenditures under this Act; and (4) sums as determined by the Board to be necessary to cover contingencies. Declares that the receipts and disbursements of the Fund shall not be included in the totals of the U.S. budget and exempts them from any general budget limitation. Makes each State responsible for establishing a financing program for the implementation of the State program. Title V: Congressional Consideration - Sets forth rules, changeable as any other rule of the House of Representatives or the Senate, regarding congressional disapproval resolutions under this Act. Title VI: Private Options - Declares that this Act does not prohibit private insurance coverage supplementing the services covered under this Act.

Declares that the purchase of any private insurance does not relieve the purchaser of the payment of premiums under this Act.

Authorizes appropriations to carry out provisions of the Public Health Service Act relating to the National Health Service Corps.

Allows community and migrant health centers in existence at enactment of this Act to use any increase in revenue resulting from the increase in the number of insured patients treated for the expansion of the amounts and types of services furnished, to serve additional patients or areas, or to promote the recruitment, training, or retention of personnel.
