Provides that if a recipient utilizes a leased employee of an organization that maintains a retirement plan with a funding deficiency, then the recipient is treated as the employer for retirement purposes. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations to ensure prompt reporting and deposits of withholding and payroll taxes by qualified leasing organizations, including procedures for registering such organizations."
