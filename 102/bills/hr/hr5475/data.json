Provides that the Government's action or inaction may include altering, by statute or rule, the regulatory approval procedures, standards, or requirements in a case in which there has been material reliance by an applicant on the prior procedures, standards, or requirements. Extends the terms of certain patents for: (1) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; (2) olestra; (3) the insignia of the United Daughters of the Confederacy; and (4) badges of the American Legion, the American Legion Women's Auxiliary, and the Sons of the American Legion. Limits the rights derived from the extension of any patent by this Act to use for which the subject matter of the patent was approved by the Food and Drug Administration."
