Mandates additional amounts in any year when the forecasted inflow to the Shasta Reservoir exceeds a specified level. Directs the Secretary, by a specified date and with the full participation of the Hoopa Valley Tribe, to complete the Trinity River Flow Evaluation Study currently being conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in a manner which insures recommendations regarding permanent instream fishery flow requirements, Trinity River Division operating criteria, and procedures for the restoration and maintenance of the Trinity River fishery. Provides for increases in releases and implementation of the operating criteria and procedures, depending on whether the Secretary and the Tribe concur in the study recommendations."
