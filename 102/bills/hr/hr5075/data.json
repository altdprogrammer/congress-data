    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-05-06", 
    "text": "Veterans In Transition Act - Directs the Secretary of Defense to provide post-service training vouchers to eligible members of the armed forces who apply in order to finance employment retraining provided through programs established under the Job Training Partnership Act. Requires such vouchers to be provided to such members within 60 days of their separation from active duty. Defines as eligible those members serving on active duty or full-time National Guard duty on September 30, 1990, who were either involuntarily separated or separated under one of the military separation incentive programs, and who were not entitled to retired or retainer pay incident to such separation. Requires such a member to certify to the Secretary that the member is unemployed and does not have a firm commitment for employment upon separation. Directs the Secretary to provide such vouchers to certain unemployed members who did not receive such vouchers due to lack of the required certification. Authorizes the Secretary to provide such vouchers to other members discharged or released from active duty if they would benefit from the training provided. Directs the Secretary to provide appropriate notification to members eligible for such vouchers. Provides for the determination of voucher amounts, requiring such amounts to be generally equal to the cost of providing the training required to achieve the employment objective chosen by the member. Directs the Secretary of Labor to assist the Secretary in determining voucher amounts. Authorizes any member receiving such a voucher to exchange it for employment and training services provided under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to the same extent as other individuals eligible to receive such services. Requires such vouchers to be used within a two-year period after discharge, release, or separation. Directs the Secretary, after receiving a voucher, to reimburse the training provider for the actual cost of providing such training, not to exceed the face value of the voucher. Prohibits more than ten percent of the funds provided under this Act from being used for administrative costs. Prohibits the training providers, in accepting vouchers in exchange for employment and training services under the JTPA, from: (1) reducing the number of individuals who receive such services in the absence of the voucher program; or (2) denying such services to veterans who are eligible for such services but do not have a voucher. Directs the Secretary to notify the State agency administering the JTPA in which the member intends to reside and take up training. Amends the JTPA to include such separated members in the defense conversion adjustment program provided under such Act. Requires preseparation counseling of members about to be discharged or released from active duty to occur as soon as possible, but not later than 90 days before the date of discharge (currently, upon discharge). Includes as part of such counseling the creation of a transition plan for the member and spouse to achieve educational, training, and employment objectives. Directs the Secretary to consult with the Secretaries of Labor, Education, and Veterans Affairs and the Economic Adjustment Committee to improve the coordination of, and eliminate duplication between, specified job training and placement programs available to members who are discharged or released from active duty. Directs the Secretary to use ten percent of the amount authorized to be appropriated under this Act for the financing of specified coordination efforts. Directs the Secretary, as part of the preseparation counseling provided to discharged or released members, to insure that information is provided to interested members with respect to the establishment and operation of small businesses. Authorizes the Secretary to make a grant to a member eligible for a training voucher to assist such member in establishing a small business after such discharge or release. Authorizes the Secretary to make a grant to a business owned or operated by a veteran to assist the business to employ members eligible for training vouchers. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the head of a Federal agency under which the agency makes grants to States and local governments and nonprofit organizations to establish internships or other training programs for members eligible for training vouchers. Provides that all such grants will be made in lieu of providing the member with a training voucher. Authorizes the Secretary, in order to assist discharged or released members and their spouses in locating civilian employment, to conduct marketing and employer outreach activities to promote the creation of employment opportunities for such members and spouses. Authorizes appropriations."
