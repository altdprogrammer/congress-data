Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to revise such criteria if they do not meet such requirement. Requires States to submit to the Administrator for approval a chemical-specific numeric water quality standard for dioxin that is at least as stringent as the criteria established by this Act. Sets forth standard approval and modification procedures. Provides that the criteria established for dioxin by this Act shall take effect for any State without an approved standard. Requires the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service to conduct a study to: (1) assess the impact of discharges of dioxin on wildlife and the aquatic environment; (2) evaluate the potential effects of uptake and accumulation of dioxin in wildlife and aquatic life on the food chain and public health; and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of public health-oriented criteria to protect wildlife and aquatic life from the effects of dioxin discharges."
