    "text": "United States Marshal Service Amendments Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal judicial code to make incarcerated persons ineligible for witness fees. Amends the Federal criminal code to require that, if the Attorney General authorizes protection to an alien under the witness protection program, the appropriate U.S. officials provide such alien with appropriate immigration visas and allow such alien to remain in the United States as long as that alien abides by all U.S. laws and guidelines, rules, and regulations for protection. Authorizes the Attorney General, upon determining that the granting of permanent resident status to such alien is in the public interest and necessary for the safety and protection of such alien, to grant such status without regard to the alien's admissibility under the immigration laws or any other laws and regulations, subject to specified conditions. Specifies that permanent resident status shall not be granted under this Act to an alien who would be excluded because of felony criminal convictions, unless the Attorney General determines that granting such status is necessary to the interests of justice. Limits the number of aliens and members of their immediate families entering the United States under this Act to 100 persons in any one fiscal year."
