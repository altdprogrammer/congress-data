Makes the reduction effective the first pay period beginning on or after the date the Congress receives the report from the Secretary of the Treasury relating to such fiscal year. Requires such reductions in salary to be disregarded the first pay period beginning on or after the date the Congress receives a report indicating that total receipts of the Federal Government are greater than or equal to its total expenditures for a fiscal year. Requires restoration of the Member's salary for such position to the level which would then be in effect without enactment of this Act. Mandates such pay adjustments before any other adjustment scheduled to take effect on the same day for the same position. Prohibits the House of Representatives or the Senate from considering any bill or resolution increasing the salary for Members of Congress, with specified exceptions, unless the bill or resolution deals with no subject matter other than a pay increase for members. Requires a recorded vote by the House or Senate in the passage or adoption of such bill or resolution to reflect the vote of each Member voting."
