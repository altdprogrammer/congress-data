Directs the Secretary to study the feasibility of producing double walled rail tank cars, the safety improvements offered by such cars, and the cost effectiveness of using them. Authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations: (1) for the safe transportation of hazardous materials over dangerous routes; and (2) that require the use of double walled rail tank cars in the transportation of hazardous materials. Requires the Secretary to take into account risk assessments in issuing safety regulations."
