    "text": "Short-Time Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991 - Provides that adoption of short-time compensation programs (which provide partial unemployment benefits to individuals whose workweeks have been reduced under qualified employer plans providing for shortened workweeks in lieu of layoffs) as part of State unemployment compensation law is not precluded by any Federal law (including specified Internal Revenue Code provisions). Declares that benefits payable under a short-time compensation program shall be treated as unemployment compensation payable for partial unemployment, for purposes of Federal law. Directs the Secretary of Labor to assist States in establishing and implementing short-time compensation programs by: (1) developing model legislative language and proposing appropriate revisions; and (2) providing technical assistance and guidance. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on implementation of this Act. Requires annual State review of qualified employer plans to assure that they continue to meet short-time compensation program requirements of this Act and any applicable State law."
