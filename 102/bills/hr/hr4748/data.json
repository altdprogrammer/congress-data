Requires each eligible institution entering such a program agreement, if it experiences a percentage increase in its cost of attendance exceeding a certain amount, to report to the Director on such increase and its justification.

Sets forth annual and aggregate limits on the amounts of such loans to individuals, with adjustments for inflation and for less than full-time students. Sets forth terms of such loans and provisions for disbursement of proceeds.
