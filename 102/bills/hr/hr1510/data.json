Requires any individual, retail or wholesale seller, or manufacturer of such batteries to dispose of them only by delivery to an authorized secondary lead smelter, an authorized collection or recycling facility, or other specified entities. Sets penalties for violations of this Act. Establishes additional battery collection requirements, including requirements that: (1) retailers give written notice to customers about the illegality of improperly discarding used motor vehicle, and other types of, lead-acid batteries; and (2) retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers accept such batteries for recycling without charge. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) prescribe regulations, including a model notice for use by retailers; and (2) inspect any establishment subject to this Act and issue warnings and citations to individuals for failures to comply. Prohibits the sale of any lead-acid battery not bearing a permanent label containing information about the illegality of improper disposal and the requirement that retailers must accept used lead-acid batteries for recycling in exchange for new batteries purchased. Directs the Administrator to study and report to the Congress on the disposal and potential recyclability of household dry-cell batteries."
