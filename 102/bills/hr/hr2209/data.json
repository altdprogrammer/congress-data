Prohibits the use of such reclaimed water for direct or indirect groundwater recharge, including spreading ponds and aquifer saltwater intrusion barriers, unless: (1) an environmental impact statement is completed in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 prior to such recharge; (2) the presence of any contaminant, as tested monthly at the injection wellhead or above ground, will not adversely affect the health of persons and does not violate the maximum contaminant levels of the national primary and secondary drinking water regulations, all Environmental Protection Agency drinking water health advisories, and all State drinking water action levels, with exceptions; (3) a monitoring program which includes a toxicity assessment, undertaken in cooperation with scientists from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and funded by the Secretary, has and continues monthly to demonstrate that the effluent does not cause adverse health effects on a variety of organisms in a series of toxicity bioassays; and (4) a monitoring program is established by NAS, and funded by the Secretary, to evaluate the effects of reclaimed water on the aquifer. Authorizes the Secretary to contribute 25 percent of such projects's total costs. Bars the expenditure of Federal funds for operation and maintenance of the project, except for monitoring. Authorizes appropriations."
