    "text": "Native Hawaiian Health Care Amendments of 1992 - Amends the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988 to set specified Health objectives for Native Hawaiians to be met by the year 2000. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to report to the Congress annually on progress being made toward meeting such objectives. States that an entity qualifying to receive primary and preventive health grants must be a Native Hawaiian health care system. Limits to five (currently nine) the number of grant or contract recipients. Makes Papa Ola Lokahi (the Statewide Native Hawaiian health coordinating agency) responsible for the: (1) implementation and updating of the Native Hawaiian health care master plan; (2) training for specified health care pratitioners, community outreach workers, counselors, and cultural educators; (3) identification of and research into the diseases that are most prevalent among Native Hawaiians; (4) development of an action plan outlining the contributions that each member organization of Papa Ola Lokahi will make in carrying out this Act. Permits Papa Ola Lokahi to receive special project funds that may be appropriated for the purpose of research on the health status of Native Hawaiians or for addressing the health care needs of Native Hawaiians. Requires Papa Ola Lokahi to serve as a clearinghouse for: (1) the collection and maintenance of data associated with the health status of Native Hawaiians; (2) the identification and research into diseases affecting Native Hawaiians; (3) the availability of Native Hawaiian project funds, research projects, and publications; (4) the collaboration of research in the area of Native Hawaiian health; and (5) the dissemination of information pertinent to the Native Hawaiian health care systems. Exempts Papa Ola Lokahi from the ten percent limitation on the use of grants for administrative costs. Revises the Native Hawaiian health scholarships program to make scholarship grants available under the same terms as the National Health Service corps, provided that: (1) the types of practitioners for which grants are to be directed shall be based upon the needs of the Native Hawaiian health care systems, as identified by Papa Ola Lokahi; (2) priority shall be given to applicants identified by the Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate; and (3) service obligation shall be met by service in one of the Native Hawaiian health care systems, or in a health care shortage area. States that such scholarship program shall not be administered by or through the Indian Health Service. Redefines for purposes of such Act: (1) \"Native Hawaiian\" (requiring the individual to be a U.S. citizen); (2) \"Native Hawaiian health care system\"; and (3) \"Papa Ola Lokahi.\" Authorizes appropriations."
