Title II: Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research on Space and Aeronautics - Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research on Space and Aeronautics Act - Directs the Administrator of NASA to establish an Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research on Space and Aeronautics among eligible States. Obligates funds for program grants. Title III: General Provisions - Permits appropriations for the first two numbered categories of titles I and II to be used for certain items of a capital nature (other than land acquisition) required for the performance of research and development contracts and for grants to nonprofit educational and research organizations for purchase or construction of additional research facilities. Prohibits the use of these funds for the construction of any major facility whose estimated cost exceeds a specified amount, unless the Administrator of NASA notifies specified congressional committees. Authorizes use of certain funds, subject to limitations, for: (1) facilities construction, repair, or modification; (2) unforeseen programmatic facility project needs; and (3) repair or modification of General Services Administration facilities. Permits upward variances of funds for facilities construction under circumstances outlined in this Act. Authorizes certain fund transfers and makes available specified funds for the construction and modification of facilities. Requires the Administrator to notify specified congressional committees of the nature, cost, and reasons for such construction before expending the funds in question. Prohibits, until 30 days following congressional receipt of the Administrator's full explanation, the use of funds appropriated pursuant to this Act for any program that: (1) has been deleted by the Congress; (2) is in excess of the amount actually authorized for the particular program by specified provisions; or (3) has not been presented to either of specified congressional committees. Expresses the sense of the Congress that NASA should geographically distribute its research and development funds whenever possible. Prohibits the use of civil space stations authorized under this Act for non-peaceful purposes. Requires the Administrator to submit to the Congress an annual budget of programs whose development costs are expected to exceed a specified amount. Requires: (1) the Administrator to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the single stage rocket technology flight test program; and (2) the National Space Council to report to such committees on a national aerospace transportation technology plan. Amends the Commercial Space Launch Act to extend through January 1, 2000, the deadline for Government payment of certain launch-related third party claims. Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to authorize the Administrator to protect from dissemination information developed under Space Act agreements with non-Federal parties for up to five years. Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to authorize the National Science Foundation to foster the development and use of computer networks in support of research and education. Directs the National Space Council to prepare a plan and to report to the Congress on increased space program cooperation between the United States and the Republics of the former Soviet Union. Directs the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to: (1) establish an Institute for Aviation Weather Prediction, which shall expand upon the activities of the aviation unit currently at the National Severe Storms Center in Kansas City, Missouri; and (2) provide an opportunity for Center employees to assume comparable Institute duties."
