Title II: Agricultural Export Programs - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to consolidate the short and intermediate term direct credit sales programs. Makes specified revisions to the export credit guarantee program. Amends the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to expand the Commodity Credit Corporation's authority to combine such programs. Provides with regard to such programs for: (1) funding levels without fiscal year restriction; and (2) unused fund transferability. Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to broaden the program of providing agricultural commodities to emerging democracies to include subdivisions of a country."
