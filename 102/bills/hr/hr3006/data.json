Requires the systems architecture to: (1) incorporate data on solar variability as an essential data element; (2) maximize the use of existing data and technologies to make the data available to scientists and policymakers quickly and in a cost-effective manner; (3) minimize the need for development and operations costs; (4) utilize existing or planned U.S. assets; and (5) initiate operations by December 31, 1995."
