Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to give institutions, agencies, and organizations sponsoring such program projects notice as to the status of their application for funds at least ten months prior to the expiration of existing funding or the proposed start-up-date. Directs the Secretary to encourage coordination of such programs with other programs for disadvantaged students operated by the sponsoring institution or agency, regardless of funding source. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring a separate director for a project funded under the TRIO programs if this would hinder such coordination. Extends through FY 1996 the authorization of appropriations for TRIO programs. Requires that participants in Talent Search program projects either have completed five years (currently six years) of elementary education or be at least 11 years old (currently 12 years old)."
