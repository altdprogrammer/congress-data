Requires the Secretary of State to forward a copy of such principles to member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and encourage them to promote such principles. Requires each U.S. national to register with the Secretary of State and indicate whether they agree to implement such principles. Sets forth specified reporting requirements."
