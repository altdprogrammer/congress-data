Title II: Vaccine Injury Compensation - Amends the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 to remove provisions making the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program ineffective when there are insufficient funds to pay all claims payable under the Program. Extends to January 1, 1993, the due date for an evaluation of the Program. Increases the amount of time the special master may, because of the workload, suspend proceedings on any petition associated with the administration of vaccines before the effective date of the Program. Modifies procedures in the event a special master fails to make certain decisions or a U.S. Claims Court fails to enter certain judgments within specified time limits. Requires certain compensation for injury before the effective date of the Program to be paid from appropriations in a lump sum (currently, paid in four equal installments) from which the special master may purchase an annuity or take other actions. Regulates purchase of such an annuity. Modifies requirements regarding decisionmaking procedures of the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines."
