    "text": "Neighborhood Schools Improvement Act - Title I: Comprehensive Restructuring - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to add a new title VIII, Restructuring Program. National Education Standards and Assessment Act of 1992 - Establishes, under such new title, the National Education Standards and Assessment program, to: (1) advance establishment of voluntary national education content standards and raise student and school academic performance; and (2) provide funds for developing voluntary national school delivery standards and for further research and development on assessment to measure progress in meeting national education goals and standards. Establishes a National Education Goals Panel (the Panel). Provides that the Panel shall be composed of 18 members, as follows: (1) two appointed by the President; (2) eight Governors (three from the same political party as the President, and five from the opposite political party); (3) four Members of Congress; and (4) four State legislators. Sets forth special appointment rules, and requirements for terms of service. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth various functions of the Panel, including: (1) establishing an interactive process for developing voluntary national education content and school delivery standards; (2) recommending groups and organizations to be selected for grants to develop such standards and model assessments of the content standards for mathematics; (3) certifying the voluntary national standards submitted by such groups (after review by a technical review committee); (4) proposing various measures for evaluating such standards and progress; (5) selecting various measures and indicators in each goal area; (6) requiring State reporting of student achievement data to be in the context of other relevant information about student, school, and system performance; and (7) issuing an annual report card. Requires the Panel to: (1) operate on the principle of consensus in carrying out its responsibilities; and (2) make arrangements with any appropriate entity to generate or collect data to assess progress toward meeting the national education goals. Requires the Panel to establish a technical review committee (the Committee) to advise and assist it. Requires the Panel to solicit and consider public nominations in appointing Committee members. Requires the Committee to be composed of: (1) eight educators, including individuals with expertise on standards and assessments; and (2) eight members of the public representing parents, business, civil rights advocates, child advocates, and State and local officials. Requires the Committee to review content and delivery standards developed by groups under grants and recommend whether they should be certified by the Panel. Directs the Panel to issue an annual National Report Card (Card), including: (1) analysis of U.S. progress toward national goals; (2) comments and recommendations of Federal and State policymakers, representatives of business, and experts on teaching and child development, measurements, curriculum, and educational administration; and (3) identification of continuing gaps in existing educational data. Requires the Panel to: (1) continue to issue the Card annually during its existence; and (2) present such Cards in a form understandable to parents and the general public. Prohibit such Cards from including data using achievement goals established under specified provisions of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA), unless such goals have been reviewed and approved by the Commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to make grants for: (1) Panel operation and activities; (2) development of voluntary national education content standards; and (3) development of voluntary national school delivery standards. Defines education content (content) standards as a description, in a particular subject area, of the knowledge and skills children should acquire at each grade level. Defines school delivery (delivery) standards as the standards necessary to ensure that each student in a school has a fair opportunity to achieve the knowledge and skills set out in the national education content standards and the work force readiness standards. Directs the Panel to: (1) establish the processes by which such content and delivery standards are to be developed; (2) make recommendations to the Secretary regarding selection of grantees to develop such standards (teacher and practitioner groups and organizations for content, specified types of consortia for delivery); (3) review and certify such standards after the developing groups or consortia have ratified them; (4) report to the Congress, President, and public on such certified content and delivery standards by December 31, 1994; (5) triennially review the content standards; and (6) make recommendations to the Secretary research on authentic assessment which the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) should undertake. Directs the Secretary, through the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), to conduct an evaluation and issue reports, including: (1) an evaluation of the effectiveness of the school delivery standards, OERI research on authentic assessment, and the model assessments for national content standards for mathematics; (2) recommendations regarding the need for additional criteria to determine the validity, reliability, and fairness of assessments; and (3) criteria for evaluating assessments' technical quality in relation to intended use and their alignment with content standards. Directs NAS to submit interim and final reports on such evaluation to the Secretary, the Congress, and the public by December 31 of 1993 and 1994. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1996 for the Panel, and for FY 1993 and 1994 for such: (1) evaluations and reports; (2) national content standards; and (3) national school delivery standards.
