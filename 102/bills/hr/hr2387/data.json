Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act. Authorizes the Secretaries to enter into cooperative agreements with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. Extends to September 30, 1994, the termination date of the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act. Amends the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act to modify the required contents of striped bass population studies. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the studies. Removes provisions requiring notice to the Congress if the studies should be continued beyond September 30, 1982. Amends Federal law to remove provisions: (1) authorizing a fishery management plan on Atlantic striped bass; and (2) terminating, after September 30, 1991, certain provisions relating to protection of striped bass in the Exclusive Economic Zone."
