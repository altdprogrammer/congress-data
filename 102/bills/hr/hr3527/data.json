Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to authorize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue licenses for the export of highly enriched uranium used as fuel or target in nuclear research or test reactors only if the Commission determines that: (1) there is no alternative nuclear reactor fuel or target that can be used; (2) the proposed recipient of such uranium has provided assurances that it will use an alternative nuclear reactor fuel or target whenever it can in lieu of highly enriched uranium; and (3) the United States is developing such an alternative for the proposed export."
