    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) it should be U.S. policy to help the former Soviet republics and Baltic states achieve economic and political stability; and (2) the President should prepare and transmit to the Congress a plan to assist the former Soviet republics that includes actions to provide prompt humanitarian assistance, combat the proliferation of nuclear weapons, provide technical assistance to facilitate the emergence of free market economies, and assist the development of democratic, free market societies that protect individual rights. Conditions U.S. assistance to the former Soviet republics upon the agreement of the recipient government to reimburse the U.S. Government. Encourages such reimbursement through the provision of natural resources, such as oil and petroleum products, and stockpiled strategic and critical materials. Prohibits assistance to any former Soviet republic that: (1) has not been freely and democratically chosen or that is not moving toward a free market economy and privatization; (2) takes actions to restrict the emigration of, or discriminate against, Jews or Christians; (3) is providing military or economic assistance to Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, Angola, or any organization in any country that seeks the violent overthrow of a democratically-elected government; or (4) has failed to undertake a major reduction in defense expenditures or refused to initiate a program to destroy a significant portion of nuclear weapons located in its territory."
