    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-11-04", 
    "text": "Amends Federal transportation law to direct the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), in determining the reasonableness of a tariff rate for transportation or service previously rendered by a motor common carrier (except household goods carriers), where the motor carrier is claiming a tariff rate higher than the rate originally offered, billed, and collected, to find the claimed rate unreasonable to the extent that it exceeds the rate charged by and paid to the same motor carrier or other motor carriers for like transportation or service. Shortens the statute of limitations for the filing of claims: (1) by a motor common carrier for recovery of transportation or service charges; and (2) by a person to recover overcharges by a motor carrier. Decreases the limitation period for both kinds of claims from 36 months to: (1) 24 months for claim accruals during the year following enactment on this Act; and (2) 18 months for claim accruals on or after one year following enactment. Permits motor carriers and shippers to resolve by mutual consent, subject to Commission review and approval, any overcharge and undercharge claims resulting from billing errors or incorrect tariff provisions arising from the inadvertent failure to properly and timely file and maintain agreed upon rates, rules, or classifications."
