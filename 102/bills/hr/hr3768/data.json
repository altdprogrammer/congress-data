Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a copy of such schedule to certain congressional committees and to consult with them regarding repayment terms.

Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require certain large institutions engaged in interstate banking to submit reports of financial conditions including specified aspects of loan data for each State in which such institutions maintain branches. Subtitle D: Prompt Regulatory Action - Requires each appropriate Federal banking agency and the FDIC to prescribe regulations for implementation of a prompt regulatory action system which includes: (1) uniform standards; (2) minimum capital requirements; (3) deadlines for submission and review of capital restoration plans; (4) standards for safety and soundness; and (5) asset growth guidelines. Sets capital distribution restrictions for any insured depository institution that does not meet all currently applicable capital standards after making such distribution. Requires undercapitalized depository institutions to submit capital restoration plans with specified contents. Sets forth regulatory guidelines and restrictions for depository institutions according to risk categories (including the appointment of conservators or receivers for national banks and Federal savings associations not in compliance with statutory capital standards). Authorizes the FDIC Board of Directors to appoint the FDIC as sole conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution (after consultation with the appropriate Federal or State agency) after a determination that specified risk conditions have been met. Subtitle E: Least-Cost Resolution - Mandates that FDIC assistance to troubled insured depository institutions be in accord with prescribed least-cost resolution guidelines to ensure that such assistance is the least costly of all possible methods to the affected deposit insurance fund. Mandates an annual General Accounting Office (GAO) audit of the FDIC and the Resolution Trust Corporation to to determine compliance with such least-cost approach. Sets forth procedural guidelines with respect to: (1) creditors' claims; (2) data collection; (3) financial services industry impact analyses before resolution of a troubled insured depository institution; and (4) financial assistance prior to appointment of a receiver or conservator.

Outlines approval and termination procedures. Authorizes the Board to examine each branch or agency of a foreign bank or foreign entities engaged in lending practices. Mandates annual on-site examinations of such entities and outlines a coordinated examination procedure with the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC. Prohibits foreign banks from establishing representative offices without the Board's prior approval. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require a financial institution to file a consolidated report with the appropriate Federal banking agency if the credit it extends (currently, if the loan or loans it makes) to an insured depository institution is secured by 25 percent or more of any class of shares of an insured depository institution. Amends the International Banking Act of 1978 to authorize the Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision to disclose to their foreign counterparts information obtained in the course of exercising supervisory or examination authority, subject to confidentiality requirements. Sets forth a civil money penalty schedule for violations of such Act by a foreign bank. Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to declare that consideration of a bank's managerial resources by the Board includes the competence, experience, and integrity of its officers, directors, and principal shareholders.

Amends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to require the appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency to consider and give credit for capital investment, loan participation, and other ventures undertaken by nonminority-owned and nonwomen-owned financial institutions with minority and women-owned financial institutions and with low-income credit unions that help meet the credit needs of their local communities. Amends the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to require specified Federal agencies to: (1) refer to the Attorney General any cases in which there is reason to believe that a pattern or practice of credit discrimination exists with respect to credit application denials or discouragement; and (2) notify the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development of those cases in which there is reason to believe that a violation of the Fair Housing Act has occurred. Prohibits any appropriate Federal banking agency from requiring an institution to engage in data collection to fulfill Fair Housing Act requirements (other than under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act). Requires the Secretary of the Treasury and the head of each appropriate Federal banking agency to review and report to the Congress on laws and regulations which might adversely affect the capital position and profitability of insured depository institutions. Amends the Expedited Funds Availability Act with respect to funds held beyond statutory schedules to mandate a one-year interval between required notices to the depositor. Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to proscribe: (1) any preauthorized electronic fund transfer from a consumer's account on the basis of any form of check negotiation by a consumer; or (2) treatment of any provision contained in a check received by a depository institution and negotiated by a consumer as constituting an electronic funds transfer authorization. Amends the Expedited Funds Availability Act to make permanent the four-business days waiting period before a depositor may withdraw funds deposited at an automated teller machine owned or operated by a depository institution other than his own. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to set forth notification and policy guidelines to be followed by an insured depository institution with respect to advance notice of branch closures. Subtitle C: Bank Enterprise Act - Bank Enterprise Act of 1991 - Directs the Board and the FDIC to establish minimum requirements according to prescribed criteria so that certain accounts providing basic consumer transaction services at insured depository institutions may qualify as lifeline accounts.

Sets forth assessment procedures. Directs the Community Enterprise Assessment Credit Board (established by this Act) to issue guidelines according to specified criteria to determine community enterprise assessment credits for: (1) eligible insured depository institutions providing financial assistance to low- and moderate-income clients in distressed communities; (2) small business developers; and (3) nonprofit developers. Establishes the Community Enterprise Assessment Credit Board to establish procedures for accepting and considering applications by insured depository institutions for such assessment credits. Outlines the criteria under which an insured depository institution shall be treated as either a community development organization or a bank. Sets forth criteria for community development banks, organizations and corporations (thus making entities which meet such criteria eligible for specified insurance premium credits). Title III: Federal Deposit Insurance Reform - Subtitle A: Activities - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to authorize the FDIC to impose additional restrictions on certain troubled institutions with respect to: (1) the acceptance of brokered deposits; and (2) the acceptance, renewal, or rollover of funds obtained through any deposit broker. Prohibits a troubled institution from soliciting deposits by offering interest rates significantly higher than prevailing rates offered by other insured depository institutions on comparable deposits. Sets an interim maximum assessment rate for BIF members until a risk-based assessment system has been established by the Board of Directors according to criteria prescribed by this Act. Directs the Board of Directors to analyze and report to the Congress the impact of a risk-based assessment system upon specified aspects of mortgage lending. Sets limitations upon insured State banks and their subsidiaries with respect to activities that are impermissible for national banks, including insurance underwriting and equity investments. Retains savings bank life insurance activities by certain insured banks in New York, Connecticut, or Massachusetts. Prohibits an insured State bank, except in certain States, from acquiring or retaining any equity investment of a type or in an amount that is not permissible for a national bank. Authorizes the FDIC to require investment divestiture by an insured State bank if it determines that such investment will have an adverse effect on the safety and soundness of the bank. Directs the FDIC to study, and consequently address, any risks posed to insurance funds by equity investments of insured banks. Requires the appropriate Federal banking agencies to: (1) adopt joint uniform regulations prescribing standards for loans or extensions of credit by insured depository institutions that are secured by unimproved real estate or are made to finance construction; and (2) develop a system to monitor interest rate risk and adjust risk-based capital standards to reflect interest rate risk. Prescribes guidelines for the FDIC to take enforcement action against insured depository institutions and institution-affiliated parties. (Currently the FDIC is authorized to take such actions only against savings associations). Subtitle B: Coverage - Treats as uninsured deposits bank investment contracts between an insured depository institution and an employee benefit plan that permit benefit-responsive withdrawals or transfers without penalty. Excludes such uninsured deposits from the assessment base of insured depository institutions. Sets a maximum ceiling for insured deposits at $100,000.00. Directs the FDIC to provide deposit insurance coverage for deposits accepted on a pass-through basis to employee benefit plan participants or beneficiaries. Terminates such coverage by a specified deadline if the depository institution has not met specified minimum capitalization requirements. Declares that certain self-directed individual retirement accounts shall be aggregated and insured up to $100,000 per participant per insured depository institution. Includes within such maximum coverage certain trust funds and interbank deposits by a fiduciary depository institution. Requires the FDIC to study and report to the Congress on the cost and feasibility of tracking insured and uninsured deposits of any individual, and the exposure of the Federal Government with respect to all insured depository institutions.
