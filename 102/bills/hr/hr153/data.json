Directs the Court to prescribe rules which establish procedures for the filing, investigation, and resolution of complaints with respect to the conduct of any judge of the Court. Applies current Federal rules concerning the disqualification of justices, judges, or magistrates to judges of the Court. Authorizes the judges to participate in a thrift savings plan through contributions to the Thrift Savings Fund. Limits to five percent of basic pay the annual authorized contributions for such purpose. Requires the judges to make an election to participate in the thrift savings plan within 60 days after enactment of this Act. Requires the Congressional Record to be distributed to the Court. Authorizes the Court to accept and utilize services, gifts, and bequests of personal property in order to aid or facilitate the work of the court. Makes discretionary (currently, mandatory) the return by the Court of books, records, and diagrams submitted to the Court as part of an administrative determination."
