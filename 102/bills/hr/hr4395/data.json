Authorizes the Superior Court of DC to issue protective orders against such harassment under specified circumstances. Amends the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 to provide for consultation by the attorney for the Government to obtain the views of the victim or family about the disposition of any Federal (as under current law) or DC criminal case brought as a result of a serious crime. States that: (1) nothing in such Act shall be construed as creating a cause of action against the United States (as under current law) or DC; and (2) the guidelines implemented by the Attorney General under such Act shall apply to law enforcement agencies, attorneys, and prosecutors for DC, including the DC Corporation Counsel."
