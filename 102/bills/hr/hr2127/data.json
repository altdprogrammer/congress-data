Includes among the reauthorized programs: (1) vocational rehabilitation services (State allotments for basic vocational rehabilitation services, State allotments for innovation and expansion, and the client assistance program); (2) research and training; (3) supplementary services and facilities (construction of rehabilitation facilities, training centers, comprehensive rehabilitation centers, and special projects and supplementary services, including special demonstration and recreational programs); (4) the National Council on Disability; (5) the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board; (6) employment opportunities for individuals with handicaps (community service employment pilot programs, projects with industry and business opportunities, and supported employment services); and (7) comprehensive services for independent living (including independent living services for older blind individuals). Amends the Helen Keller National Center Act to extend through FY 1992 the authorization of appropriations for programs of the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults and its affiliated network. Amends Federal law to extend through FY 1992 the authorization of appropriations for the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities. Amends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to authorize differential funding for the fourth or fifth year of grant allotments to States under the early intervention program for handicapped infants and toddlers (from birth to age two), thus allowing certain States to continue their participation in such program under specified conditions. Allows States that have not met all or some of fourth or fifth year requirements to request extended participation for such years and, if the request is approved by the Secretary of Education, receive an allotments, years in an amount set at a specified earlier, lesser rate. Provides for reallotment of the resultant excess funds to States that have met all the requirements for such years and that will consequently be receiving their full grant allotments, as well as additional funds from their portion of such reallotment."
