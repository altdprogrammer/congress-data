    "text": "El Salvador Peace, Security, and Justice Act of 1991 - Limits the amount of military assistance for El Salvador for FY 1992. Prohibits the provision of such assistance if the President reports to the appropriate congressional committees that: (1) the Salvadoran Government has rejected or ceased to support an active role for the United Nations Secretary General in mediating a permanent settlement and cease-fire to the armed conflict; (2) the Salvadoran Government has failed to negotiate in good faith to achieve a permanent settlement and cease-fire; (3) the Salvadoran Government has not acted in good faith to carry out the United Nations-brokered agreement of September 25, 1991; (4) the Salvadoran Government has failed to conduct an investigation into, and prosecution of those responsible for, the murders at the University of Central America; or (5) the Salvadoran military and security forces are engaging in violent acts against civilians, or are failing to control such activities by elements subject to their control. Provides for the resumption of such assistance pursuant to a law enacted by the Congress. Withholds 50 percent of military assistance allocated for FY 1992 and of unobligated assistance for prior fiscal years. Releases such assistance only if: (1) the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front (FMLN) has failed to negotiate in good faith for a settlement, or has rejected or ceased to support the Secretary General's role in such settlement; (2) the survival of the Salvadoran Government is being jeopardized by FMLN actions; (3) proof exists that the FMLN is continuing to acquire significant shipments of lethal military assistance from outside El Salvador; or (4) the FMLN is engaging in violent acts against civilians or is failing to control such activities by elements subject to its control. Conditions the provision of military assistance to El Salvador on the prior notification of the appropriate congressional committees. Prohibits U.S. assistance to El Salvador if the elected head of the government is deposed by military coup or decree. Provides for the resumption of such assistance pursuant to a law enacted by the Congress. Establishes the Demobilization and Transition Fund to assist in monitoring a settlement of the conflict and in demobilizing combatants in such conflict and aiding their transition to peaceful pursuits. Makes amounts in the Fund available only if the President notifies the appropriate congressional committees that a permanent settlement of the conflict has been reached. Transfers withheld military assistance to the Fund on the date of such notification or on September 30, 1992, if no notification has occurred. Authorizes the delivery of U.S. military assistance to the Salvadoran armed forces only with the prior approval of the elected president of El Salvador. Directs the Secretary of State, through agreement with the National Endowment for Democracy or other qualified organizations, to continue programs to strengthen democratic, political, and legal institutions in El Salvador. Makes available economic support fund (ESF) assistance for such program. Authorizes the Secretary to cooperate with the United Nations to implement the Human Rights Accord agreed to by the Salvadoran Government and the FMLN and to provide assistance in support of the United Nations Observer Force in El Salvador. Makes ESF assistance available for such purposes. Withholds a specified amount of military assistance for El Salvador until the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the Salvadoran Government has pursued all legal avenues to investigate, bring to trial, and obtain verdicts against those responsible for the murders of certain land reformers, peasants, priests, and unionists. Repeals provisions of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1991 concerning military assistance for El Salvador."
