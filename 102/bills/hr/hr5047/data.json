Requires the President to establish an interagency committee to be known as the International Statistical Assistance Coordinating Committee to: (1) determine priorities for providing training and other technical assistance to monitor economic performance in such countries through the collection and analysis of economic statistical data; (2) coordinate such assistance with assistance provided by international or multilateral organizations; and (3) provide for analysis by its constituent agencies of economic statistical data regarding such countries and for the dissemination of such analysis to U.S. businesses and other interested parties. Requires U.S. assistance that is provided to encourage the development of a free-market economic system in the former Soviet republics and the Baltic states to include training and other technical assistance to develop capabilities to monitor economic performance through the collection and analysis of economic statistical data. Expresses the sense of the Congress that a specified amount of funds allocated for U.S. assistance to encourage the development of free market systems in such countries be used for such training and assistance."
