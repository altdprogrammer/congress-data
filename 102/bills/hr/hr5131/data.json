    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-05-11", 
    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit the placement in mixed municipal solid waste of a battery containing added mercury, silver, lead, nickel, cadmium, or zinc. Requires users to return all batteries subject to such prohibition to the supplier that provided the battery or to a collection facility designated by the battery manufacturer. Requires manufacturers of such batteries to: (1) ensure that a system for the proper collection, transportation, segregation by type, and processing of waste batteries exists for purchasers; and (2) clearly inform each purchaser of the prohibition on disposal of waste batteries and of the availability of such system. Directs manufacturers, to ensure that such a system exists, to identify a collection chain through which batteries should be returned to the manufacturer or to designated collection sites. Requires manufacturers of button cell batteries that are to be sold at retail in interstate commerce to ensure that such batteries are clearly identifiable as to the type of electrode used in such batteries. Prohibits the retail sale or distribution for sale of alkaline manganese batteries containing more than .30 percent of mercury by weight and after January 1, 1994, .025 percent mercury by weight. Bars the sale of batteries containing any added mercury effective January 1, 1996. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to exempt specific types of batteries from such prohibitions if there are no substitutes available. Prohibits, after January 1, 1994: (1) the retail sale or distribution for sale of button cell alkaline manganese batteries that contain more than 25 milligrams of mercury; and (2) the retail sale of button batteries containing added mercury unless they contain fewer than 25 milligrams of mercury. Prohibits the retail sale or distribution for sale in any State of a rechargeable battery consumer product unless: (1) the battery can be easily removed by the consumer or is contained in a battery pack that is separate from the product and can be easily removed; and (2) the product, the battery, and the package are labeled in a manner that is clearly visible, indicate that the battery must be recycled or disposed of properly, and are marked with specified recycling symbols. Authorizes exemptions from such prohibition if: (1) the product cannot be reasonably designed to comply with such requirements; (2) the redesign of the product would result in danger to public health or safety; or (3) the battery poses no unreasonable hazard when placed in and processed or disposed of as part of mixed municipal solid waste. Limits exemptions to two-year periods and permits only one renewal. Prohibits the knowing disposal, after July 1, 1993, of any lead-acid, nickel-cadmium, or other rechargeable battery in landfills, incinerators, or municipal solid waste composting facilities. Authorizes the Administrator to suspend such prohibition, as it applies to the operator of a solid waste management facility, upon finding that insufficient markets exist and alternate uses are not available."
