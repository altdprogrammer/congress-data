Directs the Administrator to give priority to the following projects: (1) a project for Harwich, Massachusetts, to satisfy highly variable municipal septage treatment requirements; (2) a project for San Francisco, California, to produce water which meets specified Safe Drinking Water Act standards by treating effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment facility; (3) a project in Vermont to process municipal sewage in a cold-climate application; (4) an agricultural project to purify a specified amount of wastewater generated in conjunction with feedlot activities and to reclaim such water; and (5) other projects to examine the application of such technologies. Authorizes appropriations."
