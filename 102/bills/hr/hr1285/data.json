    "text": "Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1991 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to eliminate references to \"ability-to-benefit\" students in definitions of vocational school (for purposes of the Stafford loan program), proprietary institution and postsecondary institution (for purposes of all student assistance under HEA), and institution of higher education (for purposes of HEA in general). Requires independent testing of students who are not high school graduates, for purposes of eligibility for any assistance under specified HEA student assistance provisions. Repeals conflicting provisions under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. Eliminates any statute of limitations for collection of student loan repayments or grant overpayments under HEA student assistance provisions. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to HEA student assistance programs to ensure that those serving on active duty in connection with Operation Desert Shield or Desert Storm: (1) are not placed in a worse position financially in relation to their Stafford or Perkins loans because of such service; (2) have administrative burdens eased and avoid inadvertent technical defaults with respect to student loans under HEA title IV; and (3) do not have their future eligibility for Pell Grants reduced by the amount of assistance awarded for the instruction period they were unable to complete because of such service. Directs the Secretary to publish notice of such waivers or modifications. Expresses the sense of the Congress that all institutions offering postsecondary education should provide a full refund or credit for tuition and fees for that portion of an instruction period that any Armed Force or Reserve member was unable to complete, or receive academic credit, because of active duty service in connection with Operation Desert Shield or Desert Storm. Directs the Secretary to: (1) encourage institutions to provide such refunds or credits; and (2) report to the appropriate congressional committees on their actions, including information on any institutions not providing such refunds or credits. Terminates on September 30, 1997, provisions of this Act relating to Operation Desert Shield or Storm student assistance waiver authority and tuition refunds or credits. Amends the Adult Education Act (AEA) to provide for education programs for commercial drivers. Authorizes the Secretary to make competitive matching grants for adult education programs which increase the literacy skills of eligible commercial drivers so that they may successfully complete the knowledge test requirements under the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986. Requires grantees to refer individuals identified as having literacy skills problems to appropriate adult education programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1993 for such grants. Directs the Secretary to treat the University of Detroit Mercy of Detroit, Michigan, as an eligible institution under part A (Strengthening Institutions) of title III (Institutional Aid) of HEA for purposes of assistance to institutions under other programs. Revises HEA Federal interest subsidies provisions to allow an eligible institution, if the reason for its refusal is documented and provided in written form to each affected student, to refuse to certify: (1) a statement which permits a student to receive a Stafford loan; or (2) a loan amount that is less than the student's determination of need. Amends certain provisions of the Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act which revised HEA provisions. Limits certain graduation rate data disclosure requirements to data for undergraduate students. Removes a requirement for biennial updating of such data. Directs the Secretary to permit any institution of higher education that is a member of an athletic association or conference that has voluntarily published completion or graduation data, or has agreed to publish data that is substantialy comparable to the required information, to use such data to satisfy such requirements. Revises provisions relating to the schedule for such disclosure requirements and the due dates for certain reports to the Secretary. Applies simplified needs analysis to certain low-income families who file an income tax return pursuant to the tax code of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or who are not required to file pursuant to such tax code."
