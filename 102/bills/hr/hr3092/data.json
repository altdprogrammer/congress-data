Prohibits an action from being taken under such Act if: (1) the potential economic benefits to society do not outweigh the potential economic costs to society, as determined under a specified Executive Order concerning Federal regulation; or (2) the action does not otherwise comply with the general requirements of such Order. Prohibits the promulgation of any regulation after enactment of this Act until the issuing agency is certified by the Attorney General to be in compliance with an Executive Order concerning constitutionally protected property rights or similar procedures to assess the potential for the taking of private property in the course of Federal regulatory activity, with the goal of minimizing such where possible. Provides for judicial review for such actions."
