    "text": "Airline Competition Enhancement Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to prohibit major air carriers, without approval of the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary), from transferring: (1) in any one-year period rights to use more than five percent of the gates at an airport; (2) in any one-year period more than five percent of the slots allocated at a high density airport; or (3) a certificate authorizing the carrier to engage in foreign air transportation or any portion of such certificate. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations establishing transfer procedures. Sets forth approval criteria. Authorizes operators of concentrated airports to allow eligible air carriers to use unutilized gates or other related facilities at reduced rates. Directs the Secretary to establish a procedure to direct such operators to permit a petitioning eligible air carrier to use a gate during hours at which it is not being used. Authorizes foreign persons to purchase more than a specified percentage of the voting interests of an U.S. air carrier under certain conditions. Prohibits vendors that operate a computer reservation system from: (1) making available to subscribers an integrated display in which information is ordered or emphasized based upon factors relating to air carrier identity, or supply information from its system to persons creating or attempting to create such an integrated display; (2) making available to a subscriber any subscriber transaction capability which is more complete or efficient with respect to one participant than to any other, unless the vendor offers such participant the opportunity to participate in such capability at the same price as others and the participant says no; (3) charging a participant fee which is above the fee found fair and reasonable by an arbitrator's decision with respect to such vendor unless a year has elapsed since the decision; or (4) prohibiting a subscriber from obtaining any other computer reservation system. Sets forth provisions relating to: (1) subscriber contract restraints; (2) arbitration of participant fees; and (3) treatment of certain reduced computer reservation system services."
