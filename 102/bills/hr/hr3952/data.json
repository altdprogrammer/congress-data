    "text": "Local Government Interstate Waste Control Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit owners or operators of landfills, incinerators, or other waste disposal facilities in a State from receiving municipal solid waste generated outside of the State for disposal or incineration unless they obtain authorization from the affected local government. Exempts from such prohibition: (1) owners or operators of landfills that on November 26, 1991, met all State regulations relating to design standards, leachate collection, groundwater monitoring, and financial assurance for closure and post-closure care and corrective action and before such date accepted municipal solid waste generated outside the State or obtained authorization to accept such waste from the affected local government; (2) persons who are planning to own or operate a landfill, incinerator, or other waste disposal facility and before such date obtained authorization from the affected local government to accept such waste; and (3) owners or operators of incinerators or other waste disposal facilities that before such date accepted such waste or obtained authorization to accept such waste from the affected local government. Terminates such waivers for landfills that fail to comply with State standards. Considers expansions of landfills, incinerators, or waste disposal facilities to be separate facilities requiring authorization. Exempts owners or operators of such facilities from the requirement to obtain additional authorizations if: (1) at the time they obtained authorization, they owned or possessed an option to purchase the land on which the expansion is proposed to occur; and (2) the area of expansion was indicated in documents filed with the affected local government before obtaining authorization. Prohibits the receipt of municipal solid waste generated in another State if such State does not have an approved solid waste management plan. Authorizes the receipt of municipal solid waste generated in another State without the authorization of the affected local government if the State in which the recipient facility is located does not have an approved plan."
