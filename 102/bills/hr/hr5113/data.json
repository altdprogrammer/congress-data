    "text": "Amends the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 to abolish the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals (TECA). Specifies that appeals from orders or judgments entered by a U.S. district court in cases and controversies arising under such Act may be brought in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit if the appeal is from a final decision of the district court or is an interlocutory appeal permitted under the Federal judicial code. Amends: (1) the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 to substitute the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for TECA with respect to judicial review of emergency orders under such Act; and (2) the Federal judicial code to grant such Court exclusive jurisdiction over appeals under specified provisions of such Act, the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Provides for the handling of cases pending before TECA."
