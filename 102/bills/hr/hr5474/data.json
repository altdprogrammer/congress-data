Directs the USTR to determine annually, based on the national trade estimates, for each nation that trades with the United States, whether it is: (1) maintaining open markets for U.S. goods and services; (2) refraining from government subsidies or other unfair trade practices; and (3) extending reciprocal treatment to U.S. goods and services. Requires the USTR to report annually to the Congress on action taken against any nation based on the aforementioned determinations."
