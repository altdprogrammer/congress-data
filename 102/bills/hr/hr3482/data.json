    "text": "Nonroad Alternative Fuels Demonstration Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) to establish a conversion incentive program for providing loan guarantees and interest subsidies to owners and operators of nonroad (including railroad, maritime, airport, and farm) vehicle fleets for the conversion of such vehicles from gasoline or diesel fuel to alternative fuels (i.e. processed natural gas, coal, coal water slurries, and electricity). Sets forth selection criteria and reporting requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to guarantee loans with a specified aggregate value for each of FY 1993 through 1998. Authorizes appropriations for interest subsidies for each of such years. Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 to direct the Secretary to issue rules, regulations, orders, or standards necessary for the safety of the operation and fueling of railroads on processed natural gas, coal, coal water slurries, and electricity. Preempts any State or local requirement concerning a subject regulated by the Secretary under such provision. Exempts natural gas, when used as a transportation fuel in a nonroad vehicle, from regulation under the Natural Gas Act, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, or any other Federal, State, or local law (with the exception of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 as amended by this Act and equivalent Federal safety statutes applicable to other modes of transportation)."
