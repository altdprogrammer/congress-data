Subtitle C: Standards and Information - Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide financial assistance to support a voluntary national window rating program to develop energy ratings and labels for windows and window systems; (2) develop voluntary national standards for industrial insulation; (3) review and report to the Congress on energy audit procedures in commercial, agricultural, and industrial sectors; (4) establish test procedures and develop energy conservation standards for lamps, appliance motors, and small package air conditioners; (5) evaluate for the Congress the feasibility of requiring electric lights and utility distribution transformers to meet minimum energy efficiency levels (and the possible replacement of existing transformers); and (6) submit to the Congress a program plan for promoting the early introduction of high-efficiency appliances by utilities and appliance manufacturers. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle D: Tax Provisions - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) exclude from gross income the value of energy and water conservation subsidies provided by a public utility to a customer; and (2) restore the tax credit for energy conservation expenditures on oil-heated homes. Title II: Conservation in the Transportation Sector - Subtitle A: Alternative Fuels - Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to direct the Secretary of Transportation when amending fuel economy standards: (1) not to consider the fuel economy of alcohol-powered automobiles or natural gas-powered automobiles; but (2) to consider dual energy automobiles and natural gas dual energy automobiles to be operated exclusively on gasoline or diesel fuel. Sets forth acquisition and credit allocation guidelines for owners, operators and lessees of fleets of alternative fuel vehicles. Prescribes civil and administrative penalties for noncompliance with this Act. Subtitle B: Natural Gas as a Transportation Fuel - Amends the Natural Gas Act to state that its provisions shall not apply to a person solely because such person sells or transports natural gas for subsequent use as a fuel in transportation vehicles. Preempts any State regulation prior to January 1, 1989, with respect to natural gas transportation in closed containers, or the sale of natural gas for use as a fuel in transportation vehicles. Declares that a company shall not be considered a gas utility company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 solely because it distributes or sells natural gas as a fuel for transportation vehicles. Amends the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 to define a \"high-priority user\" as any person who uses natural gas as a fuel in transportation vehicles. Subtitle C: Fuel Economy - Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to direct the Secretary of Transportation to amend the average fuel economy standard to levels which the Secretary determines are the maximum feasible average fuel economy level for model years beginning after model year 1996. Extends from ten to 30 days the period during which the Secretary of Energy may provide the Secretary of Transportation with written comments on the level of proposed amended fuel economy standards. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to determine by rule an appropriate fuel economy credit to be given to electric vehicle manufacturers. Subtitle D: Miscellaneous - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from the gross income of an employee the value of any qualified transportation benefit provided by the employer. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue regulations providing for appropriate credits for complying with the Clean Air Act to persons who operate programs for the scrapping of older, less fuel efficient vehicles. Directs the Secretary of Energy to study whether consumers use automotive fuel octane ratings higher than needed to operate their vehicles, and, if so, to take appropriate consumer education steps to reduce the excess use of premium gasoline. Declares certain conservation requirements under the Clean Air Act applicable to all employers of 100 or more persons in standard metropolitan statistical areas of 250,000 or more people. Declares it is U.S. policy that by 2000 at least ten percent of the Nation's vehicle transportation needs shall be served by domestic non-petroleum fuels. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish an electric vehicle research and development grant program to fund joint venture demonstrations of electric vehicles, and to develop an electric vehicle infrastructure. Authorizes appropriations. Declares that for purposes of the Natural Gas Act, vehicular natural gas, including gas sold wholesale or transported by persons with service area determinations, shall be deemed to be ultimately consumed in the State in which physical delivery of a natural gas sale occurs, whether or not physical combustion occurs in another State. Directs the Administrator of EPA to approve use of methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) in unleaded gasoline in amounts up to .03125 grams per gallon. Title III: Renewable Energy Sources - Subtitle A: PURPA Size Cap and Co-Firing Reform - Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to prescribe rules requiring electric utilities to offer to purchase electric capacity from alternative power production facilities only through competitive acquisition.
