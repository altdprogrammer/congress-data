    "text": "Revenue Estimating Accuracy and Sunshine Act of 1991 - Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to require reports accompanying the concurrent resolution on the budget to include technical explanations setting forth the economic data, assumptions, and methodology in sufficient detail to permit replications of the results by nongovernmental analysts. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require the Joint Tax Committee to follow such procedure in reports accompanying legislation considered or reported by the Committee on Finance or the Committee on Ways and Means. Requires the Joint Tax Committee, in determining the effect on revenues of any legislation, to use a dynamic, general equilibrium model. Requires the Committee, in formulating such model, to take into account: (1) economic effects such as production and employment changes resulting from tax changes; (2) reductions in Federal revenues from impacts on production and employment resulting from tax changes; (3) international consequences of tax changes; and (4) impacts on other Federal taxes. Directs the Joint Committee to also provide an estimate of the effects on State and local tax revenues as a result of the impacts on production and employment resulting from Federal tax changes. Provides that an appointment of the Chief of Staff of the Joint Committee may only be made if approved by recorded vote, by at least two-thirds of the members of the Joint Committee. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that any additional costs incurred to comply with this Act shall be financed in a deficit neutral manner through offsetting spending reductions."
