    "text": "High-Performance Computing and National Research and Education Network Act of 1991 - Title I: High-Performance Computing and the National Research and Education Network - Directs the President to establish and, through the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, coordinate the National High-Performance Computing Program. Sets forth Program requirements, including: (1) setting goals and priorities for Federal high-performance computing research, development, and networking; (2) providing for interagency coordination; (3) providing for oversight of the operation and evolution of the National Research and Education Network provided for in this Act; (4) improving software; (5) acceleration of high-performance computer system development; (6) technical support and research and development of software and hardware needed to address fundamental problems in science and engineering (Grand Challenges); (7) educating undergraduate and graduate students; and (8) providing for security. Establishes an advisory committee on high-performance computing. Requires identifying Program elements in the annual budget requests for each Federal agency and department participating in the Program. Requires participating agencies to support the establishment of a national multi-gigabit-per-second research and education computer network, to be known as the National Research and Education Network, to link research and educational institutions, government, and industry in every State. Charges the National Science Foundation (NSF), to the extent other entities do not do so, with primary responsibility for connecting colleges, universities, and libraries to the Network. Sets forth Network requirements, including: (1) fostering and maintaining competition and private sector investment in high-speed data networking within the telecommunications industry; (2) promoting the development of commercial data communications and telecommunications standards; and (3) purchasing standard commercial transmission and network services from vendors whenever feasible. Requires development of accounting mechanisms allowing users to be charged for using copyrighted materials. Requires: (1) the Department of Defense, through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, to support research and development of advanced fiber optics technology, switches, and protocols for the Network; and (2) the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop standards and guidelines for interoperability, common user interfaces to systems, and Network security. Authorizes all Federal agencies and departments to allow Federal research grant recipients to use grant monies to pay for computer networking expenses. Mandates a report to the Congress on Network funding, including user fees, industry support, and Federal investment. Requires the Director to coordinate agency and department activities to promote the development of information services that could be provided over the Network. Requires protection for copyright and other intellectual property rights of information providers and Network users. Title II: Agency Activities - Requires the NSF to: (1) provide computing and networking infrastructure support for all science and engineering disciplines; (2) support basic research and human resource development in computer science, computational science, and engineering; and (3) provide funding to help researchers access supercomputers. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to conduct basic and applied research in high-performance computing, particularly in computational science, with emphasis on aeronautics and the processing of remote sensing and space science data. Authorizes appropriations. Requires NIST to develop: (1) standards, guidelines, measurement techniques, and test methods for interoperability of high-performance computers in networks and common user interfaces to systems; and (2) benchmark tests and standards for high-performance computers and software. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) perform research and development on and evaluation of high-performance computing and communications systems; (2) conduct computational research with emphasis on energy applications; (3) support basic research, education, and human resources in computational science; (4) provide for networking infrastructure support for energy-related mission activities; and (5) establish at least two High-Performance Computing Research and Development Collaborative Consortia. Sets forth requirements for the Consortia. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to conduct a study regarding Federal procurement regulations and software development. Declares that, except to the extent the appropriate Federal agency or department head determines applicable, the provisions of this Act shall not apply to computer systems that process classified information or are used in connection with certain defense purposes. Allows Federal agencies and departments, and their grantees and contractors, to require prototype and early production models of new high-performance computer and communications systems to stimulate hardware and software development."
