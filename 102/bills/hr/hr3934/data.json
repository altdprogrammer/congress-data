    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-11-26", 
    "text": "Recycled Materials in Packaging Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit packagers from using packaging that does not meet standards under this Act. Requires packagers, with respect to packaging material covered by this Act, to use material that contains 35 percent and 50 percent postconsumer recycled materials beginning July 1, 1996, and July 1, 2000, respectively. Lists materials covered by this Act. Requires manufacturers or suppliers of material that is ultimately made into packaging or contained within packaging to provide information, at the request of a purchaser or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, on the amount of postconsumer recycled material in the material and to certify that such information is accurate. Directs manufacturers or importers of packaging to file annual materials use accounting reports containing information on the use of postconsumer recycled materials with the Administrator. Makes such reports available to purchasers, upon request. Exempts from this Act's requirements: (1) packaging for which compliance with other Federal law precludes compliance with this Act; (2) specified parts of a package if such parts pose no serious impediment to recycling of the package; and (3) new or innovative packaging used in six or fewer States for less than one year for purposes of testing practicality or consumer acceptance, with prior notification of the Administrator. Authorizes other special exemptions, based on health risks or innovative approaches. Sets forth application requirements for special exemptions and limits such exemptions to three-year terms. Provides for renewals of special exemptions, upon application. Authorizes the Administrator to inspect packaging or packaging facilities to determine compliance with this Act. Requires the Administrator to: (1) conduct annual random inspections of different types of packaging; and (2) inspect a particular type of packaging upon the petition of at least ten citizens. Prescribes administrative and civil penalties for violations of this Act."
