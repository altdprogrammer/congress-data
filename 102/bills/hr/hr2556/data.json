Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to rename a specified trail the Gene Marshall-Piedra Blanca National Recreation Trail. Designates a specified area within the Silver Peak Wilderness as the Nathaniel Owings Redwood Grove. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) take necessary actions for fire prevention and watershed protection in such areas; and (2) manage activities that maintain and restore fish and wildlife populations and their habitats (including the California condor) inside them. Reserves Federal water rights for wilderness areas designated by this Act. Releases all non-designated wilderness areas in the Los Padres National Forest from further statewide roadless area review and evaluation for purposes of determining their suitability for inclusion in the System. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate segments of the Sespe Creek and the Sisquoc and Big Sur Rivers, California, as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Designates segments of the Piru, Matilija, Lopez, and Sespe Creeks and the Little Sur River, California, as potential additions to the System. Authorizes, under certain conditions: (1) Pittsburg, California, to use specified land for a fire station, another public purpose, or to transfer such land to another governmental entity; and (2) Merced County, California, to use specified land for an elementary school. (Currently, the city and county are restricted to using such lands for a public park and recreation area.) Authorizes appropriations."
