Limits such deduction to $25,000 ($12,500 in the case of a separate return by a married individual) plus the long-term capital gain from the sale or exchange of closely held business interests or the principal residence of the taxpayer. Provides for determining the eligibility of a qualified individual. Makes such deduction inapplicable to estates and trusts. Allows such deduction in computing adjusted gross income."
