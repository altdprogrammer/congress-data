    "text": "Congressional and Judicial Employment Equity Act of 1992 - Amends title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit discrimination in the legislative and judicial branches of the Federal Government, other than units having positions in the competitive service, based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including marital or parental status), disability, or age. Declares that such prohibition includes the prohibitions on unlawful employment practices. Declares that such prohibition shall not be construed to require: (1) a Member of Congress to employ any individual who is not a domiciliary of the district or State which such Member represents; (2) a Member or congressional committee not to take the political affiliation of an individual into consideration when determining whether to employ such individual. Allows individuals who claim discrimination to file a written complaint with the Employment Review Board. Establishes an Employment Review Board (composed of retired Federal judges) in the judicial branch to hear discrimination complaints. Establishes procedures for filing complaints with the Board and for the conduct of the Board dependent upon the complainant. Provides for the designation of a Complaint Referral Officer who shall appoint an Investigating Counsel to investigate unresolved claims. Requires the Investigating Counsel to certify to the Board for hearing and determination each claim for which reasonable cause is found. Requires a determination not later than 180 days after the Board receives the complaint. Restricts orders for relief that relate to a congressional committee or Member reemploying, reinstating to employment, or modifying the terms and conditions of employment, of any individual in any position on the staff of such committee or Member. Limits backpay to the two-year period from the date of complaint. Provides that proceedings under this Act are closed to the public. Allows complainants to be represented by an attorney at hearings. Grants authority for judicial review of Board orders to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit."
