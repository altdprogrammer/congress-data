Requires such standards to include requirements related to adverse geologic settings, unstable terrain, ecological resources, proximity to residences, schools, hospitals, churches, and synagogues, complex hydrogeology, and vulnerable groundwater resources. Prohibits, unless the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency promulgates such standards by a specified deadline, the construction of a new treatment or disposal facility: (1) within one-half mile of a residence, school, hospital, church, or synagogue; (2) over or in a complex hydrogeology; or (3) over or in a recharge zone of an aquifer that is an actual or potential source of drinking water."
