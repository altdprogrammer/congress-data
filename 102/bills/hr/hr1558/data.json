Authorizes the Commission to establish an office to close out the affairs of the Commission after the termination of the Treaty. Establishes in the Treasury the Panama Canal Commission Dissolution Fund, consisting of amounts deposited in the Fund by the Commission from tolls, plus interest. Requires inclusion of Fund deposits in calculating toll rates. Directs the President to develop and submit to the Congress a plan, consistent with the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and related agreements, for changes to the Commission to facilitate and encourage the operation of the Canal through an autonomous entity under the government of Panama. Mandates a report by the Comptroller General to the Congress on the effectiveness of the fiscal, operational, and management structure of the Commission and recommending changes, consistent with the Treaty and related agreements, to increase efficiency and, thereby, serve as a model for the government of Panama for the operation of the Canal."
