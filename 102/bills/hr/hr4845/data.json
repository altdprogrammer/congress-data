Requires adjustment of the determination of the actual harvest of an operation if the operation: (1) compensated for the reduced salmon harvest by harvesting other fish; or (2) failed to take reasonable methods to alleviate the economic hardship resulting from the imposition by the Pacific Fishery Management Council of a ban or restrictions on the harvest."
