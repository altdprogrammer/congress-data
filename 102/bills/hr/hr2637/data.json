    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1992-07-21", 
    "text": "Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal Act - Withdraws specified lands in New Mexico from all forms of entry, appropriation, and disposal under the general land laws (including mineral leasing, geothermal, material sale, and mining laws). Reserves the withdrawn lands for use by the Secretary of Energy for conducting test phase activities, and for authorized activities associated with Waste Isolation Pilot Plant project (WIPP) purposes set forth in the Department of Energy National Security and Military Applications of Nuclear Energy Authorization Act of 1980 (thus making the land withdrawal permanent). Revokes specified public land orders made inconsistent by this Act. Confers management responsibility upon the Secretary of the Interior for such lands' withdrawal, and directs him to: (1) consult with the Secretary of Energy and the State of New Mexico in discharging such responsibilities; and (2) develop and submit to the State of New Mexico and certain congressional committees a management plan for the use of the Withdrawal until the end of the decommissioning phase. States that WIPP-related uses of the Withdrawal shall take priority over other non-WIPP related uses. Prescribes grazing, hunting and trapping guidelines. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to dispose of salt tailings extracted from the Withdrawal that the Secretary of Energy determines are not needed for backfill at WIPP. Proscribes any form of mining (including slant drilling from outside boundaries) on any Withdrawal lands. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to close Withdrawal lands to the public for health and safety, or common defense and security reasons. Requires the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) to review annually (and revise as necessary) WIPP Test Phase Plan to ensure that all proposed activities are necessary to demonstrate that the WIPP facility will comply with final disposal standards. Conditions the plan's approval by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) upon a determination that the plan's proposed activities are necessary to demonstrate that the WIPP facility is in compliance with EPA disposal standards. Requires the Secretary to submit for the Administrator's review a detailed retrieval plan to be implemented by the Secretary in the event of noncompliance during the test phase with disposal standards of this Act or certain hazardous waste regulations. Requires such plan to include specific plans for the interim management and storage of removed waste, including storage location. Mandates that the test phase plan and retrieval plan be submitted by the Secretary to the State of New Mexico for its review. Provides for conflict resolution procedures if the State of New Mexico disagrees with any plan aspect. Requires the Secretary to fully characterize all transuranic radioactive waste types at all sites from which wastes are to be shipped to WIPP. Requires characterization results to be reflected in test phase plan revisions as a prerequisite to the Administrator's certification. Sets forth requirements and limitations with respect to test phase activities, including the requirement that the Secretary of Labor review and certify that Department of Energy (DOE) emergency response training programs applicable to WIPP comply with specified Federal regulations. Limits the quantity of waste the Secretary may transport to WIPP to the lesser of: (1) 4,250 55-gallon drums; or (2) one-half of one percent of WIPP total capacity. Prohibits the transportation to or emplacement at WIPP of remote-handled transuranic radioactive waste during the test phase. Directs the Secretary to study remote-handled transuranic radioactive waste and its impact upon WIPP performance assessment. Requires the Secretary to submit annual certifications that all waste emplaced underground at WIPP remains fully retrievable during the test phase. Conditions the emplacement of transuranic radioactive waste in mined rooms in the underground repository at WIPP to conduct test phase activities upon certification by the Secretary of the Interior that such rooms will remain stable and safe to permit uninterrupted testing for the duration of such activities. Requires that, if the Administrator has not certified by a specified deadline that the WIPP facility will comply with the disposal standards, either the Secretary of Energy or the Secretary of the Interior implement the retrieval plan and the decommissioning and post-decommissioning plans provided for in this Act. Sets forth guidelines for disposal operations involving remote-handled and contact-handled transuranic radioactive waste in WIPP. Limits disposal to: (1) 5,600,000 cubic feet of contact-handled waste; and (2) 95,000 cubic feet of remote-handled waste. Directs the EPA Administrator to issue final environmental standards for the disposal of spent fuel, high-level, and transuranic radioactive waste. Directs the Secretary to: (1) comply with all applicable environmental protection and public health and safety laws during the testing, operations, and decommissioning phases with respect to WIPP; and (2) submit biennially to the State of New Mexico documentation of continued compliance with its regulatory requirements (and with those of the Administrator). Sets forth requirements for underground emplacement at WIPP of transuranic radioactive waste. Directs the Secretary to use both engineered and natural barriers at WIPP to isolate transuranic radioactive waste after disposal. Prescribes procedures for requiring a remedial plan or retrieval of waste in the event of the Secretary's noncompliance with regulatory requirements during the operations and decommissioning phases.
