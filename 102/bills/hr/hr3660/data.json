Requires the States of New York and Connecticut, in order to be eligible for grants, to designate bays and harbors of the Sound at which eligible activities will be carried out. Sets forth designation requirements. Requires grants to be used to: (1) carry out eligible activities and monitoring programs at designated bays and harbors; and (2) educate the public on the implementation and results of such activities. Allocates 2/3 and 1/3 of the amounts appropriated in a fiscal year for such grants to New York and Connecticut, respectively. Sets the non-Federal share of the costs of such activities at 30 percent. Authorizes appropriations."
