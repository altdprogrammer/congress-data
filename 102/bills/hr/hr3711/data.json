    "text": "WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Act of 1992 - States that the purpose of this Act is to authorize grants for State programs designed to: (1) provide nutritious unprepared foods (such as fruits and vegetables) from farmers' markets to women, infants, and children who are nutritionally at risk; and (2) expand the awareness and use of farmers' markets and increase their sales. Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to make the special supplemental food (WIC) farmers' market program permanent and open to all States. (The current program is a ten-State three-year pilot program.) Authorizes local and private funds to be used toward the 30 percent State matching requirement. Increases the administrative expense allowance from ten percent to 15 percent of program funds, with an additional two percent for the first year of participation or upon a showing of State financial need. Provides with regard to program funding that: (1) pilot program States submitting an approved plan shall receive funding in amounts at least equal to the previous year's assistance; and (2) remaining amounts shall be made available for such States wishing to serve additional recipients and for new programs in additional States with approved program plans. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) establish criteria for plan approval and ranking; and (2) collect program data from participating States and report to the appropriate congressional committees by April 1, 1994. Authorizes FY 1992 through 1994 appropriations."
