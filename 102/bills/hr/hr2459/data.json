Requires the Secretary to prepare an environmental assessment for sales of such timber. Prohibits the environmental assessments and such timber sales from being subject to administrative appeal. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) substitute such timber for timber that would otherwise be sold under the plan; or (2) if not feasible, sell such timber over and above the plan volume."
