    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1992-04-03", 
    "text": "Resolution Trust Corporation Funding and Cost Reduction Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to: (1) repeal the termination of the mandate for specified additional funding for the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC); and (2) specify that the additional interim funding (already authorized) which the Secretary of the Treasury must provide to the RTC must come out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated. Directs the Secretary, at the President's request, to provide to the RTC out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated to it, further additional funds of up to $25,000,000,000, until April 1, 1993 (minus the total amount of certain statutorily-mandated assessments received by the RTC). Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to direct the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to impose on Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) members: (1) a semiannual assessment according to a prescribed formula for each of the two semiannual periods which begin after the date of enactment of this Act; and (2) additional semiannual assessments for any semiannual period for which the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board determines additional special assessments are necessary to provide additional resources to the RTC (at a rate determined by the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board). Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to prohibit the RTC or the FDIC from: (1) using appropriated funds to benefit any shareholder of an insured depository institution in connection with any type of resolution by the RTC or the FDIC; and (2) transferring appropriated funds to the SAIF under certain provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Authorizes the FDIC, with respect to separate capitalization rules for savings associations' subsidiaries engaged in activities impermissible for national banks, to prescribe a greater percentage than the one prescribed if it determines that the use of such percentage would not constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or condition. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the RTC shall not be extended beyond its statutory termination date (December 31, 1996), nor receive additional failed savings associations after September 30, 1993. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to extend from three to five years the statute of limitations for tort actions brought by the RTC in its capacity as conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution. Requires the Attorney General to collect and maintain judgment information on: (1) fines and restitution orders imposed upon insured savings associations for criminal activities; and (2) the extent to which such fines and orders have been collected and received. Directs specified Federal agencies to cooperate with the Attorney General in developing an accurate and efficient means of providing such information. Requires the Attorney General to submit annual summaries of such information to certain congressional committees. Prescribes summary contents. Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 to direct certain regulatory agencies to include in their annual reports to the Congress the number of individuals and institutions against whom civil judgments for damages or restitution were awarded in agency-initiated proceedings (or who formally agreed to pay the United States in order to avoid such proceedings). Mandates the public disclosure of any claims settlement or agreement between the RTC or the FDIC and any other party pertaining to an insured depository institution in conservatorship or receivership. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to direct the RTC to: (1) adopt banking services' procurement procedures which assure minimal costs, and representative geographic and size distribution of firms and contracts providing such services; and (2) establish procedures under which real estate asset management and disposition of institutions in receivership or conservatorship are accomplished through the RTC office closest to asset location, and are accounted for to the RTC office responsible for administering the receivership of such institution. Prohibits RTC contracts with suspended or debarred contractors. Requires the RTC to report to the Congress on actions it has taken to comply with a congressional directive to examine and accelerate its dispute resolution procedures with borrowers under loans acquired as a result of its appointment as conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution."
