Title II: Providing Significance to the Recovery Planning Process - Amends the Act with respect to ensuring the preparation and use of timely, comprehensive, and effective recovery plans. Requires either the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce, as program responsibilities are vested, to report biennially to specified congressional committees on the status of: (1) efforts to develop and implement recovery plans for listed endangered and threatened species; and (2) all species for which such plans have been developed. Title III: Ensuring that the Compliance Procedures and Standards for Private Landowners and Other non-Federal Persons Are Not More Burdensome, Time-Consuming, or Costly than Those Applicable to Federal Agencies - Amends the Act to: (1) make consultation procedures for Federal agencies available to private landowners and other non-Federal agencies available to private landowners and other non-Federal individuals and entities; (2) include permit or license applicants in consultations concerning Federal agency actions; (3) authorize the issuance of general permits for private and other non-Federal activities which have minimal effect on species listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973; (4) facilitate the application for, and processing and issuance of, conservation plans for endangered or threatened species; (5) define the \"take prohibition\" for application in accordance with the intent of the Congress and in a manner providing more precise guidance to all parties wishing to avoid its violation and possible sanctions; (6) establish special limitations on application of take prohibitions; (7) provide for exemptions from the Act for non-Federal individuals and entities and remove payment requirements associated with obtaining such an exemption; and (8) give non-Federal property owners the option of purchase of their property by, or receipt of compensation for diminished value of their property from, the Federal Government when it requires that the property be managed to protect endangered or threatened species. Title IV: Species Enhancement - Amends the Act to authorize the Secretary to: (1) enter into cooperative management agreements for governing the administration and management of areas identified as habitats for listed species; (2) provide grants to private property owners for preserving the habitat of threatened or endangered species; and (3) permit activities otherwise prohibited when such actions are carried out by certain organizations for the sole purpose of promoting species conservation and population enhancement. Provides for guidance for the release of experimental populations. Title V: Reauthorization and Other Amendments - Makes technical amendments regarding application of Endangered Species Act prohibitions to threatened species and citizens suits. Reauthorizes the Endangered Species Act of 1973 at increased levels."
