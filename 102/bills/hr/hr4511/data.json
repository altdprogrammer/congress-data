    "text": "Copyright Broadcast Retransmission Licensing Act of 1992 - Amends Federal copyright law to bring within its purview broadcast retransmission systems (formerly designated as \"cable systems\"). Defines such a system as one which: (1) receives signals embodying a performance or display of a work transmitted by licensed broadcast stations; and (2) makes secondary transmissions of such signals to subscribing members of the public who pay for the service. Sets forth the compulsory licensing requirements for such broadcast retransmission systems. Defines the \"local service area\" of a television broadcast and of a radio broadcast station. Sets forth termination of compulsory licensing procedures and terms for certain broadcast retransmission systems. Requires the Copyright Royalty Tribunal to make annual rate adjustments that reflect national fluctuations in the Consumer Price Index. Authorizes petitions for specified royalty rate adjustments to be filed each February. Repeals existing limitations on the exclusive rights of secondary transmissions of superstations and network stations for private home viewing. Directs the Register of Copyrights to study and report to the Congress on whether market place mechanisms exist (or are likely to develop) which will ensure that consumers receive diverse, quality radio and television programming at reasonable prices without the need for compulsory licensing."
