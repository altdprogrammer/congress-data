    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require taxpayers who determine depreciation under the income forecast method to pay interest under the look-back method for any recomputation year. Requires such determinations to include, in the case of a film produced for theatrical or television exhibition, estimated income from subsequent television exhibition or syndication. Establishes a formula for such recomputations to recapture foregone tax revenues. Provides for taxing certain rents and royalties paid to foreign subsidiaries as foreign personal holding company income."
