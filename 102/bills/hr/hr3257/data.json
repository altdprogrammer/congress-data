Gives priority in the awarding of grants to: (1) applications for construction of treatment works which will discharge into an estuary of national significance for which a conference has been convened; (2) applications from municipalities and intermunicipal agencies for application of low-cost, low-maintenance sewage treatment technologies; and (3) applications from municipalities and intermunicipal agencies which are making expenditures for purposes for which such grants are made to the limit of their financial capability. Limits the Federal share of the cost of construction of a publicly owned treatment works and the total amount of grants for construction in any State. Authorizes appropriations."
