Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to: (1) allow all States to offer community supported living arrangements services; and (2) remove the limit on expenditures for such services in FY 1993. Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to: (1) raise the minimum earnings level for a finding of substantial gainful activity for all disability beneficiaries to the higher earnings test exempt amount applicable to blind individuals; and (2) phase out (rather than suspend entirely) disability benefits during the final months of the trial work period in which the individual engages in substantial gainful activity. Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act to: (1) index the personal needs allowance and resource limitations for inflation; and (2) take into account siblings of the child with disabilities for purposes of applying the resource deeming rules."
