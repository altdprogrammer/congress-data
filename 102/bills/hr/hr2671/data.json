Prohibits a State from levying a fee for the incineration or disposal of such waste that is less than the greater of: (1) the maximum levied by the generating State for a similar quantity of waste; or (2) the fee which would be levied by the State if the waste were generated within that State. Excludes hazardous waste from such prohibitions."
