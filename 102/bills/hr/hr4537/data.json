Directs the EPA Administrator and the Undersecretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere to jointly develop guidelines for assessing quality of coastal and marine waters in which coral reef ecosystems are found to ensure the sustainable use and conservation of such ecosystems. Requires the President to direct the Secretary of State to work with other nations and international organizations to: (1) implement an international research program to monitor the status of coral reef and related ecosystems; (2) implement a global strategy for the sustainable use of coral reef ecosystems and to encourage multilateral research efforts on sustainable management of such ecosystems; and (3) promote public education on the conservation of such ecosystems. Directs the President to convene conferences of the parties to the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (Cartagena Convention) and the South Pacific Regional Environment Program (SPREP) for purposes of identifying research and management needs in coral reef ecology and their sustainable use and the implementation of such programs in the Caribbean and South Pacific.
