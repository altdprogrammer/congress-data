Provides for grants to MHCs, CHCs, and homeless health service programs for the CPECHPs.

Amends the Vaccine and Immunization Amendments of 1990 to direct the Secretary, through the CDC, to: (1) make grants to States (currently, to public and nonprofit private entities) for demonstration projects to provide, without administrative charge (currently, without charge), immunizations to children not over two years old; and (2) provide immunizations related to certain programs under the Public Health Service Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966; and (3) maintain private physician participation in immunization services and to encourage private physicians to provide such services to infants and children enrolled under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act.
