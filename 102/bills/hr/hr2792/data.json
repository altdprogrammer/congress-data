    "text": "United States-China Act of 1991 - Prohibits the extension for a 12-month period beginning July 3, 1992, of nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-nation treatment) to China under the Trade Act of 1974, unless the President submits to the Congress a specified report stating that China has: (1) accounted for and released prisoners who have been detained and imprisoned as a result of the nonviolent expression of their political beliefs; (2) ceased exporting to the United States products manufactured by convict or forced labor; (3) ceased the supply of military arms to the Khmer Rouge; and (4) adhered to the Joint Declaration with the United Kingdom on Hong Kong. Requires such report to state whether China has made significant progress in: (1) engaging in high-level discussions on human rights issues; (2) preventing gross violations of such rights (including in Tibet); (3) terminating harassment of Chinese citizens in the United States; (4) ensuring access of international human rights monitoring groups to prisoners; (5) providing protection of U.S. intellectual property rights; (6) providing U.S. exporters access to Chinese markets by lowering tariffs, removing nontariff barriers, and increasing the purchase of U.S. goods and services; and (7) adopting a national policy consistent with specified missile, nuclear, and chemical and biological control agreements. Terminates most-favored-nation trade status for China unless the President certifies to the Congress that it has not transferred ballistic missiles or missile launchers for the M-9 or M-11 weapon systems to Syria, Iran, or Pakistan. Requires the President, if he determines such transfers to have occurrred, to: (1) notify the Congress; and (2) terminate most-favored-nation treatment for Chinese products."
