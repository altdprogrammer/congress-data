Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for such assistance out of the Highway Trust Fund. Exempts such assistance from any Federal-aid highway and highway safety construction program ceilings. Limits to 80 percent the Federal share of the cost of any construction project under this Act. Provides an apportionment formula to be followed by the Secretary in making funds available to States for such assistance. Requires the Appalachian Regional Commission to submit to the Secretary a list of estimated project costs. States that, beginning with FY 1994, projects eligible for assistance under this Act shall be eligible for funds available under law applicable to the construction and maintenance of Federal-aid primary highways."
