    "text": "Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to set forth the following conditions for a presidential waiver of the prohibition on assistance to Communist countries: (1) the government of such recipient country no longer maintains a centrally-planned economy based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and respects and observes internationally recognized standards of human rights; and (2) such assistance will encourage the deliverance of such recipient country from dependence on other Communist countries. Expands the list of Communist countries to which assistance is prohibited to include Cambodia, Afghanistan, Laos, Ethiopia, and Angola. Provides that, for the purposes of such restriction: (1) China does not include Tibet; and (2) the U.S.S.R. does not include Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, or any republic of the U.S.S.R. that has declared its independence. Requires the President to report to the Congress every three months on the steps being taken by the governments of Communist countries receiving U.S. humanitarian disaster relief assistance to alleviate the conditions that make such assistance necessary."
