Requires the committee to promote: (1) technology transfer from the Federal Government to private enterprise; and (2) government-industry cooperation to halt the penetration of U.S. markets by foreign competitors. Provides for participation by foreign countries in projects supported by the committee. Requires the committee to be headed by a director who shall make grants and enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with research and development entities or other arrangements with entities that are deemed most useful by the committee to accomplish the purposes of this Act. Requires the committee to provide the funding for research and development concerning the adaption of technology. Requires the committee to coordinate efforts with other Federal agencies to make certain there are no disputes over grants, loans, and contracts. Requires the committee to report annually to the President, both Houses of the Congress, and the Council on Industrial Competitiveness on its past year actions and any recommendations for appropriate legislative actions."
