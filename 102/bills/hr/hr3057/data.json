Directs the Secretary, through the Network, to contract with one national nonprofit agency with expertise in model program evaluation to: (1) identify programs already receiving funds under the Act which serve historically underserved or high-risk populations and which need technical assistance and training in developing and implementing program evaluation criteria and procedures; (2) notify such programs of the availability of such services; and (3) provide such services before program initiation and/or on a continuing basis during its operation. Requires programs receiving such assistance to apply for review by the Program Effectiveness Panel (the Panel), in furtherance of a dissemination grant under specified provisions. Directs the contractor to provide technical assistance in preparation of such application and supporting materials. Directs the Secretary, through the Network, to award dissemination grants (independent from and perhaps in addition to developer demonstrator grants) to the identified drug education programs which have successfully met the Panel's requirements for purposes of dissemination of information. Reserves a specified portion of funds under the Act for the contract and grants under this Act, limiting the amount which may be used for the contract. Requires that at least six programs receive the technical assistance and training provided under this Act."
