    "text": "Insurance Competitive Pricing Act of 1992 - Amends the McCarran-Ferguson Act to eliminate the antitrust exemption applicable to the business of insurance where the conduct of an individual engaged in such business involves: (1) price fixing; (2) allocating with a competitor a geographical area in which, or persons to whom, insurance will be offered for sale; (3) unlawfully tying the sale or purchase of one type of insurance to that of another type, or of any other service or product; or (4) monopolizing, or attempting to monopolize, any part of such business. Retains such exemption for conduct involving making of a contract or engaging in a combination or conspiracy to: (1) collect or disseminate historical loss data, determine a loss development factor applicable to such data, or perform actuarial services if such contract, combination, or conspiracy does not involve restraint of trade. Exempts making a contract or engaging in a combination or conspiracy to determine a trend factor (i.e., an adjustment to be made to losses incurred for claims reported by any person engaged in the business of insurance to reflect a change in inflation or any other change in the estimated loss costs incurred by persons engaged in such business): (1) during the transition period; and (2) in the case of a person with a policyholders' surplus of less than $10,000,000 or less than $100,000,000 and whose direct written insurance premiums for the line of business in question constitute less than a two and a half percent share of the total market in the most recently ended one-year period in every jurisdiction in which the person is engaged in the business of insurance and which is not more than 50 percent owned or controlled by another person engaged in the business of insurance."
