    "text": "Tribal Development Student Assistance Act - Establishes a student assistance revolving loan program for Native Americans, to be administered by tribes or tribal organizations. Requires that funds received under a grant under this Act or recovered under specified provisions of this Act be identified and accounted for separately from any other tribal or Federal funds received from the Federal Government. Requires that all funds in such account be used for the purposes of this Act. Makes the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) responsible for establishing requirements for receipt, investment, and accounting of such funds to safeguard any financial interests of the Federal Government. Requires such funds to be: (1) invested by the tribe or tribal organization only in obligations of the United States or in obligations or securities guaranteed or insured by the United States; or (2) deposited only in accounts that are insured by an agency or instrumentality of the United States. Provides that any interest or investment income that accrues to any of such funds after they have been distributed to a tribe or tribal organization to make loans under this Act shall be: (1) the property of the tribe or tribal organization; and (2) not taken into account by any Federal officer or employee in determining whether to provide assistance, or the amount of assistance, under any provision of Federal law. Directs the Secretary to make grants under this Act to: (1) tribes or multitribal organizations not serviced by current federally funded postsecondary institutions authorized for economic development grants; and (2) tribes or multitribal organizations which lack sufficient numbers of professionally trained tribal members to support established or ongoing economic development activities. Requires any tribe or tribal organization which receives such grant funds to make such funds available by loan to Native American students who have successfully completed 30 hours of postsecondary education and who are eligible for readmission to a postsecondary institution. Sets forth terms of such student loans, including: (1) being subject to repayment over a period of not more than five years; (2) not bearing interest; and (3) being subject to forgiveness for services to the tribe under specified provisions. Requires that calculation of the student's cost of attendance include all costs as determined by the tribe for purposes of fulfilling the policy of this Act. Requires any student seeking such a loan to apply for and accept the maximum financial aid available from other sources. Prohibits such loans from being considered in needs analysis under any other Federal law, and from penalizing students in determining eligibility for other funds. Sets forth requirements for a written agreement between the tribe or tribal organization and the eligible recipient for service fulfillment or loan repayment. Requires the recipient to commit to: (1) perform, for each academic year of assistance under this Act, one calendar year of service to the tribe or tribal organization in an occupation related to the course of study pursued and an economic or social tribal development plan (commencing not later than six months after the student ceases to carry at least one-half the normal full-time academic workload); or (2) repay to the tribe or tribal organization the full amount of the loan, in monthly or quarterly installments within five years (with such recovered funds to be reported annually to the Secretary and invested in the account). Sets forth provisions for: (1) limitations and conditions on such service; (2) waivers or suspensions of such service agreements; (3) pro rata reductions for partial service; and (4) annual certification of individuals' service by the tribe to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish an application process for making grants to eligible entities; (2) take into account in reviewing applications the number of students with partial completion identified by the applicant, relative to the total number of tribal members who would be benefitted by the provision of services; and (3) attempt to achieve geographic and demographic diversity in such grants. Directs the Secretary, subject to the availability of funds and acceptable applications, to make five four-year grants to tribes or tribal organizations. Requires that the amount of administrative costs associated with such grants be negotiated by the Secretary with successful applicants and made a part of the grant agreement. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1997."
