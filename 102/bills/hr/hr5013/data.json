    "text": "Title I: Wild Exotic Bird Conservation - Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 - States that the purpose of this title is to promote exotic bird conservation by: (1) assisting country of origin conservation programs; (2) ensuring that all trade in such species involving the United States is biologically sustainable and nondetrimental; (3) limiting or prohibiting imports of wild birds when necessary; and (4) encouraging implementation of the Conservation on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Convention) and the Appendices thereto. Prohibits the importation into the United States of any exotic bird species (species) listed as category B in a specified report until the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary): (1) determines that appropriate country of origin remedial conservation measures have been taken; and (2) makes specified findings and includes the species in a specified list as provided for by this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend imports of certain listed species if: (1) suspension might be necessary for the species' conservation; and (2) trade is or might be detrimental to the species or certain remedial conservation methods have not been implemented. Prohibits the importation of any species that is listed in any Appendix to the Convention unless included in the list required by this Act, beginning one year after enactment of this Act. Limits the number of exotic birds from any species that may be imported into the United States during the one-year period beginning with the enactment of this Act to the number that were imported during the most recent year for which the Secretary has complete import data. Directs the Secretary, one year after enactment of this Act and periodically thereafter, to list in the Federal Register species approved for U.S. importation. Requires the list to include: (1) the permissible countries of origin; and (2) qualifying breeding facilities in the case of captive bred species. Directs the Secretary to list a species if: (1) it is regularly bred in captivity and not wild-caught; or (2) it is bred in a qualifying facility. Sets forth the criteria for list inclusion of non-captive species, including whether the country of origin is implementing the Convention with regard to: (1) creation of a scientific or similar authority; (2) implementation of a conservation management plan; and (3) humane capture, transport, and maintenance methods. Directs the Secretary to determine whether an exotic bird breeding facility is a qualifying facility pursuant to specified criteria. Makes such determination valid for up to three years. Directs the Secretary to review periodically the trade in non-Convention species and establish an import moratorium or quota on: (1) any species if the list criteria are not being met and the moratorium is necessary for species conservation or otherwise consistent with the purpose of this title; or (2) all species from a particular country if no conservation management plan is in effect and the moratorium is necessary for species conservation or otherwise consistent with the purpose of this title. Directs the Secretary to issue a call for information from each exporting country regarding its wild bird conservation program. Sets forth the procedures by which the Secretary shall respond to petitions for import status, list inclusion, or facility status. Makes it unlawful to: (1) import an exotic bird in violation of any prohibition, suspension, or quota; (2) import an exotic captive-bred bird not bred at a qualifying facility; or (3) violate any regulation issued pursuant to this Act. Sets forth related civil and criminal penalties. Authorizes the Secretary to allow, through the issuance of import permits, the importation of any exotic bird upon determination that such importation is not detrimental to the species' survival and that the bird is being imported for one of the following reasons: (1) scientific research; (2) a personal pet; (3) zoological display or breeding; or (4) cooperative breeding programs. Establishes in the Treasury the Exotic Bird Conservation Fund to provide financial and technical assistance for projects to conserve exotic birds in their native countries. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) review opportunities for a voluntary program of bird labeling, retail outlet and breeding facilities certification, and privately run foreign technical assistance; and (2) require marking and recordkeeping. Authorizes FY 1993 through 1995 appropriations. Title II: Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Tissue Bank - Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Tissue Bank Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, to: (1) coordinate existing facilities for the storage, preparation, examination, and archiving of tissues from selected Great Lakes fish and wildlife, to be known as the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Tissue Bank; (2) maintain a central data base to track and assess data from the Bank; and (3) establish criteria for data base access by the public. Authorizes FY 1993 and 1994 appropriations. Title III: Miscellaneous - Amends the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1990 to extend authorization of appropriations through FY 1998. Amends the African Elephant Conservation Act to extend authorization of appropriations through FY 1998. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make certain technical revisions to specified maps (including areas in Virginia and North Carolina) within 30 days of enactment of this Act. Authorizes the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to continue to draw down Federal funds when matching requirements have been met. Exempts certain subgrantees from specified audit requirements. Requires subgrantees to comply with all applicable Federal laws and regulations. Amends the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1980 as amended to require: (1) completion of Alaska wetland inventories by September 30, 2000; and (2) the creation of a digital wetlands data base for the United States by September 30, 2004, including the archiving and dissemination of such material as it becomes available."
