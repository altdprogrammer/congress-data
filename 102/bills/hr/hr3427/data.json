    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-09-26", 
    "text": "Defense Manufacturing and Critical Technologies Act of 1991 - Directs the Secretary of Defense to conduct a program providing for the establishment of cooperative arrangements (partnerships) between the Department of Defense (DOD) and certain entities in order to encourage and provide for R&D of dual-use critical technologies (technologies having both military and nonmilitary commercial applications). Allows such entities (at least two participating jointly with DOD) to include one or more Federal laboratories, institutions of higher education, State governmental agencies, and other appropriate participants, as determined by the Secretary. Requires the joint participants to have a lead institution other than DOD to direct the activities of the partnership. Requires the non-DOD participants to contribute at least 50 percent of the total cost of the partnership activities. Provides for the protection of information disclosed concerning the R&D activities of the participants. Requires the Secretary to evaluate proposals for partnerships on a merit basis using a competitive selection process. Outlines selection criteria. Directs the Secretary, in consultation and coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, to conduct a program to provide assistance for the activities of eligible regional critical technology application centers (centers) in the United States. Outlines provisions concerning eligible centers, program participants, and assistance authorized, including financial and technical assistance for authorized center activities. Limits such assistance period to six years. Requires: (1) the sponsoring agency of a center to pay at least 30 percent of the total costs incurred for center activities; and (2) the eligible firms participating in a center to pay at least 40 percent of such costs. Requires a center to operate under a management plan that requires participating firms to have the primary responsibility for directing the activities of the center and to exercise such responsibility through majority voting membership of such firms on the board of directors of the center. Outlines provisions concerning program administration as well as selection criteria for centers receiving such assistance. Establishes within the Office of the Director of Defense Research and Engineering the Clearinghouse of Foreign Defense Technology Monitoring and Assessment (Clearinghouse) to: (1) maintain within DOD a central library for the compilation and dissemination of information and assessments regarding significant foreign activities in the R&D and applications of defense critical technologies; (2) establish and maintain data bases on such information and assessments; (3) perform certain liaison activities; (4) provide for public availability of such information and assessments; and (5) cooperate with the Department of Commerce in the dissemination of information and assessments regarding defense critical technologies having potential commercial uses. Directs the Secretary to establish a foreign critical technology monitoring and assessment grant program for the awarding of grants to participating organizations for the establishment of foreign critical technology monitoring and assessment offices in Europe, Pacific Ocean border foreign countries, and other countries as considered appropriate by the Secretary. Makes eligible for such grants any nonprofit industrial or professional organization that has economic and scientific interests in R&D and applications of commercial critical technologies. Requires each grantee to collect, evaluate, and disseminate to its organization and to the Departments of Defense and Commerce assessments of significant activities in R&D and applications of critical technologies that are conducted in the geographic area in which the office is located. Provides funding for FY 1992 and 1993 for critical technology programs and activities. Directs the Secretary to submit to the Congress at least biennially a multiyear strategic road map for each critical technology. Requires each road map to: (1) cover at least four fiscal years; (2) provide an assessment of current strengths and weaknesses in the national capability to develop and apply the technologies covered in the road map, and the sources of such strengths and weaknesses which enhance or hinder the development and application of such technologies; (3) ensure that results of federally-funded and conducted R&D of national critical technologies covered by the road map are appropriately disseminated to U.S. industry; and (4) include a discussion of the achievements of the activities conducted pursuant to the road map. Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to establish one or more national critical technologies advisory committees. Directs the President to establish a schedule for the submission of such road maps at regular intervals between the enactment of this Act and October 1, 1996. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative arrangements (partnerships) with certain entities to encourage and provide for R&D of advanced manufacturing technologies with the potential for having a broad range of applications. Requires each partnership to be composed of participants from two or more eligible firms. Allows the inclusion of one or more Federal laboratories, institutions of higher education, State entities, and other participants as deemed appropriate by the Secretary. Outlines provisions concerning program administration and participant selection criteria. Requires the Secretary to establish three or more partnerships within one year after the enactment of this Act. Provides FY 1992 and 1993 funding for such partnerships. Directs the Secretary to establish a program: (1) to support manufacturing extension programs of States, local governments, and private, non-profit organizations; (2) to promote the development of a broad range of such extension programs, including programs that provide for productivity and quality improvement activities; and (3) to increase the involvement of appropriate segments of the private sector in such programs. Establishes a Council on Manufacturing Extension to: (1) prescribe policies and procedures for the implementation of the program; (2) serve as a means for coordinating such program with related programs conducted by various Federal departments and agencies; and (3) develop a long-range strategic plan for the manufacturing extension activities of the Federal Government. Outlines application procedures for persons wishing to receive financial assistance for participation in the program, as well as criteria for choosing program participants. Limits the amount of financial assistance awarded to 50 percent of the cost of the program for the period in which the assistance is provided. Provides such assistance for at least five years, unless it is terminated earlier for good cause as determined by the Secretary. Allows a program participant to reapply after a terminated period of assistance. Provides FY 1992 and 1993 funding for such program. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Directors of the National Science Foundation (NSC) and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), to establish a program for making grants to institutions of higher education to support the: (1) enhancement of existing programs in manufacturing engineering education that are conducted by grantee institutions and meet specified requirements; and (2) establishment of new programs in manufacturing engineering education that meet such requirements. Requires at least one-third of the grants to be awarded for the latter purpose. Directs the Secretary to avoid geographical concentration of such awards. Directs the Secretary and the Director of NSC to enter into an agreement for carrying out the grant program. Outlines grant program requirements. Directs the Secretary to solicit from institutions of higher education proposals for grants to be awarded for the support of programs of manufacturing engineering education. Requires applications to be evaluated on a merit basis under competitive procedures. Outlines grantee selection criteria. Limits the Federal contribution of such assistance to 50 percent of the estimated cost of the activities involved. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, to conduct a program to support specified activities of one or more manufacturing managers and experts at the institution of higher education involved. Outlines provisions concerning program administration and applicant selection criteria. Limits the Federal support of such program to 50 percent of the costs of activities to be supported by such assistance. Requires the Secretary to award at least ten such grants within one year after enactment of this Act. Provides FY 1992 and 1993 funding. Allows the Secretary to authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to enter into cooperative agreements and other transactions for advanced research projects. (Currently, only the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is authorized to enter into such agreements or transactions.) Makes permanent (currently expires September 30, 1991) the authority to enter into such agreements. Directs the Secretary to report to the defense committees a plan for collecting and assessing information on the extent to which the defense industrial base of the United States: (1) procures weapons systems, subsystems, and components of such systems from foreign sources; and (2) is dependent upon such foreign sources for such procurement. Directs the Secretary to report to the defense committees a plan for the removal of barriers to the effective integration of the commercial and defense sectors of the U.S. industrial base. Requires the Secretary to designate an official within his Office to develop the plan. Requires annual development and submission to the Congress by the Secretary of a National Defense Manufacturing Technology Plan. Places FY 1992 and 1993 funding limitations on manufacturing technology-related R&D not specifically included in such annual Plan. Directs the Secretary to conduct a program for the development and use of advanced flexible computer integrated manufacturing capabilities in each of the military departments and the U.S. defense industrial base. Requires the continued development of Rapid Acquisition of Manufactured Parts technologies and applications as part of such program. Provides FY 1992 and 1993 funding for such program, with a specified capabilities-duplication prohibition within the military departments.
