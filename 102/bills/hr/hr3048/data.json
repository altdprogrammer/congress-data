Repeals the 25,000 annual cap on P-1 and P-3 visas. Requires the General Accounting Office to submit a report regarding O and P admissions and foreign treatment of U.S. artists and entertainers to the appropriate congressional committees, who shall then hold a related hearing. Establishes exceptions to the requirement that a P-1 alien must have at least one year's membership with his or her group, including: (1) certain alien circus personnel; (2) automatic waiver for 25 percent of a group; and (3) replacement due to exigent circumstances. Authorizes P-1 groups to be \"nationally recognized\" in lieu of \"internationally recognized\" under special circumstances. Revises consultation requirements to: (1) require an alien to submit advisory opinions regarding his or her expertise from peer groups or labor organizations; (2) permit the Attorney General to adjudicate a visa petition without an advisory opinion if no appropriate peer group exists; (3) direct the Attorney General to establish an expedited consultation procedure; and (4) waive the consultation requirement for an O-1 alien readmission if such alien has had a consultation within the previous two years. Defines extraordinary ability in the arts for an O visa to mean \"distinction.\" Makes O visa revisions regarding paperwork requirements, and multiple events. Repeals the three-month out of country waiting time for P-2 and P-3 readmissions. Makes P visa revisions regarding treatment of foreign organizations and performance of teaching and coaching functions. Establishes a return transportation requirement for O and P aliens (employer and petitioner jointly and severally liable for such cost). Treats fashion modeling as a specialty occupation for nonimmigrant admissions purposes. Directs the Attorney General to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees regarding O,P,H, and Q visa petitions."
