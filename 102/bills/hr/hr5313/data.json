    "date": "1992-06-03", 
    "text": "Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1992 - Title I: International Efforts to Reduce Illegal Drug Production and Drug Trafficking - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should direct the Secretary of State to negotiate with the Governments of Canada and Mexico for the establishment of a North American Narcotics Council which would explore ways and means of facilitating the exchange of information (both in antinarcotics efforts and in substance abuse reduction and education programs), increasing cooperation in antinarcotics efforts, and improving efforts to supply assistance to source and trafficking countries, and reducing through other areas and programs the demand for and supply of illicit narcotics and psychotropic substances. Requires the President to submit to the Congress, for each fiscal year in which the United States participates in the Council, a budget request to cover the expenses of such participation. Sets forth provisions for the appointment of a permanent U.S. representative and congressional advisors to the Council, provisions for termination of such Council, and reporting requirements. Requires the President, with respect to each year after 1992, to determine whether: (1) there was a reduction in the quantity of illicit coca produced or in illicit coca activities in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru; and (2) any reduction is attributable to the implementation of social or economic alternatives in such countries. Authorizes the President, if an affirmative determination with respect to such a country is made and the Congress enacts a law approving it, to apply special trade treatment to articles that: (1) are products of such country; and (2) are entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption in U.S. customs territory in the year following the year such determination was made. Specifies that if the granting of such special trade treatment would violate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, provisions of this Act shall be inapplicable until the President obtains a waiver of the provision which is the basis for such violation. Prohibits such special treatment if specified actions under the Narcotics Control Trade Act are in effect with respect to such country or if such treatment is restricted under countervailing duties or trade dumping regulations. Authorizes appropriations for additional economic assistance grants for the Governments of Bolivia and Peru, to be made available only after consummation of a written agreement between such governments and the United States outlining specific, verifiable illicit coca eradication plans resulting in a 50 percent eradication of the illicit coca crop by the end of FY 1994, and a 100 percent eradication by the end of FY 1997. Requires the Secretary of State to negotiate such bilateral agreements on behalf of the United States and to have primary responsibility for verifying the actual eradication of illicit coca in Bolivia and Peru. Authorizes the use of funds under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) for training and equipment for law enforcement agencies or other units in Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru that are organized for the specific purpose of enforcing narcotics laws. Waives, during FY 1992 through 1994, specified provisions limiting assistance to countries in default on obligations owed to the United States with respect to narcotics-related assistance under the FAA or AECA for a country that is a \"major illicit drug producing country\" because of its coca production. Amends the FAA to: (1) authorize funding for the procurement of weapons or ammunition to arm, for defensive purposes, aircraft that are leased or loaned by the United States and used in narcotics control eradication or interdiction efforts and persons participating in such efforts; (2) make an exception to the withholding of assistance for major illicit drug producing or drug-transit countries where such action would be contrary to the national interest of the United States; (3) authorize the President to provide aircraft on a sale or grant basis for anti-narcotics activities if he determines that it would be in the national interest to do so and reports the determination and the terms of the proposed sale or grant to the Congress; (4) authorize Bolivia and Peru to have U.S. military personnel strengths larger than six to carry out international security assistance programs; and (5) make certain certification procedures under such Act inapplicable to certain major drug-transit countries if the President certifies that such countries meet specified requirements in making progress towards narcotics control. Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to: (1) make certain restrictions under such Act and under the AECA inapplicable to sales of defense articles or services made on or before September 30, 1994 (currently, 1990); and (2) revise the definition of the term \"defense articles and services\" to conform to that under the AECA. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the U.S. Executive Directors of the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, and the Inter-American Development Bank to use the vote and influence of the United States to promote development projects in the Andean region consistent with U.S. anti-narcotics objectives. Establishes an Interagency Task Force on Combatting Illicit Narcotics and an Interagency Task Force on Money Laundering. Authorizes the Attorney General to assist major illicit drug producing and drug-transit countries in adopting national legislation to accommodate treaties on mutual assistance in criminal matters and on extradition and to provide technical assistance and advice aimed at strengthening the judicial, legal, and law enforcement systems of such countries. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the United States should support the actions of Latin American jurists in prosecuting drug criminals; and (2) the President should take steps to convene an international judicial conference for the purposes of emphasizing worldwide support for prosecuting drug traffickers and enabling senior judicial officials to exchange information on antinarcotic laws and statutes. Authorizes appropriations for military and law enforcement assistance and training to eligible countries for controlling illicit narcotics production and trafficking. Urges the executive branch to: (1) coordinate closely with all allies in the Western Hemisphere dedicated to countering the threat of drug trafficking; and (2) explore the possibility of undertaking joint military and intelligence operations with other countries of the Western Hemisphere. Directs the Attorney General to enter into negotiations with law enforcement officials of each foreign country with jurisdiction over companies that manufacture, market, sell, or purchase precursor or essential chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of controlled substances, with priority given to countries knowingly or unknowingly supplying such chemicals, to: (1) establish a list of such chemicals; (2) achieve international agreement on a method for maintaining records of transactions of such chemicals; (3) establish a procedure by which such records may be made available to U.S. law enforcement authorities; and (4) encourage source countries to enact national chemical control legislation.
