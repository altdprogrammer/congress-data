    "text": "Amends the Truth in Lending Act to require the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to issue regulations to discourage theft of credit cards that are mailed. Directs that such regulations: (1) require that a credit card issuer, before mailing any credit card, notify the person to whom the card is mailed that the card is being mailed; (2) prohibit an issuer from mailing a credit card other than in an inactive status; (3) prohibit an issuer that mails a credit card from activating the card before the person to whom the card is issued notifies the issuer that the card has been received; and (4) require an issuer that mails a credit card to establish a toll-free telephone number by which a person may notify the issuer of such receipt. Requires specified Federal agencies to prescribe regulations that are substantially similar to those prescribed by the Board. Sets deadlines for issuance of such regulations."
