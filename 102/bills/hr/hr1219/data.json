Provides for the relinquishment of Koniag, Inc., Selection Rights (oil and gas rights) to specified lands in Alaska in exchange for the Secretary of the Treasury establishing a Koniag Account in equal value to the Selection Rights which shall be available to Koniag for bidding on and purchasing Federal property (wherever located) sold at any public sale by an agency. Limits the average value per acre of the Selection Rights to a maximum of $300."
