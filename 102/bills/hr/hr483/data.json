Requires the image to appear for at least four seconds on at least one-third of the television screen accompanied by statements identifying the political committee or the other person paying for the advertisement and the candidate responsible for its content. Requires television advertisements that have not been authorized by a candidate to present statements: (1) naming the person paying for the advertisement and any connected organization; and (2) indicating that the advertisement has not been authorized by any candidate. Requires authorized and unauthorized radio advertisements to contain such appropriate statements. Prescribes color contrast and character height standards for statements in advertisements in publications disclosing who authorized and paid for the advertisement. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a licensee from using a broadcasting station for a communication not in compliance with the guidelines established by this Act."
