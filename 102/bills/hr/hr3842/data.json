    "text": "Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone Extension and Enforcement Act of 1992 - Declares that territorial sea of the United States is subject to U.S. sovereignty and exclusive jurisdiction. Provides for the application of this provision to U.S. laws. Establishes the contiguous zone of the United States, consisting of a belt of sea contiguous to the outer limits of the U.S. territorial sea and extending a certain distance seaward from the U.S. baselines determined in accordance with international law. Declares that the United States has the authority, within the contiguous zone, to take the actions described in Article 33 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Provides for the application of this provision to U.S. laws. Amends specified Acts to define, for purposes of those Acts: (1) \"import\" to include bringing into any place subject to U.S. jurisdiction, including the U.S. territorial sea, whether or not the bringing constitutes importation within the meaning of customs laws; and (2) \"territorial sea of the United States\" to mean the U.S. territorial sea as described in a specified Presidential Proclamation. Amends other Acts to add references to the same Proclamation. Amends the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to modify: (1) the definition of \"Continental Shelf;\" and (2) State jurisdiction over waters adjacent to the State. Amends specified Acts to replace references to the outer limit of the territorial sea with references to the inner boundary of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to: (1) refer to that proclamation in the definition of \"territorial sea of the United States;\" (2) extend the distance constituting the contiguous zone to conform to the definition of that zone under this Act; (3) include the U.S. territorial sea in the definition of \"marine environment;\" (4) exclude from the definition of \"material,\" for provisions relating to ocean dumping, matter from the normal operation of a vessel that discharges the matter in compliance with a specified convention on pollution from ships and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships; and (5) modify the size of the zone contiguous to the U.S. territorial sea within which unauthorized dumping of material transported from a location outside the United States is prohibited. Amends the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Act of 1980 to: (1) refer to that proclamation in the definition of \"territorial sea of the United States;\" and (2) specify which law shall control between three and 12 nautical miles from the baselines. Amends the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to extend to twelve miles from the line of ordinary low water the distance constituting the territorial seas. Amends specified Federal laws to substitute for references to operating on the high seas: (1) reference to operating beyond three nautical miles from the baselines; or (2) references to operating beyond the U.S. territorial sea. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to issue a coastwise endorsement to a documented vessel used in the coastwise trade as extended by this Act to transport fish, fish products, or directly related materials to or from places in the U.S. territorial sea or on shore if certain conditions are met. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 to declare that a foreign fishing or fish processing vessel with a permit may engage in activities authorized by that permit within the EEZ, including the portion of the U.S. territorial sea within the EEZ. Amends Federal law prohibiting foreign vessels from transporting passengers in the United States and foreign-built dredges from dredging in the United States to include such transportation and dredging in the U.S. territorial sea. Authorizes a competitive grant for a study of the adequacy of existing Federal and State laws, regulations, and policies for the management of resources within the U.S. territorial sea. Authorizes appropriations."
