Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to: (1) develop and implement a program with any of the affected independent states of the former Soviet Union or any country that is a signatory of a treaty banning the possession of chemical weapons, for the exchange of technical knowledge on the disposal of chemical weapons in order to explore and develop safer more cost-effective methods of such disposal; and (2) make grants to individuals in the private sector with expertise in the disposal of chemical agents to cover the costs incurred in exchange activities under such program. Establishes the Chemical Demilitarization Advisory Commission to determine and report to the President and the Congress on alternative technologies appropriate for use in the disposal of lethal chemical agents and munitions. Terminates the Commission 90 days after it submits the report. Authorizes appropriations."
