States that it shall not be in order in either the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider or adopt a concurrent resolution on the budget that does not meet this standard. Requires the President's budget to comply with the same standard. Directs the President to take action (by placing funds in reserve, by apportionment of funds, or otherwise) necessary to ensure such compliance, notwithstanding obligational authority or appropriations made within the executive branch."
