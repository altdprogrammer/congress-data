Designates the persons who may approve a contractual provision for such indemnification. Requires such a contract to: (1) require, as prerequisites to such indemnification, that the Academy receive a written statement of a claim against it or be served with a pleading commencing a suit against it and give written notice to the Attorney General of such written claim or service of process within the five-day period after the receipt of claim or the service of process, whichever first occurs; and (2) provide for contract of or assistance in the defense by the Government, at its election, of any such claim or suit. Prohibits a payment from being made pursuant to this Act unless the Attorney General certifies that the amount is just and reasonable, with exceptions. Permits such a payment to be made from funds: (1) obligated for the performance of the contract concerned; (2) available to the executive agency concerned for research or development, or both, and not otherwise obligated; or (3) appropriated for such payment."
