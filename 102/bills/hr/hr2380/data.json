Permits fees to be used only for recycling and waste management programs. Authorizes a State to enforce laws regulating the treatment and disposal of solid waste within the State. Exempts specified types of waste from regulation under this Act. Grants congressional approval to agreements or compacts entered into by two or more States for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance for solid waste management. Authorizes the Administrator to promulgate regulations exempting waste types or recycling practices from the authority granted to States under this Act if such action promotes the development of an interstate market for recyclable materials or is necessary to promote environmentally sound waste disposal practices."
