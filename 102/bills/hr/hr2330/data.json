    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-05-14", 
    "text": "Audiotext Industry Obligations and Consumer Rights Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), within 270 days, to complete a rulemaking proceeding to establish a system for the oversight and regulation of audiotext services. Requires the FCC's final rules to: (1) include measures that provide a consumer of audiotext services with adequate and clear descriptions of the rights of the caller; (2) define the obligations of common carriers with respect to the provision of such services; (3) include requirements on such carriers to protect against abusive practices by providers of such services; (4) prohibit customers from being disconnected from local exchange services for refusal to pay for such services; and (5) identify procedures by which common carriers and providers of such services may take affirmative steps to protect against nonpayment of legitimate charges. Specifies that such regulations shall prohibit any common carrier from offering audiotext services of any provider of such services who fails to: (1) include in each audiotext message an introductory disclosure message that describes the service being provided, specifies clearly and at a reasonably understandable volume the total cost or cost per minute and any other fees for such service and for any other audiotext service to which the caller may be transferred, informs the caller of the option to hang up at the end of the introductory message without incurring any charge, and informs the caller that parental consent is required for calls made by children; (2) disable any bypass mechanism which allows frequent callers to avoid listening to the disclosure message after the institution of any price increase and for a period of time sufficient to give frequent callers sufficient notice of the price change; (3) stop the assessment of time-based charges immediately upon disconnection by the caller; (4) include an appropriate and clear signal at intervals determined by the FCC, where technically feasible, during live interactive group programs, to alert callers to the passage of time, and explain such signal in the disclosure required for such program; and (5) comply with such additional standards as the FCC may prescribe to prevent abusive practices. Directs that such regulations require that any common carriers offering audiotext services: (1) require, pursuant to contract or tariff, that a provider of audiotext services comply with regulations issued pursuant to such Act and terminate the offering of an audiotext service of a provider if such service is not provided in compliance with such regulations; (2) ensure that a caller may avoid audiotext charges with respect to services provided in violation of such regulations or under such other circumstances as the FCC determines necessary to protect callers from abusive practices; (3) establish a local or toll-free telephone number to answer questions and provide information on callers' rights and obligations with regard to their use of audiotext services offered by the common carrier; (4) within 60 days after the issuance of final regulations, provide to all of such common carrier's telephone subscribers a disclosure statement that clearly sets forth all rights and obligations held by the subscriber and the carrier with respect to the use and payment for audiotext services, describes any nonpayment option prescribed by the FCC and the applicable blocking option, and provides an explanation of live interactive programming; (5) ensure that charges for audiotext services are stated separately on the bill from the sections relating to local and long distance telephone charges and that such statement includes the common carrier's toll-free telephone number; (6) notify in writing the State regulatory commission of any State within which the carrier intends to offer audiotext services of such intention, including a description of the service to be provided and a list of the carrier's policies and procedures; (7) make available to such State regulatory commission, upon request, a list of audiotext telephone numbers accessible by callers within that State through such carrier, including the name, business address, and business telephone number of the audiotext provider; and (8) obtain from any provider of audiotext services that solicits charitable contributions proof of tax exempt status. Specifies that such regulations shall require that any local exchange carrier carrying audiotext services must offer callers the option of blocking access to all audiotext services for their telephone. Allows such regulation to permit the costs of such blocking to be recovered by contract or tariff, but specifies that such costs may not be recovered from local or long distance ratepayers. Directs that such option be offered without charge to the caller for a reasonable period (established by FCC regulations) after the effective date of such regulation, an initial connection, or subscription for any new telephone line. Requires the FCC to consult with the Federal Trade Commission concerning the adequacy of existing regulations relating to the advertising of audiotext services via broadcasting and cable communications and, if such existing regulations are deemed inadequate, to take specified steps, such as requiring that TV advertisements include notification that charges will be billed to the caller's telephone number, notification that children under age 18 must obtain parental consent before placing a call to the advertised number, and a statement of the cost of calling such number. Specifies that such regulations may exempt from introductory message requirements: (1) calls from frequent callers or regular subscribers using a bypass mechanism to avoid listening to the disclosure message required by such regulations; or (2) audiotext services provided at nominal charges. Directs: (1) that such regulations establish procedures to ensure that carriers and other parties provide appropriate refunds to callers who have been billed for audiotext services pursuant to programs found to have violated such Act, such regulations, or any other Federal, State, or local consumer protection law; and (2) the FCC, within one year, to submit to the Congress its recommendations with respect to the extension of such regulations to services that provide, for a per call charge, data services that are not audiotext services. Specifies that no cause of action may be brought in any court or administrative agency against a common carrier or its affiliates on account of any action which the carrier or affiliate takes in good faith to terminate an audiotext service in order to comply with the regulations prescribed under such Act."
