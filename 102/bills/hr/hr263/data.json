Authorizes the Comptroller to release funds for a system to the extent necessary to enable the system to meet such requirements and criteria. Requires the Secretary of each military department, at the beginning of each fiscal year, to establish a funding schedule (expressed as projected costs for meeting requirements and criteria) for each system. Directs each Secretary to maintain and update such schedules to reflect changes in requirements, criteria, and projected costs. Requires the Comptroller to review such schedules."
