Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide tax credits for contributors to candidates for public office equal to 50 percent of the annual total of a contributor's political contributions. Limits tax credits to an annual total of $125 and $250 respectively for individual and joint contributors. Disallows estates and trusts from receiving such tax credits."
