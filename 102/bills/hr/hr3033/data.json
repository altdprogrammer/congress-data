    "text": "Job Training Reform Amendments of 1992 - Title I: Job Training Partnership Requirements - Subtitle A: General Provisions - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to revise and extend employment and training assistance programs. Declares it to be the policy of the United States to: (1) provide financial assistance to States and local service delivery areas (SDAs) to meet the training needs of low-income adults and youth and assist them in obtaining unsubsidized employment; (2) increase funds availabe for programs of training services for the disadvantaged by at least ten percent of the baseline each fiscal year to provide for growth in the number of eligible adults and youth served beyond the current five percent of the eligible population in need of these services; and (3) encourage provision of longer and more comprehensive education, training, and employment services to the eligible population, with increased funding to maintain current service levels. Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to authorize appropriations for FY 1993 and succeeding fiscal years. Requires that both part A (Adult Training Program) and part C (Youth Training Program) of title II (Training Services for the Disadvantaged) of JTPA each receive at least 40 percent of the combined funds for such parts A and C. Defines \"basic skills deficient\" as reading or computing skills at or below 8th grade level. Adds the Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs, the Center for Employment Training, literacy organizations, organizations serving older workers and organizations that provide service opportunities and youth corps programs to the list of community-based organizations. Strikes from such list the National Urban Indian Council. Revises the definition of \"economically disadvantaged\" to: (1) refer to the official poverty line, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget; and (2) include those determined eligible for, even if not receiving, food stamps during the six-month period prior to the application. Revises the definition of \"supportive services\" to include: (1) drug and alcohol abuse counseling and referral; (2) individual and family counseling; (3) financial assistance (except post-termination); (4) dependent care; and (5) job coaches. Subtitle B: Service Delivery System - Includes as exceptions to the two-year limit on frequency of Governor's redesignations of service delivery areas (SDAs): (1) failure to meet performance standards; and (2) failure to take corrective action for a substantial violation of JTPA or related regulations. Includes representatives of public assistance agencies on private industry councils (PICs) under JTPA. Revises other provisions for PIC membership. Requires that representatives of organized labor and community-based organizations constitute at least 15 percent of PIC membership. Sets forth selection procedures for education representatives and labor representatives on the PIC. Applies the requirement for a job training plan to training services for the disadvantaged only. Revises requirements for the contents of such plans to provide for linkages with appropriate agencies and for outreach to recruit locally determined target groups. Adds requirements for procedures for selecting service providers. Requires service delivery area (SDA) job training plans to include: (1) goals for the training of women in nontraditional employment and the training-related placement of women in nontraditional employment and apprenticeship; (2) a description of efforts to be undertaken to accomplish such goals, including efforts to increase awareness of such training and placement opportunities; and (3) procedures for annual reporting of the extent to which the SDA has met such goals and of a statistical breakdown of women trained and placed in nontraditional occupations, including specified types of information. Adds community-based organizations to those entities reviewing such job training plans. Revises requirements for training services for the disadvantaged performance standards to: (1) promote delivery of services to the hard-to-serve; and (2) add measurement of increased basic education attainment and occupational skills (as well as the current measurement of increased employment and earnings and reduced welfare dependency). Provides for the following additional factors in performance standards for youth programs: (1) attainment of employability competencies; (2) dropout prevention and recovery; (3) secondary and postsecondary school completion or its equivalent; and (4) enrollment in other education, training, or employment programs or apprenticeship, or enlistment in the Armed Forces. Allows variations in standards to reflect differences between in-school and out-of-school programs. Requires the private industry council to determine levels for competency standards based on such factors as entry skill levels and other hiring requirements. Sets forth additional elements of performance standards. Retains the requirement that the Secretary prescribe performance measures, but states that such standards shall not be taken into consideration in the award of incentive grants.
