    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Hazardous Waste Facilities Public Accountability Act of 1992 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to revise standards for financial responsibility and post-closure care for hazardous waste facilities to require: (1) a post-closure period in perpetuity for facilities where wastes or residuals remain on the site, unless the facility owner or operator can demonstrate that post-closure care is no longer necessary; (2) financial responsibility for credible accidents and corrective action from the issuance of a permit through closure and the entire post-closure period; and (3) liability assurances through the entire post-closure care period, financial responsibility for post-closure care through the entire post-closure period, and revisions of cost estimates if the cost of such care is increased. Requires the payment of annual fees by owners or operators required to obtain operating or post-closure care permits. Prohibits a State from maintaining a hazardous waste program unless it demonstrates that it will collect fees in an amount reflecting the reasonable costs of the permit program. Imposes penalties for failures to pay fees. Allows fees to differentiate between facilities based on size, complexity, and other factors. Prohibits any person from obtaining or renewing a permit, expanding a facility, or transferring ownership of a facility unless such person demonstrates that any firm engaged to operate the facility: (1) is in compliance with Federal and State environmental and public health statutes and regulations; (2) has paid all outstanding fines or penalties for violations of such statutes and regulations; and (3) has made available to the public a statement disclosing criminal convictions for violations of antitrust laws and citations for permit violations or environmental cleanup, reclamation, or closure violations."
