Exempts from this Act's requirements waste paper, glass cullet, metal, or plastic that: (1) has been separated from solid waste before export; (2) is exported for incorporation into new products with recycled content; and (3) is not a hazardous waste under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Authorizes persons to apply to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for the exemption of other recovered materials. Requires persons exporting exempted materials to notify the Administrator prior to such exporting. Prohibits the export of solid waste from the United States unless there is an agreement between the United States and the receiving country which provides for: (1) the exchange of information regarding such export and its management; (2) cooperation on compliance with, and enforcement of, such agreement; (3) biennial review and revision or suspension of such agreement under certain circumstances; and (4) a prohibition on further transport of such waste from the country of destination without the written consent of parties to the agreement. Deems any agreement concerning shipments of hazardous waste entered into by the United States and in force on this Act's enactment date to meet this Act's requirements for two years following such enactment date. Prohibits the export of solid waste from the United States unless the exporter has obtained a permit from the Administrator. Outlines information to be included in the permit application. Requires the Director of the National Enforcement Investigations Center to submit an investigative report on each applicant to the Administrator. Provides that permittees shall have the continuing duty to provide assistance or information requested by the Administrator or the Center and to cooperate in any inquiry conducted by the Center. Directs the Administrator, before issuing a permit under this Act, to determine that the solid waste will be managed in a manner protective of human health and the environment and which is no less strict than that which would be required if the waste were managed in the United States. Provides that such determination shall assure that certain facility operation and transportation requirements are met. Limits permit terms to a period of five years. Directs the Administrator to report annually to the Congress on all solid waste exports. Prohibits the issuance of any permit unless the Administrator determines that: (1) the waste generator has used reasonable efforts to eliminate or minimize waste generation prior to export; (2) the receiving facility is capable of treating, storing, and disposing of such waste in a manner protective of human health and the environment and no less strict than that which would be required if the waste were managed in the United States; and (3) the application meets the requirements of this Act. Directs the Administrator to make inspections of any permittee and of any facility handling waste subject to a permit, as necessary. Authorizes the Administrator to revoke a permit under specified circumstances. Directs the Administrator to establish a user fee to defray the cost of administering this Act. Requires such fee system to consist of a one-time permit application fee and a waste export permit fee to be paid over the life of the permit. Prescribes civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act."
