    "text": "Underwater Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1991 - Amends the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 to require the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations requiring that operators of underwater pipeline facilities provide information (and revise such information periodically) such as the following for each facility: (1) the location, diameter, and length of the facility; (2) the date of installation, type, and manufacturer of the facility; (3) the date on which significant repairs were made or when the facility was replaced, and the nature of the repair, replacement, or both; and (4) an assessment by the operator of the susceptability of the facility to corrosion and outside force damage. Directs the Secretary to issue annual reports to the Congress. Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish and maintain in a computer data base a hazardous liquid pipeline facility inventory, incorporating the data submitted by such operators, and other data collected, under this Act; and (2) make such data accessible by computer telecommunication and any other appropriate means to any person, at a reasonable cost, and to States and municipalities without charge. Sets forth additional reporting requirements. Directs the Secretary: (1) within one year, to issue regulations requiring all underwater pipeline facilities which can accommodate the passage, without significant alterations, of instrumented internal inspection devices to be inspected with such devices (and requires such inspections to be conducted on at least an annual basis, unless the Secretary determines that less frequent inspections do not diminish their value in preventing releases); (2) within 18 months, to issue regulations requiring the use of remotely controlled emergency flow restricting devices on all underwater pipeline facilities (and requiring the annual inspection of such devices and the review of any operational procedures and training guidelines associated with the use of such devices); and (3) within six months, to study the benefits of automatic emergency flow restricting devices on underwater pipeline facilities in preventing releases into environmentally sensitive areas or significant commercial water routes (and, upon completion of such study, to report to the Congress and make recommendations). Requires the Secretary, within six months, to submit to the Congress a report describing Department of Transportation (DOT) actions to ensure that its enforcement policies and procedures pertaining to the hazardous liquid pipeline safety program are consistent throughout the program, including the extent to which: (1) DOT has implemented procedures to coordinate the enforcement activities of its hazardous liquid pipeline safety field inspection staff with headquarters enforcement and legal staff, written guidelines regarding procedures for the adequate documentation of cases, and written guidelines delineating the type and severity of sanctions that should be applied to violators of pipeline safety regulations; and (2) guidelines pertaining to sanctions incorporate an operator's enforcement history and the extent to which such guidelines require the levying of more severe sanctions on chronic violators of hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations. Directs the Secretary to collect information regarding each hazardous liquid pipeline facility operator's inspection and enforcement history in order to: (1) determine whether there is evidence of chronic violations of hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations by such operator; and (2) set priorities for inspection, increased monitoring, rulemaking, and in the event that widespread deficiencies are discovered in the hazardous liquid pipeline safety program, remedial efforts to correct such deficiencies. Requires that information pertaining to operators possessing a record of chronic violations of hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations be made available to other Federal, State, and local government agencies and officials, and to the public upon written request. Amends the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 to require that not less than 20 (currently, five) percent of any amounts appropriated for carrying out the Federal grants-in-aid provisions for any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1991 (currently, 1985) be available for grants to aid State enforcement under such Act."
