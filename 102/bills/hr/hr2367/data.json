Declares a person to be an infringer of the copyright in any audiovisual work that has been treated for the purpose of preventing or inhibiting its reproduction if that person imports, manufactures, sells, or distributes any device or component whose primary purpose of effect is to avoid, deactivate, or circumvent copy-protection systems. Declares the importation of such equipment actionable. Amends the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to prohibit such devices. Makes civil remedies, including attorney's fees and litigation costs, available for violations of such Act."
