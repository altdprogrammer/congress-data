Directs the President, whenever seeking a declaration of war or whenever U.S. armed forces are introduced into hostilities or situations described in the War Powers Resolution of 1973, to report within 48 hours to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate on: (1) the circumstances necessitating the introduction of U.S. armed forces; (2) the constitutional and legislative authority under which such introduction will take place; (3) the level of U.S. and foreign casualties expected; (4) the estimated scope, duration, and cost of the hostilities; (5) the proportion of the total cost which will be paid by U.S. allies; (6) what Federal programs should be cut and what Federal revenues should be increased to pay for military action; and (7) how U.S. armed forces personnel needs will be met and whether the draft should be reinstated to meet such needs. Requires the Comptroller General to review such report. Provides for revisions of the President's report whenever the data on cost or casualties provided by the Comptroller General exceed the estimates provided by the President."
