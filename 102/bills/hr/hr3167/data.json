    "text": "Authorizes a holder of a valid oil shale mining claim who has filed a patent application by August 1, 1991, to receive: (1) a general patent if in receipt of a first half final certificate by the date of enactment of this Act; or (2) a limited patent (oil shale and associated minerals) if not in receipt of such certificate by such date. Requires a holder who did not file for a patent by August 1, 1991, to elect either a limited patent or maintenance of an unpatented claim. Deems failure to elect as an abandonment of the claim. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to notify holders of unpatented claims of the requirements of this Act."
