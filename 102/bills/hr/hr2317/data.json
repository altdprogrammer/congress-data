    "text": "Indian Development Investment Zone Act of 1991 - Title I: Designation of Indian Development Investment Zones - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for the designation of Indian enterprise zones by the Secretary of the Interior for purposes of providing tax relief and increasing the economic stake of tribal residents in their community and its development. Sets forth eligibility requirements and required tribal commitments for such designations. Requires the Secretary to prepare and submit to the Congress every four years a report on the effects of such Indian enterprise zones' designation. Requires that any tax reduction effected by a tribal commitment under the terms of this Act be disregarded for purposes of determining the eligibility of a tribe for Federal assistance or benefits. Title II: Federal Income Tax Incentives - Subtitle A: Credits for Employers - Allows employers located in Indian enterprise zones a nonrefundable income tax credit for qualified increased employment expenditures and for certain wages paid to economically disadvantaged individuals. Subtitle B: Credits for Investment in Tangible Property in Indian Enterprise Zones - Allows businesses an additional investment tax credit for investment in certain tangible property located in Indian enterprise zones. Subtitle C: Sense of the Congress with Respect to Tax Simplification - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury should simplify the administration and enforcement of amendments made by this Act. Title III: Establishment of Foreign-Trade Zones in Indian Enterprise Zones - Requires the Foreign Trade Zone Board to consider on a priority basis and to expedite the processing of applications for the establishment of foreign-trade zones within Indian enterprise zones. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to give priority to, and expedite the processing of, applications for the establishment of foreign-trade zones within Indian enterprise zones. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to give priority to, and expedite applications for, the establishment of ports of entry necessary to establish such zones. Title IV: Conflict Resolution in Indian Enterprise Zones - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to approve plans, pursuant to a tribal economic development plan, that include provisions for conflict resolution between enterprise zone parties. Requires that such plans not encumber the trust assets of the tribe. Title V: Amendment to Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act - Amends the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to permit contractors of a Federal agency additional compensation equal to five percent of certain payments made to a subcontractor or supplier that is an Indian organization or Indian-owned economic enterprise."
