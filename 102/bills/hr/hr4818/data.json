    "text": "Department of Energy Nuclear Weapons Complex Reconfiguration Commission Act - Establishes the Department of Energy Nuclear Weapons Complex Reconfiguration Commission (appointed by the President) to review and report to the Congress on: (1) segmentation decisions by the Department of Energy (DOE) with respect to programmatic environmental impact statements (PEIS) prepared under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, including DOE proposals to segment the issue of nonnuclear consolidation from the PEIS process; (2) environmental assessments and any findings of no significant impact made by DOE as a result of a PEIS or segmentation of a DOE-prepared PEIS; (3) the DOE record of decision with respect to any DOE-prepared PEIS regarding the structural reconfiguration of the nuclear weapons complex; (4) the need for supplemental environmental impact statements (SEIS) to be prepared by DOE, and to review such SEIS; (5) the adjustment assistance plan for nuclear weapons facility workers proposed by DOE; and (6) DOE analyses of the cost of the structural reconfiguration of the nuclear weapons complex. Directs the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) to report biannually to the Commission on DOE actions, assessments, and decisions with respect the Commission's enumerated duties. Requires the Commission, after receiving the Secretary's report, to submit to the President an evaluation of its reviews, and a justification of any proposals that differ from those of DOE. Prescribes procedures for approval or disapproval of Commission recommendations by either the President or the Congress. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to postpone implementation of any DOE proposal to segment the issue of nonnuclear consolidation from the PEIS process until the Commission makes a recommendation in favor of such proposal which the President approves and the Congress does not disapprove."
