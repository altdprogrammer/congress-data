    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-05-01", 
    "text": "Coast Guard Management and Law Enforcement Act of 1991 - Title I: Vessel Acquisition and Renovation - Authorizes appropriations for the Coast Guard for renovation of the Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw. Authorizes appropriations to implement the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990. Amends Federal law to authorize the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to acquire by purchase, lease, lease-purchase, or otherwise under multiyear contracts vessels for Coast Guard use, subject to certain conditions. Amends provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 relating to capital construction funds to add to the definitions of \"eligible vessel\" and \"qualified vessel\" vessels operating under an agreement with: (1) the Secretary of Commerce for use by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; or (2) the Secretary of Transportation for use by the Coast Guard. Title II: Law Enforcement - Subtitle A: Orders to Land - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide for fines and imprisonment for the pilot or operator of an aircraft subject to the jurisdiction of the United States who intentionally fails to obey an order to land by an authorized Federal law enforcement officer who is enforcing U.S. controlled substances laws. Defines an aircraft \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" to include: (1) an aircraft in the airspace of a foreign nation, when that nation consents to U.S. law; and (2) over the high seas, an aircraft without nationality, of U.S. registry, or of foreign registry, when that nation has consented or waived objection to U.S. enforcement of U.S. law. Allows a foreign nation to consent or waive objection by radio, telephone, or similar oral or electronic means. Makes an aircraft used in violation of these provisions liable in rem for the fine imposed. Authorizes seizure and forfeiture of such an aircraft. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require the immediate revocation of the registration of aircraft nationality when the pilot or operator of the aircraft intentionally fails to obey such an order to land. Amends Federal law relating to the Coast Guard to authorize the Coast Guard to issue orders and make inquiries, searches, seizures, and arrests and take other lawful action relating to violations of U.S. laws on an aircraft over the high seas or waters of U.S. jurisdiction. Imposes civil fines on the master, operator, or person in charge of a vessel, or a pilot or operator of an aircraft, who intentionally fails to comply with certain Coast Guard officers to stop or land. Amends provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930 authorizing customs officers to board and search any vessel or vehicle at any authorized place to define \"authorized place\" to include: (1) with respect to a vehicle, a location in a foreign country at which U.S. customs officers are permitted to conduct inspections, examination, or searches; and (2) with respect to an aircraft, a location outside the United States, including a foreign country at which U.S. customs officers are permitted to conduct such actions. Imposes civil fines on the pilot or operator of an aircraft who intentionally fails to comply with a customs officer's order to land. Subtitle B: Territorial Sea - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to report to the Congress a list of all laws enforced by the Coast Guard in U.S. territorial seas whose application should be extended to 12 nautical miles in accordance with a specified Presidential Proclamation extending U.S. territorial seas to 12 nautical miles. Title III: Management and Administration - Amends Federal law relating to the Coast Guard to establish within the Coast Guard Reserve the Merchant Marine Reserve consisting of members of the Coast Guard Reserve with special knowledge or expertise regarding merchant marine affairs. Defines, for the subtitle of Federal shipping law relating to vessels and seamen, the term \"Secretary\" to mean the Secretary of Transportation. (Current law covering those provisions defines that term to mean the head of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, which (under other provisions) is the Department of Transportation, except when the coast Guard is operating as a service of the Navy.) Amends Federal law to substitute references to a documented vessel with a Great Lakes endorsement for references to a vessel enrolled or licensed to engage in the foreign and coasting trade on the northern, northeastern, and northwestern frontiers of the United States in provisions relating to: (1) the exemption of certain merchandise used as \"sea stores\" from payment of duty; (2) the exemption of certain vessels from customs entry and clearance fees; (3) the exemption of certain towing vessels (tugs) from a requirement to make entry at the customhouse; (4) a requirement that the master of certain vessels file, upon arrival from a foreign contiguous territory, a list of supplies or merchandise purchased in the foreign country for use or sale on the vessel and a statement of the cost of all repairs to and all equipment taken on board; and (5) the exemption of certain vessels from payment of a tonnage tax. Title IV: Recreational Boating Safety - Extends to September 30, 1996, the termination date of the National Boating Safety Advisory Council."
