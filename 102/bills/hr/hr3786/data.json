Requires the Secretary of Labor to identify foreign countries that: (1) have not adopted, or enforced, prohibitions against the use of child labor in the manufacture of products; and (2) have exported products of child labor to the United States. Authorizes any person to file a petition with the Secretary requesting that a particular country be identified. Requires the Secretary, before making such identification, to: (1) consult with the U.S. Trade Representative, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of the Treasury; and (2) publish notice in the Federal Register that such identification is being considered and invite public comment. Directs the Secretary of Labor to transmit to the Congress a report with respect to the national laws and practices of foreign countries pertaining to the commercial exploitation of children. Prohibits the importation of products which have been produced by child labor. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties."
