Limits aggregate contributions received and expenditures made by an eligible House of Representatives candidate in an election cycle to $600,000 with specified additional limitations in general, special, and runoff elections. Exempts from such expenditure limitations certain costs and taxes, including: (1) fundraising costs that do not exceed five percent of the limitations; and (2) five percent of the candidate's campaign office salaries and overhead expenses.
