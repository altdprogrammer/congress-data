    "date": "1991-11-27", 
    "text": "Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty Implementation Act of 1991 - Amends the Arms Export Control Act to authorize the President to transfer to any NATO country that is a party to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (NATO/CFE country) defense articles that: (1) are battle tanks, armored combat vehicles, or artillery included within the Treaty's definition of conventional armaments and equipment limited by the Treaty; (2) were, as of the date of signature of the Treaty, in the stocks of the Department of Defense and located in the Treaty's area of application; and (3) the President determines are not needed by U.S. military forces within such area. Permits the United States to accept such countries' assistance in eliminating direct costs of such transfers and in meeting obligations for destruction of conventional armaments and equipment limited by the Treaty. Authorizes the transfers of such articles without cost to the recipient country. Applies certain restrictions concerning third party transfers and security to transfers of such articles. Requires the President to ensure that such transfers, along with transfers by other NATO/CFE countries in implementing the Treaty, are consistent with the U.S. policy of maintaining the military balance in the Eastern Mediterranean. Terminates the President's authority under this Act at the end of the 40-month period beginning on the date the Treaty enters into force. Directs the President to notify the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee prior to making such transfers. Requires the President to report to specified congressional committees on: (1) all transfers made under this Act; (2) how such transfers further the purposes of this Act; and (3) all transfers made to another country of conventional armaments and equipment limited by the Treaty by each NATO/CFE country and Warsaw Pact country in implementing the Treaty. Title II: Soviet Weapons Destruction - Part A: Short Title - Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991. Part B: Findings and Program Authority - Prohibits U.S. assistance to the Soviet Union, any of its republics, or any successor entity in destroying nuclear and other weapons under this title, unless the President certifies to the Congress that the proposed recipient is committed to: (1) making a substantial investment of its resources for dismantling or destroying such weapons; (2) forgoing military modernization that exceeds legitimate defense requirements and forgoing the replacement of destroyed weapons of mass destruction; (3) forgoing use of fissionable and other components of destroyed nuclear weapons in new nuclear weapons; (4) facilitating U.S. verification of weapons destruction; (5) complying with relevant arms control agreements; and (6) observing internationally recognized human rights, including the protection of minorities. Authorizes the President to establish a program to assist Soviet weapons destruction. Part C: Administrative and Funding Authorities - Provides for the transfer of amounts among Department of Defense accounts for the administration of Soviet nuclear threat reduction programs. Requires assistance provided under Part B to be conditioned upon the agreement of the recipient government to reimburse the United States, to the appropriate extent, for the cost of such assistance from natural resources or other materials. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the committee of conference on House Joint Resolution 157 (Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations and Transfers for Relief from the Effect of Natural Disasters, for Other Urgent Needs, and for Incremental Costs of \"Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm\" Act of 1992) should consider providing the necessary authority for the President to transfer funds pursuant to this title. Part D: Reporting Requirements - Requires the President to report to the Congress on proposed obligations under part B and to make quarterly reports to the Congress on activities under part B to reduce the Soviet military threat. Title III: Emergency Airlift and Other Support - Authorizes the transfer of certain Department of Defense funds to provide during FY 1992 emergency airlift of humanitarian assistance to the Soviet Union, its republics, or any successor entity, should the need arise. Designates such transferred funds as emergency requirements for purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act). Establishes repayment arrangements similar to those required under Part B, Title II. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the committee of conference on House Joint Resolution 157 should consider providing the necessary authority for the President to transfers funds pursuant to this title. Requires the President to notify specified congressional committees of planned transfers of funds under this title and to report to specified congressional committees after making such transfers. Title IV: Arms Control and Disarmament Act - Amends the Arms Control and Disarmament Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1992 and 1993. Authorizes the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency to administer oaths and take sworn statements in investigations. Requires the Inspector General of the Agency to report to the President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on the Agency's fulfillment of its primary functions. Requires the President to comment on recommendations contained in such report. Directs the On-Site Inspection Agency to monitor nuclear tests pursuant to the Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty, and such additional arms control agreements as the President may direct. Requires the President to include in the request for authorization of appropriations for the On-Site Inspection Agency a report to specified congressional committees on a review of the Agency's operations. Requires certain committees to review proposed transfers, reprogramming, or reallocation of funds from or within the budget of such Agency."
