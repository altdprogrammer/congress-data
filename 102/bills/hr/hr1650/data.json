    "text": "Private Property Rights Act of 1991 - Provides that no regulation promulgated by an executive agency shall become effective until the Attorney General certifies that the agency is in compliance with the Executive Order 12630 or similar procedures to assess the potential for the taking of private property in the course of Federal regulatory activity, with the goal of minimizing such where possible. Limits judicial review of actions under this Act to whether such certification has occurred. Permits such review only in the same forum and at the same time as the pertinent regulation is subject to review."
