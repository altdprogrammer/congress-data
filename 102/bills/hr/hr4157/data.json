    "text": "Title I: National Development Investment - Public Works and Economic Development Act Amendments of 1992 - Amends the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to make grants to eligible States, local governments, economic development districts or organizations, or Indian tribes for: (1) construction and repair of public facilities; (2) establishment of revolving loan funds to promote small business; (3) establishment of employee stock ownership plans; and (4) provision of technical assistance for improving and enhancing economic development. Outlines eligibility requirements. Requires an application for a grant under this Act to include: (1) a certification that the area concerned meets certain distress requirements; (2) a certification of any responsibilities which the Secretary has agreed to perform; and (3) a development investment strategy prepared in accordance with this Act. Requires the Secretary to consider specified purposes of this Act in approving applications. Lists as criteria any one of which an area must meet in order to be eligible for a grant under this Act: (1) a per capita income of 80 percent or less of the national average; (2) an unemployment rate one percent above the national average for the most recent 24-month period for which statistics are available; or (3) a sudden economic dislocation resulting in job losses. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to establish a revolving loan fund for making or guaranteeing loans to small businesses for initial or working capital, or for the purchase of facilities or equipment. Limits to $1,000,000 the amount of any such grant. Limits the amount of any grant under this Act to a maximum of 50 percent of the cost of completing the project as determined at the time of the grant application. Allows such grant percentage to increase up to 80 percent in cases of extreme economic distress as determined by the Secretary for up to 25 percent of the total grants made in a fiscal year. Outlines guidelines for the determination of extreme economic distress. Permits the Secretary to reduce or waive the non-Federal share of a project in the case of an Indian tribe. Limits expenditures in any one State to a maximum of 15 percent of the appropriations made pursuant to this Act, except for expenditures to Indian tribes. Limits the amount the Secretary may obligate in any fiscal year to any person, other than grants for the establishment of qualified employee ownership organizations. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants, with specified fiscal year limitations, to community development corporations to assist small businesses by reducing the interest rates for economic development activities to be carried out in areas meeting the distress requirements under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1995 for economic development assistance grants under this title. Authorizes the Secretary to make economic development planning grants to States, economic development districts, Indian tribes, distressed counties, and distressed local governments. Requires such planning to be part of a comprehensive, continuous process involving public officials and private citizens in analyzing local economies, defining development goals, determining project opportunities, and formulating and implementing a development program. Earmarks such grants for coordination of investment for community facilities, economic development, manpower training, and transportation services. Authorizes the Secretary to evaluate Federal, State, and local development investment efforts. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct demonstration programs to test the feasibility of new ways to increase productivity and growth, foster innovative technology, match labor force with labor markets, improve U.S. competitiveness, and encourage economic diversity and regional balance. Requires reports on such demonstration programs. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to colleges, universities, and other organizations for promoting productivity, economic development, and employment opportunities. Limits the amount of any economic development planning grant to 75 percent of the cost of such planning or of the preparation of a development investment strategy. Limits the grants to educational institutions in the same manner. Authorizes the Secretary to reduce or waive any non-Federal share of such grants in the case of Indian tribes. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1995 for such grants. Prohibits the approval of any grant unless the Secretary is satisfied that the project concerned will be properly and efficiently administered, operated, and maintained. Permits the Secretary to discharge responsibilities relative to a project by accepting a certification of the grant applicant's performance of such responsibilities. Requires the Secretary to make comprehensive annual reports to the Congress detailing operations under this Act. Requires all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on projects assisted under this Act to be paid the prevailing rate of wages. Requires the Secretary to maintain and make available for public inspection records of approved applications. Requires each recipient of a grant to maintain specified records. Allows the Secretary and the Comptroller General access to all records of such recipients. Provides nondiscrimination requirements in the approval of grant applications. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1995 for salaries and other administrative expenses in carrying out this Act and for special economic development and adjustment assistance. Amends the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to rename such Act as the National Development Investment Act. Title II: Appalachian Regional Development - Appalachian Regional Development Act Amendments of 1992 - Amends the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 to declare that investments under such Act shall also be made in severely distressed and underdeveloped counties and areas lacking resources for basic services. States as a new purpose of such Act to make the Appalachian region's industrial and commercial resources more competitive in national and world markets. Outlines general actions to be taken to achieve such purpose. Extends through FY 1995 the authorization of appropriations under such Act for administrative expenses of the Appalachian Regional Commission. Authorizes the Commission to lease office space through FY 1995. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1995 for the Appalachian development highway system. Increases from 70 to 80 percent the Federal share of the costs of an Appalachian development highway segment the Secretary is authorized to pay upon the application of a participating State that has proceeded to construct such segment without the aid of Federal funds. Applies such increase to projects approved after March 31, 1979. Directs the Commission, in considering programs and projects to be given assistance, to include programs and projects proposed in a severely distressed and underdeveloped county or an area lacking resources for basic services. Removes a provision of such Act which prohibited financial assistance to finance the cost of industrial plants and related industrial facilities or to enable plant subcontractors to undertake work previously performed in another area by other contractors or subcontractors. Prohibits grants with funds authorized after September 30, 1992, from exceeding 50 percent of the cost of any approved project, with an exception for up to 80 percent for a county which the Commission determines is one of the most distressed counties in the Appalachian region. Limits the number of grants that may be increased to 80 percent. Adds specified purposes relating to technical assistance, training programs, and demonstrations for which the President is authorized to make grants to the Commission to further the purposes of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965. Allows for demonstrations with regard to economic resources under such grants. Authorizes additional appropriations under such Act for general programs for FY 1993 through 1995. Extends provisions of such Act (previously terminated in 1982) through FY 1995. Authorizes the Commission, if it determines that it is in the public interest, to award to a domestic firm a contract made pursuant to a grant issued under this Act that, under competitive procedures, would be awarded to a foreign firm, if: (1) the final product of the domestic firm will be completely assembled in the United States; (2) when completely assembled, not less than 51 percent of the final product of the domestic firm will be domestically produced; and (3) the difference between bids submitted by the foreign and domestic firms is not more than six percent. Provides certain limitations to such Buy-American requirement. Requires the Commission to report to the Congress on contracts covered and awarded to foreign and domestic firms under the above provision."
