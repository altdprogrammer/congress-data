Names West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Indiana, and Illinois as affected States as of enactment of this Act. Requires affected States to establish State agencies or instrumentalities (\"State Boards\") to promulgate regulations for the expeditious and economical development of coalbed methane gas deposits. Prescribes coalbed gas development and drilling guidelines. Proscribes the drilling of any well for coalbed methane gas production without State Board approval."
