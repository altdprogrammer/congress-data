Requires the Secretary to use competitive bidding procedures in such leasing. Conditions the lease of such lands upon payment of a minimum royalty rate of at least 20 percent in amount or value of the production removed or sold from the lease. Directs the Secretary to reject any bid for a lease if the Secretary determines that the proposed royalty would be less than fair market value. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) require all or any portion of the royalty to be paid in the form of petroleum produced under the lease; and (2) provide such petroleum to the Department of Defense at the request of the Secretary of Defense. Permits the lease of such Federal lands to include the transfer of wells, gathering lines, and related Federal equipment if the lessee assumes responsibility for maintenance, repair, or environmental restoration. Declares that certain statutory consultation and approval requirements do not apply to this lease."
