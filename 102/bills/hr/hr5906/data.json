Declares that nothing contained in this Act is intended to curtail the display, sale, or distribution of newspapers, magazines, theater programs, and similar printed material under the terms of a properly executed concessions permit, contract, or a cooperating association agreement. Authorizes appropriate and limited public acknowledgement of a donor or sponsor's contribution to a specific program, activity, or event in a National Park area on a case-by-case basis to such individual only if the program, activity, or event furthers the purpose of the park area and the recognition is determined to be appropriate. Prohibits the advertising, commercial notice, or acknowledgement from stating or implying National Park Service endorsement of a product, service, or facility. Permits organized activities or special events within a National Park area only pursuant to a permit. Authorizes permit issuance only if there is an appropriate association between such area and the activity or event and if the activity or special event does not: (1) harm the area's resources or values; (2) pose a risk of damage to any property or endanger public health or safety; (3) unduly interfere with normal park operations or visitor use; or (4) result in significant conflict with other uses."
