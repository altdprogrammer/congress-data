    "text": "Surface Transportation Research and Development Act of 1991 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to develop a national plan for surface transportation research and development. Requires the Secretary to initiate research and development programs in the areas of: (1) highway vehicle research; (2) automated highway and vehicle systems; (3) high speed rail systems; (4) magnetically levitated train systems; (5) lightweight, rubber-tired, battery-powered multiple-unit passenger transportation systems; and (6) advanced automotive technologies. Directs the Secretary to strengthen and expand surface transportation infrastructure research and development. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on the results of a study on the potential for increased recycling of automobile components in the United States and the steps needed to increase such recycling. Requires the Secretary to conduct a research and development program on the use of certain nonhazardous solid wastes in the construction of the surface transportation system. Directs the Secretary to establish an independent surface transportation research advisory committee. Limits expenditure on long-term research. Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to require the Secretary to convene a conference of domestic motor vehicle manufacturers, parts suppliers, Federal laboratories, and motor vehicle users to explore ways in which cooperatively they can improve the competitiveness of the United States motor vehicle industry by developing new technologies which will enhance the safety and energy savings, and lessen the environmental impact, of domestic motor vehicles. Establishes a National Award for the Advancement of Motor Vehicle Research and Development. Includes basic automotive science under the research and development authority of the Secretary. Requires DOT to stimulate technological advances in transportation through research and development. Prohibits the fraudulent labeling of products made in America and requires compliance with the Act commonly known as the Buy American Act. Authorizes appropriations."
