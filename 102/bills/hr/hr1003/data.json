States that nothing in this Act shall have the effect of reducing the pay of any individual whose compensation may not, under certain provisions of the U.S. Constitution, be diminished during such individual's continuance in office. Prohibits the pay of U.S. justices and judges from being increased to reflect any of the next five adjustments taking effect, beginning on or after the enactment of this Act. Amends the Federal Salary Act of 1967 to provide that recommendations of the President for pay adjustments for Members of Congress and other governmental officials shall be of an advisory nature only, and shall have no force or effect. Restores post-employment rules to individuals leaving government employment only if this Act becomes law before May 31, 1991."
