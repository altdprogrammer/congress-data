    "text": "Credit Card Mail Theft Protection Act - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to require the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) to issue regulations to discourage theft of credit cards from Postal Service facilities. Directs that such regulations: (1) require a card issuer that mails a credit card to, through, or from a location that is located in a high-risk area to mail the card in an inactive status and to not activate the card before the card holder contacts the card issuer to verify receipt of the credit card, or to comply with such other procedures for ensuring the receipt of credit cards by card holders as are authorized by the regulations; and (2) prescribe standards developed in consultation with the Postmaster General, for determining high-risk areas. Requires specified Federal agencies to prescribe regulations that are substantially similar to those prescribed by the Board. Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties for: (1) knowingly, and with intent to defraud, trafficking in or using an unauthorized access device tht is a credit card to obtain anything of value; (2) willfully or maliciously injuring, defacing, or destroying, in violation of provisions regarding fraud and related activity in connection with access devices, any mail containing a credit card; (3) the theft or receipt of a stolen credit card in the mail; and (4) the theft of a credit card by an officer or employee of the Postal Service. Directs the Board to: (1) conduct a study to determine the extent of theft of credit cards from Postal Service facilities; and (2) submit a report to the Congress describing the findings of that study and recommending any additional steps necessary to limit such theft."
