Restricts such exceptions to investments or credit extensions granted to a savings association's subsidiary as of April 12, 1989, and to subsequent investments and credit extensions granted to complete projects or investments initiated by the subsidiary before that date. Mandates that the Director require such savings associations to deduct at least 25 percent of the eligible amount from capital."
