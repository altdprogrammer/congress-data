Title II: Definitions - Sets forth the definitions of terms used in this Act. Title III: Disposal of Defense Articles - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to require the Secretary of Defense to: (1) evaluate inventories of heavy equipment and construction materials and ensure that those items which are not needed for an identifiable military mission will be classified as excess and disposed of; (2) declare as excess those inventory items which cost over a certain amount to store, maintain, and repair; (3) develop a cost-effective plan for returning excess items to the United States for disposal; (4) report to specified congressional committees on the status of, and disposal plans for, such inventory items; and (5) annually review and evaluate the utilization by recipients of excess nonlethal supplies and excess defense articles pursuant to programs administered by the Department of Defense in order to ensure that such items are being utilized accordingly. Requires the heads of Federal agencies overseeing Federal laboratories to evaluate their inventories of scientific equipment. Requires all such equipment not needed for current or anticipated Federal purposes to be disposed of. Requires appropriate reports to specified congressional committees. Directs the Administrator (Administrator) of the General Services Administration (GSA) to make available excess heavy equipment and construction materials to a Federal agency based on the agency's ability to use such items for official business. Prohibits Federal agencies receiving excess heavy equipment and construction materials from transferring such equipment to other Federal or non-Federal agencies or organizations. Requires excess heavy equipment and construction materials received by a Federal agency to be returned to GSA if the Administrator determines that the equipment is not being efficiently used or if the official business of the agency for which the equipment is being used has been completed. Excludes heavy equipment and construction materials from the definition of \"nonlethal excess supplies\" used under armed forces provisions, and from the definition of various terms used for excess property in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Title IV: Distribution Of Excess And Surplus Heavy Equipment And Construction Materials - Gives the Administrator authority over the disposal of all excess and surplus heavy equipment and construction materials. Requires such disposal to be done pursuant to this Act. Requires the Administrator to make all excess and surplus heavy equipment and construction materials available to the States after such items have been disposed of to Federal agencies. Requires the Administrator, after providing actual notice to the States of the availability of excess heavy equipment and construction materials, to deliver such items requested by the States on a fair and equitable basis according to public need and efficiency of utilization. Requires the Administrator to make the equipment and materials available without cost, except that if transportation is requested by the State, the Administrator may assess fees for transportation costs. States that for no less than 12 months after original delivery, the Administrator shall retain all right, title, and interest in heavy equipment and construction materials which have an acquisition cost greater than $10,000. Provides that if a State can show that the equipment or materials were well maintained and were efficiently used in the furtherance of public purposes and that the equipment can reasonably be expected to be maintained and used in the furtherance of public purposes, the Administrator shall transfer to the State all right, title, and interest in the equipment or materials. Requires States, within 12 months after regulations to implement this paragraph have been issued, to establish a program under which equipment and construction materials are allocated to eligible users in order to continue to be eligible to receive excess heavy equipment and construction materials. Allows such a program to be operated by the State or by State-Certified Equipment Centers. Requires the Administrator to offer grants for the establishment of such Centers. Sets forth provisions providing for disposals under specified conditions of urgency, such as when the President certifies that a foreign nation has dire need for particular pieces of heavy equipment and construction materials.

Authorizes appropriations for GSA grants to establish such Centers. Title V: State And Community Infrastructure And Economic Development - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to require the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (Secretary) to establish a computerized database and standardized forms which States shall use to develop infrastructure and economic development plans utilizing priority lists of anticipated needs submitted to the States by counties and other units of local government, and which also utilize State-Certified Equipment Centers and advanced planning techniques. Requires the Secretary to make grants to States that want to establish such a plan, with priority to States with high long-term unemployment rates and pressing infrastructure needs. Requires the Secretary to establish a national infrastructure and economic development strategy to help States implement their plans to encourage cooperation among the States, and to coordinate Federal infrastructure and economic development programs and resources. Requires the Secretary to update such strategy every two years and to transmit a document containing such strategy to specified congressional committees.
