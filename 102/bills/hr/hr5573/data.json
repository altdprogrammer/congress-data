    "text": "Full-Service Schools Act - Establishes the Federal Interagency Work Group (the Group) to: (1) facilitate collaboration between agencies and mobilize Federal policy to achieve systemic reform to meet the comprehensive needs of at-risk children and their families for education, health, and social and human services; and (2) provide grants to States and local entities to develop similar programs at the State and local levels. Provides that the Group shall be composed of the Secretaries of Education, Health and Human Services, and Labor, and funded equally by their departments. Directs the Secretary of Education to act as the fiscal agent for the Group. Requires the Group to: (1) assist Federal, State, and local agencies to develop, implement, and evaluate service integration programs under this Act; (2) coordinate agency resources and funding to allow for consolidation of Federal categorical programs, when waiver requests are made; (3) establish and maintain a national data base that includes Federal, State, local, and private collaborative efforts to serve at-risk children; (4) make grants to States for interagency work groups and local efforts to integrate services for at-risk youth and their families; (5) determine grant amounts by considering the number of local project sites the State group can target with limited allocations to each site; and (6) waive certain Federal requirements that impede collaborative efforts, if such waivers will result in more efficient use of resources. Requires States, for grant elibility, to: (1) establish a State interagency work group (with at least the State public education and health and human services departments); (2) develop training to assist staff members to understand communities and the full array of available resources to help at-risk children and families; (3) require equal contributions by departments in the State group; (4) set as a goal the integration of existing funding sources from the departments represented; (5) designate a fiscal agent; and (6) assist local entities in developing local interagency agreements. Requires local entities, for grant eligibility, to: (1) develop a community planning process including specified parties; (2) develop mandatory services recommended by the planning group; (3) establish a local interagency work group (if located in a city of 10,000 or more); (4) require equal contributions of the local educational agency and represented entities; (5) assure a reasonable effort to initiate structural reform; and (6) designate a fiscal agent. Sets forth application requirements and grant limitations. Requires local programs to include activities to improve educational performance by: (1) reducing school dropout and teen pregnancy rates and the number of children in unsupervised settings; (2) increasing adult/family literacy and the number of students returning to school after dropping out; and (3) improving access to primary health care for families and their children. Allows local programs to develop a variety of programs to serve the comprehensive needs of students, including specified optional activities. Sets forth requirements for annual local reports, a State report after the second calendar year of funding, and a Federal report within three years after enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
