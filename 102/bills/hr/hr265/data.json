Declares that the authority of the Secretary of Commerce under specified provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and the Secretary of Transportation under specified provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 shall not apply to vessels deemed surplus under this Act. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to retain 15 of such surplus vessels for use for offshore artificial reefs under specified provisions of Federal law."
