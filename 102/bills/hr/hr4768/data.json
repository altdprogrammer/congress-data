    "text": "Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Airport Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992 - Amends the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 to revise the requirement that an airport development project ensure that at least ten percent of certain concessions (sales of food, beverages, printed material, or other consumer products) at the airport go to small business owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Changes the set-aside from ten percent of all such concessions to ten percent of the aggregate of all revenues generated by such concessions, including, furthermore, all businesses which provide ground transportation, baggage carts, automobile rentals, parking, or other consumer services. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to allow an airport operator or owner to meet the ten percent goal by including businesses operated through management contracts or by including the purchase of goods or services used in a business conducted on the airport if it would not be practicable for the operator or owner to comply with such goal by approved business arrangements. Permits the Secretary, by regulation, to allow such inclusions on an airport by airport basis. Revises the definition of an eligible \"disadvantaged business enterprise\" to raise the maximum average annual gross receipts permissible from $14,000,000 to $16,015,000."
