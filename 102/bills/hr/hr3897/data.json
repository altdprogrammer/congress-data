    "text": "Western Shoshone Claims Disbursement Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a judgment roll to apportion and distribute certain funds awarded to Western Shoshone Indians of Nevada on a per capita basis among a distributee, members of certain tribes, and their descendants. Sets forth procedures to establish the judgment roll and to distribute such funds. Exempts such funds from Federal, State, or local income tax. Prohibits: (1) the funds from being considered as income or resources used as the basis for denying or reducing the financial assistance or benefits to any person or household participating in any Federal, State, or local program; (2) discrimination by a tribe or band against any distributee who participates in the distribution of the funds by denying such person or relative of such person any benefits or opportunity available from such tribe or band to other persons who do not participate; and (3) the receipt of such funds as construing a waiver of any existing treaty or State compact rights or as a sale of ancestral lands. Declares that such funds are compensation for past damages. Prohibits executive order reservations set aside for the Western Shoshone Indians from being diminished by this Act and confirms them effective with their respective dates."
