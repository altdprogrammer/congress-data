    "text": "Victims Justice Act of 1991 - Repeals: (1) the current $150,000,000 cap on the Crime Victims Fund under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984; and (2) sunset provisions under such Act. Modifies the formula for the distribution of sums deposited into the Fund to provide that: (1) seven percent of the total funds deposited in a fiscal year shall be available for child abuse prevention and treatment grants; (2) four percent shall be available for training and technical services to victim assistance programs and for financial support of services to crime victims by victim assistance programs; and (3) 89 percent shall be available for crime victim compensation and victim assistance programs. (Current law provides a complex formula for the distribution of funds depending on the amount deposited in the Fund.) Authorizes the Director of the Office for Victims of Crime to retain any amount in excess of 110 percent of the total deposited in the previous fiscal year as a reserve for those years in which there is a shortfall in the Fund, provided that the reserve not exceed $20,000,000. Provides that the first $6,200,000 above $150,000,000 deposited in the Fund through FY 1995, and the first $3,000,000 for each fiscal year thereafter, shall be available to the judicial branch for administrative costs. Increases the Federal share of victim compensation programs from 40 to 45 percent of the amounts awarded by each program during the preceding fiscal year. Allows up to five percent of a victim compensation program grant to be used for administrative costs. Specifies that if the compensation paid by an eligible crime victim compensation program would cover costs that a Federal program, or a federally financed State or local program, would otherwise pay: (1) such victim compensation program shall not pay such compensation; and (2) the other program shall make its payments without regard to the existence of the crime victim compensation program. Authorizes the Director to use unspent compensation funds for assistance programs in either the year such funds are not spent or in the following year. Requires crime victim assistance chief executives to give particular attention to children who are victims of violent street crime. Authorizes the use of grants under this Act for demonstration projects. Allows up to five percent of a victim assistance program grant to be used for administrative costs. Makes biannual reports under such Act due on May 31 (currently, such reports are due December 31). Requires grantees to certify that no grant funds will be used to supplant State and local funds, but rather will supplement those otherwise available funds."
