Requires the Center also to provide Spanish language training programs to State and local workers and volunteers who provide important services to the Spanish-speaking community. Requires the Center to be located in one of the boroughs of the City of New York in a community where U.S. census data reveals a high concentration of Spanish-speaking residents. Sets minimum funding requirements and a deadline for operations to begin at such facility. Requires the Center to make maximum efforts to provide employment opportunities for residents of the surrounding community. Requires Center employees, to the extent practicable, to be residents in or near the community where the Center is located. Requires the Center to try to provide community outreach and education programs. Requires the President to submit a report to the Congress evaluating the Center."
