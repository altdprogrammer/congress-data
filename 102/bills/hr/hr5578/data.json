Limits the aggregate number of Japanese motor vehicles imported into the United States in each year from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1999, to no more than 1,900,000, adjustable downwards according to a specified formula. Requires the Secretary to publish such estimates, computations, and calculations in the Federal Register."
