    "text": "Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal judicial code to reauthorize the independent counsel law for an additional five years. Directs: (1) the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to provide administrative support and guidance to each independent counsel; and (2) the General Services Administration to provide office space within a Federal building for each independent counsel. Requires an independent counsel to: (1) conduct all activities with due regard for expense, authorize only reasonable expenditures, and (promptly upon taking office) assign to a specific employee the duty to ensure expenditures are made in accordance with such principles; and (2) comply with the established policies of the Department of Justice regarding expenditures of funds to conduct investigations and prosecutions, except where such compliance would violate the purposes of the Act. Authorizes the Attorney General to conduct a preliminary investigation upon the receipt of information sufficient to constitute grounds to investigate whether a Member of Congress may have violated any Federal criminal law, other than a violation classified as a Class B or C misdemeanor or an infraction."
