Provides that leases executed under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act that cover an area within the newly expanded territorial sea boundaries shall remain in effect until they expire under their original terms. Precludes a State affected by the expanded territorial sea boundaries from granting a lease within such boundaries until the Secretary of Commerce determines that such State has an approved coastal zone management program in accordance with the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972."
