Amends the Federal judicial code to declare that State authorities shall enforce any child support order according to its terms and shall not modify it, except in certain circumstances, if such order is made consistent with this Act by a court of another State. Confers continuing, exclusive jurisdiction upon the court of a State which has made a child support order consistent with the provisions of this Act, and which is either the child's State, or the State of one of the contestants. Grants a State court authority to modify a child support order made by the court of another State if: (1) it has jurisdiction to make such an order; and (2) the court of the other State no longer has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction because it is no longer the child's State or the residence of any contestant, or each contestant has filed written consent for the State to modify the order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of such order. Grants the court of a State which no longer has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of a child support order authority to enforce it with respect to unsatisfied obligations which accrued before the date on which a modification was made by another State in accordance with this Act."
