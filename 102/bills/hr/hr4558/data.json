    "text": "Infrastructure Investment Accounting Act of 1992 - Amends Federal law to require the annual budget submitted by the President to be a unified budget which includes an infrastructure investment account. Requires such budget to present prior, current, and future proposed amounts and contain: (1) unified budget financing requirements; and (2) for the infrastructure investment account physical infrastructure revenues, physical infrastructure investments, physical infrastructure financing requirements before interfund transfers, interfund transfers, and physical infrastructure financing requirements. Requires the President, in addition to the unified budget, to present such information for accounts, agencies, and functions. States that the infrastructure investment account includes only the major activities, projects, and programs which support the acquistition, construction, alteration, and rehabilitation of physical infrastructure. Requires all other activities, projects, and programs to be represented elsewhere in the unified budget. Defines a unified budget as one in which revenues and expenses for general funds, trust funds, and enterprise funds are consolidated to display totals for the Federal Government as a whole, including operating expenses. Requires the Comptroller General, as necessary, to review and report to the Congress on the implementation of this Act."
