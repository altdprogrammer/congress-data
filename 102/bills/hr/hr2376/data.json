    "text": "Provides that if the husband and wife of a minor child (under age 13) are both members of the armed forces and are both assigned to duty subjecting such members to hostile fire or imminent danger, then the Secretary of Defense shall, at the request of such members, relieve one of the members from performing such duty. Sets forth the same requirement with respect to a member who is a single parent of a minor child. Directs the Secretary to reassign members so relieved to duty that does not require the separation of the member from the minor child. Authorizes the Secretary to delay the discharge or retirement date of a member so relieved."
