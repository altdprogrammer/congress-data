Directs the Board to be guided by principles expressed in the Fair Campaign Practices Arbitration Rules and the Code of Fair Campaign Practices when formulating its fair campaign practices code. Permits the Board to accept fees for its services and donations from supporters (including candidates and political parties). Declares that the Board shall maintain tax exempt status notwithstanding its activities with respect to dispute resolution, arbitration and fair campaign practices code promulgation, and lobbying."
