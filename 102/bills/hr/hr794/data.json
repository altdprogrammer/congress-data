Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to designate refuge boundaries within the lands and waters of the Connecticut River basin. Authorizes the Secretary, to the extent authorized under existing laws, to acquire lands and waters for inclusion in the refuge. Establishes the Silvio Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge when sufficient property has been acquired that can be effectively managed as a refuge. Directs the Secretary to work with, provide technical assistance to, provide community outreach and education programs for or with, or enter into cooperative agreements with private and public entities to further the purposes of the refuge. Establishes the Silvio Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge Advisory Committee. Authorizes the Secretary to construct, administer, and maintain: (1) at an appropriate site within the refuge up to four Silvio Conte National Fish and Wildlife Education Centers; or (2) enter into cooperative agreements to share the construction and operation of and the land acquisition for the center at an appropriate site, using appropriated or donated funds. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Authorizes an agreement between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and the University of Massachusetts/Amherst to establish the Silvio O. Conte Memorial Scholarship Fund to encourage students to enter the fields of fisheries and wildlife ecology and conservation, natural resources policy and administration, or ecology. Authorizes the Director of the Service to make a one-time contribution of up to a specified amount to the University to establish the Fund. Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Operations Indemnification Clarification Act of 1988 to authorize the construction, administration, and maintenance at an appropriate site of a wildlife interpretation and education or visitor center. Authorizes agreements to share the costs of those activities, using appropriated or donated funds. Title III: Culebra National Wildlife Refuge - Allows the headquarters facility and residences for the Culebra National Wildlife Refuge to be constructed on lands leased from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico on a long-term basis. Amends the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act to allow an increased Federal share of cost-sharing for coastal wetlands conservation projects for States which have: (1) a trust fund from which the principal is not spent; or (2) a fund derived from a dedicated recurring source. (Current law allows an increased Federal share for States which have a trust fund from which the principal is not spent.)"
