    "text": "Overseas American Economic Competition Enhancement Act of 1991 - Amends Internal Revenue Code provisions relating to the taxable income of certain U.S. citizens or residents living abroad. Excludes from the gross income of qualifying individuals (thus exempting from income tax), in addition to foreign earned income, the following items: (1) U.S. earned income and certain capital gain net income during the period of a temporary stay or stays (not exceeding a total of 183 days) in the United States; (2) foreign income other than compensation for labor or personal services; (3) U.S. income not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business; and (4) gain from the disposition of a U.S. real property interest. Revises the criteria under which an individual qualifies for these tax exclusions to make eligible a U.S. citizen or resident who, during any 18-month period (currently 12 months), is present in a foreign country or countries during at least 510 full days (currently 330)."
