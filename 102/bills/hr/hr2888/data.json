Bars construction on the project until such a report is issued and approved by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to require an updated dynamic analysis of such reservoir using state-of-the-art procedures for determination of the need for the construction of an upstream toe berm to ensure reservoir embankment stability. Specifies that all costs of such analysis and any modification of such reservoir for acceptable stability in conformance with the analysis shall be paid by the Federal Government. Authorizes the Secretary, to enter into an agreement with a local contractor for the removal of rock and aggregate from such reservoir to eliminate the loss of minimum silt and recreation pool storage space through silt intrusion. Authorizes appropriations."
