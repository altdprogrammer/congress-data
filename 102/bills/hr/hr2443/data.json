    "text": "Privacy Act Amendments of 1991 - Amends the Privacy Act of 1974 to revise the definition of: (1) \"individual\" to include living individuals of all nationalities; (2) \"record\" to subject personal information to the Act independent of the medium on which it is maintained and regardless of physical form or characteristics; (3) \"system of records\" to include record groups maintained on an electronic data processing system; and (4) \"routine use\" to mean the use of a record for a purpose which is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. Prohibits agencies from modifying the conditions of disclosure for a routine use of a record to authorize other disclosures not expressly authorized under the Act. Enables an individual to secure his or her records maintained in electronic files in any appropriate format which the agency can provide. Requires agencies to provide individuals requesting information under the Act with any information to which they are also entitled under the Freedom of Information Act. Requires employee training to facilitate access to records. Requires notices published in the Federal Register which describe agency record systems to include the purpose for which the system is established. Provides for an administrative appeal when a request for access to, or correction of, a record is denied. Provides for injunctive relief under the Privacy Act of 1974. Requires that agencies provide for regular compliance audits for systems of records maintained by contractors. Requires advance congressional notification of proposed changes in a routine use of agency records which are significant. Requires an Office of Management and Budget review of and report to the Congress on the consistency of routine uses with the law and published guidelines for all systems of agency records established under the Privacy Act of 1974."
