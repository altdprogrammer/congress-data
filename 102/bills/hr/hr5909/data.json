Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to solicit bids annually for a cost-containment contract to be entered into by infant formula manufacturers and those State agencies that elect to have the Secretary perform the bid solicitation and selection process on their behalf. Prescribes guidelines for the solicitation and selection process. Sets a deadline for the Secretary to report to the Congress on the decisions made by State agencies and the Secretary regarding bid solicitations, including any recommendations to increase competition by encouraging the participation of additional infant formula manufacturers. Prescribes guidelines for the Secretary to follow in order to reduce the costs of any supplemental foods. Directs the Secretary to allocate to each State agency for specified fiscal years an amount for costs of nutrition services and administration on the basis of a formula which shall be designated to provide funds to help defray reasonable anticipated expenses associated with specified aspects of joint purchasing of infant formula by two or more State agencies and cost containment efforts."
