Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) (the Director) to carry out such program under which such colleges, using program grants and matching non-Federal funds will provide education in technology fields. Requires the Director to: (1) award such program grants on a competitive basis; and (2) establish and maintain, at NSF or by contract, a readily accessible inventory of technology education programs which are serving public and private employers and addressing the changing work force demands of technology. Requires each college awarded such a grant to provide an associate degree education program in designated technology fields in accordance with this Act. Limits individual grants amounts. Requires the Director to appoint a National Advisory Council on Technology Education, which is to advise on and review the program and to report annually to the Director and the Congress. Requires the Director and the Council to report annually on the program to the NSF and the Congress (directly, without review by NSF or the Office of Management and Budget). Requires such program to be coordinated with programs and policies of the Departments of Commerce, Labor, Education, and Defense, and other relevant Federal agencies. Sets forth special emphases for such program, and required uses of program funds. Authorizes appropriations."
