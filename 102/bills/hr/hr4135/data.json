Makes imported property and property used in mining extraction and timber harvesting ineligible for such credit. Allows such credit for qualified failed thrift property acquired from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). Denies such credit to any officer, director, substantial shareholder, or owner of depository institutions acquired by the FDIC or the RTC. Requires a portion of the gain on the resale, exchange, or other disposition of such property to be paid to the FDIC or the RTC."
