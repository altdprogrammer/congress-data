Requires the United States Trade Representative to: (1) reform articles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to reflect the national environmental laws of contracting parties and international treaties, conventions and other agreements; (2) secure a working party on trade and the environment within the GATT which would include United Nations agencies with environmental expertise such as the United Nations Environmental Program and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development; and (3) take an active role in developing trade policies that make GATT more responsive to environmental concerns."
