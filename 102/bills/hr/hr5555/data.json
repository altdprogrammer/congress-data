    "text": "Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to direct the Attorney General to establish preinspection stations within two years of enactment of this Act in at least three of the ten foreign airports identified as last departure points for the greatest numbers of passengers arriving at U.S. entry ports. (Such preinspection stations shall be in addition to any stations established before enactment of this Act.) Directs the Attorney General to maintain records (including records of foreign airport of departure) of aliens arriving by air at U.S. ports of entry without valid documentation. Directs the Attorney General to establish three inspection stations by November 1, 1996, at foreign airports for the purpose of achieving maximum prevention of illegal immigration into the United States. (Such preinspection stations shall be in addition to those required to be established by this Act within two years of enactment, or those established before its enactment.) Directs the Attorney General to assign additional immigration officers to foreign airports without preinspection stations when significant numbers of aliens without valid documentation depart for the United States. Sets forth conditions to be met before a preinspection station may be established in a foreign country, including: (1) diplomatic protection for U.S. employees and their families; (2) facility compliance with Federal Inspection Services standards; (3) the country's maintenance of adequate refugee and asylum procedures; and (4) a prohibition against establishing a station in a country from which a resident has been granted refugee or asylum status in the United States during the previous three years. Revises the pilot visa waiver program to: (1) make it permanent; (2) repeal certain paperwork requirements; (3) subject participants to exclusion or deportation without appeal (except for an asylum claim); and (4) require carriers to distribute program information to passengers. Authorizes arriving vessels or aircraft to submit electronic passenger manifests to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Limits such information to passenger name, date of birth, citizenship, passport number, and flight identification. States that nothing in such Act shall be construed as requiring a personal interview of arriving passengers. Requires immigration inspections to be conducted within 30 minutes (currently 45 minutes) of arrival. Directs the Attorney General to establish an expedited inspection process for U.S. citizens returning by air from abroad. Repeals the January 1, 1993, deadline for retired international organization officials and employees and spouses (G-4 visa) to apply for special immigrant status."
