    "date": "1992-10-02", 
    "text": "Amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (the Act) to: (1) make findings, including that the incidence of juvenile delinquency can be reduced through public recreation programs and activities designed to provide youth with social skills, enhance self esteem, and encourage the constructive use of discretionary time; and (2) include among the purposes of the Act the encouragement of parental involvement in treatment and alternative disposition programs, and the coordination of services between State, local, and community-based agencies, and the promotion of interagency cooperation in providing such services. Provides that the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) shall have the same reporting relationship with the Attorney General as the directors of other offices and bureaus within the Office of Justice Programs. Revises provisions regarding the rates of compensation for special personnel, experts, and consultants. Directs the Administrator to: (1) develop objectives, priorities, and a long-term plan, and implement overall policy and a strategy to carry out such plan (currently, implement overall policy and develop objectives and priorities) for Federal juvenile delinquency programs and activities; (2) review the plan annually, revise it as the Administrator deems appropriate, and publish the plan in the Federal Register according to a specified timetable; and (3) issue model standards, within a year, for providing health care to incarcerated juveniles. Requires that such plan contain specific goals and criteria for making grants and contracts, conducting research, and carrying out other activities, and provide for coordinating the administration of programs and activities, including proposals for joint funding to be coordinated by the Administrator. Repeals provisions authorizing the Administrator to: (1) transfer funds appropriated for Federal juvenile delinquency programs and activities to other Federal agencies under specified circumstances; and (2) make grants and contracts to other agencies, institutions, and individuals. Revises provisions regarding the composition of the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to: (1) repeal the requirement that specified individuals, including the Director of the Office of Community Services, be on the Council; and (2) include the Administrator of OJJDP, the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, such other officers of Federal agencies who hold significant decisionmaking authority as the President may designate, and individuals appointed to the Council from among nine appointees (practitioners in the juvenile justice field who are not Federal officers or employees). Directs such appointees, in addition to performing their functions as members of the Council, to collectively: (1) make recommendations regarding the development of the objectives, priorities, and long-term plan, and implementation of overall policy and strategy to carry out such plan; and (2) report such recommendations to the Administrator and to the chairmen of specified congressional committees. Requires the Administrator to include in his annual report a detailed summary and analysis addressing the educational status of juveniles, including information relating to learning disabilities, failing performance, grade retention, and dropping out of school. Raises the allocation formula limits with respect to Federal assistance for State and local programs concerning juvenile delinquency and programs to improve the juvenile justice system, subject to certain requirements. Makes a portion of a State's allotment available for one full-time staff position. Limits the amount available for State plan development and other preaward activities associated with such State plan and for administration to ten (currently, seven and a half) percent of the total annual allotment of a State. Requires States to include part E challenge activities in the plans they submit to OJJDP in order to receive formula grants. Revises provisions with respect to the composition and functions of the advisory group required under each State plan. Specifies that such advisory group shall consist of not more than 33 members: (1) who have training, experience, or special knowledge concerning the prevention and treatment of juvenile delinquency or the administration of juvenile justice; (2) including at least one locally elected official representing general purpose local government, representatives of law enforcement and juvenile agencies, public agencies concerned with delinquency prevention or treatment, private nonprofit organizations, volunteers who work with delinquents or potential delinquents, youth workers involved with programs that are alternatives to incarceration (including programs providing organized recreation activities), persons with special experience and competence in addressing problems related to school violence, vandalism, and alternatives to suspension and expulsion, and in addressing problems related to learning disabilities, emotional difficulties, child abuse and neglect, and youth violence; (3) a majority of whom (including the chairperson) shall not be full-time employees of the Federal, State, or local government; (4) at least one-fifth of whom shall be under age 24 at the time of appointment; and (5) at least three of whom have been under the jurisdiction of the system at some time. Sets forth additional requirements with respect to such advisory group. Requires State plans to contain an analysis of and a plan for providing: (1) gender-specific services for the prevention and treatment of juvenile delinquency; (2) services for the prevention and treatment of juvenile delinquency in rural areas; and (3) mental health services to juveniles in the juvenile justice system. Earmarks funds for programs and services such as: (1) community-based alternatives to incarceration and institutionalization, including specified programs and services for youth who can remain at home with assistance, need temporary placement, and need residential placement; (2) community-based programs and services to work with parents and other family members to strengthen families, including parent self-help groups; with juveniles during their incarceration and their families; and with parents with limited English-speaking ability; (3) educational programs or supportive services for delinquent or other juveniles, provided equitably regardless of sex, race, or family income, designed to encourage juveniles to remain in elementary and secondary schools or in alternative learning situations, and to enhance coordination with the local schools that such juveniles would otherwise attend; (4) expanded use of home probation; (5) youth-initiated outreach programs designed to assist youth (including youth with limited proficiency in English) who otherwise would not be reached by traditional youth assistance programs; (6) programs and projects designed to provide for the treatment of youths' dependence on or abuse of alcohol or other drugs; (7) programs for positive youth development that assist delinquent and other at-risk youth in obtaining a sense of safety and structure, of belonging, of self-worth, of independence and control over one's life, of closeness in interpersonal relationships, and of competence; (8) programs designed to encourage courts to develop and implement a continuum of post-adjudication restraints that bridge the gap between traditional probation and confinement in a correctional setting, including expanded use of probation, restitution, community service, treatment, home detention, intensive supervision, electronic monitoring, boot camps and similar programs, and secure community-based treatment facilities linked to other support services; and to assist in the provision by the Administrator of information and technical assistance, including technology transfer, to States in the design and utilization of risk assessment mechanisms to aid juvenile justice personnel in determining appropriate sanctions for delinquent behavior; (9) programs designed to prevent and reduce hate crimes committed by juveniles; and (10) programs (including referral to literacy and social service programs) to assist families with limited English-speaking ability that include delinquent juveniles to overcome language and cultural barriers that may prevent the complete treatment of such juveniles and the preservation of their families. Includes alien juveniles in custody in the group of status offenders to be removed from secure detention or correctional facilities. Requires State plans to prohibit the detention or confinement of juveniles alleged or found to be delinquent and certain other youth in any institution in which they have contact with adults incarcerated because they have been convicted of a crime or are awaiting trial on criminal charges (currently, regular contact, and excludes the following), or with the part- or full-time security staff (including management) or direct-care staff of a jail or lockup for adults. Extends through 1997 (currently, 1993) the requirement that the Administrator promulgate regulations which make exceptions to a prohibition against the detention or confinement of juveniles in any jail or lockup for adults with respect to the detention of juveniles accused of non-status offenses who are awaiting an initial court appearance pursuant to an enforceable State law requiring such appearances within 24 hours after being taken into custody, subject to specified exceptions. Includes among such exceptions situations where conditions of: (1) distance to be traveled or the lack of highway, road, or other ground transportation do not allow for court appearances within 24 hours, so that a brief delay (not to exceed 48 hours) is excusable; and (2) safety exist (such as severely adverse weather conditions that do not allow for reasonably safe travel), in which case the time for an appearance may be delayed until 24 hours after the time that such conditions allow for reasonably safe travel. Requires State plans to provide: (1) assurance that youth in the system are treated equitably on the basis of gender, race, family income, and mentally, emotionally, or physically handicapping conditions; (2) for family counseling during the incarceration of juvenile family members and coordination of family services when appropriate and feasible; and (3) assurance that if the State receives Federal assistance for State and local juvenile justice programs for any fiscal year that exceeds 105 percent of that received by the State for such programs for FY 1992, all of such excess shall be expended through or for programs that are part of a comprehensive and coordinated community system of services. Specifies that failure to achieve compliance with the requirement that State plans provide that juveniles who are charged with or who have committed offenses that would not be criminal if committed by an adult or offenses which do not constitute violations of valid court orders, or such nonoffenders as dependent or neglected children, not be placed in secure detention or correctional facilities, within the three-year time limitation, shall terminate a State's eligibility for juvenile justice funding for a fiscal year beginning before January 1, 1993, unless the Administrator determines that the State is in substantial compliance (through deinstitutionalization of not less than 75 percent of such juveniles or through removal of 100 percent of such juveniles from secure correctional facilities) and has made, through appropriate executive or legislative action, an unequivocal commitment to achieving full compliance within a reasonable time not exceeding two additional years.
