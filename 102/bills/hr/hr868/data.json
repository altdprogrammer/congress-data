Prohibits exports to, imports from, American economic or military assistance to, or the extension of nondiscriminatory trade treatment to, any country listed under the President's report. Requires the publication of a list of dual-use items subject to export controls under the Export Administration Act of 1979. Prohibits the U.S. Government, in addition to imposing applicable penalties under the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1979, from procuring any goods or services from, transferring any technology to, and granting any security clearances to, all U.S. or foreign persons in violation of this Act. Provides for the forfeiture to the United States of property of concerns that have violated this Act. Makes procurement sanctions inapplicable to any contract entered into before the sanctioned country was listed under this Act if such sanction would threaten the security of third country nationals or would involve massive and unavoidable financial losses to the penalized person or entity."
