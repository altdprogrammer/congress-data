Requires Federal agencies to certify to the Congress that no appropriated amounts will be used in violation of such prohibition. Prohibits motor vehicles used by a Federal agency from being used to provide transportation for an agency employee (and prohibits an agency employee from performing such service) unless the President, in the case of an executive branch employee, or the Chief Justice, in the case of a judicial branch employee, issues a finding that: (1) the transportation is necessary for purposes of national security or employee safety; or (2) the use of the vehicle is the most practical and cost-efficient means of transportation available to carry out official functions. Requires Federal agencies to report annually to the Congress on all employee travel outside of the United States."
