    "text": "Energy Technology Research and Development Authorization Act of 1991 - Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Energy for FY 1992 and 1993 for: (1) supporting research and technical analysis (with amounts for the Basic Energy Sciences Program, including amounts for the Advanced Photon Source, the Energy Research Analysis Program, the Multiprogram Energy Laboratories Facilities Support Program, university and science education, and the Advisory and Oversight Program Direction and Policy Management for Energy Research Activities); (2) nuclear energy (with amounts for the Nuclear Energy Research and Development Program and for a research and development program to mitigate hazards associated with high level radioactive waste and spent fuel from nuclear reactors); (3) fusion energy research and development (with amounts for magnetic fusion energy research and for the Inertial Confinement Fusion Program); (4) the Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation Program; (5) the Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Program; and (6) fossil energy (with amounts for basic and supporting research, advanced technology development, petroleum, natural gas, cooperative research and development, and supporting activities). Sets forth U.S. policy with respect to appropriations for substantial and major construction projects of the Department of Energy (DOE) in civilian energy research and development areas. Directs the Secretary, after the completion of the preliminary design phase of a major construction project, to report to the Congress on: (1) estimates of the total cost of construction, the time required to complete construction, and the annual operating costs of the facility; (2) the intended useful operating life of the facility; and (3) any existing facilities to be closed as a result of the operation of such facility. Requires the Secretary, after the completion of the preliminary design phase of the Advanced Neutron Source and Burning Plasma Experiment major construction projects, to provide the Congress with information on their anticipated costs and schedules. Directs the Secretary to: (1) proceed expeditiously to procure a deployment contractor for the commercialization of the Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation technology; and (2) authorize the University of California and Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc., to enter into cooperative research and development agreements with private sector entities to develop non-uranium enrichment applications of such technology. Requires the Secretary to award a contract for further design and engineering with respect to a standardized commercial nuclear power plant design that has been certified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Sets forth contract selection criteria. Limits Federal funding for such project and requires 50 percent of the funding to be from non-Federal sources. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on plans for increasing the participation of historically black colleges in DOE Basic Energy Science programs. Requires the Secretary to establish a research, development, and production center at the Hanford Reservation in Richland, Washington, to be known as the Research Reactor User Complex (RRC). Authorizes the DOE and DOE contractors operating the RRC to enter into agreements with non-Federal entities to use the RRC for: (1) the production of industrial and medical isotopes or steam for use or sale; or (2) irradiation services to support research or commercial objectives. Limits such agreements to a period of 25 years. Requires DOE contractors operating the RRC to: (1) maintain and operate the Fast Flux Test Facility; (2) ensure that all experiments meet applicable safety requirements and criteria; and (3) provide support services to the non-Federal entities that have entered into such agreements. Establishes an RRC Fund in the Treasury. Directs the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on the appropriateness of cost sharing requirements for DOE fossil research and development projects. Requires the Secretary to submit an annual three-year budget estimate for DOE civilian research and development programs to the Congress. Sets forth restrictions on authorizations."
