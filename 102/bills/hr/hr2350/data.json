    "text": "National Liberty Scholarship and Partnership Act of 1991 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to establish programs for additional financial aid and counseling and other supportive services for low-income students (to be called Liberty Scholarships and Partnerships for Low-Income Students). Authorizes the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to establish such programs through matching payments to States for: (1) State financial aid programs that award grants to low-income students who attain a high school diploma or its equivalent to guarantee them the financial assistance necessary to attend an institution of higher education; and (2) a partnership program (provided by States in cooperation with local educational agencies, postsecondary institutions, and community organizations) of additional and comprehensive mentoring, counseling, outreach, and supportive services for elementary, middle, and secondary students at risk of dropping out of school and for students and their parents regarding college financing options. Requires that grants under such financial aid program be used to reduce the expected family contribution of qualified students. Requires that the maximum amount of such a grant be established by the State, but prohibits such amount from being: (1) more than the average cost of attendance for an in-State student in a four-year program at public institutions in such State; or (2) less than 75 percent of such cost of attendance. Reduces the maximum grant by: (1) the total amount of other grant assistance (but not work-study assistance) for which the student is eligible; and (2) one-half of the amount by which the adjusted gross income of the student's family exceeds the Federal poverty level. Defines \"qualified student\" as one who: (1) is less than 22 years old at time of first grant award; (2) is receiving a Pell Grant for the academic year of the award or would be eligible for such Pell Grant but for their attendance on a less than half-time basis; (3) receives a high school diploma or equivalent in 1993 or thereafter; and (4) is enrolled in an authorized degree program in the State (States may opt to offer grant program portabiity for recipients at institutions in other participating states). Requires a State to demonstrate, under the partnership program, that it has increased the aggregate amount of its expenditures to provide comprehensive mentoring, counseling, outreach, and supportive services. Directs the Secretary to establish criteria for determining which types of services programs may be counted for such purpose. Lists examples of acceptable activities. Allows the State to incude in such program participation of businesses, religious organizations, community groups, postsecondary educational institutions, nonprofit and philanthropic organizations, and other entities deemed appropriate by the Secretary. Sets forth requirements for Federal matching payments to States for such financial aid and partnership programs, with additional payments for limited administrative expenses. Bases State allotments under this Act on their relative allocations under provisions for grants for local educational agencies in counties with especially high concentrations of children from low-income families under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Prohibits any State from using more than 50 percent of its allotment for the comprehensive counseling, outreach, and support services partnership program. Sets forth reallotment provisions. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1996 for grants for matching payments to States for such financial aid and partnership programs, but only if the annual Federal appropriations for the HEA program of Grants to States for State Student Incentives exceed a specified amount. Repeals provisions for School, College, and University Partnerships (part B of title V of HEA) serving low-income students."
