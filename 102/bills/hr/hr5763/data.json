Makes a sugarcane producer who knowingly harvests or allows to be harvested excess acreage liable to the Commodity Credit Corporation for a civil penalty equal to one and one-half times the U.S. market value of the sugar marketed in excess of the processor's allocation. Requires any assessed penalty to be prorated among producers of all sugarcane acquired by the processor from excess acres. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to suspend or adjust sugarcane limits due to a natural disaster or other adverse condition."
