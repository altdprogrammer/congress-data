Prohibits a grant to a State under existing provisions for early intervention with respect to HIV disease unless the State: (1) requires testing of providers; and (2) prohibits performance, except with informed consent, of the procedure by infected providers. Requires infected providers to inform patients who may have been exposed and offer to provide counseling and testing. Requires the State to provide counseling to providers on the effects of the prohibition of performing listed procedures. Requires HIV disease and hepatitis B to be included on the list of communicable diseases. Requires inclusion on the list of procedures those procedures which pose a risk of transmission of communicable diseases from patient to provider. Prohibits HIV early intervention grants to a State unless the State authorizes providers to test the patient, without consent, for communicable diseases the provider has a reasonable basis to believe the patient has. Applies the requirements of this title to provisions relating to grants for health care and support services for individuals and families with HIV disease. Title II: General Provisions - Sets forth the effective date of the amendments made by this Act."
