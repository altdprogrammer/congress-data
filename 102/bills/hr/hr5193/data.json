    "text": "Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 - Title I: Women Veterans Health Programs - Women Veterans Health Programs Act of 1992 - Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, through December 31, 1995, to provide counseling to a woman veteran whom the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines requires such counseling to overcome psychological trauma which, in the judgment of a mental health professional employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, resulted from a physical assault, battery, or harassment of a sexual nature which occurred while the veteran was serving on active duty. Requires such a woman veteran to seek such counseling within two years after her date of discharge or release from active duty. Allows the Secretary, through December 31, 1994, to provide such counseling through a contract with a qualified mental health professional under certain conditions. Limits any counseling to a one-year period, unless the Secretary determines that a longer period is required. Requires the Secretary to give priority to the establishment of the women veterans counseling program and to provide information concerning the availability of such services to eligible women veterans. Allows such information to include the establishment of a toll-free telephone number. Requires coordination with the Secretary of Defense for informing newly released women veterans of such program. Provides a priority for such women veterans among veterans receiving outpatient care from the Department. Directs the Secretary to commence the provision of information on the sexual trauma counseling within 90 days after the enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to report to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees (veterans' committees) on actions taken with respect to the counseling program. Authorizes the Secretary, in furnishing hospital care and medical services to veterans, to provide to women the following health care services: (1) pap smears; (2) breast examinations and mammography; and (3) general reproductive health care, including the management of menopause, but excluding infertility services, abortions, or pregnancy care (with an exception). Requires the Secretary to ensure that directors of Department medical facilities identify and assess the opportunities to: (1) expand the availability of, and access to, health care services for women veterans; and (2) provide the counseling, care, and services authorized under this title. Directs the Secretary, in 1993 through 1995, to report to the veterans' committees on the provision of health care and the conduct of research carried out by, or under the jurisdiction of, the Secretary relating to women veterans. Requires the Secretary to ensure that an official in each regional office of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department serve as a coordinator of women's services, outlining such coordinator's responsibilities. Directs the Secretary to foster and encourage the initiation and expansion of research relating to the health of women veterans. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary, only with funds expressly so provided in an appropriations Act, to study and report to the veterans' committees on the needs of women veterans for health care services. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Health-Care Sharing Agreements Between Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense - Authorizes the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the Secretary of Defense to expand the availability of health-care sharing arrangements with the Department of Defense (DOD). Allows a proposed agreement entered into by the head of a Department medical facility to take effect only if the Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the VHA certifies to the Secretary that implementation of such agreement: (1) will result in the improvement of services to eligible veterans at such facility; and (2) will not result in the denial of, or delay in providing, access to care for any veteran at such facility. Provides that such agreement will pertain to primary beneficiaries of veterans (surviving spouses and natural or adopted children). Allows covered beneficiaries receiving care or services at either a Department or DOD facility to receive such services: (1) without regard to any otherwise applicable copayment or deductible; or (2) subject to a requirement to pay only part of any such copayment or deductible as specified in agreement guidelines.
