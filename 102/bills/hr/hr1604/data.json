Makes this Act inapplicable with respect to any activity in connection with a joint production venture if more than 30 percent of the beneficial ownership of the voting securities and equity of such venture is controlled by foreign entities. Requires any facilities operated by such venture to be located within the United States or its territories. Declares that this Act shall not affect any rights or obligations under the Free-Trade Agreement Between the United States and Canada."
