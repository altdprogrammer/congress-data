    "text": "Amends the Historic Preservation Act to direct the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) promulgate regulations outlining procedures for making eligibility determinations for the National Register of Historic Places; and (2) make such determinations promptly upon receipt of a request from any Federal agency, State or local government, or person which may be affected by such determination. Specifies that: (1) such regulations shall provide that only the Secretary is empowered to make a formal determination of eligibility; and (2) prior to making a determination that any property or district, five acres or larger, is eligible for the Register and therefore subject to the review process, the local governing body with authority for making land use determinations shall be given the opportunity to concur in or object to such determination (and if a simple majority objects, the Secretary shall take no further action with respect to the property until such objection is withdrawn). Deletes a requirement that such regulations include provisions to carry out specified purposes of such Act with respect to the multiple ownership of a single property."
