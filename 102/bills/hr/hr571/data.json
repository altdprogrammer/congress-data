    "text": "Amends Federal law (commonly known as the National Park Service Concessions Policy Act) with respect to preferential rights to provide new or additional accommodations, facilities, or services to concessioners in areas administered by the National Park Service. Repeals certain provisions of such Act with regard to: (1) right of preference for contract renewal; and (2) possessory interest of such concessioner. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop and implement a system for: (1) the renewal and extension of existing contracts and permits; (2) the granting of new contracts and permits on a competitive basis; (3) provision of new or additional services through concessioners in areas of the National Park System; and (4) the limiting of contracts to U.S. persons only. Authorizes the Secretary to terminate any foreign-owned or controlled concessions in the National Park System. Requires the Secretary to review all existing contracts (including the Circle Line Statue of Liberty Inc. contract) to determine if: (1) any of them were awarded outside of the normal procedures of such Act; and (2) any of them can be legally terminated on that basis. Directs the Secretary to review the concession serving the Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island to determine if there is sufficient access for the public and if the cost of the ferry service to Ellis Island and Liberty Island is justified. Requires the Secretary to consider providing additional ferry service from additional points of embarkation in New Jersey and New York City to Ellis Island and Liberty Island. Authorizes the Secretary to construct or allow for the construction of a permanent bridge, open to the public for pedestrian use, connecting Liberty State Park and Ellis Island. Allows construction of a facility at a National Park System unit for concession purposes only if: (1) such facility is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the enactment of this Act; and (2) funds are appropriated for such construction."
