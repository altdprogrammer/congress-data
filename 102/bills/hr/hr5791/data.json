    "text": "Domestic Relations Order Interstate Compliance Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties (for a first offense, a fine, up to six months' imprisonment, or both; in any other case, a fine, up to two years' imprisonment, or both) for willful failure to comply with a domestic relations order involving residents of more than one State. Directs the court to order restitution in an amount equal to the past due support obligation or damages for other violations existing at the time of sentencing. Authorizes a court to include, as a condition of probation, that a defendant comply with the terms of any court or administrative order pursuant to the law of a State, the District of Columbia, or any other possession or territory of the United States for the payment of support or the granting of access or visitation with a minor child. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to make grants to States to develop, implement, and enforce criminal interstate child support legislation and to coordinate criminal interstate domestic relations order enforcement efforts. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) uses of grant funds; (2) State and local application requirements; (3) review of State applications; (4) distribution of funds; and (5) evaluation. Authorizes appropriations."
