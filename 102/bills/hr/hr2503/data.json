    "text": "Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit candidates for a House of Representatives election from accepting contributions: (1) from any multicandidate political committee (PAC), individual, or other source not located within the candidate's district; or (2) that in the aggregate exceeds $200 from the same source. Precludes such candidates from making contributions from personal funds totaling more than $200. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow income tax credits for contributions to House of Representatives candidates (but not by an estate or trust). Prohibits House of Representatives candidates from: (1) accepting contributions during the 14-day period before an election; (2) establishing, financing, or controlling a political committee other than the candidate's principal campaign committee; or (3) carrying forward from one election cycle to the next a total of more than $25,000 in all campaign accounts. Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit the House from considering business other than pro forma matters between Labor Day and election day of each year in which a regularly scheduled Federal general election is held (except in a case of national emergency). Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to mandate that, whenever any person makes an expenditure for an advertisement expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, prior public notice shall be provided with respect to: (1) advertisement contents; (2) the identity of the purchaser of the advertisement; and (3) the names of officers and members of a purchasing organization's board of directors."
