Title II: State Health Care Insurance Plans - Outlines criteria concerning administration, comprehensiveness, universality, portability, and accessibility that the State's health care insurance plan must satisfy in order to receive the Federal payment under title I of this Act. Title III: Budget-Neutral Financing of the Federal Block Grant - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a surtax, on both the regular income tax and the minimum tax, to replace revenues used for block grants under this Act. Creates in the Treasury the National Health Care Block Grant Trust Fund to finance the block grants made available under title I of this Act."
