    "text": "Universal Medical Care Act of 1992 - UniMed Act of 1992 - Creates the UniMed program with three components: MediWorkers, MediKids, and MediWrap. Title I: MediWorkers Component of UniMed Program - Subtitle A: Employer-Sponsored Group Health Plans - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to require each employer to provide coverage to each eligible full-time employee or spouse. Provides for consumer protection by: (1) regulating claims procedures; (2) requiring certain disclosures; and (3) prohibiting financial arrangements between group health plans and physicians having the effect of reducing or limiting services. Sets forth procedures and requirements for group health plan certification by the Health Benefits Board (Board) established under this Act. Requires: (1) the Board to establish minimum quality standards; and (2) each plan to issue a health plan card to each covered individual. Mandates coverage of certain core services, including: (1) inpatient and outpatient hospital services; (2) physician and community health clinic services and certain other health professional services; (3) certain inpatient and outpatient mental health services; (4) certain alcohol and drug abuse treatment services; (5) pregnancy-related services; (6) specified preventive services; (7) diagnostic and laboratory services; and (8) case management. Allows the Board to include additional preventive services and, in order to conduct demonstrations, additional services as core benefits. Establishes related advisory committees. Prohibits a plan which is not a network plan (defining a network plan as a plan which limits coverage to services provided by participating providers or which permits higher deductibles and coinsurance applicable to the use of non-participating providers) from limiting coverage of core services to specified providers. Regulates deductibles, coinsurance, and cost-sharing. Requires the Board to: (1) annually establish reference payment rates, based on the payment methodology used under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, for all core services; or (2) substitute rates established by a State, unless that would increase expenditures or shift costs among UniMed's three components. Limits charges for: (1) institutional services to the reference rates; and (2) professional services to the same proportion above the reference rates as the limiting charge established under specified Medicare provisions. Requires adequate core services payment rates and use of Medicare payment methodologies. Mandates prospective reductions in reference payment rates for: (1) hospitals with excessive rates of increase of capital expenditures which were not pre-approved by the Board; and (2) medical residency programs inconsistent with number and specialty distribution standards. Limits employee-paid premiums according to a specified formula which includes consideration of the employee's wages. Prohibits excluding pre-existing conditions or exclusions for core services that are more restrictive than the exclusions under the MediWrap component. Sets forth consumer protections, including: (1) prohibiting a plan which is not a network plan from restricting the covered individual's choice of provider; (2) requiring notice of the low-income assistance available under this Act; and (3) insolvency and escrow reserves protection. Mandates issuance of health plan identification cards and use of standard claims forms and processes. Requires: (1) coordination of coverage and termination of coverage among plans and between plans and the MediKids and MediWrap components; (2) coordination of deductibles and cost-sharing among plans; (3) notice of beginning and terminating coverage of an individual; (4) ongoing accounting, for each covered individual, regarding deductibles and cost-sharing to promote portability; and (5) that the MediWrap component cover each MediWrap eligible individual whose coverage under a plan or under Medicare part A is terminated. Provides for certification of open (defined as not limited to a particular employer or industry or organized on behalf of a particular group) group health polices. Considers a plan as meeting certain certification requirements if it provides benefits through a contract with a carrier for an open certified policy. Prohibits a State from imposing any requirement on an open basic policy inconsistent with these requirements. Requires a certified group health policy to meet requirements of this Act relating to claims procedures, financial arrangements between group health plans and physicians having the effect of reducing or limiting services, issuance of UniMed cards, core services, deductibles, coinsurance, cost-sharing, payment rates, pre-existing conditions, choice of provider, solvency, standardization of cards and claims processing, and coordination and portability of coverage. Requires the carrier of a certified policy to assume responsibility under this Act for equalization of premiums. Requires a carrier which offers a certified policy to offer it without regard to the size of the employer. Allows health maintenance organizations to have certain geographic and size limits. Prohibits open basic certified policies from being terminated, except for premium nonpayment, fraud or misrepresentation, or at the end of a year. Allows employers to change to another policy without penalty at the end of each calendar year.
