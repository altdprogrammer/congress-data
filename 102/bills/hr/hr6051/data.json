(Increases also the number of weeks of unemployment benefits payable to certain railroad workers under such Act.) Conforms certain financing provisions of such Act to amendments made by this Act. Requires that the provisions of (and amendments made by) this Act be treated as emergency requirements designated by the President and the Congress under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act). Requires that any amount of new budget authority, outlays, or receipts resulting from the provisions of (and amendments made by) this Act not be considered for any purpose under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
