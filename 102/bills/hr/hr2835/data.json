    "text": "Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems Act of 1991 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a program to promote and facilitate the implementation of Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems (IVHS) as a component of the nation's surface transportation systems to enhance the capacity, efficiency, and safety of the Federal-aid highway system, reduce societal, economic, and environmental costs associated with traffic congestion, and enhance U.S. industrial and economic competitiveness and productivity. Requires the Secretary to: (1) coordinate an IVHS program and foster its use; (2) develop and implement standards to promote the widespread use and evaluation of IVHS technology (to the extent practicable, promoting compatibility among IVHS technologies implemented throughout the States); (3) establish guidelines and requirements for the evaluation of field and related operational tests; and (4) establish a repository for technical and safety data collected as a result of federally sponsored projects pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to utilize advisory committees in carrying out responsibilities under this Act. Directs the Secretary: (1) within 12 months, to formulate (and submit to the Congress) a strategic plan for the IVHS program; (2) within 24 months and annually thereafter, to submit reports to the Congress on implementation of such plan; and (3) within 24 months, to submit a report to the Congress (and within five years, to update such report) addressing the non-technical constraints to all aspects of the innovation of such program, including antitrust, privacy, staffing, patent, and liability concerns, recommending legislation and administrative action, and addressing ways to further promote industry and State and local government involvement in such program. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) provide planning and technical assistance to State and local governments seeking to use and evaluate IVHS technologies; and (2) make grants for feasibility and planning studies to be conducted by State and local governments. Sets forth provisions with respect to funding and eligibility requirements and priorities for funding projects. Directs the Secretary to: (1) designate transportation corridors in which application of IVHS will have particular benefit and, through financial and technical assistance, assist in the implementation of such systems; and (2) allocate funds for such purpose to eligible State and local entities for application in corridors having several of specified characteristics, such as traffic density at least 1.5 times the national average, severe or extreme nonattainment for ozone, and complexity of traffic patterns. Specifies that the Federal share for activities authorized pursuant to this Act shall be 80 percent of the cost."
