Prohibits funds made available by the Federal Government from being used to obtain or use, unless medically necessary, any syringes or needles other than such syringes and needles. Mandates a study and report to the Congress on the effects of requiring health care providers to use only such syringes and needles on the costs of needles and syringes and on the access of individuals and entities, including health care providers in developing nations and diabetics, to reasonably priced needles and syringes."
