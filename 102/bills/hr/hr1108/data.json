Amends the Federal veterans' and armed forces educational assistance programs to provide that, in the case of an active-duty or reserve member student who fails to complete a course of study under such programs due to being called to active duty or being given increased work in connection with the Persian Gulf War, both the amount of educational assistance received and the time spent pursuing that course will not be counted against such student for purposes of his or her general entitlement to educational benefits under the appropriate educational assistance program. Restores the full amount available to such student veteran as if the interrupted course had not been taken. States that such exclusion shall also apply to members of the Selected Reserve pursuing courses of study (and similarly interrupted) under the armed forces' educational assistance program."
