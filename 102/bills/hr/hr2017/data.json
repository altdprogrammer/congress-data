Makes void and unenforceable any portion of an agreement in settlement of a case in Federal court that has such purpose or effect. Authorizes any person who is substantially affected by such an order or agreement, by motion or in a civil action, to obtain the disclosure of the information about a public hazard. Specifies that, for purposes of this Act, the new media are \"substantially affected\" by any order or agreement prohibited by this Act. Requires the court, in any proceeding to enforce prohibitions of this Act, to examine the disputed information in camera. Specifies that the copyrighting of information does not prevent the disclosure or use of information about a public hazard."
