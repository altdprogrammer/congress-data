Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, when selecting grant applicants, to give priority to entities that have experience in providing services to runaway and homeless youth. (Currently such priority is to be given to private entities.) Adds to current grant applicant requirements certain assurances about: (1) the provision of outreach programs; and (2) confidentiality of records maintained on individual runaway and homeless youth. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to national nonprofit organizations to provide technical and training assistance. Repeals the requirement that priority be given to grants smaller than $150,000. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to public and private entities to implement evaluation projects designed to increase knowledge concerning, and to improve services for, runaway and homeless youth. Authorizes appropriations."
