Directs that such report include for each recipient country: (1) an analysis of the impact of such assistance on the country's economic development, including a description of the specific objectives sought and the extent to which they were not achieved and why; (2) a description of the amount and nature of the assistance provided by other donors during that period; (3) a discussion of the commitment of the host government to addressing the country's needs in each development sector; (4) a description of the trends in each sector; (5) statistical and other information necessary to the evaluation; and (6) a comparison of the analysis provided in the report with relevant analyses by international or nongovernmental organizations or donor countries. Requires that each report: (1) be submitted to the Congress as a separate document; and (2) identify those countries in which economic assistance has been most and least successful, explain why the assistance was not more successful, and specify what the United States has done as a result."
