    "text": "Aid for Trade Act of 1991 - Title I: Use of Foreign Assistance Funds - Allocates, on a percentage basis, bilateral economic assistance for FY 1993 through 1997 and thereafter for the construction, design, or servicing of developmentally sound capital projects. Limits the use of such assistance to the procurement of U.S. goods and services. Establishes a program for the combined use of credits, loans, and guarantees by the Export-Import Bank and the private sector and grants from the Agency for International Development (AID) under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to support the construction, design, or servicing of such capital projects. Directs the President to establish an interagency capital projects coordinating committee composed of specified Federal officials to ensure a strategic approach to the support of such projects. Requires the committee to submit to the Congress a report with respect to the support and coordination of such projects and the extent to which they and tied aid programs have affected U.S. exports. Sets specified percentage limits on cash transfers with respect to Economic Support Funds for FY 1993 through 1997. Requires the Comptroller General to study and report to the Congress on cash payment assistance. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require the Administrator of each agency, in determining the geographic code for the purchase of goods and services, not to grant any waivers from Geographic Codes 000 (United States only) or 941 (United States and least-developed countries) except for specified reasons. Requires the Administrator of AID to report annually to the Congress on such waivers. Title II: Increase in Credit Authority - Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to direct the Export-Import Bank to increase its direct loans and reserve funds for loan guarantees for FY 1993 through 1997 by 15 percent per year. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 and 1994 to the Tied Aid Credit Fund. Amends the Trade and Development Enhancement Act of 1983 to authorize appropriations for FY 1993 and 1994 to support preliminary engineering and design work for capital projects. Title III: Eastern Europe Recovery Program - Authorizes the President, acting through the Administrator of AID, to provide technical assistance to assist in the revision of public policy and administrative reforms to effect the evolution of free-market economics among the Eastern European nations. Authorizes appropriations. Establishes within the Export-Import Bank an Eastern European Loan Guarantee Program which shall provide guarantees to U.S. lenders and exporters to export U.S. products and services to Eastern Europe. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to increase the amount of direct investment loans that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation must make each fiscal year. Earmarks a specified amount of such loans to promote the activities of U.S. small businesses in Eastern Europe. Title IV: General Provisions - Requires the Secretary of the Treasury and the President of the Export-Import Bank to report to the Congress on the status of negotiations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with respect to reducing the levels of concessional financing by its member countries (other than the United States) if a new agreement has not been reached by December 31, 1991."
