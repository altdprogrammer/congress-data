    "text": "Desert Storm Reservist Family Fairness Act of 1991 - Entitles reserve personnel on active duty during the Persian Gulf conflict for more than 30 days to special pay in the amount of the difference between the pay received as a civilian and the military pay received while on such active duty. Prohibits such special pay and military pay from exceeding $4,167 per month, or from exceeding the monthly rate of GS-14 if such reserve member is a Federal employee before being called to such active duty. Provides that if a career Senior Executive Service appointee performs any military service for which such special pay is applicable, that period of military service shall be disregarded in determining: (1) the due date for meeting recertification requirements; (2) the period for meeting recertification after being conditionally certified; and (3) the period permitted for filing appeals of certification questions with the Merit Systems Protection Board. Authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to prescribe regulations to provide that all rights and benefits of career appointees serving in such qualifying military service are not interrupted or diminished as a result of serving in such capacity. Outlines other rights and benefits to which such regulations shall apply."
