    "text": "Amends Federal law to expand the boundaries of Stones River National Battlefield, Tennessee, to include additional lands. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, before acquiring any lands whose surface has been substantially disturbed or believed by the Secretary to contain hazardous substances, to report to specified congressional committees on: (1) potential hazardous substances associated with such lands and the estimated cost of restoring them; and (2) a plan of remedial measures needed to allow acquisition of such lands to proceed in a timely manner, consistent with the requirements of this Act. Prohibits the Secretary from acquiring any lands under this Act if any portion of them has become contaminated with hazardous substances. Allows any owner of improved noncommercial residential property within the boundaries of the Battlefield, who has reached the age of majority, to retain the right of use and occupancy for continued residential purposes, subject to certain conditions. Limits the terms of such use and occupancy to a maximum of 25 years, or, in the alternative, the death of the owner or the owner's spouse, whichever is later. Directs: (1) the owner to elect such term; and (2) the Secretary to pay the owner the fair market value of the property on the date of such acquisition, less the fair market value of the term retained by the owner. Authorizes the conveyance or transfer of such right of use and occupancy, during its existence, under specified conditions. Authorizes the Secretary, if the terms and conditions of the right of use and occupancy are violated, to terminate such right by tendering to its holder an amount equal to the fair market value, as of the date of the tender, of that portion which remains unexpired on the date of its termination. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into an agreement with Murfreesboro, Tennessee, that, if the city constructs and maintains a trail linking the Battlefield with Fortress Rosecrans, the Secretary would: (1) transfer available funds to the city for land acquisition to construct the trail; and (2) provide technical assistance to it and to Rutherford County for development and planning of the trail. Requires the Secretary to agree to accept the transfer from the city of the remnants of Fortress Rosecrans at Old Fort Park and to maintain such Fortress as part of the Battlefield. Directs the Secretary to: (1) prepare on or before February 1, 1992, a plan for the preservation and interpretation of Redoubt Brannan; and (2) update on or before March 31, 1993, the General Management Plan for the Stones River National Battlefield. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) provide technical assistance to the city and to Rutherford County in the development of zoning ordinances and other land use controls to preserve historically significant areas adjacent to the Battlefield; and (2) make minor boundary revisions for it, under certain conditions."
