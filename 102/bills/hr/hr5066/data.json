    "text": "Long Island Sound Water Quality Research Act - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to expand the duties of the Environmental Protection Agency Long Island Sound Office to include the conduct of studies of: (1) alternative or innovative technologies to decrease pollution in the Sound; (2) present and foreseeable population and demographic trends in the Sound drainage area and the relation of land use patterns to point source and nonpoint source pollution; (3) a drainage area data base that evaluates the water quality capacity of the area, incorporates resource inventories and analyses, evaluates specified environmental features, and utilizes a format that can be integrated into Federal, State, and local management programs and systems; (4) a land use watershed model for coastal and upland areas of the Sound; (5) sensitive areas for the creation or restoration of degraded mudflats or wetlands in the drainage area; (6) sensitive areas for the remediation of contaminated sediments in the Sound; and (7) methods to refine the Long Island Sound Water Quality Model to improve the analysis of findings of nonpoint source pollutants and to better understand historical water quality trends. Requires the Office to prepare recommendations, using the land use watershed model: (1) for promoting least-cost land use strategies and water quality planning for municipalities in the drainage area; and (2) that incorporate relevant policies adopted by the Management Conference of the Long Island Sound Study. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act and extends existing authorizations."
