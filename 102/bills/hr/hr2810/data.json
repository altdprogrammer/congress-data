    "text": "Drug Treatment and Prevention Act of 1991 - Amends the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) establish a capacity expansion program that will provide grants to assist States to expand their capacity to provide effective and comprehensive treatment to individuals who use illegal drugs; and (2) award such grants to States in which a demand for drug treatment services exceeds the capacity of organizations operating in those States to provide such services. Sets forth application procedures, Federal funding limitations, and other requirements with respect to such program. Specifies that funds provided under this Act for such program shall supplement, not supplant, existing or planned drug treatment services in a State and shall be available only for the provision of direct treatment services. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986 to revise provisions with respect to emergency grants to authorize the Secretary to make drug-free schools emergency target grants to eligible local educational agencies (LEAs) and consortia of LEAs (currently, limited to LEAs) that: (1) demonstrate significant need for additional assistance for purposes of reducing and preventing drug and alcohol use and drug-related crime among students served by such agencies (currently, to combat drug and alcohol use among such students); (2) support projects that require cooperative linkages between schools and communities to reduce and prevent drug and alcohol use among schoolchildren; (3) demonstrate the most effective approaches to reducing and preventing drug and alcohol use among schoolchildren; and (4) promote the goal that every school in America will be free of drugs and violence and will offer a discipined environment conducive to learning. Specifies: (1) authorized activities by LEAs with grant funds; and (2) eligibility and application requirements for such grants by LEAs and consortia of LEAs. Directs the Secretary, in awarding grants, to give special preference to applications that: (1) hold particular promise for reducing and preventing the incidence of drug and alcohol use and drug-related violence in elementary and secondary schools; (2) are based on a rigorous and comprehensive research design; and (3) have demonstrated that they will integrate the resources of families, community groups, and the media into an effective, community-based assault on drug and alcohol use in schools. Requires the Secretary to conduct an evaluation of this program. Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) grant amounts and distribution of funds; and (2) set-asides from appropriations to conduct such evaluation, provide training and technical assistance to LEAs, and disseminate the results of the program. Authorizes approriations. Requires a local or intermediate educational agency or consortium to include in any application to the State educational agency for a drug and alcohol abuse prevention grant a statement of how any emergency target grants funded by the Government under this Act are integrated into the overall prevention plan set forth in the application. Amends the PHSA to require a State, in order to receive specified Federal funds, to develop, implement, and submit for approval a statewide drug treatment and prevention plan, which shall designate a single State agency for developing and implementing the plan. Sets forth plan and reporting requirements. Requires States to maintain expenditures for drug-related services at a level equal to not less than the average amount of such expenditures for the preceding two years to qualify for grants, subject to waiver by the Secretary under specified circumstances."
