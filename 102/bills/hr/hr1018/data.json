McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (National Board), to carry out a program of grants to assist communities: (1) in which a substantial percentage of the residents are military personnel assigned to areas outside such communities in connection with the Persian Gulf conflict; and (2) which are adversely affected by the absence of those members. Requires grants to be awarded in accordance with title III of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to local boards for distribution to private nonprofit and public organizations to assist persons in such a community. Directs the National Board to establish guidelines that specify the manner in which such grants shall be awarded. Allows local boards receiving such a grant to use the grant for the duration of the Persian Gulf conflict. Authorizes appropriations to FEMA for FY 1991 for such grants."
