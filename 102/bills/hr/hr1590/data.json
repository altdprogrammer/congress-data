    "text": "Ancient Forest Act of 1991 - Directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and of the Interior to designate lands for a Pacific Northwest Ancient Forest Reserve System, consisting of Federal and public lands in Oregon, Washington, and Northern California. Includes within the criteria for the System the need for lands for the viability and recovery of the northern spotted owl population. Requires the Ancient Forest Reserves to include at least 50 percent of old growth forest ecosystems found in the Douglas-fir Region that are outside of congressionally designated areas (wilderness areas and wild and scenic rivers in which commercial timber sales are prohibited). Prohibits vegetation removal on lands designated as Ancient Forest Reserves except for public safety, recreation, and administration. Requires that any timber harvest in the old growth forest ecosystems outside of Ancient Forest Reserves but within the Douglas-fir Region be managed using specified techniques under New Forestry Principles. Requires the Secretaries to establish an Ancient Forest Research Program on old growth forest ecosystems. Directs the President to establish a permanent Ancient Forest Scientific Committee to report to the Secretaries and certain congressional committees on specified aspects of programs and activities established under this Act. Mandates for FY 1992 through 1994 the minimum board feet per year the Secretaries must offer for sale from national forest lands within the Douglas-fir Region and other lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management within such Region according to certain guidelines on tree diameter and canopy closure. Prohibits the sale of timber in certain areas. Requires that sales of timber be first offered from those lands likely to suffer the least ecological impacts. Increases from 25 to 50 percent for a five-year period the amounts paid by the Secretary of Agriculture to States for their counties under Federal law with respect to national forests in the Douglas-fir Region. Sets forth for a five-year period the method by which Oregon and California land-grant funds paid by the Secretary of the Interior shall be distributed to such counties. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Forest Service's State and private forestry programs, to establish a special initiative to improve the productivity on State, county, and private lands in counties that include lands within the Douglas-fir Region. Requires the Secretaries to establish a national community assistance task force to oversee assistance to rural communities in those counties included within the Douglas-fir Region and to establish local task forces to assist communities and help displaced workers. Requires the Secretaries to establish a program to improve the condition of Federal forest lands in the Douglas-fir Region, with hiring preference given to local workers. Directs the President to appoint a Forest Community Assistance Coordinator to coordinate Federal assistance to affected communities and displaced workers. Establishes a special fund in the Treasury to consist of a certain percentage of the Federal Government's share of all timber receipts to fund the Timber Worker Adjustment Program established by this Act under the Job Training Partnership Act to help displaced timber workers find new jobs. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to study and report to specified congressional committees on consolidation of the Bureau of Land Management's Oregon and California lands through exchange, purchase, or donation. Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, and the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 with respect to old growth forest ecosystems. Directs the Secretaries to prepare and submit to the Congress a nationwide inventory of old growth forest ecosystems on national forests and public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Authorizes appropriations."
