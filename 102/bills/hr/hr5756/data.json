    "text": "Uniform Protection of Reproductive Rights Act of 1992 - Prohibits States from restricting the right of a woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy: (1) before 12 weeks of gestation; (2) after 12 weeks, if necessary to protect the life or health of the woman or in the case of severe fetal deformity; or (3) after 12 weeks and before fetal viability, if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. Allows a State to impose requirements medically necessary to protect the life or health of the woman. Declares that this Act does not prevent a State from: (1) requiring a minor to involve a responsible adult before such termination; or (2) protecting individuals or private institutions from having to participate in the performance of abortions to which they are conscientiously opposed."
