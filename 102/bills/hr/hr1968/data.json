    "text": "Consolidated Maternal and Child Health Services Act of 1991 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, for each fiscal year, to make payments to each State for maternal and child health care and related services, including: (1) for women, providing health services related to pregnancy; (2) for infants and children, providing preventive health services; (3) for infants not exceeding one year of age, providing comprehensive health services; (4) training individuals in administering such services for women, infants, and children; (5) conducting evaluations of such services; and (6) conducting surveys or studies required by the Secretary under this Act. Requires a State to determine eligibility, giving preference to individuals from low-income families (as defined by the State). Requires that all the services, except inpatient services, be provided at a single facility in the community. Authorizes States to expend the payments to make grants to public and nonprofit entities and to enter into contracts with public and private entities. Declares that, notwithstanding any other law, if an individual is eligible for any service or item under these provisions, the individual may not receive the service or item under any other Federal program providing services or items with respect to maternal or child health, subject to exception. Repeals titles X (Population Research and Voluntary Family Planning Programs) and XX (Adolescent Family Life Demonstration Projects) of the Public Health Service Act and provisions of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 relating to a special supplemental food program for women, infants, and children (commonly known as the WIC Program). Requires the head of the agency that administers each program consolidated by this Act to make a determination regarding any amendments which should be made to any Act affecting that program and report to the appropriate committees of the Congress. Prohibits payments to a State unless the State agrees that the payments will not be expended to pay for any abortion, or for any counseling on or referral for obtaining any abortion, except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. Requires that the State agree to provide services without regard to the ability of an individual to pay and make charges, if any, pursuant to a public schedule. Directs the Secretary, for FY 1993, to make a supplemental allotment for each State that has made satisfactory progress toward: (1) providing all State-assisted maternal and child health services and items without regard to whether the services and items are provided with Federal financial assistance; and (2) providing the services and items pursuant to a single, standardized application form through which all desired services and items can be simultaneously requested. Sets forth special provisions applicable to Indian tribes or tribal organizations. Authorizes appropriations. Requires any amounts paid to a State to remain available to the State for one year after the State receives the amounts."
