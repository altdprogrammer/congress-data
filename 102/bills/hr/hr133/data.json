    "text": "House of Representatives Election Campaign Reform Act of 1990 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) establish the House of Representatives Campaign Trust Fund (the Fund) within the Treasury; (2) provide a 100 percent tax credit for the first $200 in contributions an individual makes to a House candidate running for election in the State in which the individual is a resident if such contributions are not transmitted through an intermediary; and (3) provide for a $2 tax check-off on Federal income tax returns to be paid to the Fund. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to: (1) reduce from $5,000 to $2,000 the maximum amount of contributions a multicandidate political committee may make to any candidate for Federal office per election; (2) prohibit a House candidate from establishing, maintaining, or controlling a political committee, other than an authorized committee of the candidate or a committee of a political party; (3) require a House candidate to report to the Federal Election Commission all contributions totaling at least $25,000, in contributions of $200 or less from individual residents of the State from which the candidate is running in order to receive matching payments for the first $200 in individual contributions up to a maximum amount of $300,000; (4) require the Commission to certify to the Secretary of the Treasury such amounts reported; (5) require a House candidate to certify to the Commission that neither he or she, nor any family members, will furnish more than $100,000 from personal funds for the election; (6) allow the opponents of a House candidate who refuses to make such a certification to receive matching funds for up to $1000 in contributions from individuals regardless of their State residence; (7) allow opponents of a House candidate who violates such a certification to receive from the Fund payments equal to the amount of personal funds furnished for the election in excess of $100,000; (8) allow a House candidate who is certified and is notified by the Commission that he or she is the target of an independent expenditure in excess of $10,000 to receive from the Fund payments equal to 300 percent of the amount of such independent expenditures; (9) require that excess campaign funds be repaid to the Fund on a pro rata basis; (10) require any persons who make independent expenditures in excess of $10,000 to report such independent expenditures to the Commission within 24 hours and to file with the Commission a statement as to which candidate such expenditures are intended to help or hurt; and (11) require the Commission to notify each candidate in the House election of such independent expenditures within 24 hours. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 and the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to, respectively: (1) require broadcast stations to offer their lowest rates for broadcasts which are one to five minutes in length to House candidates who have made a certification that they will limit personal spending to $100,000; and (2) require the inclusion of a statement that a House candidate has not agreed to abide by the spending limits where appropriate in broadcast or print advertisements which solicit contributions or expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate. Sets forth penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
