Requires eligible lenders under the Stafford Student loan program to request pre-claims assistance within a specified period if the guaranty agency offers such pre-claims assistance for default prevention. Requires that guaranty agencies, within a specified period after receipt of such a request for such pre-claims assistance, to notify each eligible institution of the lenders request for such assistance on such loan. Reduces certain special allowances paid to holders of eligible loans under the Stafford student loan program. Requires eligible institutions under such program to submit certain information to the Secretary if they wish to change their accrediting agency or association. Requires student borrowers, in order to receive any student loan under the Act, to provide the lender at the time of applying for such loan: (1) their driver's license number; and (2) the name and address of their next of kin. Directs eligible institutions to require borrowers to supply the following exit interview information: (1) their address and the address of their next of kin; and (2) their driver's license number. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to establish and publicize a toll-free consumer telephone hotline for use by the public, to permit students who allege fraud or unfair practices by eligible institutions to inform the Department of Education. Requires that an institution's graduation and placement statistics be audited by an independent public agency. Sets forth restrictions on institutional promotional activities. Requires institutions to use the same definition of academic year for all student assistance programs under the Act. Establishes a tuition refund policy. Set forth special rules relating to accreditation. Authorizes the Secretary, under a specified procedures, to limit, suspend, or terminate an eligible institution from student assistance program participation whenever: (1) the institution withdraws from a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association during a show cause or suspension proceeding against it; or (2) such an agency or association reports, under a specified arrangement with the Secretary, that the institution was denied accreditation. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations specifying the legal restrictions and the requirements of eligible institutions relating to loan counseling and reporting requirements (including requirements and restrictions on disclosure of borrower records to third parties, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and other applicable Federal laws)."
