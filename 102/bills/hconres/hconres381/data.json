    "text": "Declares that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should modify regulations that implement the Clean Air Act to permit any State in nonattainment to adopt a State Implementation Plan that relies on a selective inspection and maintenance program. States that such program should focus on how best to locate and repair that proportion of the fleet that causes the majority of pollution. Declares that States should adopt the most cost-effective method of locating and fixing gross polluters. States that EPA regulations under such Act should provide that States that opt for a selective program will receive credits that are no less than the actual pollution reduction achieved by such a program and that they may rely on actual data accumulated during the program in determining the reduction achieved. Declares that such regulations should require States to compile information gained through methods of on-road testing and that an individual panel of experts should evaluate such information to report on emission status and trends and the effectiveness of vehicle emission control activities and make recommendations to correct deficiencies and enhance capabilities of EPA's mobile source emission models."
