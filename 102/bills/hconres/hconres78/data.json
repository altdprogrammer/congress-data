Declares that the trade policy of the President and the Congress shall address the discrepancy between the open capital markets of the United States and the virtually closed markets of Japan. States that one indication of the openness of Japanese capital markets is the degree to which Americans may exercise significant shareholder rights through membership on corporate boards of directors."
