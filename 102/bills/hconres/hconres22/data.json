Urges Suriname's military to return power to the duly constituted government because of lack of credibility in the promised election to be held within 100 days. Calls upon the Secretary of State to: (1) bring about an immediate cessation of all forms of foreign assistance to Suriname until constitutional democracy is restored; (2) request international financial institutions to terminate funding activities with Suriname until constitutional democracy is restored; (3) utilize the U.S. membership in the Organization of American States, the United Nations, and other international organizations to condemn the military authority in Suriname for its flagrant violation of the principles of constitutional democracy and urge their immediate restoration; and (4) cooperate with other governments in multilateral appeals structured to focus world attention on the situation in Suriname."
