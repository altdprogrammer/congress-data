Calls on the President to: (1) restate the United States' long-standing non-recognition of the annexation of the Baltic nations and support for the principle of self-determination for the Baltic peoples; and (2) pursue official recognition of the independent and democratically- elected governments of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Calls on the President of the Soviet Union to resolve the issues of independence for the Baltic nations through peaceful means."
