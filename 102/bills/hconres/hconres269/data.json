Commends the President and executive branch officials for their involvement in key diplomatic initiatives within the UN and their commitment in their bilateral relations to achieve a free and fair referendum for self-determination in the Western Sahara. Calls upon: (1) Morocco and the Polisario Front to comply with the terms of the peace plan as endorsed by the UN Security Council; and (2) the President to continue the current U.S. policy of advocacy of the peace plan, support the efforts of the UN Secretary General to ensure that independent international observers be allowed to monitor the referendum until its results have been published, and encourage the Secretary General to take appropriate steps to ensure that the Security Council will take firm action in the event of any failure to comply with, or attempt to delay, the peace plan. Expects all parties to respect the results of the referendum if independence is the decision."
