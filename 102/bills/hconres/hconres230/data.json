Urges that the Secretary General give high priority to environmental damages as a category of claims and provide a special allocation for this category in the UN Compensation Fund, not subject to limits for individual claimants, and that this allocation: (1) comprise at least 25 percent of the portion of the fund available for payment to claimants under a specified UN resolution; (2) include funds for consolidated claims and reimbursement to various governmental and private organizations for expedited damage assessments to the environment and public health as a result of the oil fires and slick; (3) provide for reimbursement of cleanup and restoration costs; and (4) be subject to periodic review."
