Urges the Government of China to take constructive steps to reduce tensions in regional military conflicts by restricting the transfer of conventional weapons, working toward the creation of a multilateral conventional arms transfer and control regime, agreeing not to transfer weapons of mass destruction, and agreeing to multilateral controls on the transfer of ballistic missiles and the technology associated with the development of such weapons and delivery systems."
