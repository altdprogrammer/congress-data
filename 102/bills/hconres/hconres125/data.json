Security Council Resolution 678, which authorizes the use of force to restore international peace and security in the area. Commends the President for his ability to unite and mobilize the community of nations through the U.N. Security Council, providing the leadership necessary to overturn the Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait. Urges the President to mobilize the international community through the Security Council to achieve a resolution demanding the expeditious replacement of Hussein as military and political leader of Iraq."
