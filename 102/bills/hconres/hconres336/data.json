Urges the President to: (1) respond to President Yeltsin's initiative to deactivate SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles by taking parallel actions with U.S. strategic forces; (2) seek agreement with the Russian Federation to proceed with the mutual destruction of highly MIRVed land-based missiles as a first priority as soon as technically feasible; (3) consider parallel initiatives to accelerate the reduction of nuclear warheads on submarine-launched missiles; and (4) fully use funds provided by the Congress to assist in destruction or elimination of strategic nuclear arms in Russia and request any additional funds which may be required to secure the reduction of Russian nuclear force levels to those called for by the Joint Understanding by the year 2000."
