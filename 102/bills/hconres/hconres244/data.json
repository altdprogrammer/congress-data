Declares that the United States should encourage: (1) both Koreas to reach a comprehensive peace treaty and nonaggression pact; (2) North Korea to cease all exports of advanced missile systems, release all political prisoners, and begin major economic and political reform; and (3) the Government of South Korea to abolish its National Security Law, release all political prisoners, keep informed and consult with the opposition party, churches, and student groups in reunification efforts, and consider a process of reunification based on peaceful coexistence, exchanges, and unification."
