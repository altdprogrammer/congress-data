Expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States should support: (1) international and national programs aimed at encouraging a global transition to environmentally sustainable energy systems; (2) new programs and institutions to help developing countries become more energy efficient and otherwise increase their capacity for acquiring and using technology to make their economies more environmentally sustainable; (3) global goals of slowing deforestation of primary forests, increasing worldwide forest cover, and preserving a specified amount of mature forests; (4) improved national forests strategies that integrate all policy issues related to the loss of forests and eliminate economic incentives for deforestation; (5) the development of a new international agreement to eliminate land-based sources of marine pollution and cooperative efforts to address these sources of pollution at the regional level; (6) a process of international consultations aimed at identifying ways that poverty can be alleviated and natural resources better conserved through reduction of developing country debt burdens; and (7) the development of a timetable for industrialized nations and the United Nations to adopt a reformed system of national accounting that would reflect full environmental and social costs."
