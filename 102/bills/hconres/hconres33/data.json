Authorizes the continued use of American military force to enforce the United Nations economic embargo against Iraq, to defend Saudi Arabia from direct Iraqi attack, and to protect American forces in the region. Pledges continued support for sustaining the policy of increasing economic and diplomatic pressure against Iraq, maintaining military options, and seeking to increase the military and financial contributions made by allied nations. Declares that: (1) the Constitution requires the President to obtain authorization from the Congress before initiating new offensive military action or waging war against Iraq or Iraqi forces; and (2) the Congress does not rule out the enactment at a later time of a declaration of war or other congressional authorization for the use of force. Sets forth priority procedures for, and commits the House leadership to, swift consideration of any presidential request to authorize the use of force against Iraq."
