Calls upon such Government to: (1) abide by its international obligations and the Mauritanian constitution to protect the rights of all Mauritanians; (2) permit an impartial investigation by independent Mauritanian organizations into the death in detention of hundreds of black Mauritanians and to bring those responsible to justice; (3) permit international human rights and humanitarian organizations to conduct fact-finding missions to Mauritania; and (4) take immediate steps to enforce Mauritanian law and end the practice of slavery. Welcomes: (1) recent actions by such Government, including the amnesty and release in April 1991 of hundreds of political prisoners; (2) President Taya's announcement on April 15, 1991, promising legislative elections and allowing political parties to be formed; and (3) the diminution of tensions between Senegal and Mauritania. Commends the U.S. Department of State for its thorough reporting on human rights abuses in Mauritania in the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1990. Calls upon the President to convey U.S. concern about human rights violations in Mauritania by: (1) publicly condemning human rights abuses; (2) encouraging the appointment of a special rapporteur on Mauritania at the United Nations Human Rights Commission; (3) opposing loans to Mauritania in the World Bank and the African Development Fund (except for loans to meet basic human needs); and (4) encouraging the Governments of France, Spain, and Germany to oppose such loans to Mauritania and to limit assistance to Mauritania to humanitarian assistance provided through private voluntary organizations."
