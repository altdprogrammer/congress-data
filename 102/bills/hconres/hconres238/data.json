Calls upon: (1) President Mobutu to step down and permit the transitional government to return the country to democratic rule; and (2) the Administration to urge that an international peacekeeping force be brought into Zaire to ensure stability during the political transition process and to express its willingness to offer assistance in implementing any future international peacekeeping arrangement. Supports the aspirations of the Zairean people for democratic change, particularly the convocation of a sovereign national conference. Urges such conference, as soon as possible after its convocation, to form a transitional government which would organize free and democratic elections. Invites the international community to express concerns with respect to the repression and corruption of the Mobutu regime and to provide support to the Zairean democratic forces' desire for peaceful change."
