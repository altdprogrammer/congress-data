    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Government and people of the United States unequivocally support the right of the people of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia to independence and democracy; and (2) the Soviet Union should immediately cease all hostilities against the Baltic people, remove their troops from Baltic facilities and government buildings, and initiate good faith negotiations with the democratically-elected Baltic governments regarding the restoration of independence to the Baltic countries. Specifies that, until such time as the President certifies to the Congress that the Soviet Union has taken such actions: (1) the Export-Import Bank of the United States may not issue, or make any payment on, any insurance, reinsurance, or guarantee with respect to the financing of exports to the Soviet Union; (2) the Soviet Union should not be eligible to receive nondiscriminatory (most favored nation) trade treatment from the United States; (3) the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the U.S. executive directors to the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to oppose any grant of special association status to the Soviet Union in such institutions; and (4) the United States shall oppose any waiver of restrictions of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development applicable to financing within the Soviet Union. Requires the President to: (1) redirect any Commodity Credit Corporation agricultural credits extended to the Soviet Union away from the central Soviet Government and into the Baltic States and those Soviet republics which are seeking such direct assistance; (2) provide emergency medical assistance to the people of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia channeled through appropriate private voluntary organizations; and (3) request that the recent issue of Soviet aggression against the Baltic people be raised in the United Nations. Urges the President to open closer diplomatic ties with the democratically-elected Governments of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia to pave the way for official U.S. recognition of such Governments."
