Urges the President to take steps to achieve such initiative and to negotiate such agreement or agreements with equitable terms under which designated forces from various countries, including the United States, would be available to the Security Council. Urges the President to consult with the foreign affairs and defense committees of the Congress in the course of negotiating such an agreement. Expresses the intent of the Congress to give prompt consideration to any such agreement negotiated. Affirms the principle embodied in the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 that, upon congressional approval of such an agreement, the President shall be authorized to direct that the U.S. armed forces designated in the agreement be employed as necessary to support decisions of the Security Council."
