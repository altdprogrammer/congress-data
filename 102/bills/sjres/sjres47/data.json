Requires the Congress to: (1) approve a proposed balanced budget for each fiscal year; and (2) adopt measures necessary to assure that fiscal year appropriations do not exceed revenues. Permits any bill that would cause a violation of this latter requirement to become law only if passed by two-thirds of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Authorizes a waiver of these provisions during times of declared national emergency."
