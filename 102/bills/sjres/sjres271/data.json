Praises the presidents of Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, and Senegal for their efforts. Authorizes the President to provide assistance to support democratic institutions in Liberia, for the resettlement of refugees, for the demobilization and retraining of troops, and for the provision of other assistance to implement such accord, if the President certifies that Liberia has made significant progress toward democratization and that such assistance will aid that country in making further progress and is otherwise in the U.S. national interest. Requires a separate certification for each fiscal year."
