Prohibits Federal outlays from exceeding estimated receipts in a fiscal year, and prohibits any increase in the public debt limit, unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress provide for a specific excess of outlays, or for an increase, by rollcall vote. Requires the President to transmit to the Congress before each fiscal year a proposed Federal budget in which total outlays do not exceed total receipts. Prohibits any bill to increase revenue from becoming law unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each House by rollcall vote. Provides for waiver of this Amendment for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect. Declares that Federal receipts exclude those derived from borrowing and that Federal outlays exclude those for repayment of debt principal."
