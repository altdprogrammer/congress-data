    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1991-01-14", 
    "text": "Expresses U.S. policy: (1) to maintain a strong military establishment to protect this nation from military attack; (2) to rely first on the moral force of a united world embodied in the United Nations (UN), using its military might to assure compliance with noncombatant UN sanctions, and resorting to war only as a last resort; (3) to take all corrective action necessary to redress, rectify, or prevent: occupation and seizure of another nation by military aggression; an aggressor nation profiting from its aggression; hostage taking; the violation of foreign embassies; the manufacture or possession of weapons of mass destruction prohibited by treaty, by the norms of decency, or by UN declaration; the assumption of authoritarian governmental powers; and any other actions threatening the stability and peace of a neighboring state or region; and (4) that its first response to such violations shall be the isolation of the offending nation by the unilateral imposition of sanctions and by the promotion of similar sanctions by the UN. Approves and reconfirms the conditions imposed by the UN for the lifting of the embargo against Iraq (i.e., the freeing of all hostages, the complete removal of the Iraqi presence in Kuwait, the restoration of the legitimate Kuwait Government, and the return of compensation for all Kuwaiti property appropriated, damaged, or destroyed). Urges adoption by the UN of two additional conditions: (1) that the Iraqi Government destroy all chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and all means of manufacturing such weapons and agree to UN on-site verification; and (2) that the independence of the Iraqi parliament be restored and free elections be monitored by the UN. Declares that the Congress has the exclusive responsibility under the Constitution to declare war and that offensive Iraqi military action against Iraq is clearly \"war\" as contemplated by the Constitution. Directs that the authorities exercised by the President in carrying out the UN embargo against Iraq (as an alternative to the use of offensive military force) remain in force until full compliance by Iraq with UN Security Council resolutions, or until at least January 1, 1992, whichever comes first. Prohibits offensive military action against Iraq before January 1, 1992, unless Iraq takes significant military or other action that endangers the lives of residents or troops in other countries. Requires that, in the event of Iraqi noncompliance by such date, the policy regarding the use of military force be reevaluated by the U.S. Government in concert with the UN Security Council."
