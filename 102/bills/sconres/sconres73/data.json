Recognizes UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar's efforts in negotiating the terms of the peace plan adopted by the UN relating to the Western Sahara. Calls upon Morocco and the Polisario Front to comply with the terms of the peace plan as endorsed by the UN Security Council. Calls upon the President to: (1) continue strong advocacy of the peace plan; (2) ensure that independent international observers be allowed to monitor the referendum until its results have been published; and (3) take steps to ensure that the UN Security Council takes firm action in the event of any failure to comply with, or attempt to delay, the peace plan."
