Condemns: (1) the arrest and detention of Burmese citizens for the peaceful expression of their political views; and (2) such Government's disregard of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Urges: (1) the President to impose additional economic sanctions upon Burma pursuant to the Customs and Trade Act of 1990; (2) the United States to affirm its support for the resettlement of Burmese asylum seekers; and (3) the Government of Thailand to accord all displaced Burmese temporary safe haven, protection against return of those who might face persecution, and access to procedures for third country resettlement for those Burmese refugees who are without safe and reasonable alternatives."
