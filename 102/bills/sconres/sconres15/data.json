Expresses the sense of the Congress that such cooperation should include \"national treatment\" for private direct investors, an undertaking to keep any protection of new industries as small and as brief as possible, and an agreement to listen attentively to OECD advice in the selection of new industrial or commercial projects, in the general management of the Third World nation's economy, and in the reassessment of its comparative advantages."
