    "text": "Establishes the congressional budget for FY 1993 and sets forth appropriate budgetary levels for FY 1994 through 1997. Sets forth recommended budgetary levels of Federal revenues, new budget authority, budget outlays, deficits, public debt, and credit activity. Sets forth the amounts of increase in the public debt subject to limitation, the balances of the Federal retirement trust funds, and revenues and outlays of the Social Security trust funds for FY 1993 through 1997. Specifies the funding of major functional categories. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Government should sell assets to nongovernment buyers; and (2) amounts realized from such sales will not recur on an annual basis and do not reduce the demand for credit. Allows budget authority and outlay allocations for legislation that increases funding for certain purposes when legislation has been reported that will, if enacted, reduce other funding by an equal or excess amount. Describes such purposes as funding: (1) to improve the health and nutrition of children and to provide for services to protect children and strengthen families; (2) for economic growth initiatives for unemployment compensation and related programs; (3) to make continuing improvements in ongoing health care programs or to begin phasing-in health insurance coverage for all Americans; and (4) to improve educational opportunities for individuals at the early childhood, elementary, secondary, or higher education levels, or to invest in America's children. Requires in the Senate an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members to: (1) waive or suspend the maximum deficit amount point of order of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974; or (2) sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under such maximum deficit amount point of order. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Committees on the Budget be required to use the Congressional Budget Office or Office of Management and Budget set of economic forecasts with the lower real gross domestic product growth forecast for FY 1993 and future budget years."
