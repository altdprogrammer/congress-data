Urges the President to support: (1) an international convention to reduce the threat of global climatic change; (2) the development of a global strategy and action plan to conserve biological diversity; (3) principles that provide for the international protection, growth, and sustainable use of mature forests; (4) the creation of an International Northern Forests Organization (to study the linkages among international trade in forest products, the management of northern forests, and the regional and global environment in order to assist member countries in the development of sustainable forest management policies); (5) policies and agreements that encourage the development of renewable sources of energy and energy-efficient technology with priority to developing more efficient transportation systems; (6) the implementation of the Montreal Guidelines for Protection of Marine Environment Against Pollution from Land-Based Sources; (7) programs to ensure the efficient and equitable use of fresh water resources with priority to the promotion of water conservation and demand management programs; (8) the acceleration of international efforts to reduce the emission of and phase out chemicals that deplete the ozone layer; (9) efforts to strengthen the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Shipments of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal; (10) voluntary measures for financing UNCED agenda initiatives that integrate environmental projects and considerations with comprehensive developmental goals and that meet the concerns of developing countries; (11) new voluntary multilateral measures to provide assistance for global environmental protection activities in developing countries; (12) a process for international consultation for identifying methods of conserving natural resources and reducing the debt burden of developing countries; (13) initiatives to strengthen the ability of the United Nations and its agencies to assist the world community in developing and implementing agreements that serve the goals of UNCED; (14) the development of a reform system of national accounting that reflects full environmental costs; and (15) the international recognition of the right of the general public to be informed of, and participate in, decision making that affects the environment and the use of natural resources. Calls on the President to recognize June 5, 1992, as World Environment Day. Declares that the President should not support any action or undertake any commitment pursuant to this Act that would adversely affect the competitiveness of American industry or that would result in a net long-term loss of American jobs."
