    "text": "Establishes the congressional budget for FY 1992, and sets forth appropriate budgetary levels for FY 1993 through 1996. Sets forth recommended budgetary levels of Federal revenues, new budget authority, budget outlays, deficits, public debt, and credit activity. Sets forth the amounts of increase in the public debt subject to limitation, the balances of the Federal retirement trust funds, and revenues and outlays of the Social Security trust funds for FY 1992 through 1996. Specifies the funding of major functional categories. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Government should sell assets to nongovernment buyers; and (2) amounts realized from such sales will not recur on an annual basis and do not reduce the demand for credit. Declares that, for certain allocations and points of order under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the levels of Social Security outlays and revenues for this resolution shall be the current services levels. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Government should not enact major spending or revenue changes to the Social Security system without a debate of the budgetary consequences of such changes in the context of the concurrent resolution on the budget; and (2) the Congress should not enact major reductions in Social Security revenues unless the current actuarial estimates of Social Security trust funds over the next 75 years indicate the trust funds are actuarially sound. Allows increases in funding for certain purposes when legislation has been reported that will, if enacted, reduce other funding by an equal or excess amount. Describes such purposes as funding: (1) to improve the health and nutrition of children and to provide for services to protect children and strengthen families; (2) for economic recovery initiatives for unemployment compensation and related programs; (3) to make continuing improvements in ongoing health care programs or to begin phasing-in health insurance coverage for all Americans; (4) to expand access to early childhood development services for low-income pre-schoolers; and (5) to increase funding for surface transportation. Expresses the sense of the Congress that if a surtax on the income of millionaires is enacted, then the revenue generated by such surtax will be used to offset a commensurate increase in direct tax assistance to families, which will include increasing dependent exemptions and tax credits for children. Expresses the sense of the Congress that, within discretionary allocations in this budget, the Committees on Appropriations should: (1) consider proposals to terminate substandard and inefficient project% and programs in 1992; (2) reduce the Federal investment in outdated projects and programs; and (3) reallocate those resources to higher-priority discretionary programs and projects. Expresses the sense of the Congress that legislation should be enacted to provide a wiser, more fair and more equitable distribution of Federal benefits. Declares that subsidies to the wealthiest segments of our society should be either redirected to provide more assistance to the poor and underprivileged, or applied to further deficit reduction. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) veterans' programs are a top national priority, particularly in the area of medical care, and that congressional appropriations committees should give such programs maximum consideration; and (2) the limits on the estate size of incompetent veterans without dependents under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 may be inconsistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act (Pub. L. 101-336) and therefore discriminatory. Declares that the committees of jurisdiction should consider modifying such provisions on a deficit-neutral basis. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the congressional budget committees in conjunction with the administration and the bipartisan leadership should explore and develop a comprehensive, multiyear plan for further reductions in the deficit that would be considered by the Congress next year. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the transportation trust fund should be excluded from the deficit."
