    "text": "Establishes a process to allow the President ten days to review draft conference reports on appropriations for FY 1993 through 1995 and make changes in individual items of appropriations. Requires the President to sign such legislation when it is officially submitted if: (1) the Congress votes on each individual item that has been changed; and (2) the legislation is identical to that originally reviewed except for proposed changes that the Congress fails to disapprove. Establishes a procedure for the Congress, if the President exercises such authority, to vote to approve or disapprove each changed item as an amendment in disagreement. Amends the Standing Rules of the Senate and the Rules of the House of Representatives to establish a question hour devoted to questioning the President and a designated cabinet officer. Declares that the President may review appropriations legislation as provided under this Act only if the President is participating in the question hours."
