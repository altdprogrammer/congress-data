Sets forth authorities with respect to the issuance of bonds to be sold at prices determined by the Commission. Provides that toll rates for bridge use shall be adjusted to provide funds for: (1) a reasonable reserve or allowance for bridge maintenance and repair; (2) the improvement and expansion of bridges; (3) deposit to a sinking fund to pay interest and principal on bonds; (4) the price of bonds redeemed or repurchased before maturity; and (5) other amounts required to be paid or deposited by agreement with bondholders or specified providers of contracts or arrangements. Applies the remainder of tolls to extraordinary capital costs incurred in connection with the bridges and to the redemption of bonds or payment of other costs in connection with such contracts or agreements. Deems the Commission to be a public authority of the State of New York for purposes of Federal law. Removes a provision concerning the taxation of bondholders. Entitles Commission members to compensation for official duties."
