Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director, to study and report to the Congress on the potential impacts to the Park and Preserve caused by the proposed mine development in British Columbia. Directs the Secretary of State to seek the agreement of the Canadian Government that the International Joint Commission be referred, pursuant to a specified Treaty, to: (1) examine comprehensively the potential adverse environmental and social impacts of the proposed mining activity; and (2) issue no permits required to develop such project before completion of such study. Requires the Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of State, to seek the cooperation of the Canadian Government to obtain World Heritage Site status and protection for the entire Alsek and Tatshenshini River watershed."
