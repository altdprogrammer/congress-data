Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to ensure that: (1) telephone service providers in the United States adopt flexible billing procedures and policies in connection with the costs incurred by such members and their families for calls to and from the Persian Gulf region; and (2) families of such members will not have their telephone service cut off due to their inability to pay for such calls. Provides that long distance service providers in the United States should file special reduced rates for such calls with the FCC for immediate consideration."
