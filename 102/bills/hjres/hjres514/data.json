Provides that the Department of the Treasury, including the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board, should: (1) undertake measures to ensure that their policies, bank examination practices, and regulations identify those which may adversely affect the availability of credit with respect to the needs of farmers, agriculture, and small businesses; and (2) modify those which have been determined to threaten or adversely affect the availability of commercial credit in order to stimulate speedy and robust economic recovery. Directs such entities to: (1) establish internal mechanisms by which adversely affected lenders and potential borrowers may administratively appeal certain decisions of bank examiners or local regulatory officials; and (2) report to the Congress on legislative recommendations to assure the availability of commercial credit to promote economic recovery."
