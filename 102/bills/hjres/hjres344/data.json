Directs the United States to: (1) lead in efforts to establish such a regime; (2) seek to establish an international right of inspection no less stringent than that set forth in the Agreement Between the United States of America and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards in the United States; and (3) seek to ensure that such a regime provides for multilateral sanctions against foreign countries and persons that violate the regime that are no less stringent than those set forth in Executive Order 12735 (regarding chemical and biological weapons proliferation). Specifies that such a regime should include adequate provisions for verification and enforcement. Sets forth reporting requirements."
