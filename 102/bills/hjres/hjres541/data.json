Recognizes and commends efforts of reconciliation initiated by the State of Hawaii and the United Church of Christ with Native Hawaiians. Apologizes to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for such illegal overthrow and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination. Expresses the commitment of the Congress to acknowledge the ramifications of such illegal overthrow in order to provide a foundation for reconciliation between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people. Urges the President to also acknowledge the ramifications and to support reconciliation efforts."
