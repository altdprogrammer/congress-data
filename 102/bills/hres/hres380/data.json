Calls upon the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to work to improve screening procedures in place in Hong Kong and other first asylum states in Southeast Asia, including the special procedures for unaccompanied minors. Urges: (1) the United Kingdom to end the forced repatriation of Vietnamese asylum seekers; and (2) the Department of State to ensure that U.S. contributions to the UNHCR are properly monitored and used toward protecting Vietnamese boat people against flawed screening."
