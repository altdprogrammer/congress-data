Applies such waiver to resolutions providing for the consideration or disposition of: (1) a general appropriation bill (including an amendment or conference report); (2) a conference report (including an amendment reported from conference in disagreement); or (3) a joint resolution making continuing appropriations for FY 1993 (including an amendment or conference report). Makes it in order at any time for the remainder of the second session of the 102d Congress to consider a conference report and any amendment reported from conference in disagreement on the same day reported or any day thereafter if copies of the conference report and accompanying statement, together with the text of any amendment reported from conference in disagreement, have been made available to Members for at least two hours before the beginning of such consideration. Makes it in order for the remainder of the second session of the 102d Congress for the Speaker of the House to: (1) entertain motions to suspend the rules, providing an announcement has been made at least two hours before the consideration of such a motion; and (2) declare recesses subject to the call of the Chair."
