Amends rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit the expenditure of appropriated funds to defray expenses of committee members or employees incurred while traveling outside of the United States, its territories, or possessions, unless a committee resolution as been approved that authorizes such travel and sets forth certain requirements."
