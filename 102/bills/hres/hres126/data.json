Encourages Turkey and Iran to continue their assistance to the Kurds and other Iraqi refugees. Pledges U.S. assistance to international relief efforts to aid the refugee populations. Calls for sustained humanitarian relief for the refugees. Urges the President to continue his efforts to win international support for those fleeing Iraqi repression and to press the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council to adopt effective measures to assist Iraqi refugees and to enforce the demand that Iraq immediately end its repression of the Kurds and other Iraqi civilians. Urges that the costs of the provision of immediate, urgent assistance to the Kurds and other Iraqi refugees which are not covered by voluntary contributions from participating nations be paid by the Government of Iraq through the reparations accounting procedures established under terms of the U.N. ceasefire agreement with Iraq."
