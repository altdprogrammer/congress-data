Urges the President to seek international agreement on: (1) reaffirming the right of all refugees to return to their former residences and to receive appropriate compensation; (2) to the extent consistent with international law, authorizing the use of seized assets of the former Yugoslav Government to assist the international relief effort; and (3) declaring null and void any documents signed under duress which transfer property of members of one ethnic group to members or organizations of another ethnic group."
