Expresses the House of Representatives' continued condemnation of the Burmese military regime, and support for Kyi and the Burmese people in their struggle for peaceful and democratic change. Urges the Government of the People's Republic of China to suspend all economic aid and transfers of military supplies to Burma until Kyi and all other prisoners of conscience are released, martial law is lifted, and the results of the May 1990 elections are implemented. Welcomes the Administration's efforts to promote human rights in Burma, and calls upon the President and the Secretary of State to: (1) encourage the restoration of democracy and to condemn human rights violations in Burma; (2) advocate the immediate and unconditional release of Kyi and all other prisoners of conscience; (3) impose additional economic sanctions on Burma; (4) call privately and publicly for an end to China's military transfers and economic aid to Burma and advise its Government that a willingness to end such support will play an important role in the development of U.S. relations with it; and (5) promote multilateral efforts, including an international arms embargo and economic sanctions, to encourage the military regime to bring its practices into conformity with internationally recognized human rights standards. Encourages a decision to invite Kyi to address a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress."
