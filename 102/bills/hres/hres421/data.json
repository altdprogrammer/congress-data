    "text": "Bring Democracy to Congress Resolution of 1992 - Amends rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit a member from serving on any particular committee for more than eight years or as committee chairman for more than four years. Disregards: (1) service performed as a member of such committee for less than a full session in any Congress; and (2) previous service on any committee before the beginning of the 103d Congress. Requires the membership of each committee (except the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct), subcommittee, task force, or other subunit, to reflect the ratio of majority to minority party Members of the House at the beginning of the Congress. Exempts the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico and the Delegates to the House from the count in determining such ratio. Requires the membership of each select committee, subcommittee, task force, subunit, or conference committee to reflect the ratio of the majority to minority party Members of the House at the time of appointment. Amends rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives to make it out of order to consider any resolution providing for the consideration of a measure otherwise subject to amendment under House rules if such resolution limits the right of Members to offer germane amendments to such measure, unless the chairman of the Rules Committee has previously announced that less than an open amendment process might be recommended by the Committee for the consideration of such measure and the resolution is approved by at least two-thirds of voting members. Amends rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives to make it out of order to consider any order of business resolution which provides that, upon adoption, the House shall be considered to have automatically adopted a motion, amendment, or resolution, or to have passed a bill, joint resolution, or conference report, unless consideration of such resolution is agreed to by at least two-thirds of the members voting. Amends rule XV of the Rules of the House of Representatives to provide for an automatic roll call vote when the Speaker puts the question upon final passage of: (1) any bill, joint resolution, or conference report making general appropriations, providing revenue, or adjusting the statutory congressional pay rate; or (2) any concurrent resolution on the budget or conference report thereon that provides an increase in the statutory debt limit. Amends rule XXVII of the Rules of the House of Representatives to require the signature of one-third of the membership (currently, a majority) before a discharge petition may be entered on the Journal. Declares that it is the policy of the House of Representatives that the following Federal laws should be amended to apply to the House in the same or similar manner as they apply to the Executive branch: (1) the National Labor Relations Act; (2) the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970; (3) the Equal Pay Act of 1963; (4) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; (5) the Freedom of Information Act; (6) the Privacy Act of 1974; (7) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1974; and (8) provisions of the Federal judicial code relating to an independent counsel. Directs the standing committees of the House with subject jurisdiction over such Federal laws to report legislation to the House to implement such policy. Provides for consideration of such legislation. Amends rule XLVI of the Rules of the House of Representatives to repeal mandated provisions allowing a Member to mail franked mass mailings."
