Directs the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to determine an appropriate charge for issuing a check drawn on such bank with insufficient funds, based on the average amount charged by financial institutions in similar cases (but at least $25 per check), notify each Member subject to such charges, and require the Members involved to pay such amount to the Clerk of the House for deposit in the Treasury as a miscellaneous receipt. Specifies that any failure to pay an amount owed under this Act shall be a matter for consideration in accordance with the Rules of the House."
