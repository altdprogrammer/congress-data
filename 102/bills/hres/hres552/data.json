    "text": "Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the President should immediately call for an emergency meeting of the United Nations (UN) Security Council to authorize all necessary means, including the use of military force, to implement a UN-sponsored effort to provide humanitarian relief to civilians in Bosnia-Hercegovina and a UN-sponsored plan to place heavy weapons belonging to all factions there under UN supervision. Urges the Security Council, during such meeting to: (1) consider the means by which the UN and International Red Cross personnel shall be granted access to refugee and prisoner of war camps in all of the republics of the former Yugoslavia; (2) review the effects on Bosnia-Hercegovina of the arms embargo imposed on all states in the former Yugoslavia and determine whether the termination or suspension of the application of that resolution to Bosnia-Hercegovina could result in increased security for the civilian population of that country; and (3) determine how to convene a tribunal to investigate allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed within the territory of the former Yugoslavia and to accumulate evidence, charge, and prepare the basis for trying individuals believed to have committed such crimes. Declares that the Congress should promptly consider any authorization requested by the President for any use of U.S. military forces pursuant to UN authorization."
