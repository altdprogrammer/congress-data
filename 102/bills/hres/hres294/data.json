Applies such waiver to resolutions providing for consideration or disposition of certain bills or joint resolutions to: (1) develop a national intermodal surface transportation system and authorize funds for the construction of highways, highway safety programs and for mass transit programs; (2) require the least-cost resolution of insured depository institutions, improve supervision and examination, and provide additional resources to the Bank Insurance Fund; (3) control and prevent crime; (4) provide for the termination of the application of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 to Czechoslovakia and Hungary; (5) make technical corrections in the enrollment of certain FY 1991 appropriations Acts; (6) delay until September 30, 1992, the issuance of any regulations by the Secretary of Health and Human Services changing the treatment of voluntary contributions and provider-specific taxes by States as a source of a State's expenditures for which Federal financial participation is available under the Medicaid program and to maintain the treatment of intergovernmental transfers as such a source; and (7) provide funding for the Resolution Trust Corporation. Authorizes the Speaker of the House, through November 27, 1991, to declare recesses at any time, and to entertain motions to suspend the rules, providing an announcement has been made at least one hour before the consideration of such a motion."
