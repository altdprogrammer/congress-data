Requires the Sergeant at Arms to collect the 41 rolls of microfilm sought by the subpoena and to reproduce them in documentary form. Requires the Sergeant at Arms to obtain a determination from the U.S. District Court of the enforceability of such subpoena (including its materiality and relevance) to notify the House upon receipt of such determination, and to comply with the subpoena consistent with the Court's determination. Declares that the House relies upon the assurances of the special counsel to take necessary steps to provide full protection for the confidentiality of such records. States that it is the will of the House to maintain such communication and cooperation with the special counsel as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the privileges and rights of the House and its Members."
