Commends: (1) the decision of DOJ to undertake such an investigation; and (2) police officers who uphold the law in exercising their responsibilities and whose practices toward individuals in police custody are humane. Urges: (1) full prosecution and the removal from service of police officers who engage in police brutality in violation of Federal, State, and local law; and (2) police departments to develop policies and procedures to guide officers in the proper use of force, to reduce the police brutality that occurs after individuals are in police custody, and to develop approaches for fostering better dialogue between the departments and the communities they serve."
