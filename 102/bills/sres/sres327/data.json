Establishes the Independent Senate Ethics Commission to: (1) receive requests for review of allegations of improper conduct that may reflect upon the Senate such as a violation of law, a violation of the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or a violation of a Senate rule or regulation relating to the conduct of a person in the performance of his or her duties as a Member, officer, or Senate employee; (2) make informal preliminary inquiries in response to such requests; (3) submit a report to the Senate if a formal investigation is not warranted as a result of such inquiries; and (4) conduct a formal investigation if there is substantial credible evidence that improper conduct or a violation has occurred and, in view of the seriousness of the allegation and other relevant considerations, a full investigation of the alleged misconduct or violation is warranted. Authorizes the Commission to appoint a special counsel to assist in conducting formal investigations. Authorizes a Member of the Senate to introduce a resolution proposing that the Senate adopt the report of the Commission with or without modification and impose an appropriate sanction."
