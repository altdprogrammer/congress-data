Calls on the Government of Albania to promptly complete a full and objective investigation of the April 2 killings in Shkoder and to deal appropriately with those found responsible. Regrets that the organization and conduct of the campaign preceding the March 31 election did not permit opposition political parties to compete fairly with the governing Party of Labor. Commends the President for his decision to reestablish full diplomatic relations with Albania. Urges him to utilize this new relationship to: (1) encourage a dialogue between the Government and the opposition regarding the future of the country; and (2) urge the Government to honor its expressed commitments to make political and market-oriented economic reforms and to meet European political and human rights standards. Expresses the view of the Senate that: (1) the Administration should support Albania's application for membership in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), subject to specified conditions; (2) if Albania becomes a CSCE member, the United States should use the CSCE forum to monitor and encourage Albania's compliance with its CSCE obligations; (3) the United States should be as responsive as possible to Albania's genuine humanitarian needs; (4) other economic assistance and economic relations should be directly related to Albania's progress in making political and economic reforms and in improving its human rights performance; (5) the Administration should encourage and support programs of the National Democratic and Republican Institutes to assist in Albania's democratic development; and (6) the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, or both, should expand Albanian language broadcasting to such country and the U.S. Information Agency should establish a strong information program at the new embassy in Tirana."
