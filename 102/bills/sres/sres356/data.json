Authorizes the Secretary of the Senate to appoint and fix the compensation of each eligible participant selected, for a period determined by the Secretary. Limits to two the number of fellowship participants so employed. Directs the Secretary to place eligible participants in positions in the Senate that are, within practical considerations, supportive of the fellowship participants' areas of expertise. Requires that a limited amount of funds to compensate eligible participants for FY 1993 be paid from the Senate contingent fund. Authorizes appropriations."
