Supports the measures announced by the President on August 6, 1992. Prohibits the introduction of U.S. military personnel into combat or potential combat situations without clearly defined objectives and sufficient resources. Pledges that the Senate shall provide necessary funds for U.S. participation in such humanitarian relief and multilateral force activities, pursuant to UN Security Council mandates consistent with the terms of this Act. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the elections for the President and Parliament of Romania scheduled on September 27, 1992, will be an important measure of Romania's progress toward democracy; (2) such elections should be conducted in a free and fair manner that includes reasonably equal access to the mass media by the major candidates; (3) the Secretary of State should initiate an international effort to ensure that a sufficient number of U.S. and international observers are in Romania to monitor the elections; and (4) consideration of any legislation to grant nondiscriminatory (most-favored-nation) trade status to Romania should be withheld until the Secretary has certified to the Senate that the elections in Romania are conducted in a free and fair manner."
