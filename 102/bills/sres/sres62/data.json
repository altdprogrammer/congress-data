Authorizes the transfer of any unexpended balance of any committee to a special reserve to assist such committee during the transition to a biennial budget. Earmarks a minimum amount to be reserved for each Committee. Declares that it is the sense of the Senate that each department or agency administering legislation making an authorization or reauthorization of any program where funds are provided by a distribution formula, whenever possible, shall: (1) make available to the Senate an enumeration of funds received by each State under such program in the most recent available fiscal year; or (2) in the case of a new program and if practicable, provide an enumeration of funds which would be available to each State under such program. Directs the Congressional Budget Office to report to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration by May 15, 1991, on an evaluation of the most practicable means of achieving such objectives."
