Declares that it should be U.S. policy to ensure that military and other assistance to the Philippines does not support illegal logging activities undertaken by officials of the Philippine military. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Japanese Government should undertake an investigation through ITTO to determine the amount of illegal tropical timber imported into Japan by individuals and corporations involved in the Philippine tropical timber trade."
