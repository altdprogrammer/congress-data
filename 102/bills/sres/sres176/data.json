Declares that the deteriorating situation in Yugoslavia requires the United States to intensify efforts to resolve the crisis. Commends the European Community (EC) for its efforts to mediate the crisis. Urges: (1) the EC to fully include an Albanian representative from Kosov in the EC-sponsored peace conference; and (2) the Administration to base its policy toward the six republics and two provinces of Yugoslavia on the democratic principles enunciated by the Secretary of State on September 4, 1991, with respect to the Soviet Union, to press for the inclusion of an Albanian representative from Kosovo in the peace conference, and to raise the issue of Serbian Government-sponsored aggression against the Croatian Government, the citizens of the Republic of Croatia, and the Albanians in Kosovo at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe meeting which convened in Moscow on September 10, 1991."
