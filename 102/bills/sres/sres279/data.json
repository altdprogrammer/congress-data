Establishes the Commission on Senate Perquisites. Requires the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate to report to the Commission on: (1) the services and benefits available to Senate members and employees that are not equally available to all other persons or that are available in or near the Senate buildings at below fair market value; and (2) how such services and benefits contribute to the members' and employees' performance of their duties. Requires the Commission, upon receipt of such report, to review the services and benefits provided to Senate members and employees. Directs the Commission to report to the majority and minority leaders of the Senate proposing introduction of a resolution that: (1) describes those benefits and services that may not properly be made available in or near Senate buildings by Government or private sector employees at the expense of Senate members and employees; and (2) directs the appropriate Senate officers to arrange for the provision of such services and benefits at fair market value. Authorizes any Senate member to introduce such a resolution and provides for its consideration. Requires all payments received for such services and benefits provided by Government employees and all rent and other payments received from private contractors that provide such services and benefits to be paid into the deficit reduction account of the Treasury."
