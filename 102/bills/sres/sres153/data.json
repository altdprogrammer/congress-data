Condemns the use of force by the Yugoslav authorities against civilians. Calls for: (1) the United States to use its leadership to ensure that concerns regarding the restoration of political stability in Yugoslavia will not preclude promoting and securing democracy and self-determination; (2) the peaceful resolution of political differences in Yugoslavia and the inclusion of Kosovo and Vojvodina in that process; (3) the President to explore means of increasing direct diplomatic, political, and economic ties with the democratic governments of the republics of Croatia and Slovenia; and (4) the State Department to expand direct contacts with the leaders of the democratic opposition of Kosovo and Vojvodina. Calls: (1) upon the Yugoslav Army to refrain from obstructing the functioning of the democratic Governments of Slovenia and Croatia and the Government of Serbia to cease using force against the Albanian population of Kosovo; and (2) for free and fair elections in the provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. Recommends that the Administration shape its foreign assistance, trade, and technical assistance programs to support the republics of Croatia and Slovenia and the other democratic republics in Yugoslavia and to encourage democracy in the rest of Yugoslavia."
