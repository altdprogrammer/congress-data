    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Provides for the direct election of the President and Vice President of the United States. States that in such an election, a vote may be cast only as a joint vote for the election of two persons (referred to as a \"presidential candidacy\") one of whom has consented that his name appear as candidate for President on the ballot with the name of the other as candidate for Vice President, and the other of whom has consented that his name appear as candidate for Vice President on the ballot with the name of the said candidate for President. Stipulates that if a presidential candidacy receives a plurality of at least 40 percent of the votes cast, the persons comprising such candidacy shall become the President and the Vice-President-elect. Provides that if, after any such election, none of the persons joined as candidates for President and Vice President can be declared elected, the Congress shall assemble in a special joint session to choose, from the two pairs of persons joined as candidates for President and Vice President who received the highest numbers of votes cast in the election, one such pair by ballot. States that the Congress shall by law provide procedures to be followed in consequence of the death or withdrawal of a candidate on or before the date of an election under this article."
