Permits the President to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to prohibit the bringing or the importation into the United States of any or all products which are the growth, produce, or manufacture of any offending country for such duration as he deems appropriate and to the extent that the prohibition imposed pursuant to this Act is sanctioned by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Requires the President in the event he fails to notify the Secretary to notify Congress of his reasons."
