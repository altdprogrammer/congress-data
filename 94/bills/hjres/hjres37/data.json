    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Provides for the nomination of Presidential candidates by direct popular vote at a primary election. Requires that no person shall be a candidate for nomination for President except in the primary of the party of his registered affiliation, and his name shall be on that party's ballot in all the States if he shall have filed a petition at the seat of the Government of the United States with the President of the Senate. States that for the purposes of this article a political party shall be recognized as such if the electors for candidates for President and Vice President of such party received, in any or all of the several States, an aggregate number of votes, equal in number to at least 10 percent of the total number of votes cast throughout the United States for all electors for candidates for President and Vice President in the most recent previous Presidential election. Sets forth procedures governing the primary elections in each State. Provides that the person who shall have received the greatest number of votes cast by the voters of the party of his registered affiliation shall be the official candidate of such party for President throughout the United States, if such number be a plurality amounting to at least 40 percent of the total number of such votes cast. Provides for a run-off election in the event that a candidate of a particular party receives 40 percent of the votes cast. Requires each party to nominate a candidate for Vice President. States that in the event of the death or resignation or disqualification of the official candidate of any political party for President, the person nominated by such political party for Vice President shall resign the vice-presidential nomination and shall be the official candidate of such party for President. Stipulates that the Congress may provide by appropriate legislation for cases in which two or more candidates receive an equal number of votes, and for methods of determining any dispute or controversy that may arise in the counting and canvassing of the votes cast in elections held in accordance with this article."
