Provides that such study, investigation, and review of such programs shall include, but not be limited to: (1) the fiscal status of the trust funds established for the financing of such programs and the adequacy of such trust funds to meet the immediate and long- range financing needs of such programs; (2) the scope of coverage, the adequacy of benefits, and the conditions of qualification for benefits provided by such programs; (3) the impact of such programs on, and their relation to, public assistance programs, nongovernmental pension and insurance programs, other governmental retirement and annuity programs, medical service delivery systems, and national employment practices; (4) the quality of the administration of such programs; and (5) any inequities which affect substantial numbers of individuals who are insured under such programs. Directs that no later than six months after the Commission is initially appointed it shall submit to the President and the Congress a report on the Commission's plans for conducting the study. Specifies that at or before the close of each of the first four years the Commission shall submit to the President and the Congress an annual report on the study and investigation with recommendations. States that the fourth such report shall constitute the final report of the Commission. Stipulates that after such final report the Commission shall cease to exist. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
