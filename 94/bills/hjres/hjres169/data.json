    "text": "Establishes a Commission to be known as the Commission for Re-establishing Constitutional Principles to be composed of 21 members. Sets forth the powers of the commission. Directs the Commission to study the decisions and orders, including dissenting opinions, of the United States Supreme Court and of any other Federal court resulting from such Supreme Court decisions and orders, rendered during the past 12 years to determine: (1) the extent to which such decisions and orders have hindered or prevented Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies from performing their functions and consequently endangered persons and property in the United States and contributed to an increase in violations of law, including mob violence; and (2) the extend to which the United States Supreme Court has unsurped the authority and powers of the legislative and executive branches of the Federal Government granted by the Constitution, including the powers retained to the States and to the people under the Constitution. Requires the Commission to submit a report to the Congress and the President, not later than December 31, 1968, together with recommendations as to such action as may be required to prevent further unsurpation by one branch of the Federal Government of the authority and powers of another."
