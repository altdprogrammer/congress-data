Expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States based businesses involved in the manufacturing, marketing, or selling of infant formula have a responsibility to conduct their overseas activities in ways which do not have adverse effects on the nutritional health and well-being of people in developing nations. Requires the President to conduct a detailed study into the nature, scope, and extent of the effects of infant formula use in developing nations. Provides that the results of such study shall be transmitted to the Congress within a year from the date of enactment of this joint resolution."
