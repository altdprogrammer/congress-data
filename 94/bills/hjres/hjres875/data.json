Provides that the electors assigned to each State with its Senators shall be elected by the people thereof. States that each of the electors apportioned with its Representatives shall be elected by the people of a single- member electoral district formed by the legislature of the State. Requires that each candidate for the office of elector of President and Vice President shall file in writing under oath a declaration of the identity of the persons for whom he will vote for President and Vice President, which declaration shall be binding upon any successor to his office. Provides that the person having the greatest number of electoral votes for President shall be the President, and the person having the greatest number of electoral votes for Vice President shall be the Vice President, if such numbers are a majority of the whole number of electors chosen. States that if no person voted for as President has a majority, then from the persons having the three highest numbers of votes for President, the Senate and House of Representatives together, each member having one vote, shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President."
