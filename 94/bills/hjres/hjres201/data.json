Provides that the joint committee shall make continuing investigations and studies with respect to: (1) the practices and methods used in the executive branch to classify information in the interests of the common defense and security, and (2) suspected uses of such classification procedures within the executive branch for purposes contrary to the public welfare. Authorizes the joint committee to, at such times as it finds classification procedures being used for purposes contrary to the public welfare, initiate such action as it deems appropriate in order to prohibit such misuse; and to publicly disclose any classified information the classification of which the joint committee considers not to be merited in the interests of the common defense and security and the disclosure of which the joint committee considers to be in the public interest. Requires the joint committee to report to the Senate an the House of Representatives; from time to time, the result of its investigations and studies, together with such recommendations as it may deem desirable. Provides that the expenses of the joint committee shall be paid one-half from the contingent fund of the Senate, upon vochers signed by the chairman of the joint committee."
