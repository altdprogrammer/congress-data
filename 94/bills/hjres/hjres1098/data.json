    "text": "Establishes the Hawaiian Native Claims Settlement Study Commission. Describes the Commission's organizational structure, states the membership qualifications, and specifies the powers granted to its Chairman. Authorizes each Federal department, agency, and instrumentality to furnish the Commission such data, reports, information and other resources as the Chairman of the Commission may request. Sets forth the goals of the Commission, which include studying the needs and concerns of the Hawaiian natives, the nature of any wrongs committed against them, and the extent of their injuries. Requires a report to be filed by the Commission to Congress which provides recommendation for remedies. Declares that any such recommendations shall, to the extent possible, insure that any such remedy (1) will be a final settlement which extinguishes all claims of Hawaiian natives against the United States arising from the actions set forth in the preamble of this resolution; (2) will be capable of prompt implementation with a minimum of litigation; (3) will be in conformity with the real economic and social needs of the Hawaiian natives; (5) will not create a wardship or trusteeship; (6) will not replace or diminish any right, privilege, or obligation of the Hawaiian natives as citizens of the United States or the State of Hawaii; and (7) will not relieve, replace, or diminish any obligation of the United States or the State of Hawaii to protect and promote the rights and welfare of Hawaiian natives as citizens of the United States or Hawaii. States that no provision of this resolution shall be constructed as: (1) constituting a jurisdictional act, conferring jurisdiction to sue, or granting implied consent to Hawaiian natives to sue the United States or any of its officers with respect to claims arising from the actions set forth in the preamble of this resolution; or (2) constituting a precedent for reopening, renegotiating, or legislating upon any past settlement involving land claims of, or other matters with any native organization or any tribe, band, or identifiable group of American Indians. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this resolution."
