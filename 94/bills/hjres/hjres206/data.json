    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Revises the procedure to be followed in the event that no Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate receives a majority of electoral votes. Stipulates that if no person voted for as President has such a majority, then from the persons having the three highest numbers of votes for President, the Senate and House of Representatives together, each member having one vote, shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. Defines a quorum for such purpose as three-fourths of the whole number of the Senators and Representatives, and requires that a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice. States that if an additional ballot is necessary, the choice on the second ballot shall be between the two persons having the highest numbers of votes on the first ballot. Provides that if no person voted for as Vice President has such a majority, the Vice President shall be chosen from the persons having the three highest numbers of votes for Vice President in the same manner as herein provided for choosing the President. Empowers the Congress to determine questions concerning breach of faith by electors in the casting of electoral votes, and to provide for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the Senate and the House of Representatives may choose a President or a Vice President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them."
