Directs the Secretary of the Interior to undertake, by means of cooperation with California, to preserve and enhance tule elk populations. Encourages the establishment of additional tule elk herds on Federal lands. Calls for the transportation of surplus animals from the refuge unit to the Point Reyes National Seashore and other areas under Federal and State jurisdictions if there exist suitable guarantees of proper wildlife management and habitat maintenance. Establishes the tule elk as a species of wildlife threatened with extinction. Designates the Tule Elk National Wildlife Refuge as a national area authorized for the preservation of such species. Authorizes such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this resolution."
