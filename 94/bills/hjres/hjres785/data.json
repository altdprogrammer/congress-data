    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Provides that the official candidates of political parties for President shall be nominated at a primary election by direct popular vote. Provides that each voter shall be eligible to vote only in the primary of the party of his registered affiliation. Directs that no person shall be a candidate for nomination for President except in the primary of the party of his registered affiliation, and his name shall be on that party's ballot in all the States if he shall have filed a petition at the seat of the Government of the United States in accordance with this resolution. Provides that a political party shall be recognized as such if the electors for candidates for President and Vice President of such party received an aggregate number of votes, equal in number to at least ten percent of the total number of votes cast throughout the United States for all electors for candidates for President and Vice President in the most recent previous presidential election. Requires that primary elections be held at the same time throughout the United States. Provides that the person who shall have received the greatest number of votes cast by the voters of the party of his registered affiliation shall be the official candidate of such party for President throughout the United States, if such number be a plurality amounting to at least 40 percent of the total number of votes cast. Provides that if no person receives at least 40 percent of the total number of votes cast for candidates for nomination for President by the voters of a political party, then the Congress shall provide for a runoff election. Directs each party to nominate a candidate for Vice President using the procedure stated in this resolution for the selection of Presidential candidates. Provides that in the event of the death or resignation or disqualification of the official candidate of any political party for President, the person nominated by such political party for Vice President shall resign the Vice-Presidential nomination and shall be the official candidate of such party for President."
