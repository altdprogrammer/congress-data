Calls for the regular publication of statistics which indicate the social, health, and economic condition of Americans of East Asian or Pacific Island origin or descent. Requires the Department of Commerce to undertake a study to determine what steps would be necessary for developing estimates of undercounts of such Americans. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to use East Asian or Pacific Island language questionnares and bilingual enumerators in the Bureau of the Census data-collection activities to insure that the needs and concerns of the East Asian and Pacific Island origin population are given full recognition."
