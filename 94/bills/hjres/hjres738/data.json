Requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit, each year, a report to the Congress as to the estimated size and condition of the various Tule elk herds in California. States that such report shall include his determination as to whether or not the preservation of the Tule elk herd may be endangered by changes in land use or land management practices on lands owned by any Federal, State, or local agency. Provides that the Secretary of the Interior, in coordination with Federal, State, and other officers having jurisdiction over lands on which Tule elk herds are located, shall develop a plan for Tule elk restoration and conservation, including habitat management."
