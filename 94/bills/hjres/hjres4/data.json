    "text": "Establishes a Court of Ethics. Directs the President to appoint, by and with the consent of the Senate, a chief judge and two associate judges. States that the court shall hear complaints of unethical conduct by Federal officers and employees if it determines that such a hearing is of sufficient public interest and importance to be warranted. Provides that after hearing a complaint of unethical conduct in the Government service, the court shall render a decision on whether proper ethical principles have been violated and shall state all of its findings of fact, opinions, and the reasons for such decision. Requires that if the court determines that ethical principles have been violated: (1) by an officer or employee of an agency of the Federal Government it shall forward a copy of its decision to the head of such agency; (2) by a Member of the House of Representatives or an officer or employee thereof it shall forward a copy of its decision to the Speaker of the House of Representatives; (3) by a United States Senator or an officer or employee of the Senate it shall forward a copy of its decision to the President of the Senate; (4) by an officer or employee of the judicial branch of the Federal Government, it shall forward a copy of its decision to a judge of the court concerned; and (5) by a person who may be impeached, it shall forward a copy of its decision to the Speaker of the House of Representatives. States that each person advised of a violation of ethical principles under this subsection may take such disciplinary action with respect to the officer or employee guilty of such violation as such person may deem appropriate and as is permitted by law. Stipulates that the United States Courts of Appeal shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Court of Ethics. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as are necessary to carry out this joint resolution."
