Res. 138, roll call #441 (70-18)) Authorizes the President to implement the \"United States Proposal for the Early-Warning System in Sinai,\" provided that United States civilian personnel assigned to Sinai under such proposal shall be removed immediately in the event of an outbreak of hostilities between Egypt and Israel or if the Congress by concurrent resolution determines that the safety of such personnel is jeopardized or that continuation of their role is no longer necessary. Requires such assigned personnel to be volunteers. Requires the President, so long as the participation of such personnel continues, to submit written reports to the Congress at least every six months on: (1) the status, scope, and anticipated duration of their participation; and (2) the feasibility of ending or reducing as soon as possible their participation by substituting nationals of other countries or by making technological changes. States that the authority contained in this Joint Resolution does not signify approval of the Congress of any other agreement, understanding, or commitment made by the executive branch."
