States that the names of such enterprises shall be published in the Federal Register. States that it shall be unlawful for any article produced or distributed by such enterprise to be imported into the United States. Provides that such sanctions shall continue until the foreign enterprise concerned has ceased to engage in commercial whaling. Provides that any action by such an enterprise to dismantle or convert any vessel used in commercial whaling shall be deemed to be prima facie evidence that such enterprise has ceased to engage in commercial whaling. Specifies that the sanctions shall continue to apply to any such enterprise which transfers whaling equipment to another enterprise which is engaged in whaling."
