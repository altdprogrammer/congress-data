Requires the Commission to study means to provide legal remedies to States, and political subdivisions thereof, whose economic development has been retarded or damaged or is threatend with damage by the dissemination of inaccurate, biased, or prejudicial information, or by other actions of persons, programs or organizations. Provides that, in making such study, the Commission shall consider the feasibility of providing that a State, or political subdivision thereof, may bring an action in a court of the United States both for injunctive relief and damages against persons or organizations which may disseminate biased or prejudicial information that may serve to incite riots or to damage the economy of such State or any local political subdivision thereof. Requires the Commission to submit a comprehensive report of its studies to the Congress and to the President, together with recommendations for legislation or amendments to the Constitution of the United States as it deems appropriate. Authorizes to be appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated such funds as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
