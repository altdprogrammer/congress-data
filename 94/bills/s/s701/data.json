    "date": "1975-02-17", 
    "text": "Consumer Energy Act - Title I: Natural Gas Short Title - Natural Gas Production and Conservation Act - Defines the terms used in this Act. States that new natural gas may be sold or transferred in commerce by a producer only if its total price at the time deliveries are first commenced does not exceed the base price, applicable adjustment, or additional amount, if any authorized by this Act. Directs the Federal Power Commission to establish an initial national base price for natural gas within 180 days of enactment, and to make such price retroactive to January 1, 1975. States that the initial national base price shall not be less than $.40 nor more than $.75 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas. Provides for an annual adjustment of the base price to account for any inflation. States that the Commission may authorize charges for natural gas in excess of the base price in any high-cost production areas designated by the Commission according to specified criteria set forth in this Act. Permits the pass through, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, of the cost of all new natural gas unless the costs exceed the applicable price ceiling. Limits the applicability of the provisions of this Act to new natural gas. Requires that for sales of old natural gas, priority be given to local distribution companies to meet the requirements of each such company's residential and small users. Makes it unlawful for local distribution companies to charge residential and small users rates which do not reflect the lesser cost of natural gas for such users. Directs the Commission to grant or deny approval for the construction of new gas pipelines within 120 days. Stipulates that agreements pertaining to oil or gas development on Federal lands shall require, as a condition to such agreement, that the person granted the right of development design and implement immediately an exploratory and development program designed to obtain maximum production from such lands as soon as practicable, upon approval by the Secretary of the Interior. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to report annually to the Commission and to Congress on the status of all Federal lands leased for oil and gas development. Directs producers to keep the Commission currently informed on a reservoir to reservoir basis of all natural gas reserves which it has discovered. Prohibits the use of natural gas and propane for boiler fuel by users other than residential or small users unless, upon petition by a user, the Commission determines that (1) such user has a plan to convert as soon as possible to alternative fuels produced in any State; or (2) it is not feasible to utilize such alternative fuels at the time of such Commission determination. Directs the Commission to promulgate by rule a national plan to prohibit as soon as practicable boiler fuel use of natural gas and propane contracted for prior to January 1, 1975, by users other than residential or small users. Requires the Commission to take necessary steps to assure the availability in interstate commerce of sufficient quantities of natural gas for use as a raw material feedstock or process fuel in the production of fertilizer and essential agricultural chemicals in existing and new plants. Authorizes the Commission, upon a finding that it is in the public interest, to direct any natural-gas company to establish a physical interconnection between any specified facility of such company and any specified facility of any other such company, or any producer. States that upon a finding that there is a natural gas supply emergency in a specific area, the Commission may, by order, direct any natural-gas company or companies which is not itself experiencing such an emergency to make specified deliveries of natural gas, directly or indirectly, to the natural-gas company which is experiencing the emergency. Requires that the company delivering gas for such an emergency be compensated at a rate equal to the price of the highest-cost natural gas sold by such company plus any additional price authorized by the Commission. Title II: Oil Price Regulation - Oil Consumers' Price Protection Act - Directs the President within 15 days of enactment of this Act to issue orders establishing controlled ceiling prices to govern the first sale of \"old\" and \"new\" domestic crude oil. Stipulates that such ceiling for \"new\" domestic crude oil shall not exceed 70 percent of the actual average world market price for crude oil purchased for export from major oil producing countries during the 2-week period from January 1 through January 14, 1975. Stipulates that such orders shall not apply to synthetic oil manufactured from coal, shale, or tar sands. Requires the President to review the effect of such orders to determine (1) the extent to which any such order has tended to reduce the world oil price levels established by cartels; (2) any measurable impact any order, has had, on the Nation's domestic supply of crude oil and the domestic demand for petroleum products refined or produced from such crude oil; (3) the extent to which such order has reduced the rate of inflation; and (4) any effect which such order has had, or may have on the profit margins of major oil companies. Requires that any such order require that any reduction in the price of crude oil or any refined petroleum product resulting from the application of such order be passed through to any subsequent purchaser. Title III: National Energy Supply Corporation - National Energy Supply Corporation Act - Establishes the National Energy Supply Corporation. States that the Corporation shall be administered by a Board of Directors composed of five individuals appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Authorizes the Corporation to (1) explore for oil and natural gas on any public lands; (2) develop, produce, import, purchase, refine, store, transport, and sell oil or natural gas; (3) engage in research and development for improved methods for the discovery, production, refining, storage, and transport of oil or natural gas and to operate experimental installations incident to such research and development; and (4) explore for, import, purchase, transport, and sell oil or natural gas anywhere in the world other than in the United States. Directs the Corporation to (1) establish priorities so as to alleviate shortages of oil or natural gas and products, to maximize competition in the industry, to lower the world prices of oil, and to provide increased supplies at reasonable prices to the consumer; (2) give first preference to the purchase of oil from foreign nations or international entities which are willing to sell, or to negotiate to sell, at prices below the world market price; (3) act in specified situations as the exclusive agent of the United States in specified purchasing situations; and (4) consult with the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and any other appropriate agency as to how its powers should be exercised to eliminate or alleviate anticompetitive or noncompetitive conditions in the energy industry. Requires the Corporation to establish standby reserves of oil and natural gas. Directs the Corporation to notify the Environmental Protection Agency whenever it determines to construct a refinery or establish such reserves. Specifies that the Corporation shall endeavor to sell crude oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum products purchased by it in such manner as to (1) encourage competition within the petroleum industry within the United States; (2) allocate available supplies equitably on a geographical basis; and (3) insure the maximum utilization of petroleum refining facilities located within the United States. Exempts the Corporation from all Federal taxation. Stipulates that the Corporation shall not be exempt from State and local taxation. Prohibits the Corporation from selling its products at prices that are below its actual costs. Requires the Corporation to report to the Congress and the President annually all of its activities. Sets forth specific items to be included in such report. Provides that the Congress shall exercise continuing oversight over the activities of the Corporation. Establishes within the Corporation, but independent of its control, a Citizens Advisory Commission. Sets forth the membership and organization of the Commission. Provides that the Commission shall monitor, review, and evaluate the activities of the Corporation and report thereon to the Congress not less than once every six months. Sets forth other specified functions of the Commission. Empowers the Corporation to incur debt for capital and operating purposes. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Corporation for fiscal year 1975, and for each of the next ten succeeding fiscal years, $50,000. Title IV: Oil Pipeline Transportation - Oil Pipeline Transportation Act - Transfers all functions of the Interstate Commerce Commission with respect to the regulation of oil pipelines to the Federal Power Commission. Provides that whenever the Commission finds action necessary or desirable in the public interest, it may by order, direct an oil pipeline company (1) to extend or improve its transportation or storage facilities, or (2) establish a physical connection of its transportation or storage facilities with the facilities of any person engaged or legally authorized to engage in the refining or distribution of oil. States that no oil pipeline company shall (1) abandon its facilities or any service rendered without the permission and approval of the Commission; or (2) undertake the construction of extension or any facilities for the transportation or storage of oil, unless there is in force a certificate issued by the Commission authorizing such acts. Prescribes the procedures and requirements for granting of such certificates of public convenience and necessity. States that the Commission shall not grant, issue, or renew a certificate of public convience and necessity until it has received the advice of the Attorney General of the United States and the Federal Trade Commission. Makes it unlawful for any pipeline company to refuse to provide any shipper of such oil or products who meets minimum tender requirements access of exit storage of terminal facilities at any origin point of any destination point. Provides that a pipeline company may file an application with Commission requesting that the required minimum tender be raised. States that in every determination by the Commission upon an application for an increased tender, the burden of proof shall be on the applicant. Requires that such hearing shall include consideration of: (1) evidence from factual tests of the degree of intermixture of crude oil or refined petroleum products; (2) other relevant scientific, technological, and engineering calculations; (3) the opinion of the National Transportation Safety Board; (4) the opinion of the Department of Justice regarding the effects on competition of the proposed increased minimum tender as requested by such pipeline company. Prescribes penalties for violations of this Act. Directs the Commission to monitor the activities of oil pipeline companies subject to the provisions of this Act by periodic investigations."
