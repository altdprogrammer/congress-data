Limits the aggregate amount of outstanding guaranteed loans to $25,000,000. Requires that loans not be guaranteed under this Act unless: (1) without it the concessioner could not obtain funds; (2) the improvement is economically sound; and (3) the improvement is appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the area. Creates the National Park Service Guarantee Fund for the purpose of carrying out the Act. Sets forth provisions regarding defaults on the loans. Bars termination or revocation of the guarantee except in certain circumstances."
