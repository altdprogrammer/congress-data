    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 3922 passed in lieu) Older Americans Amendments - =Title I: Amendments to Older Americans Act= - Extends until January 1, 1976, the deadline for completion of studies to be conducted by the Federal Council on Aging. Includes within the definition of the term \"social services,\" under the Older Americans Act, legal counseling and services to older persons and programs designed to maintain and improve the physical fitness of older persons. Permits the Commissioner on Aging to provide direct funding to an Indian tribal organization when he finds that members of such tribe are not receiving benefits equivalent to those provided to other older persons in the State or appropriate area and when he finds that members of the tribe would be better served through such direct funding. Allows State and area agencies on aging to enter into agreements with agencies administering programs under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Titles VI, XIX, and XX of the Social Security Act for the purpose of jointly funding transportation programs to meet the common needs of persons receiving benefits under such Acts and persons participating in the programs under titles III and VII of this Act. Increases the minimum allotment for State administrative funds under the Older Americans Act for each State from $160,000 to $200,000. Authorizes the appropriation of $50,000,000 for each fiscal year 1976 and fiscal year 1977, to be distributed to the States for the purpose of paying up to 90 percent of the cost of the following projects: (1) transportation projects; (2) home service projects; and (3) projects to provide legal service and counseling. Authorizes training grants in two new categories: (1) to assist in the training of lawyers and paraprofessional persons to provide legal (including tax and financial) counseling and services to older persons; and (2) grants for two and four year colleges and university-based training in gerontology in addition to currently authorized short-term and in-service training. Revises the Older Americans Act relating to the availability of surplus commodities for nutrition projects for the elderly, in the following respects: (1) requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to provide such commodities for nutrition projects for the elderly, and (2) increasing the level of assistance to be provided by the Secretary of Agriculture in donated commodities from 10 cents to 25 cents per meal for fiscal year 1976 and to 50 cents per meal in fiscal year 1977. Provides that where a State has phased out its commodity distribution facilities prior to June 30, 1974, such State may, for purposes of the programs authorized by this Act, elect to receive cash payments in lieu of donated foods. Extends the authorization for appropriations under such Act for two years. Adds title IX, \"Community Service Employment for Older Americans,\" to such Act. Provides that in order to foster and promote useful part-time work opportunities in community service activities for unemployed low-income persons who are 55 years old and older and who have poor employment prospects, the Secretary of Labor is authorized to establish an Older American Community Service Employment Program. Establishes guidelines for such Program. Allows the Federal share of the costs of any such approved community service project to be 90 percent. Requires the Secretary to consult with State and local agencies concerning the areas in which community service programs are most needed. Directs the Secretary to reserve from each year's appropriation funds to enter into grants and contracts with national aging organizations to conduct older workers employment programs before alloting the balance of the appropriation to the States. Extends the authorization for appropriations for such title through September 30, 1978. Repeals title IX of the Older Americans Comprehensive Services Amendments of 1973. =Title II: Amendments to Other laws= - Extends through fiscal year 1977 provisions authorizing funds for programs for the elderly under the Adult Education Act and the Higher Education Act of 1965. Extends through fiscal year 1977 authorizations for the Senior Opportunities and Services Programs under the Community Services Act. =Title III: Study of Discrimination Based on Age= - Directs the Commission on Civil Rights to undertake a study to determine whether otherwise eligible persons are, because of their age, discriminated against in the administration of federally assisted programs; and in the event that the Commission finds that such discriminatory practices do exist, it is to seek to determine their causes and extent and identify the federally assisted programs involved."
