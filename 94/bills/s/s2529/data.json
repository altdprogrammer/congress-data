Increases from $21,000 to $33,000 the limitation with respect to direct loans to veterans for purchase of a home in a rural area or small town or city where adequate credit is otherwise unavailable. Extends indefinitely the Veterans' Administration home loan guarantee and home loan programs. Increases from 30 to 50 percent the amount which the Veterans' Administration may guarantee of a loan to a veteran for the purchase of a mobile home. Makes the provisions of State constitutions or laws limiting the amount of interest that may be charged by specified classes of lenders inapplicable to loans or mortgages secured by one-to-four-family dwellings and insured under title I or II of the National Housing Act or title 38 (Veterans' Affairs) of the United States Code."
