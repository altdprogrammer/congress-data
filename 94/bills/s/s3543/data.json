Establishes a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Long-Run Economic Goals and Policies. Directs the Committee to (1) conduct a study of sustainable long-run economic goals; (2) solicit the advice of workers, business, agriculture, consumers, State and local government, and the public at large on programs and policies; (3) submit to the Congress legislative recommendations setting forth such long-run economic goals as are deemed appropriate and advisable; and (4) report to the Congress its findings and recommendations with regard to specific policies to achieve such long-run goals. Authorizes appropriations of sums necessary to enable the select committee to exercise its powers, functions, and duties under this Act. Requires the President to submit to the Congress an annual economic report setting forth (1) trends in the levels of employment, production, and purchasing power; (2) annual numerical goals for employment, production, and purchasing power; (3) programs and policies for carrying out the goals of this Act; (4) the budgetary impact of such programs and policies; and (5) anti-inflation policies and recommendations. Directs the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to submit a report in conjunction with the President's report analyzing the economic goals set forth therein and the effect of such goals and policies on monetary policy. Requires the Congress to establish procedures for the effective oversight of all government programs and policies, including a comprehensive budget review of every government program at least once every four years. Title II: Coordination of Federal, State, and Local Government Activities Affecting Employment - Directs the President to submit to Congress recommendations with regard to existing and alternative policies and programs designed to improve the coordination between the Federal Government and State and local governments of programs and policies intended to increase employment and employment opportunities, and strengthen the financial condition of State and local governments. Requires the President to submit recommendations designed to reduce the under utilization of human and capital resources due to the geographical distribution and limited mobility of such resources within the country. Directs the President to minimize structural unemployment by studying and reviewing the appropriateness and effectiveness of existing and alternative employment and training mechanisms and programs. Stipulates that the President shall transmit to the Congress recommendations relating to youth employment which (1) utilize and alter, where appropriate, the resources and facilities of existing youth employment and training programs and (2) provide policies to encourage employment of youth in rewarding and skill-creating jobs. States that the President shall assist the Congress in achieving integration of existing public and private income maintenance programs by submitting recommendations for improvement and simplification of income maintenance and employment policies."
