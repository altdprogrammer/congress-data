Rept. 94-976) Animal Welfare Act Amendments - Defines terms to be used in the Animal Welfare Act, including: \"dealer,\" which shall not include retail pet stores; and \"intermediate handler,\" which shall mean any person including a department of the United States Government or of any State or local government who is engaged in any business in which he receives custody of animals in connection with their transportation in interstate commerce. Provides that at the request of the Secretary of Agriculture any regulatory agency which requires records to be maintained by intermediate handlers and carriers with respect to the transportation in commerce of animals shall require inclusion in such records of such information as the Secretary may require for the administration of this Act. Directs the Secretary to promulgate standards governing the transportation and care by intermediate handlers, and carriers of animals consigned by any dealer, research facility, exhibitor, operator of an auction sale, or a department or agency of the Federal, State, or local governments. Prohibits delivery for transportation or transportation by such persons and entities of dogs, cats, and other animals as may be specified, unless accompanied by a certificate from a veterinarian certifying that the animal is, ten days before delivery, free of infectious disease or physical abnormality which would endanger the animal or the public health. Prohibits transportation of such animals, except to research facilities, unless such animals are above a specified age. Disallows shipment of animals C.O.D., unless specified charges are guaranteed by the consignor. Permits the Secretary of Transportation to disapprove, before promulgation, standards for the air transport of animals. Directs the Secretary to promulgate rules and regulations to permit inspectors to confiscate or destroy in a humane manner any animal found to be suffering as a result of a failure to comply with the Animal Welfare Act. Permits the Secretary to make investigations to determine violations, and imposes a $5,000 fine and/or a one-year imprisonment for specified violations of such Act. Defines \"animal fighting venture\" for purposes of such Act. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend licenses of dealers, exhibitors, or operators of auction sales for violations of this Act. Subjects any dealer, exhibitor, research facility, intermediate handler, carrier, or operator of an auction sale to a civil penalty of $1,000 per violation and to cease and desist orders for violations of such Act or rules or regulations thereunder. Withholds implementation of any such penalty or order pending a hearing. Provides for judicial review of orders of the Secretary under such Act. Subjects dealers, exhibitors, or operators of auction sales to criminal penalties of $1,000 and/or a one-year imprisonment for knowing violations of such Act. Requires promulgation of regulations relating to intermediate handlers and carriers required under this Act within nine months of enactment, and for compliance with this Act and such regulations within 90 days thereafter. Makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly sponsor or exhibit an animal in any animal fighting venture to which any animal was moved in interstate commerce; and for any person to knowingly sell, buy, or transport in commerce any dog or other animal for an animal fighting venture. Authorizes appropriations for the enforcement of such provisions relating to animal fighting ventures."
