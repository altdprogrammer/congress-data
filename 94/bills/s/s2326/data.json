    "text": "Requires Federal inspection under official standards for export grain that is required to be inspected under the U.S. Grain Standards Act. Authorizes the voluntary inspection by licensees employed by, or operating, official inspection agencies for other grain in the United States under the official standards or for any grain in this country under other criteria approved by the Secretary of Agriculture. Revises the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture relating to issuing regulations requiring operators of grain elevators to install sampling and monitoring devices and other equipment needed for official inspections as a condition of obtaining such inspection. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to report annually to the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry and the House Committee on Agriculture concerning the viability and effectiveness of the grain inspection program and any need for further legislation. Requires the Secretary to conduct investigations into the suitability of current official grain standards and report the findings to these committees. Extends the prohibitions on forcible assaults and related offenses to United States Department of Agriculture personnel and inspection personnel licensed to perform any official inspection function. Makes a conviction of such an offense a basis for denial of inspection service to any applicant. (Amends 18 U.S.C. 111 and 1114)"
