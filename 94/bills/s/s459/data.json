    "text": "Emergency Urban Crime Reduction Act - Declares that it is the purpose of this Act to authorize the Attorney General to make grants and provide technical assistance to cities in the United States where the need to combat crime is greatest, in order to permit such cities to strengthen police protection, improve the administration of the local courts, and reform and rehabilitate the local correctional system. Authorizes to be appropriated to carry out the purposes of this Act $300,000,000 for the fiscal year 1975 and for each of the two fiscal years thereafter. Provides that the funds appropriated to carry out this Act shall be allotted by the Attorney General to eligible cities on the basis of the population and crime index of each such city. Defines the term \"eligible city\" to mean any city determined by the Attorney General to be among the first twenty-five cities in the United States on a crime index prepared by him for the purposes of this Act. States that each eligible city desiring to participate in the program shall submit an application which meets the criteria enumerated in this Act. Provides that the Attorney General shall not finally disapprove a city plan without affording the Council reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing. Provides for judicial review of the Attorney General's final action with respect to the approval of a city's plan. States that the Federal payment under this Act shall not exceed ninety percent of the cost of carrying out a program under this Act. Provides that the Comptroller General shall have access for the purpose of examination and audit to any books, documents, papers, and records that are pertinent to any grantee under this Act."
