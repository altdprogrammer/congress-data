Directs that the amount of any monthly annuity payable under this Act accruing for any month and which is computed with regard to service performed by an individual prior to January 1, 1969, shall be reduced by the portion of any benefits under any State retirement system to which such individual is entitled (or on proper application would be entitled) for such month which is attributable to such service performed by such individual before such date."
