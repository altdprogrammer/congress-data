Directs the Commission to make a report to the President and the Congress with respect to the existence or possibility of any long-term or short-term shortages affecting the development of any resources, or the supply of any raw materials, or finished materials (including any possible impairment of productive capacity which may result from shortages). Directs the Commission to include in such report specific recommendations with respect to institutional adjustments.

Provides for the appointment of members of the Commission and specifies the powers of the Commission. National Commission on Supplies and Shortages Act - Directs the Commission to establish a National Resources and Materials Information System. States that the System shall be independent of the executive departments and under the control and direction of an Administrator. States that the function of the System shall be the collection, collation, comparison, analysis, tabulation, standardization, and dissemination of resources and materials information pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to request, acquire, and collect resources and materials information from any person in such form and in such manner as he may deem appropriate in order to fulfill the requirements of the System and to achieve the purposes of this Act. States that the Administrator shall coordinate existing resources and materials information collection activities of all Federal agencies. Authorizes the President to transfer to the System all or part of the resources and materials information activities being carried on by a Federal agency. Requires the Administrator to maintain within the System the capability to perform analysis and verification of resources and materials information to the extent necessary to serve the purposes of this Act. States that the System shall contain such information as is required to provide a description of and facilitate analysis of resources and materials supply and consumption within and affecting the United States on the basis of such geographic areas and economic sectors as may be appropriate, and to meet adequately the needs of the Congress. Requires that the system contain such information as is required to define and permit analysis of: (1) the institutional structure of the resources and materials supply systems, including patterns of ownership and control of resources and resources companies, and the production, distribution, and marketing of raw, semifinished, and finished materials; and (2) the depletion of resources and the consumption of raw, semifinished, and finished materials by such classes, sectors, and regions as the Administrator shall determine are appropriate to the purposes of this Act. Directs the Administrator to issue regulations under which resources and materials information and other information will be acquired for the system and will be designated and indexed by source and by type or subject. States that such regulations shall also provide for designation of the restrictions, if any, on access to, exchange of, or use that may be made of particular items of groups of items of related information in the system. Provides that any employee of the Commission or the System who makes an unauthorized disclosure of information (1) to which public access is restricted or (2) furnished to the Administrator by another Federal agency subject to restrictions shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both; and shall be removed from office or employment. Requires all persons owning or operating facilities or business premises who are engaged in any phase of resources ownership, control, or development, or materials supply or major materials consumption to make available to the Administrator such information and periodic reports, records, documents, and other data, relating to the purposes of this Act, including full identification of all data and projections as to source, time, and methodology of development, as the Administrator may prescribe by regulation or order as necessary or appropriate for the proper exercise of functions under this Act. Provides that any individual who knowingly submits or causes to be submitted, a materially false or fraudulent answer, response, or report in response to any lawful request for resources and materials information made under this Act shall be fined not more than $20,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, for each such offense. Authorizes the Administrator to enter into arrangements to collect from institutions outside the Federal Government such additional resources and materials information and other information as the Administrator determines is required for comparison with, or extension of, the information base of the System in furtherance of the purposes of this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to compile, maintain, and keep current on not less than an annual basis a survey of all resources in the public lands of the United States. Requires the Comptroller General of the United States to continuously monitor and evaluate the operations and activities of the System including its reporting requirements. Authorizes to be appropriated $15,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1976, 1977, and 1978, for purposes of carrying out this Act."
