    "text": "Federal Handgun Control Act - Defines the term \"handgun\" as a firearm designed or redesigned to be fired by the use of a single hand, including the parts from which a firearm can be assembled. Excludes antique firearms from the term. Makes it unlawful for any person to import, manufacture, sell, buy, transfer, receive, or transport any handgun which the Secretary of the Treasury has determined to be unsuitable for lawful purposes. States that a handgun which has a barrel of less than six inches in length shall not be approved for lawful purposes. Exempts from the provisions of this Act handguns sold or delivered to designated research facilities and duly commissioned law enforcement officers. Exempts firearms which are designated as curios or relics, and also occasional, sporadic sales by a licensed collector who is not a dealer. Prohibits any person other than a licensed importer, licensed dealer, or licensed manufacturer from knowingly possessing or transferring any handgun unless it is registered with the Secretary under this Act. Permits the Secretary to enter into grant agreements with State agencies who agree to carry out the registration requirements of this Act for handguns within the State. Authorizes appropriations of sums necessary to enable the Secretary to make such grants. Provides that the application for registration shall be filed in such form as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe, including: (1) the name and address of the applicant; (2) the number of the Federal handgun license issued to the applicant pursuant to this section; (3) the name of the manufacturer, the caliber or gage, the model and the type, and the serial number of the handgun; and (4) the date, place, name and address, of the person from whom the handgun was obtained. Specifies registration fees to be paid by applicants. Makes ineligible for registration any person who: (1) is under 18 years of age; (2) is, because of alcoholism, drug addiction, or mental disease or defect, an individual who cannot possess or use handguns safely or responsibly; (3) has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; (4) is a fugitive from justice; or (5) is not qualified under all appliable Federal, State, and local laws to register a handgun. Requires notice to the Secretary from a person to whom a handgun registration certificate has been issued under this section if such person changes his address, or transfers possession of a registered handgun. Makes similar provisions for obtaining a Federal handgun license for a handgun and ammunition of a caliber other than .22 rimfire. States that information required to be included in any application, certificate, or license submitted to or issued by the Secretary under this Act shall not be disclosed by him except to the National Crime Information Center established by the FBI, and to law enforcement officers requiring such information in pursuit of their official duties. Prescribes penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes the payment of compensation for the reasonable value of handguns voluntarily transferred to law enforcement agencies. Provides that the Secretary may prescribe such other rules and regulations as he deems reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Permits the Secretary to declare periods of amnesty for the registration of handguns under this Act or the transfer of handguns to any law enforcement agency. Specifies the effective dates of the provisions of this Act. Authorizes such appropriations as necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
