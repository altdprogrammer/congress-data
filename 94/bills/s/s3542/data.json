Requires promulgation of regulations within 15 days of enactment of this Act respecting procedures for the handling of claims under this Act. Requires publication of an explanation of such procedures in general circulation newspapers in Idaho. Authorizes agreements with the owners of irrigation facilities damaged by such dam failure to finance the repair or reconstruction of such facilities to the extent the cost of repairs or construction are not covered by insurance. Authorizes appropriations as are necessary to carry out this Act."
