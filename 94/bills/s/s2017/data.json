    "as": "Senate agreed to House amendment with amendment", 
    "date": "1976-02-19", 
    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendment with an amendment) States the finding of the Congress that the increase and spread of heroin consumption since 1974, and the continuing abuse of other dangerous drugs, clearly indicate the need for effective, ongoing, and highly visible Federal leadership in the formation and execution of a comprehensive, coordinated durg abuse policy. Makes it the policy of the United States to significantly reduce the incidence, as well as the social and personal costs, of drug abuse. Adds a new title II (Office of Drug Abuse Policy) to the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972. Establishes in the Executive Office of the President the Office of Drug Abuse Policy, which shall be headed by a director appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Requires the Attorney General to consult with the Director before adding or removing a drug from the controlled substance list. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1978 to carry out this Act. Requires the Director to make recommendations to the President with respect to policies for, and establishment of priorities for, Federal drug abuse functions and to coordinate the performance of such functions by Federal departments and agencies. Requires the Director to: (1) conduct, or provide for, evaluations of the performance of drug abuse functions by Federal departments and agencies, and the results achieved by such departments and agencies in the performance of such functions; and (2) seek to assure that Federal departments and agencies, in the performance of drug abuse functions, construe drug abuse as a health problem. Instructs the Director to submit to the President and the Congress, prior to March 1 of each year, a written report on the activities of the Office. Provides that drug abusers who are suffering from medical conditions shall not be discriminated against in admission or treatment, solely because of their drug abuse or drug dependence, by any private or public general hospital which receives support in any form from any program supported in whole or in part by funds appropriated to any Federal department or agency, including Veterans' Administration facilities. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1978 for formula grants under the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972. Requires the publication of regulations by the first day of each fiscal year of the allotment formula for such grants. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to give high priority to special project grants or contracts under such Act for primary prevention programs (programs designed to discourage persons from beginning drug abuse). Authorizes appropriations for such grants and contracts through fiscal year 1978. Directs the Director to coordinate Federal drug abuse prevention functions with corresponding functions of State and local governments; and provide for a central clearinghouse for Federal, State, and local governments, public and private agencies, and individuals seeking drug abuse information and assistance from the Federal Government. Authorizes the Director to provide technical assistance to States and localities and to draft and make available to them model legislation relating to drug abuse programs. Requires the Director to encourage and promote expanded research programs to create, develop, and test: (1) synthetic analgesics, antitussives, and other drugs which are nonaddictive, or less addictive than opium or its derivatives, to replace opium and its derivatives in medical use; (2) long-lasting, nonaddictive blocking or antagonistic drugs or other pharmacological substances for treatment of heroin addiction; and (3) detoxification agents which, when administered, will ease the physical effects of withdrawal from heroin addiction. Authorizes appropriations for such purposes through fiscal year 1978."
