    "text": "National Correctional Standards Act - Declares that it is the purpose of this Act to require the formulation and application of a more explicit and responsive set of national standards to guide the Federal role in the reform of the corrections component of Federal, State, and local criminal justice systems. Authorizes the President, in consultation with the Attorney General, to appoint a National Advisory Commission on Correctional Standards. Provides that such Commission shall consist of fifteen members who shall be appointed by and with the consent of the Senate. States that it shall be the duty of the Commission within one year of its appointment to establish minimum standards relating to the administration of correctional and pre- trial detention institutions and facilities and to hold public hearings on the proposed standards prior to submitting its final recommendations to the Attorney General for his approval. Provides that the Attorney General shall approve the standards as a whole or secure the concurrence of the Commission by a majority vote of its members to changes therein. States that such standards shall then be published and shall be applicable to all correctional and pre-dentention facilities receiving Federal financial assistance. Provides that State and local agencies shall not receive grants under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act unless they provide for the promulgation and implementation of such minimum standards. Sets forth general objectives for the Commission to consider prior to the establishment of such minimum standards. Authorizes to be appropriated $500,000 for the purpose of carrying out this Act."
