    "text": "Comprehensive Maternal and Child Health Protection Act - Establishes a comprehensive system of health care services for children and pregnant women. Title I: Comprehensive Maternal and Child Health Protection Benefits - Provides that every pregnant woman and every child residing in the United States who is a legal resident or a citizen of the United States or the spouse of a legal resident or a citizen of the United States shall be eligible for benefits under this Act. Entitles an eligible child under this Act to receive from his provider either directly or indirectly all health care services related to the diagnosis and treatment of any disease, injury, or disability, as well as any other health care services necessary for the adequate protection, maintenance, or restoration of his mental and physical health. Specifies that women eligible under this title shall be provided all health care services related to the diagnosis and treatment of pregnancy, disease or injury during pregnancy which could threaten the healthy development of the unborn child; and any injury, disability, or disease relating to or resulting from pregnancy that occurs during the 12 weeks immediately following the termination of a pregnancy, including but not limited to the mental well-being of the woman. Sets forth requirements for participating providers. Establishes guidelines for the method and amount of payment to providers. Establishes in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare a Maternal and Child Health Protection Board to be composed of five members. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, acting through the Board, to establish capitation rates to be paid to participating providers, to establish standards and qualifications for participating providers, and to monitor and study the operation of the provisions of this Act with special emphasis with regard to the provision of health services to eligible persons. Establishes the position of Executive Director of the Maternal and Child Health Protection Board to perform such duties in the administration of this title as the Board may assign to him. Establishes a National Maternal and Child Health Protection Advisory Council, which shall consist of the Chairman of the Board and 12 members. Directs the Advisory Council to advise the Board on matters of general policy in the administration of this title, and to study the operation of this title and the utilization of health services under it. Directs the Board to appoint for each of the regions of the administration and for each health service area a regional or local advisory council. Specifies that it shall be the function of each such council to advise the regional or local representative of the Board on all matters directly relating to the administration of this title in the region or area. Requires the Board to consult with State health agencies to coordinate the administration of this title with related State and local activities. Directs the Board to make an agreement with any State which is able and willing to do so under which the State health agency will be utilized by the Board in determining whether providers of services meet or continue to meet the qualifications and requirements established in regulations issued by the Board. Requires the Board to disseminate, to providers of services and to the public, information concerning the provisions of this title. Authorizes the Board to make statistical and other studies of any aspect of the operation of this title, including studies of the effect of the title upon the health of the people of the United States, and to make such other studies as it may consider necessary or promising for the evaluation, or for the improvement, of the operation of this title. States that determination of entitlement to benefits under this title, determinations of who are participating providers of services, and determination of capitation rates to be paid by the Board to participating providers, shall be made by the Board in accordance with regulations. Empowers the Board, under specified circumstances, to suspend or terminate the participation of the provider. Provides for judicial review of such suspension and termination orders. Directs that the provisions of this title shall terminate at the end of fiscal year 1981. Title II: Catastrophic Protection Tax Credit - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for medical expenses, not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, equal to the sum of: (1) 50 percent of the amount by which the medical expenses paid or incurred by him during the taxable year exceed ten percent but are less than or equal to 20 percent of his modified adjusted gross income, plus (2) 100 percent of the amount by which such medical expenses exceed 20 percent of his modified adjusted gross income."
