Provides that a warrantless search of a person or his property incident to any pretrial custody, detention, imprisonment, or other incarceration of that person which follows from his arrest on charges of traffic or vehicular law violations is prohibited, except that a limited search for weapons under such circumstances is permissible. Defines the terms used in this Act."
