    "text": "National School-Age Mother and Child Health Act - States that Congress finds pregnancy among adolescents to be a serious problem. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to designated State agencies to meet part of the cost of planning and coordinating services for school age girls and their children. Sets forth requirements which the State plans must meet before receiving such grants including comprehensive health care to school-age girls (associated with the continuation of pregnancy) and to their children, family planning and counseling, infant and child day care and a coordinated program of social services. Directs that no identifying information of persons receiving services shall be collected by the Federal or State government. Authorizes the appropriation of $30,000,000 for fiscal year 1976 and for each of the next two succeeding fiscal years to carry out the purposes of this Act. Establishes a unit within the Maternal and Child Health Service of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to administer and coordinate the program established by this Act."
