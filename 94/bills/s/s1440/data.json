Authorizes appropriations under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of sums necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Reserves 5 percent of the amounts appropriated for discretionary use by the Assistant Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention for grants to States and the District of Columbia to carry out programs complementary to the purposes of this Act. Reserves up to 3 percent of the amounts appropriated for grants to territories and Indian schools. Requires the remainder of funds to be allocated to local educational agencies within the States according to the following criteria: (1) the financial need of local educational agencies; (2) the extent and impact of delinquency and crime in the schools of the district to be served; and (3) the degree to which the district to receive funds under this Act has established effective procedures for the protection of the constitutional rights of students and employees of the school district affected. Requires recipients to expend not less than fifty percent of funds granted under this Act for educational programs, including renovation of facilities, but not including programs utilizing security technology and personnel. Directs that the remainder of funds appropriated under this Act be expended for activities designed to achieve the purposes of this Act, including utilization of security technology and personnel. Stipulates that no funds may be used to support the introduction, presence, or use of firearms, other weapons, or chemical agents in any school."
