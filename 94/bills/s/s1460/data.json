    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1975-04-17", 
    "text": "Amtrak Improvement Act - States that the Congress finds that it is essential to the national interest to provide a sufficient multiyear Federal financial commitment for the provision of rail passenger services; to enhance the effectiveness of the program of State-initiated intercity rail passenger services; and to establish clearly the authorities and responsibilities of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation for the management of its affairs. Specifies that the Board of Directors of the Corporation, under the Rail Passenger Service Act, has the following responsibilities in the development and promotion of intercity rail passenger service: (1) responsibility for approving the Corporation's annual operating and capital plan; (2) responsibility for approving deletions, additions, and changes of service; and (3) responsibility for approving the Corporation's annual report to Congress. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish and maintain, in cooperation with the Corporation, customs inspection procedures for trains operated in international intercity rail passenger service that will be convenient for passengers and will result in the most rapid possible transit between embarkation and debarkation points of such service. Requires the Secretary of Commerce and the Interstate Commerce Commission to report annually to the President and to the Congress on the effectiveness of the Corporation in carrying out its responsibilities. Directs the Board to establish procedures by which the Corporation may add routes or delete routes and required services of the basic system. States that the proposed procedures should be submitted to the Secretary for his approval. Permits the Corporation to institute rail passenger service beyond the basic system under a two- year agreement with the involved State, regional, or local agency if the agency agrees to reimburse the Corporation for 5 percent of total operating losses and associated capital costs of such service and if the service meets specified requirements of this Act. States that such experimental service shall cease after two years unless the Corporation finds that it has attracted sufficient patronage to serve the public convenience and necessity. Provides for discontinuation of service on any route provided that at least thirty days notice of any change or discontinuation of service is sent by mail by the Corporation to the Governor of the affected State or States. Authorizes additional appropriations to the Corporation through fiscal year 1979."
