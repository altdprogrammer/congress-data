Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a planning commission to develop a plan for the development and use of the land and water resources of the recreation area. Provides that if the State of California adopts comprehensive planning legislation for the Santa Monica Mountains and such legislation creates a commission to develop a plan for the area, approved by the Secretary, then the Secretary will appoint the Commission members in lieu of the procedure designated by this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Secretary $50,000,000 for grants to State and local governments having responsibility for implementing the plan for the recreation area. Limits such grants to acquisition of land and interests in land. Provides that any final judgment raising a justifiable issue under the fifth or fourteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States, which has been rendered by the highest appropriate court of the State of California and which is adverse to a property owner whose property is located within the boundaries of the recreation area may be appealed by such property owner to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which Circuit Court shall have the same jurisdiction for review as the United States Supreme Court."
