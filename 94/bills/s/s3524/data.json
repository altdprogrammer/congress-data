    "text": "Freedom of Emigration Act - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to prohibit the President from renewing any commercial agreement with any nonmarket economy country which places certain restrictions upon emigration. Increases the circumstances under which: (1) the President shall not conclude or renew such agreement; and (2) such country may not participate in United States programs which extend credit or guarantees, to include visitation restrictions, old age benefit restrictions, and certain currency restrictions. Permits the Congress to find such country in violation of such Act. Eliminates the exemption from these prohibitions of countries with most-favored-nation status and the authority of the President to waive these restrictions."
