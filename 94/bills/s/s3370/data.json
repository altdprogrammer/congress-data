Revises the definition of the term guarantee to mean that the Small Business Administration will pay to sureties a sum not to exceed 90 percent of any loss incurred by reason of its execution of a bond. Requires that payments made by the Administration after the default or bankruptcy of a surety shall be made directly to the obligee and not to the surety's trustee in bankruptcy. Increases to $25,000 the minimum amount of any contract on a public works building requiring a bond."
