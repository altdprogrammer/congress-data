Increases, under Title II (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act, the percentage of the base annual allocation of funds to the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. Title II: Changes in Benefits - Prohibits the retroactive payment of old-age, wife's, husband's, widow's or widower's benefits if such payment would require a reduction in the amount of an individual's monthly benefits pursuant to existing law. Stipulates specified exceptions to such prohibition. Revises the conditions governing the deduction of earnings from the benefit amount of a retired person. Phases out the payment of child's insurance benefits under the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance program to students above the age of 18."
