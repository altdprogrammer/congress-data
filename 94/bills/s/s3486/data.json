Limits the amount of any such reduction where prior notice is given to a 25 percent reduction over each six-month period. Exempts small marketers and distributors whose amount of business did not exceed one percent of the total market in such State. Exempts marketers engaged solely in the selling of refined petroleum products on a retail level to end users."
