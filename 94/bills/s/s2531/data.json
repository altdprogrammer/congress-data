    "text": "Alien Employment Certification Act - Prescribes penalties for anyone who knowingly uses, attempts to use, possesses, obtains, accepts, or receives any visa, permit, border crossing card, alien registration receipt card, or other document prescribed by statute or regulation for entry into or as evidence of authorized stay in the United States, knowing it to be forged, counterfeited, altered, or falsely made, or to have been procured by means of any false claim or statement, or to have been otherwise procured by fraud or unlawfully obtained. Stipulates that no appropriated funds may be expended or obligated to support any program, whether public or private, providing aid or assistance directly or indirectly, to any individual, whether through cash payments or any other form of aid or assistance, unless as a condition of eligibility for receiving such aid or assistance the applicant is required to show proof of United States citizenship or, if not a citizen, proof that such individual is lawfully in the United States. Makes it unlawful for any employer or any person acting as an agent for such an employer, or any person who for a fee refers an alien for employment by such an employer, knowingly to employ, continue to employ, or refer for employment any alien in the United States who has not been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, unless the employment of such alien is authorized by the Attorney General. Provides an exception where the employer has made an inquiry as to whether a person employed or referred by him is a citizen or an alien, and if an alien, whether such alien is lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence or is authorized by the Attorney General to accept employment."
