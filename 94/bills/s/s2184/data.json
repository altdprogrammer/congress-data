Rept. 94-1447) Olympic Winter Games Authorization Act - Declares the finding of the Congress that assistance authorized by this Act is provided in recognition of the unique economic circumstances of the Lake Placid area and should not be considered as establishing precedent for future Federal assistance for international athletic competitions. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to provide grants to the Lake Placid 1980 Olympic Games Incorporated, or State, local or other governmental agencies, at such times, and under such conditions as he considers necessary and appropriate for assisting in the planning, design, and construction of the necessary winter sports and supporting facilities in connection with the XIII international Olympic winter games. States that all revenues generated by the Lake Placid Winter Olympics in excess of costs shall revert to the U.S. Treasury to the extent of appropriations authorized by this Act. Requires that all winter games facilities be constructed in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations governing the use of Adirondack Park. Directs the Secretary to ensure that all activities relating to the Olympic winter games be carried out in consonance with the recreational and wilderness values of such Park. Requires the Secretary to take necessary action to assure that the facilities constructed with Federal assistance will be designed to provide maximum continued public use and benefit following the completion of the 1980 Olympic winter games. Requires the Secretary to submit interim reports to the Congress on the progress of the design and construction of facilities pursuant to this Act, together with any recommendations for further Federal Government involvement to assure a successful staging of such games. Specifies that a final report shall be submitted within three months after the completion of the 1980 games. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of $49,040,000 for grants and $250,000 for the administration of this Act."
