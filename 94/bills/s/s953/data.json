    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs with amendment, S. Rept. 94-632) =Title I: Foreign Boycotts= - Foreign Boycotts Act - Provides, under the Export Administration Act of 1969, that it shall be the policy of the United States to oppose restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by foreign countries against other countries friendly to the United States or against any domestic concern; and to encourage and request domestic concerns to refuse to take any action furthering or supporting the restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by any foreign country against another country friendly to the United States or against any domestic concern. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to implement rules and regulations requiring that any domestic concern receiving a request for the furnishing of information, the signing of agreements, or the taking of any other boycotting action, shall report such fact to the Secretary, and whether the concern intends to comply or has complied with such request. Requires such rules and regulations to prohibit each domestic concern from: (1) furnishing information regarding the race, religion, or nationality of that concern's directors, officers, employees, or shareholders to implement a boycott against a country friendly to the United States; or (2) refusing to do business with any other domestic concern or person pursuant to an agreement with or request from any foreign country to implement a boycott against a country friendly to the United States. Permits heads of departments and agencies exercising functions under the Export Administration Act of 1969 to impose a $10,000 civil penalty for each violation of this title or rules and regulations thereunder; and permits such officials exercising licensing functions under such Act to suspend or revoke the export authority of a person. =Title II: Disclosure= - Domestic and Foreign Investment Improved Disclosure Act - Provides, under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, that any person who acquires specified equity securities, making him the beneficial owner of more than five percent of that class of securities, shall, within ten days, send to the issuer of the security, the exchange where it is traded, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, such of the following information as the Commission deems necessary: (1) the background, identity, residence, and nationality of such person and those on whose behalf the purchases have been effected; (2) the source and amount of the funds used in making the purchases; (3) if the purpose of the purchase is to acquire control of the business of the issuer; (4) the number of shares of such security which are beneficially owned by such person; and (5) information as to any contracts or understandings with any person with respect to any securities of the issuer. Requires every holder of record of two percent or more of such securities, to report such interest and such information as the Commission may prescribe. Reduces such percentage to one percent on September 1, 1976, and to one-half percent on September 1, 1977, except that the Commission may shorten or extend such periods. Makes it unlawful to make use of the mails or any other means of interstate commerce to effect any transaction in such securities if it is known that such information required to be filed under this Act has not been filed."
