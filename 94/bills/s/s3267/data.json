Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to test each production prototype of an automobile developed in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance under this Act, or referred to him for such purpose by the Administrator or (ERDA) to determine whether such production prototype complies with any exhaust emission standards or any other requirements promulgated or reasonably expected to be promulgated under any provision of the Clean Air Act, the Noise Control Act, or any other provision of Federal law administered by him. Sets forth patent rights for inventions made in the course of activities conducted under this Act.
