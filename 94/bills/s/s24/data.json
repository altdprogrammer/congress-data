Enumerates the items to be filed by the applicant in the Patent Office for commencement of the national stage of processing. States that all questions of substance and procedure in an international application designating the United States shall be determined as in the case of national applications regularly filed in the Patent Office.

Specifies the fees required and permitted to be charged by the Patent Office. Provides for the allocation of funds appropriated to the Patent Office, to the Department of State for the purpose of payment of the share on the part of the United States to the working capital fund established under the Patent Cooperation Treaty.
