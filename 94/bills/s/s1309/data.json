Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make cash grants to the education department of each State for the purpose of providing funds to local school districts and private nonprofit school systems for the establishment of courses in nutrition education. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as the Congress considers necessary to carry out such purpose. Allows the Secretary to distribute funds directly to the school systems when the State education agency is unable to do so. Directs the Secretary to withhold not less than one percent of such funds in order to carry out research and development projects in nutritional information."
