Includes related drains and waterways in the authorization. States that development with respect to conservation and public recreation shall be in accordance with the Federal Water Project Recreation Act. Requires the integration of the Glen Elder unit with other Federal works constructed under the comprehensive plan approved by the Flood Control Act of December 22, 1944, as amended. Provides for the repayment of construction costs allocated to irrigation by irrigators using water from the unit. Prohibits the use of water from the unit to irrigate lands for the production of basic agricultural commodities if such use would result in an excess of such commodities for the marketing year. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to determine the rate of interest on the unpaid balance of the reimbursable cost of the unit. Authorizes the appropriation of $55,000,000 for construction of the unit subject to changes based on applicable engineering cost indexes."
