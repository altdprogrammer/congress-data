Title II: Amendments to the Energy Reorganization Act - Establishes, within the Atomic Energy Commission, an Office of Nuclear Materials and Facilities Safety. Asserts that the Director of such Office, and of all other Offices created by this Act, shall be appointed: (1) by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; (2) from among individuals who have distinguished themselves in the appropriate field; and (3) without regard to political affiliation. Substitutes such Office for the former Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. Charges the Director of the Office with licensing and regulation associated with the safety of processing, transporting and handling of nuclear materials. Creates, within the Commission, an Office of Nuclear Materials and Facilities Safeguards, to be headed by a Director. Substitutes such Office for the former Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards. Charges the Director of the Office with responsibility for construction and operation of nuclear reactors except for those reactors which contain minimal amounts of special nuclear materials which the Director specifically exempts by regulation. Forms, within such Office, the Safeguards Protective Force to provide physical protection of production and utilization facilities and of special nuclear materials in transportation. Requires the Director of such Office to: (1) consult with the Director of Nuclear Materials and Facilities Safeguards with regard to the purpose, the number of research projects, and the development and demonstration for nuclear safeguards, and (2) negotiate arrangements with foreign safeguards organizations and the International Atomic Energy Agency for joint undertakings in safeguards research, development, and demonstration, and to coordinate domestic safeguards research with that of such organizations, subject to the Commission's approval."
