Directs the Secretary to provide for an emergency standard to take effect immediately after publication in the Federal Register if he determines (1) that there is clear and recognized evidence of employees being exposed to serious danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards, and (2) that such emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger. Requires the Secretary to provide at least twenty-four hours advance notice to the employer to be inspected that an inspection will be made where (1) such notice would afford the employer an opportunity to have qualified management personnel or consultants present during the inspection and (2) where the Secretary has determined that such notice would not unreasonably hamper or defeat the purposes of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Directs the Secretary to visit the workplace of employers for the purposes of affording consultation and advice to such employers, upon the request of the employers."
