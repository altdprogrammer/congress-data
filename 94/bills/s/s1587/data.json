    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 5247 passed in lieu) =Title I: General Provisions= - Provides that upon the application of any State, political subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe, the Secretary of Commerce is authorized, under the Public Works and Economic Development Act, to make grants for the purpose of increasing the Federal contribution to a public works project for which Federal financial assistance is authorized. States that any grant made for a public works project under this Act shall be in such amount as may be necessary to make the Federal share of the cost of such project 100 percent. Directs the Secretary to provide financial assistance to federally assisted projects authorized and for which funds have been obligated at the time of enactment of the Public Works Employment Act of 1975 which because of rapid increases in wages or cost of materials cannot be initiated and completed within the amount obligated. States that to be eligible for such assistance, the State, or political subdivision thereof, Indian tribes, public or private nonprofit group or association, or other eligible applicants to which Federal financial assistance is provided must submit an application to the Secretary setting forth information on the project, job effectiveness of the project, and the benefits to the community or region served by the project. Authorizes the Secretary, upon the application of any State, political subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe, to make grants for construction, renovation, repair, or other improvement of local public works facilities. Gives priority to grants made under this Act where such funding will initiate construction within ninety days of application approval. Limits assistance under this Act to areas designated by the Secretary of Labor as an area with an unemployment rate equal to or in excess of 6.5 percent for the most recent three months or any areas designated pursuant to the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973. Requires that 70 percent of the funds to be distributed under the job opportunities program shall be distributed to areas having unemployment in excess of the national average for the most recent three months, where the national average equals or exceeds 6.5 percent. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to expedite and give priority to grant applications submitted for such areas having unemployment in excess of the national average rate of unemployment for the most recent three consecutive months, and requires that 70 percent of the funds appropriated pursuant to this Act shall be available only for such grants. Authorizes appropriations of $1,000,000,000 to carry out such grant provisions during fiscal year 1976. Provides that under the business development program of the Public Works and Economic Development Act, the annual appropriations for the purpose of purchasing evidences of indebtedness, paying interest supplement to or on behalf of private entities making and participating in loans, and guaranteeing loans, shall not exceed $200,000,000 for fiscal year 1976. Makes grants under the Act available only for projects which can be initiated and substantially completed within 12 months of allocation. Authorizes an additional $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 1976 for the Job Opportunities Program. =Title II: Antirecession Provisions= - Authorizes emergency support grants to States and local governments to coordinate budget-related actions by such governments with Federal efforts to stimulate economic recovery. Authorizes appropriation for 12 calendar quarters for emergency support grants of $125,000,000, plus $62,500,000 times the number of one-half percentage points by which the rate of seasonally adjusted national unemployment for the most recent calendar quarter exceeded 6 percent. Disallows such formula grants where the next to most recent calendar quarter did not have such an unemployment rate in excess of 6 percent. Requires that one-third of such funds go to States and two-thirds to local governments. Sets forth formulae for determining the State and local government percentages of such funds. Directs the Secretary of Labor to reserve specified portions of such funds for making emergency support grants to State or local governments in severe fiscal difficulty, for the purpose of maintaining basic services. Sets forth criteria for determining \"severe fiscal difficulty.\" Requires governments applying for such funds to: (1) submit a program for maintaining public employment and basic services; (2) provide reports containing such information as the Secretary may require to carry out the provisions of this title; and (3) expend such funds within 6 months. Sets forth sanctions to be implemented should governments receiving such funds discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or sex in programs authorized under this title. Requires a government receiving funds under this title to certify that it has made substantial economies in its operations and that without grants under this title it will not be able to maintain essential services without increasing taxes. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress after each calendar quarter on his actions under this title. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office and the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations to conduct a study to determine the most effective means by which the Federal Government can stabilize the national economy during periods of excess expansion and high inflation through programs directed toward State and local governments. =Title III: Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments= - Changes the formula by which water pollution control funds are allotted to the States under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act."
