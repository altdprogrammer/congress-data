States that such program shall provide, among other things, for the written notification to each such owner of such land or water or interest therein to the effect that it is necessary for the United States to acquire such land, water or interests in connection with its civil works program. Requires such notification to further include: (1) information as to the right of any such owner to receive an itemized listing from the Corps of Engineers of the amount offered for the purchase of the property being acquired; (2) information as to the right of the owner to request review of the amount being offered; and (3) information as to other assistance which the Corps can make to displaced landowners. Directs that such program further provide for the establishment from time to time of land review panels to review the fair market value of property being acquired by the Corps of Engineers. Prohibits the condemnation of any land by the Corps within 90 days of the first notification of the owner that the Corps plans to acquire the property. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
