Authorizes the payment of specified court costs and fees to parties prevailing in any civil action against the United States. Authorizes the awarding of such court costs and fees in cases where the party does not prevail against the United States, if such an award would be in the interests of justice. Stipulates that any final judgment, and any final judgment for costs and fees, rendered by the Court of Claims against the United States, shall be paid out of any general appropriation therefor, on presentation to the General Accounting Office of a certification of such judgment by the clerk and the chief judge of such court. (Amends 28 U.S.C. 2412, 2517, 2678)"
