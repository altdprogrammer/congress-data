Sets forth regulations governing the apportionment of benefits and the crediting of coverage based on periods of coverage in this country and a foreign country. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to prevent the withholding of social security taxes from an individual during any period when such individual's income is subject to the social security taxes of another country."
