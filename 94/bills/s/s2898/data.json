    "text": "United States Postal Service Improvements Act - Imposes a ban on rate increases for specified classes of mail pending the adoption by law of an authorization of appropriations deemed necessary to provide for the efficient movement and delivery of such classes of mail. Authorizes the appropriation to the United States Postal Service of such sums as may be necessary as reimbursement for the maintenance of services during the period for which rate increases are prohibited. Revises the method of fixing postal rates and fees by requiring the Board of Governors of the Postal Service to transmit to the Congress any proposed increase in such rates and fees at least 90 days before the effective date of such increase. Stipulates that such increase shall become effective unless before the end of the first period of 60 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after the proposed increase is transmitted, either House adopts a resolution disapproving the proposed increase. Details procedural rules relating to the consideration of resolutions disapproving proposed postal rate increases. Directs the Comptroller General to study the desirability of closing any existing postal facilities the anticipated construction needs of the Postal Service through the year 2000, and the present methods of transporting mail. Prohibits the closing of any postal facility until the completion of the Comptroller Generals' study."
