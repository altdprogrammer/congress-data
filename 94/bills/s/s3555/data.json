    "text": "Voluntary Standards and Certification Act - Title I: National Standardization - Requires the Federal Trade Commission to promulgate minimum requirements for uniform standards development procedures for those in the private sector who set standards for products including procedures for making appeals from the decisions of any such standards-setting body. Permits the Commission to enforce the procedures set forth pursuant to this Act upon its own initiative or upon written petition filed with it by any interested person. Provides that any appeal decision with respect to a standards setting decision shall consider the effect of such standard upon competition and consumers. Requires any private organization developing standards or certifying products to obtain certification from the Secretary of Commerce. Requires the Secretary to issue such certification if he finds that such organization meets the minimum requirements promulgated by the Commission. Authorizes the Secretary to grant financial assistance to nonprofit standards- development organizations to insure representation of consumers, small business, and other interests in decisions. Requires all Federal agencies to utilize standards set by certified private organizations whenever possible to avoid duplication of effort. States that appeals bodies established by private organizations shall have no powers of enforcement except those given them by the organizations creating such bodies. Title II: International Standardization - Establishes a Division of Standards and Certifications within the Bureau of Standards of the Department of Commerce to develop the resources, facilities, and expertise necessary to assist the Secretary and the Commission. Requires the Secretary, through the Division, to provide for and assist appropriate participation by private nonprofit organizations in international standardization activities as representatives of the United States. Requires the Secretary to make arrangements for direct governmental participation in such international standardization activities where the Secretary determines private participation is insufficient or cannot be established. Requires the Secretary to list all international standards and certification systems unless to do so would not be in the public interest. Establishes an Interagency Committee on International Standardization Policy and a Public Committee on International Standardization Policy to provide policy guidance to the Secretary in carrying out his duties under this Act. Establishes procedures for petitioning the Secretary to delist a particular standard or certification system and for judicial review. Title III: Accreditation - Requires the Secretary, through the Division, to set forth procedures to establish a voluntary national laboratory accreditation program to accredit certification laboratories for a class of technology or a specific product if he finds it is in the public interest. Requires the Secretary to establish a criteria committee to establish criteria to accredit such laboratories. Sets forth procedures for the development of such criteria and the accreditation of such laboratories, both domestic and foreign. Provides procedures for the removal, withdrawal, or termination of accreditation. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - Creates the position of Director of the Division of Standards and Certifications. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Commission: $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1978; $2,500,000 for fiscal year 1979; and $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1980; and to the Secretary of Commerce $6,000,000 for fiscal year 1978; $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1979; and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1980, to carry out this Act."
