    "text": "Catastrophic Health Insurance and Medical Assistance Reform Act - Title I: Catastrophic Illness Insurance - Establishes a Catastrophic Health Insurance Program under the Social Security Act. Sets forth the eligibility criteria for individuals. Provides that every individual who: (1) is a resident of the United States; and (2) is a citizen of, or a lawfully admitted alien in the United States shall be entitled to catastrophic health insurance benefits provided by this Act in cases where he is not covered by an approved employer plan. Delimits the scope of benefits, including hospital and related insurance benefits (hospital, post-hospital, and home health services) and medical and other health benefits. Sets forth the terms and conditions governing payment of benefits and deductibles. Stipulates that in determining the amount of expenses incurred by an individual for medical and other health services in any calendar year, all amounts in excess of $500 incurred in connection with the treatment of mental, psychoneurotic or personality disorders of such individual, shall be disregarded. Provides for a general deductible from: (1) the reasonable costs of inpatient hospital services past the 60th day; and (2) inpatient hospital benefits of the higher of the following: (A) $2,000, or (B) $2,000 adjusted by the Consumer Price Index to reflect changes in fees for physician services (in $100 increments). Permits payments for specified mental health care services. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to promulgate regulations prescribing standards designed to assure that services consisting of the furnishing of blood or blood products, or the application of procedures or courses of treatment which are experimental or extraordinarily complex, will be provided only when such services are appropriate to the health care needs of the patient. Creates, in the United States Treasury, a Federal Catastrophic Health Insurance Trust Fund to provide a reserve for payment of benefits authorized by this Act. States that individuals covered under approved employer or self-employed plans shall be entitled to those benefits rather than the benefits provided by the catastrophic health insurance plan. Defines the term \"employer plan\" as meaning an insurance policy, contract, or other arrangement entered into between an employer and a carrier under which the carrier, in consideration of premiums or other periodic payments, undertakes to pay for the costs of health services received by the employer's employees. Requires that the coverage provided under such plans must include a package of benefits which is the same as that provided by the Federal catastrophic health insurance benefits plan established under this Act. Sets forth additional requirements governing employer health plans. Establishes an Actuarial Committee to prepare and recommend annually to the Secretary a Table of Values of Catastrophic Health Insurance Coverage, which shall establish the actuarial value of one year's catastrophic health insurance coverage for employers, carriers, and others involved in the programs. Allows an income tax credit under the Internal Revenue Code for the actuarial value of catastrophic health insurance coverage for the self-employed and for employees covered under approved employer plans. Title II: Medical Assistance Plan for Low-Income People - Provides, for low-income individuals and families, assistance toward the costs of necessary hospital, skilled nursing facility, medical and other health care services. Guarantees free choice by inpatients of health services from any person, institution, or agency qualified under this Act. Permits individuals the option of obtaining other health insurance protection. Describes the medical assistance plan, what individuals are eligible to receive its health benefits, and the application procedure. Enumerates the scope of benefits under the plan, including: (1) 60 days of inpatient hospital services; (2) skilled nursing facility services; and (3) home health services. Prescribes the co-payment requirements and procedures of persons eligible for benefits. Makes special provisions relating to Medicaid eligibles and the circumstances under which such persons are eligible for health benefits under this title. Authorizes the Secretary to require consolidation of facilities of carriers and intermediaries in geographic regions with minimum size populations of persons covered under this title. Creates the Medical Coverage Trust Fund to consist of gifts and bequests and held by a Board of Trustees. Makes provisions for State contributions to the Fund. Authorizes appropriations to the Fund for each fiscal year of sums necessary to carry out the purposes of this title. Sets forth the definitions of terms used in this title, including the meaning of \"income,\" \"health care expenses,\" and \"inpatient hospital services. Prohibits exclusion by employers of specified employees from coverage under group health insurance plans. Title III: Private Basic Health Insurance Certification Program - States that any insurer may provide any health insurance policy to the Secretary for his examination and certification. Sets forth the standards under which the Secretary shall not certify any such insurance policy. Title IV: Amendments to the Medicare Program Immunizations - Authorizes payments for immunizations which the Secretary determines are appropriate under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, but only if provided on a schedules allowance basis, as determined under regulations promulgated by the Secretary. Extends coverage of the renal disease program authorized under such Act to specified individuals not previously covered. Title V: General Provisions Relating to Health Insurance Under Social Security Act - Requires the Secretary to establish a separate organizational unit within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare under the direction of the Assistant Secretary for Health Insurance Administration, who shall report directly to the Secretary and who shall have policy and administrative responsibility for the programs established by this Act and by the unemployment compensation, medicare, medicaid, and renal disease programs of the Social Security Act. Expresses the policy of Congress to encourage and expand philanthropic support for health care."
