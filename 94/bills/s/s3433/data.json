Prohibits the importation of dairy products into the United States unless the Secretary of Agriculture has certified that such products are wholesome and pure and that the plants in which such products were manufactured or processed comply with minimum standards of sanitation prescribed by the Secretary. Requires that the standards established under this title be comparable to those imposed upon domestic dairy products. Directs the Secretary to inspect imported dairy products and to require that such products be accompanied by a certificate of compliance indicating that such products conform to the minimum standards established under this Act. Provides for the assessment of fees on imported dairy products to cover the cost of inspections and certificates required by this title. Title II: Meat and Meat Products - Prohibits the importation of meat or meat products capable of use as human food into the United States unless tests have been conducted to determine whether such articles contain any substance prohibited in any carcass or meat product from any domestically produced animal or contain a level of any substance in excess of the maximum allowable level for domestically produced meat products. Stipulates that such tests may be conducted by persons in the exporting country if such individuals have been certified to do so under the same criteria as persons certified by the Department of Agriculture to conduct such test on articles of animals produced in the United States. Provides for the assessment of fees on such imported products to cover the costs of inspections and testing required under this title. Title III: Study; Effective Date - Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to conduct a study to determine the most practicable and effective method of requiring imported meat and dairy products to bear lables identifying such products as being imported."
