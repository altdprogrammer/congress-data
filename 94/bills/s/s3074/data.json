    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments - Provides, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, that included within the definition of aliens are those persons coming temporarily to the United States for a period of not more than a year to perform other than exceptional services or labor if the Secretary of Labor has determined that there are not sufficient workers available at the aliens' destination who are willing and able to perform such services or labor. Limits the number of aliens born in any foreign state or dependent area located in the Eastern Hemisphere who may be issued immigrant visas or who may otherwise acquire the status of lawfully admitted aliens for permanent residence to 45,000 in the first three quarters of any fiscal year and to 170,000 in any fiscal year. Limits such immigrant visas to aliens born in any foreign state of the Western Hemisphere or in the Canal Zone, or in a dependent area located in the Western Hemisphere, to 32,000 in the first three quarters of any fiscal year and to 120,000 in any fiscal year. Provides that, exclusive of conditional entries, the number of aliens entering the United States chargeable to any single foreign state may not exceed 20,000 and to any single dependent area may not exceed 600 in any fiscal year. Sets forth criteria for determining which foreign state or dependent area will be charged for each immigrant. Entitles the Attorney General to admit to the United States any immigrant inadmissable solely because he was not entitled to an exemption to quota limitations if he could not have known before he left a foreign country to enter the United States that he would be excluded by such limitations. States that no immigrant who has been admitted or paroled into the United States may apply to have his status changed to permanent resident alien if such alien was admitted in transit without visa or if such alien accepts employment which has not been authorized by the Attorney General prior to filing such application for change of status. Prohibits the employment of any alien not lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States unless such employment is authorized by the Attorney General. Prescribes a civil penalty on an employer or one who refers such alien for employment of $500 for the first violation of this Act and a penalty of not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 for subsequent violations of this Act. Provides that violations will be determined at a hearing on record conducted before an immigration officer. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to disclose to the Attorney General the name and address of any alien not a permanent resident of the United States who is receiving benefits under the Social Security Act. Provides that when changing the status of Cuban aliens under special provisions of the law to that of permanent resident alien, the Secretary of State shall not reduce the number of visas to be issued. States that such provision shall not apply to an alien admitted or paroled into the United States after the enactment of this Act. Repeals the provisions of present law providing immediate relatives of a citizen of the United States with the exemption from entrance quotas accorded special immigrants. States that such revocation of privilege only applies to such immediate relatives who have not established a priority date on the basis of an entitlement in existence immediately prior to the effective date of this Act which is set by this Act as the first day of the first month after the expiration of 90 days following enactment of this Act."
