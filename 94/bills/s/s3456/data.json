    "text": "Uniform Criteria Act - Title I: Assignment Provisions - Stipulates that assignment by an educational agency of a student to the school nearest such student's place of residence which provides the appropriate grade level and type of education is not a denial of equal protection of the laws unless such assignment is made to segregate students on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin. Stipulates that the failure of an educational agency to attain a balance, on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, or socioeconomic status, of students among its schools shall not constitute a denial of equal protection of the laws. Title II: Remedies - Limits Federal courts, departments, and agencies, in formulating a remedy for a denial of equal protection of the laws, to such remedies as are essential for correction. Restricts Federal courts, departments, and agencies, when formulating remedies involving student transportation, to specified remedies. Prohibits Federal courts, departments, and agencies from ordering the implementation of a plan that would require the transportation of any student to a school other than the school closest or next closest to the student's residence. Allows educational agencies to apply to have court orders or desegregation plans under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 reopened and modified to comply with this Act. Title III: Definitions - Defines terms for purposes of this Act. Defines a \"dual school system\" as one in which students are assigned to schools solely on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin for the purpose of segregating such students in the schools of the system. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends the Emergency School Aid Act to repeal the authority of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants for the purpose of conducting metropolitan area integration projects."
