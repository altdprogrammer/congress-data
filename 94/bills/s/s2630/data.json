Provides that in determining appropriate work projects priority shall be given to projects that are highly labor intensive, may be initiated promptly, and will result in substantial natural resource or environmental improvements. Directs the Secretaries to jointly extend the grant program for State projects so as to provide increased employment of young adults to develop, preserve, and maintain non-Federal public lands and waters within the States.
