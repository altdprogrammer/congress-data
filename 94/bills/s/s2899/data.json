    "text": "Postal Reorganization Act Amendments - Authorizes appropriations for the United States Postal Service for fiscal year 1976. Requires the Postal Service, in requesting the appropriation of funds authorized under this Act, to submit specified information to the appropriate congressional committees. Directs that all revenues and fees collected by the Postal Service be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury of the United States. Directs the Postal Service to provide door or curbline delivery to all permanent residential addresses during any fiscal year for which the Congress has appropriated all of the funds authorized to be appropriated to the Service. Allows cluster box delivery service in lieu of door or curbline service where the appropriate unit of local government has approved the provision of cluster box service. Requires the President to appoint members of the Postal Rate Commission, with the advice and consent of the Senate. Increases to ten months the time limit for recommended decisions by the Commission on requests submitted by the Postal Service for alteration of rates, fees or mail classifications. Revises criteria regarding maximum temporary rates and fees established by the Postal Service where the Commission exceeds such time limit. Allows temporary changes in rates, fees, and mail classification to remain in effect up to 150 days after the Commission transmits its recommended decision to the Postal Service. Includes among the factors to be considered by the Commission in making a recommended decision on a request for changes in rates, fees, or service the educational, cultural, scientific, and informational value to the recipient of mail matter. Stipulates that final Commission action pertaining to rate and service complaints and to requested rate, service, and mail classification changes shall be taken by a vote of the majority of the Commissioners. Requires the Postal Service to keep the Commission fully and currently informed with respect to the operation of the Postal Service. Empowers the Commission to initiate reviews and hearings relating to the activities of the Board of Governors and the Postal Service in connection with the fixing of postal rates and mail classifications.

Redefines \"qualified nonprofit organization\", \"agricultural\", and \"agricultural organizations\", for purposes of preferential postal rates. Qualifies specified State conservation publication for such rates. Permits any member of a private nonprofit organization (other than a political committee) to deposit any mailable matter relating to the activities or functions of such organization in any letterbox, postage free if: (1) such member engages in such activity on a voluntary basis without reimbursement from such organization; and (2) such organization has obtained written approval to engage in such activity from the postmaster for the district in which such activity is to be conducted. Authorizes appointment of the Postmaster General and Deputy Postmaster General by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Establishes the Commission on Postal Service. Directs the Commission: (1) to study the public service functions of the Postal Service and recommend to what extent and by what means such functions may be defined and costs thereof reasonably estimated; (2) to identify any difference between the costs that the Postal Service should reasonably expect to incur in providing services in accordance with codified policy directives and the revenues that the Postal Service may reasonably be expected to receive from rates and fees for such services; and (3) to determine, the extent to which the public service functions of the Postal Service should be supported by appropriations. Instructs the Commission to study present ratemaking procedures and develop recommendation's for more expeditious and economical procedure, and to determine the causes of the increases in postal costs that have occurred since the enactment of the Postal Reorganization Act. Requires all proceedings of the Commission to be open to the chairman of the appropriate Congressional committees or their designees and notice of such proceedings to be given to such chairmen or designees. Requires the Commission to transmit to the President and to each House of the Congress detailed interim progress reports four times annually, and a final report containing a detailed statement of its findings and recommendations, together with any individual views, within two years after the date of the enactment of this Act.
