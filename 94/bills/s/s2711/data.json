    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1975-12-12", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #585 (86-1)) =Title I:= Federal-Aid Highway Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to apportion for fiscal years 1977 and 1978 the sums authorized to be appropriated for such years for expenditure on the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. Authorizes the appropriation of funds out of the Highway Trust Fund for specified highway programs, including the Federal-aid primary system, Federal-aid community service system, and forest highways. Establishes the Federal-aid community service system which shall consist of the Federal-aid nonurbanized system and the Federal-aid urbanized system. Provides that the Secretary of Commerce may withdraw his approval of any route on the Interstate System within an urbanized area, if he determines that the route is not essential. States that when the Secretary withdraws his approval, a sum equal to the Federal share of the cost to complete the withdrawn route shall be available to the Secretary to incur obligations for the Federal share of the Federal-aid primary system and the Federal-aid non-urbanized system (presently such funds are made available for nonhighway public mass transit projects). Directs that States receiving a transfer of mileage may not be eligible for the optional use of Interstate funds as outlined above. Revises the apportionment formula for expenditure upon the Federal-aid systems. Directs that two-thirds of such funds shall be allocated to the Federal-aid primary system (presently one-third). Increases from $50,000,000 to $150,000,000 the amount authorized in each fiscal year for the repair or reconstruction of highways, roads, and trails which suffer serious damage as a result of natural disasters. Provides that the Secretary shall not approve any program for projects in any urbanized area unless he finds that such projects are in accordance with a continuing comprehensive transportation process and that such process includes public participation. Requires each State to have a program which provides for highway design and maintenance, traffic control and surveillance of traffic for detection and correction of high accident locations. Directs all States to have projects to improve highway safety. Authorizes the Secretary to deduct up to 3 3/4 percent of sums authorized to be appropriated for expenditure upon the Federal-aid safer roads system. Authorizes the Secretary to engage in research on specified areas of highway transportation, including passenger terminal facilities, transportation of hazardous materials, and the economic and environmental impact of highway transportation. Provides that not more than 1 1/2 percent of the Federal-aid systems funds shall be available for expenditure for engineering and economic surveys with respect to future statewide transportation programs and local public transportation systems. Directs the Secretary to undertake a complete study of the financing of completion of the Interstate Highway System. Authorizes the Secretary to determine the cost of repairing the damage to Alaska highways caused by heavy truck traffic during construction of the trans-Alaska pipeline. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to make an investigation and study the need for Federal assistance in the construction of highways for the transportation of coal and other energy-related uses. Establishes the National Transportation Policy Study Commission to study national transportation policy and to recommend programs and policies. =Title II:= Highway Safety Amendments - Directs the Secretary to grant a waiver of highway safety standards when requested by a State so that the State may undertake alternative highway safety measures unless he determines that such alternatives do not have a potential for reducing highway accidents. Provides that funds apportioned under this Act to any State that does not have a highway safety program approved by the Secretary, shall be reduced by not less than 50 percent of the amount that would otherwise be apportioned to the State. States that no such safety program shall include any requirement compelling a State to enforce any regulation requiring motorcycle operators or riders to wear safety helmets. Authorizes the appropriation of funds to carry out highway safety programs. States that to the extent that any provision of this Act provides new or increased authority to enter into contracts under which outlays will be made from funds other than the Highway Trust Fund, such new or increased authority shall be effective for any fiscal year only in such amounts as are provided in annual appropriation Acts."
