    "text": "Natural Gas Emergency Standby Act - Title I: - Sets forth congressional findings and purposes applicable to this Act. Title II: Interstate Pipeline Emergency Natural Gas Purchases Act - States that the purpose of this title is to grant the Federal Power Commission (FPC) authority to allow interstate pipeline companies with insufficient natural gas for their high priority consumers to acquire natural gas from intrastate sources and other interstate pipeline companies on an emergency basis free from the provisions of the Natural Gas Act. Revises the Natural Gas Act to permit the FPC to exempt from the provisions of the Natural Gas Act the transportation, sale, transfer or exchange of natural gas in connection with emergency acquisitions of natural gas by interstate pipelines. Exempts transactions between a producer, interstate pipeline company, intrastate pipeline company or gas distributing company, to or with an interstate pipeline company which does not have a sufficient supply of natural gas to fulfill the requirements of its high priority consumers of natural gas, and which is curtailing deliveries pursuant to a curtailment plan on file with the FPC. Limits exemptions to 180 days in duration. Title III: Curtailed Consumers Emergency Natural Gas Purchases Act - States that the purpose of this title is to allow curtailed high priority consumers of natural gas to purchase natural gas from the intrastate market by enabling them to arrange for the transportation of such gas by regulated interstate pipeline companies. Provides, under the Natural Gas Act, that FPC jurisdiction shall not extend to transportation by gas distributing companies of natural gas purchased under this title by curtailed high priority consumers. Provides explicit authority to the FPC to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity to transport natural gas purchased under this title, without the need to review and approve the price paid by a high priority consumer directly to the seller. Title IV: Emergency Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act Amendments - States the purpose of this title is to continue the conservation of natural gas and petroleum products by fostering the use of coal by powerplants and major fuel burning installations, and if coal cannot be utilized, to provide authority to prohibit the use of natural gas when petroleum products can be substituted. Extends FEA's recently expired authority to require conversion to coal by gas and oil burning powerplants and major fuel burning installations. Adds a new authority to require conversion from gas to oil where coal conversion is not feasible and certain other requirements are met, including a certification by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency that the particular powerplant or installation will be able to comply with the Clean Air Act while burning oil. Title V: Propane Standby Allocation Act - States that the purpose of this title is to provide standby authority for the President to allocate propane during periods of actual or threatened severe shortages of natural gas. Provides standby authority to the President to issue such orders and regulations as may be appropriate in order to provide for systematic allocation and pricing of propane. Requires findings that shortages of natural gas exist or are imminent and that such shortages constitute a threat to public health, safety or welfare. Sets forth criminal and civil sanctions for violation of regulations and orders made pursuant to this title, as well as authority to issue orders to insure compliance and to afford restitution to injured parties. Provides a defense under antitrust or contract law for failures or delays in providing, selling or offering for sale propane if such failures or delays result from compliance with this title. Prescribes administrative procedures, including the manner by which rulemakings are to be initiated. Sets forth the requirement for administrative procedures by which any inequities or hardships arising from the administration of the program can be prevented. Provides for judicial review by the Federal courts, including the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, of the provisions of this title and any rules, regulations or orders issued to carry out the purposes of this title. Provides injunctive and other remedies for insuring compliance. Specifies subpoena power and the authority to inspect premises, inventories, documents and other items to carry out the provisions of this title. Provides for paying witnesses' fees and mileages and for compelling attendance of witnesses. Establishes a private right of action based on any legal wrong suffered because of acts or practices arising out of this title. Provides, under the Federal Energy Administration Act, that any regulated pricing of propane may reflect factors other than the cost attributed to its production. Authorizes the President to delegate powers granted by this title to other offices, departments and agencies of the United States. Title VI: - Provides that the termination of this Act or of the authorities granted under it does not affect any action or pending proceedings not finally determined on such date, nor any action or proceedings based upon any act committed prior to such date. Preserves the validity of the remainder of this Act and its continuing application if any particular provision or application is held invalid."
