Directs that it shall be unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to send or receive anything of value for the purpose of committing any crime of terrorism. Specifies that it shall be unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to knowingly possess, or dispose of, anything of value gained by any crime of terrorism. Provides that a violation of this Act shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000 or ten years imprisonment, or both. Requires that any person convicted in the United States of a crime of terrorism which resulted in the death of a hostage shall be imprisoned for life and shall be ineligible for any parole, time off for good behavior or any mitigation of sentence whatsoever. Grants the United States a civil right of action to impose a constructive trust upon all property acquired by violation of any Federal criminal statue and upon the fruit or product thereof."
