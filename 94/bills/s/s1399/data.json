    "text": "Victims of Crime Act - Declares that the purpose of this Act is to promote the public welfare by establishing a means of meeting the financial needs of the innocent victims of violent crimes or their surviving dependents and intervenors acting to prevent the commission of crime or to assist in the apprehension of suspected criminals. Establishes a three-member Violent Crimes Compensation Board within the Department of Justice. Gives to the Board specified administrative powers. States that the Board shall order the payment of reimbursement (1) in the case of the personal injury of an intervenor or victim, to or on behalf of that person; or (2) in the case of the death of the intervenor or victim, to or on behalf of the surviving dependent or dependents of either of them. Provides that the Board shall determine the amount of compensation under this Act: (1) in the case of a claim by an intervenor or his surviving dependent or dependents, by computing the net losses of the claimant; and (2) in the case of a claim by a victim or his surviving dependent or dependents, by comptuing the pecuniary losses of the claimant. Places various limitations and requirements in order for reimbursement, including the provision that no order for compensation shall be in excess of $50,000, including lump-sum and periodic payments. Provides that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia shall have jurisdiction to review all final orders of the Board. Lists the crimes to which this Act is applicable. Creates the Criminal Victim Indemnity Fund which shall be the repository of: (1) criminal fines paid in the various courts of the United States; (2) additional amounts that may be appropriated to the Fund as provided by law, and (3) other specified amounts. Provides that the Fund shall be utilized only for the purposes of this Act. Establishes the Advisory Council on the Victims of Crime to review the administration of this Act and the various programs of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Requires the Board to transmit an annual report to Congress. Provides that any court of the United States may impose a maximum fine of $10,000, to be deposited into the Criminal Victim Indemnity Fund, on any person convicted of an offense resulting in personal injury, property loss, or death, in addition to any other penalty that might be imposed. Authorizes the Federal Prison Industries to withhold from the wages of any offender employed in such Industries an amount not to exceed 10 percent of such wages. Directs that such funds shall be deposited in the Fund. Authorizes Federal grants to pay the costs of State programs which reimburse victims of violent crime which are substantially comparable in coverage and limitations to the provisions of this Act. (Adds 18 U.S.C. 4129)"
