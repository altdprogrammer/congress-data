    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare with amendment, S. Rept. 94-439) Construction Industry Collective Bargaining Act - Establishes the Construction Industry Collective Bargaining Committee (CICBC) in the Department of Labor consisting of 10 members representing the viewpoint of employers, 10 members representing the viewpoint of national labor organizations, and up to three members representing the public. Requires that with respect to termination or modification of any collective bargaining agreement covering employees in the construction industry, unions affiliated with any standard national construction labor organization, and any employer or employer association dealing with them, must give notice to their respective national organizations 60 days prior to the expiration date of the agreement. Authorizes the CICBC to take jurisdiction over a labor matter within a specified 90-day period. Provides that when the Committee takes jurisdiction, strikes and lockouts are prohibited for a period of up to 30 days following the expiration date of the contract. Provides that when the Committee has taken jurisdiction and has requested participation of the appropriate national organizations, no new contract between the parties shall take effect without approval of the standard national union involved, unless the Committee has suspended or terminated the operation of this approval requirement. Authorizes the Committee to promote and assist in the formation of voluntary national craft or branch boards; to make recommendations as deemed appropriate to facilitate area bargaining structures; to improve productivity; to promote stability of employment; to improve dispute settlement procedures; and to make other suggestions, as it deems appropriate, relating to collective bargaining in the construction industry. Authorizes appropriations as may be necessary to carry out this Act. Provides that this Act shall expire on December 31, 1980. Requires the CICBC to make annual reports to the President and the Congress on its activities."
