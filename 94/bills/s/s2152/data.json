    "text": "Intergovernmental Law Enforcement Cooperation and Reorganization Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to provide: (1) a new organization structure for improved performance, coordination, and evaluation of firearms control functions at the Federal level; and (2) more effective coordination between Federal, State, and local government agencies in an effort to assist States and localities in improving interstate and local regulation of illicit handgun traffic. Defines terms used in this Act. Title I: Gun Control Transfers - Transfers to the Attorney General all functions of the Secretary of the Treasury under the Gun Control Act. Establishes within the Department of Justice the Firearms Safety and Abuse Control Administration, to be headed by an Administrator appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Requires the Attorney General to submit an annual report to the Congress covering the activities of the Administration, including: (1) an assessment and evaluation of specific programs of Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies to reduce illicit handgun traffic; (2) a description of the nature, extent, and effect of Federal, State and local law enforcement agency intelligence operations relating to illicit handgun traffic; and (3) such recommendations, including recommendations for additional legislation, as the Attorney General deems appropriate. Stipulates that in the exercise of the functions transferred under this title, the Attorney General shall have the same authority as that vested in the agency or authority exercising such functions immediately preceding their transfer. Title II: Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations - Directs the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, in consultation with the United States Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities, and representatives of Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies, to investigate, analyze, and report within six months of the enactment of this Act upon: (1) intergovernmental problems involved in controlling illicit handgun traffic; and (2) the effectiveness of the Gun Control Act, particularly the requirements for licensing of manufacturers, importers, and dealers."
