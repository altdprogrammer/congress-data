Authorizes the President to exempt States from this Act in order to avoid hardship or to conserve fuel. Exempts a State lying in more than one time zone or which is not contiguous to any other State and lies entirely within one time zone. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to report to Congress on the operation and effects of this Act. Suspends until after the last Sunday of October 1977 the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to modify the limits of any time zone. Authorizes the Federal Communications Commission to make such adjustments with respect to hours of operation of daytime standard amplitude modulation broadcast stations as shall be consistent with the public's interest in receiving interference-free service."
