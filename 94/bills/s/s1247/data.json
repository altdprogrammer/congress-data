Rept. 94-376) Military Construction Authorization Act - =Title I: Army= - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to establish or develop military installations and facilities by acquiring, constructing, and rehabilitating permanent or temporary public works, including land acquisition, utilities, and equipment for specified acquisition and construction. Authorizes the Secretary to establish or develop Army installations and facilities by proceeding with construction made necessary by changes in Army missions and responsibilities. =Title II: Navy= - Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to establish or develop military installations by acquiring, constructing, and rehabilitating permanent or temporary public works, including land acquisition, utilities, and equipment for specified acquisition and construction. Authorizes the Secretary to establish or develop Navy installations and facilities by proceeding with construction made necessary by changes in Navy missions and responsibilities. =Title III: Air Force= - Authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to establish or develop military installations by acquiring, constructing, and rehabilitating permanent or temporary public works, including land acquisition, utilities, and equipment for specified acquisition and construction. Authorizes the Secretary to establish or develop Air Force installations and facilities by proceeding with construction made necessary by changes in Air Force missions and responsibilities. =Title IV: Defense Agencies= - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to establish or develop military installations by acquiring, constructing, and rehabilitating, permanent or temporary public works, including land acquisition, utilities, and equipment for specified acquisition and construction. =Title V: Military Family Housing= - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to construct or acquire sole interest in existing family housing units in the numbers and at the locations enumerated in this Act, but no family housing construction shall be commenced at any such locations in the United States until the Secretary shall have consulted with the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development as to the availability of suitable private housing at such locations. States that with respect to the family housing units authorized to be constructed, the Secretary of Defense is authorized to acquire sole interest in privately owned or Department of Housing and Urban Development held family housing units in lieu of constructing all or a portion of the family housing authorized by this Act. Sets limits on the cost of housing units which may be acquired. =Title VI: General Provisions= - Authorizes appropriations as may be necessary for the purposes of this Act, and sets limitations on the appropriations for public works projects authorized by titles I - V. Provides that any of the amounts specified intitles I, II, and III, and IV of this Act may, in the discretion of the Secretary or Director of the defense agency concerned, be increased by 5 percent when inside the United States (other than Hawaii and Alaska), and by 10 percent when outside the United States or in Hawaii and Alaska, if he determines that such increase is required for the sole purpose of meeting unusual variations in cost, and could not have been reasonably anticipated at the time such estimate was submitted to the Congress. Provides that the total cost of all construction and acquisition in each such title may not exceed the total amount authorized to be appropriated in that title. Permits real property and associated personal property, which have been determined excess as the result of a defense installation realignment or closure, to be leased to State or local governments pending final disposition of such property, if such action would facilitate State or local economic adjustment. =Title VII: Guard and Reserve Forces Facilities= - Guard and Reserve Forces Facilities Authorization Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to establish or develop additional facilities for the Guard and Reserve Forces, including the acquisition of land."
