    "text": "Occupational Safety and Health Act Amendments - Directs the Secretary of Labor, under the Occupational Safety and Health Act to accompany any rule which modifies an occupational safety or health standard with a statement that summarizes its social and economic impact on affected employers and consumers and a determination that the benefit to be derived from such standard justifies such proposal. Prohibits any standard promulgated under the Act from requiring any employer to phase out, change, or replace existing equipment or facilities before the normal life of that equipment expires. Permits the use of protective equipment, controls, and technological procedures by the employer where selected options will afford adequate protection to the employee and the use of such equipments controls, or procedures does not create a new danger to the health and safety of the employees affected. Directs the Secretary to provide for an emergency standard to take effect immediately after publication in the Federal Register, if he determines that employees are being exposed to serious danger and that such standard is necessary to protect employees. Requires the Secretary to provide at least twenty-four hours advance notice to the employer to be inspected where such notice will enable the employer to have qualified consultants present and where such notice will not hamper or defeat the purposes of this Act. Provides that the commencement of proceedings under the Act shall operate as a stay of the order of the court of the lesser of ninety days or until such time that there is a ruling on the request for such stay. Requires the Secretary to visit the workplaces of employers for the purpose of affording consultation and advise with respect to training and employee education."
