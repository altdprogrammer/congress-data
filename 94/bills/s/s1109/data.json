    "text": "Parole Commission Act - Creates as an agency of the Department of Justice the United States Parole Commission, the members of which shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Provides that the Attorney General shall designate from among the Commissioners one to serve as Chairman. Specifies the duties of the Chairman. Provides that the Parole Commission by majority vote, shall have the power: (1) to grant or deny any application or recommendation to parole any eligible person; (2) to impose reasonable conditions on any order granting parole; (3) to modify or revoke an order paroling any eligible person; and (4) establish the maximum length of time which any person whose parole has been revoked shall be required to serve, but in no case shall such time, together with such time as he previously served in connection with the offense for which he was paroled, be longer that the maximum term for which he was sentenced in connection with such offense; and where such revocation iis based upon a subsequent conviction of the parolee of any Federal, State or local crime committed subsequent to his release on parole, determine whether all or any part of the unexpired term being served at time of such parole shall run concurrently or consecutively with the sentence imposed for such subsequent offense. Makes a person eligible for parole after serving one-third of his term or after serving fifteen years of a life sentence or of a sentence of more than forty-five years. Sets forth the procedures for an appearance of a person before the Parole authority. Provides that a warrant for the taking of any person who is alleged to have violated his parole may be issued by the Commission within the maximum term or terms for which such prisoner was sentenced. States that such person shall be given a hearing, without unncessary delay, to determine if there is probable cause to believe that he has violated a condition of his parole. Provides that counsel may be appointed if the alleged violator is unable to retain counsel. Provides that a juvenile delinquent who has been committed and who, by his conduct, has given sufficient evidence that he has reformed, may be released on parole at any time under such conditions and regulations as the United States Parole Commission deems proper if it shall appear to the satisfaction of such Commission that the juvenile has substantially observed the rules of the institution to which he is confined, that there is a reasonable probability that such person will live and remain at liberty without violating the law, and if in the opinion of the Commission such release is not incompatible with the welfare of society. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the purposes of this Act."
