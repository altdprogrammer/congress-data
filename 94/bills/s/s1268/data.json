States the findings and policy of Congress with regard to maintaining for the American people an enduring wildlife heritage. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop a systematic planning program to guide the administration and management of the National Wildlife Refuge System, and its component units. Establishes, specifies, and classifies such component units. Provides that no lands within the system may be disposed of, nor may the administration or management of any unit of the system be transferred in whole or in part, unless the Secretary of the Interior has determined that such disposal or transfer will have no adverse impact on wildlife or human environments and has transmitted a report of his findings, including environmental impact, and recommendations to the President. Directs the Secretary to review all lands and waters contiguous to and within all units of the National Wildlife Refuge System in existence on the effective date of this Act and report his findings and recommendations to the President within three years with respect to lands and waters which should be acquired or withdrawn. Directs the Secretary to review lands and waters in the public domain, in proximity to urban areas, and all coastal and marine waters within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, to determine whether such lands and waters should be included within the System. Makes the National Wildlife Refuge Service responsible for the administration and management of the System."
