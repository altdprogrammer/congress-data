    "text": "(Reported to Sen. jointly from the Committees on Foreign Relations; & Atomic Energy with amndt., S. Rept. 94-1193) Nuclear Explosive Proliferation Control Act - Declares the purposes of this Act to be to insure the effective control by the United States over its exports of nuclear equipment, materials, and sensitive nuclear technology. Requires the United States to take such actions and institute such measures as are necessary and feasible to assure other nations which adhere to nuclear nonproliferation policies a reliable supply of nuclear fuel services. Directs the United States to institute initiatives: (1) to seek to negotiate international agreements to assure the peaceful uses of nuclear materials and technology; (2) to assure the international community of the United State's commitment to nuclear security; and (3) to assure the international community that the United States is committed to a strong International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and to a comprehensive safeguards program administered by such agency. Directs the President in concert with the IAEA and the nuclear exporting and importing nations to implement the policies and initiatives of this Act. Requires the Energy Research and Development Administration to establish and operate a safeguards and security training program for persons from countries which have or may acquire nuclear production and utilization facilities. Declares that any proposed agreement for cooperation is to be negotiated by the Secretary of State with the technical assistance and concurrence of the Administrator of Energy Research and Development, and submitted to the President. Authorizes the Congress to disapprove any proposed agreement for cooperation by the passage of a concurrent resolution stating such disapproval. Requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to furnish to the appropriate legislative committees of the Congress its views with respect to whether any such proposed agreement for cooperation contains adequate safeguards and other controls to insure that the export of any nuclear materials will not constitute an unreasonable risk to the common defense. Provides for coordination between the departments and agencies of the executive branch with respect to all subsequent arrangements significant for nuclear explosive purposes. Prescribes the authority of the Energy Research and Development Administration with respect to distributing special nuclear material other than under an export license. Declares that it is unlawful for any person to produce any special nuclear material outside of the United States except under specified circumstances. Sets forth the procedures and other requirements for the issuance of export licenses by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Enumerates criteria which the United States adopts governing its exports for peaceful nuclear uses of source material and special nuclear material. Prohibits the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from issuing any export license and the Energy Research and Development Administration from distributing any source or special nuclear material until it finds that the criteria set forth in this Act will be adhered to, and the concerned executive departments and agencies have expressed their approval. Authorizes the Commission to issue general licenses for domestic activites with respect to utilization and production facilities, if the Commission determines that such licensing will not constitute an unreasonable risk to the common defense and security. Directs the President to review all government activities relating to the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear explosive devices. Requires the President to make an annual report to the Congress on the Government's efforts to prevent such proliferation. Authorizes sums to be appropriated for the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission."
