Authorizes appropriations from the fund for municipal solid waste management plans, in accordance with guidelines established by the Administrator consistent with the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Imposes criminal penalties of up to a $10,000 fine and/or five years imprisonment for evasion of the charges imposed by this Act, or for knowing failure to collect charges imposed by this Act. Imposes additional penalties for failure to supply accurate information and for assisting in the furnishing of false information. Title II: General Provisions - Stipulates that nothing in this Act shall preclude States and localities from adopting more stringent solid waste standards. Imposes certain record-keeping requirements upon manufacturers of products covered by this Act. Establishes procedures for judicial review under this Act."
