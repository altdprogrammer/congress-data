Directs each Federal agency to: (1) develop alternatives to recommended courses of action in any proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concerning the impact on productivity; (2) provide appropriate support to initiatives, resolutions, and programs designed to maximize regional and international cooperation in anticipating and preventing actions adversely affecting productivity; and (3) make available to State and local governments, public institutions, industry, and individuals appropriate advice and information designed to maintain, enhance, and promote sustained productivity growth.
