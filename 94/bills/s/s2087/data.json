    "text": "States that the purpose of this Act is to provide a source of financial assistance for homeowners and builders to enable them to purchase and install solar heating equipment or combined solar heating and cooling equipment, primarily through the small business segment of the economy, while substantially reducing energy use. Authorizes the Small Business Administration, under the Small Business Act, to make loans to individuals and families owning and occupying one-to-four family residential structures to assist them in purchasing and installing qualified solar heating and cooling equipment. States that such loans may be made in an amount covering up to 75 percent of the cost of purchasing and installing the necessary equipment, and not exceeding amounts specified in this Act. Sets forth the terms and conditions governing the loans. Defines \"qualified solar heating equipment\" as meaning equipment which utilizes solar energy to provide heating for a residential structure and which is certified by the Administration as meeting minimum specified standards, including a requirement that the equipment must be designed to meet more than 40 percent of the total heating needs of the types of structure for which it is intended. Directs the Energy Research and Development Administration to establish procedures for periodic inspection and review of solar heating and cooling equipment models, and certifications. Directs the Administration to disseminate full, complete, and current information concerning recommended standards and types of qualified solar heating or solar heating and cooling equipment appropriate for use in residential structures of varying sizes and types and in various regions of the country. Establishes, under the Small Business Act, a solar heating and cooling loan fund for financing loans made pursuant to this Act. Sets a $600,000,000 limit on the total amount of loans, guarantees and other obligations entered into by the Administration which are outstanding at any one time for the purposes of this Act."
