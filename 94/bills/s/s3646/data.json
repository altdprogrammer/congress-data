Establishes additional penalties for assault on such persons with a deadly or dangerous weapon. Defines \"internationally protected person\" to mean a chief of state, head of government, or foreign minister, and any member of his family accompanying him. Establishes penalties for willfully intimidating, coercing, or harassing an official guest and for obstructing a foreign official in the performance of official duties. Establishes penalties for committing specified acts on or within 100 feet of any building or premises used by a foreign government, foreign official, or international organization for diplomatic or residential purposes if such acts are intended to intimidate, coerce, threaten, or harass any foreign official or obstruct such individual in the performance of official duties. Authorizes the United States, if the victim of an offense under this Act is an internationally protected person, to exercise jurisdiction over the offense if the alleged offender is present within the United States, irrespective of the place where the offense was committed or the nationality of the victim or the alleged offender. Authorises the Attorney General to request assistance from any Federal, State, or local agency, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force, any statute, rule, or regulation to the contrary notwithstanding, in order to enforce this Act. (Amends 18 U.S.C. 112, 970, 1116, 1201; Adds 18 U.S.C. 878)"
