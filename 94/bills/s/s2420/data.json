    "text": "Government Secrecy Control Act - States that it is the policy of the United States Government to permit information relating to the national defense or foreign policy of the United States to be kept secret only when the disclosure of such information would harm the national defense or foreign policy or when such information has been provided to the Government of the United States by a foreign government or international organization pursuant to an agreement which conforms to the policy of this Act and which precludes the release of such information without the consent of that foreign government or international organization. States that it is also the policy of the United States Government not to permit information to be kept secret in order to impede access by Congress to such information or to conceal incompetence, inefficiency, wrongdoing, or administrative error, to avoid embarrassment to any office or agency, or to restrain competition or independent initiative. Establishes a Joint Committee on Government Secrecy to carry out the policies of this Act, and upon determination that the practices of Government departments and agencies fail to conform to such policies, to direct their revision. Specifies the composition, duties, and powers of the Joint Committee. Establishes the Office of National Defense and Foreign Policy Information within the Executive Office of the President to be headed by a Registrar of National Defense and Foreign Policy Information. States that it shall be the function of the Registrar to compile and transmit to the Joint Committee a Register of National Defense and Foreign Policy Information, and to review and recommend the procedures relating to the disclosure of information by the President, and Federal departments and agencies. Abolishes the Interagency Classification Review Committee. Requires that any document or matter kept secret pursuant to this Act shall be entered on the Register of National Defense and Foreign Policy Information. Specifies the information to be contained in each entry required to be made in the register. Specifies special procedures for the entry of specified classes of matter into the Register."
