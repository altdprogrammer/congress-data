Directs the Secretary to accumulate and analyze all data related to the public health aspects of the use of diethylstilbestrol (DES) as a growth promotant in animals intended for use as food, and to report to the Congress the results of such accumulation and analysis, together with his recommendations as to the appropriate course of action to be taken with regard to such use of DES. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, to make an independent and concurrent report to the Congress with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare as to the appropriate course of action to be taken with regard to such use of DES. Prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of diethylstilbestrol (DES) for use as a postcoital contraceptive except in cases of rape or incest or a comparable medical emergency. Sets labeling requirements for drugs composed wholly or partly of diethylstilbestrol (DES). =Title II: Food and Drug Administration= - Food and Drug Administration Act - Establishes a Food and Drug Administration within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Provides for a Commissioner to head such Administration appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Sets forth the duties and powers of such Commissioner. Transfers to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs all functions of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare administered through the Food and Drug Administration. Stipulates that those functions to suspend the approval of a new drug, a new animal drug, or a medicated animal feed as an imminent hazard to health may not be redelegated by the Commissioner."
