    "text": "Broadcast License Renewal Act - Sets the term of a broadcast or any other class of license at five years and states that renewals may be granted for a term of not to exceed five years if the Commission finds that the public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served thereby. Requires the Commission to establish procedures to be followed by licensees of broadcasting stations to ascertain throughout the terms of their licenses the problems, needs, and interest of the residents of their service areas for purposes of their program service. Directs the Federal Communications Commission to conduct a study to determine how it might expedite the elimination of those regulations of broadcast licensees required by the Communications Act of 1934 which do not serve the public interest and to make annual reports of the results of such study (including any recommendations for legislation) to the Committee on Commerce of the Senate and the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives."
