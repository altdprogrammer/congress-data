    "text": "Presidential Regional Primaries Act - States that it is necessary to regulate the nomination of candidates for the office of President in order to protect the integrity of the Presidential election process. Eliminates single State Presidential primary elections. Designates five multistate primary regions in which primary elections will be held in consecutive months beginning with March of the Presidential election year. Sets forth the method by which the Federal Elections Commission is to determine the order in which regional elections are to be held. States the method by which candidates, other than those generally recognized by national news media as major party candidates, may obtain listing on a regional ballot. States that the candidates receiving five percent or more of the votes of their political party in a regional election shall designate delegates from the region to the national nominating convention in the same proportion to the total number of delegates as the number of votes received by the candidate bear to the number of votes cast. Requires delegates to national Presidential conventions to vote for the candidate who appointed them until: (1) after the second ballot; (2) the candidate receives less than 20 percent of the vote; or (3) the candidate releases the delegates. States that the candidate who receives a majority of the votes on a ballot shall be nominee. States that the Vice-Presidential candidate shall be chosen by the convention according to procedures of the nominating party. States that the Federal Elections Commission shall reimburse each State for the costs of conducting a regional primary. Sets forth the duties of the Commission with respect to regional primaries, including: (1) the publication of definitive lists of candidates; (2) the validity of petitions for candidacy; and (3) the promulgation of guidelines for the conduct of regional primaries. Defines the terms used in this Act and authorizes necessary appropriations."
