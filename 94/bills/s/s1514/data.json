Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to establish criteria for the determination of presumptive disability under the supplemental security income program. Provides that the assistance afforded under such program shall be coordinated with that of other assistance programs on both the Federal and State levels. Provides that the eligibility of households containing a recipient of supplemental security income benefits shall be determined on the basis of the uniform national eligibility standards for non-public assistance households. Repeals the requirement that such benefits be paid to a third party payee upon the certification of the chief medical officer at the facility where the recipient is undergoing treatment that payment directly to the recipient would be of significant therapeutic value and that there is substantial reason for believing that the funds would not be improperly used. Requires expedited action on applications for benefits and determinations regarding disability. Excludes from income, those education expenses paid for by grant, fellowship, or scholarship for purposes of determining eligibility for benefits. Revises the eligibility standards for residents of a principally residential facility not used as a health care facility, correctional institution, or school or training facility."
