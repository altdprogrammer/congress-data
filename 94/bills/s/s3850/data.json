    "text": "Indian-Controlled Postsecondary Educational Institution Assistance Act - Amends the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to make grants to Indian-controlled educational institutions for specified purposes, including: (1) planning of educational programs and activities; (2) basic operational costs; and (3) student services. Prescribes eligibility requirements for receipt of such grants. Authorizes the Secretary, upon the request of any American Indian tribe or community to assist in the planning and development of feasibility studies to determine whether there is justification for the creation of an Indian-controlled postsecondary educational institution. Sets forth a grant formula to be followed by the Secretary in extending funds to qualified applicants. States that eligibility for assistance under this Act shall not supplant eligibility under other Federal financial assistance programs. Requires the Secretary to submit a report to the Congress containing a survey of existing and planned physical facilities of Indian-controlled postsecondary educational institutions. Authorizes appropriations for the three full fiscal years after the enactment of this Act. Provides for adjustment of grants where the sums appropriated for any fiscal year are not sufficient to pay in full the total amounts which all approved grant applicants are eligible to receive under this Act for that fiscal year."
