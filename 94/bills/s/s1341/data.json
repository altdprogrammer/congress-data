Title II: Defines, under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972, the term \"navigable waters\" to include a Marine Pollution Control Zone extending 197 miles from the outer limit of the territorial seas. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to set limits of liability for discharges of oil and hazardous substances and standards of performance controlling the discharge of sewage from vessels in the 200-mile zone. Requires a review of present rules and regulations promulgated with respect to United States-flag vessels engaged in coastwise trade to determine whether stricter standards are necessary."
