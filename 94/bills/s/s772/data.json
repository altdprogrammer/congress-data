    "text": "Beef Research and Consumer Information Act - Declares that it is the purpose of this Act to enable cattle producers to establish, finance, and carry out a coordinated program to improve markets for cattle, beef and beef products, and to provide an adequate supply of high quality beef to the consumers of the Nation at reasonable prices. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to issue beef research and promotion orders. Provides that such orders shall be issued only after due notice and opportunity for hearing shall have been given to producers and producer organizations, and after the Secretary shall have determined that the issuance of such an order will effectuate the declared policy of this Act. Declares that such order shall not take effect until approved by a majority of two-thirds of the cattle producers voting in a referendum. Establishes a Beef Board to administer the Order in accordance with its terms and provisions, to make rules and regulations to effectuate the terms and provisions of the Order, to receive, investigate and report complaints of violations of the Order, and to recommend to the Secretary amendments to the Order. Lists the procedures for appointing members of such board. Requires that any plans for advertising, sales promotion, consumer education, producer education, research, and the annual budget be developed by the Beef Board and submitted to the Secretary of Agriculture for approval. Empowers the Beef Board to enter into contracts or agreements for the development and carrying out of the activities authorized under the Order. Declares that producers of cattle shall be assessed at a specific rate to be determined by stated procedures. Provides that each time cattle are sold, the cattle producer shall pay to the purchaser the amount assessed, based upon the sale price of the cattle. Provides that any cattle producer against whose cattle or beef any assessment is made and collected shall have the right to demand and receive from the Beef Board a refund of such assessment. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to pre-empt or interfere with the workings of any beef board, beef council, or other beef promotion entity organized and operating within and by authority of any of the several states. Provides for the return to any such beef board or council of an amount to be determined by a stated formula. Stipulates that to qualify for the funds, such a state beef board, beef council or other beef promotional entity shall demonstrate ability to provide research, promotion and education within the state consistent with this Act and Order. States that each purchaser, handler or agent may be required to report to the Beef Board periodically concerning number of cattle handled, amount assessed, sale price of cattle on which assessment was collected, and other information necessary for the enforcement of this Act. Declares that this Act and any order issued pursuant to it may be enforced in the District Courts of the U.S., with the U.S. Attorney General having authority to bring any Civil suits authorized under the Act. Provides for a fine of not more than $1,000 for violations of this Act and any orders issued pursuant to it. Stipulates that no funds collected by the Beef Board shall in any manner be used for the purpose of influencing governmental policy or action. Authorizes to be appropriated such funds as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Stipulates that funds so appropriated shall not be available for payment of the expenses or expenditures of the Beef Board in administering any provisions of any order issued pursuant to the terms of this Act."
