States that such allowance shall be equal to 80 percent of reasonable transportation expenses, up to a maximum payment of $800. Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements with States to receive applications for and to provide relocation assistance. Sets forth penalties for obtaining payments fraudulently under this Act.
