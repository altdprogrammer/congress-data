    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1975-11-20", 
    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare with amendment, S. Rept. 49-486) Children and Youth Camp Safety Act - Makes it the purpose of this Act to protect and safeguard the health and well-being of the children and youth of the Nation attending camps, to provide Federal assistance to the States in developing programs for implementing safety standards for youth camps, and to provide for the Federal implementation of safety standards for youth camps in States which do not implement such standards. States that it is the purpose of this Act that youth camp safety standards be applicable to intrastate as well as interstate youth camp operators. States the intent of Congress that the States assume responsibility for the development and enforcement of effective youth camp safety standards. Defines the term \"youth camp\" to mean any residential camp, day camp, troop camp, travel camp, trip camp, primitive or outpost camp, or Federal recreational youth camp located on private or public land, which, among other activities conducts a youth camp for 10 or more campers under 18 years of age. Defines \"youth camp activities\" to include sports and athletic, and campcraft and nature study activities, under the auspices of a youth camp operator. States that such term does not include: (1) regularly scheduled meetings of voluntary organizations such as the Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts that do not involve camping experience; (2) regularly scheduled athletic events of the little league and similar organizations that do not involve camping experiences; (3) bona fide extracurricular activities conducted under the auspices of the schools; (4) learning experiences in the arts and drama or conferences or forums; (5) activities carried on in private homes; and (6) the activities of a family and its guests carried out as a social activity. Defines \"youth camp safety standards\" to mean criteria issued by the Secretary designed to provide each camper safe and healthful conditions, facilities, and equipment which are free from hazards that are causing, or are likely to cause death, serious illness, or serious physical harm. Requires each youth camp operator to provide each camper safe and healthful conditions and adequate supervision to prevent injury. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to promulgate camp safety regulations within nine months of enactment of this Act. Provides that such regulations shall take effect two years after promulgation. Provides that during the two-year period following promulgation and annually thereafter States may assume responsibility for development and enforcement of safety standards. Requires such States to submit plans for such development and enforcement. Grants the Secretary a right of disapproval of such plans. Prohibits the Secretary from having any administrative or enforcement authority in any State which has in effect an approved plan, except that he shall review annually each State plan which he has approved, and the enforcement thereof, and shall certify that such plan is administered so as to comply with the provisions of such plan and report such certification to the Congress in an annual report. Permits the Secretary to suspend payments under this Act from States not in compliance with standards imposed by this Act. Directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance and consultative services to assist in the development and implementation of State plans. Permits the Secretary to make grants to States for the development of youth camp safety plans, to assist such States with plan initiation and training costs, and to States for the early operation and improvement of youth camp safety programs. Permits representatives of the Secretary to inspect youth camps and to investigate their records. Requires youth camp operators to file annual reports with the Secretary on accidents resulting in death, injury, and serious illness. Requires the Secretary to provide for the citation of youth camp operators for any violation of any standard, rule, or order promulgated pursuant to this Act. Directs the Secretary to afford an opportunity for a hearing for any youth camp operator issued a citation or notice of a proposed penalty. Permits any youth camp operator adversely affected by the decision of the hearing examiner to obtain a review of the decision in the United States court of appeals. Provides that upon the request of any youth camp operator, director, or staff, or during any inspection the Secretary shall provide consultative services to youth camps in States which do not have in effect a State plan. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act and regulations thereunder by youth camp operators. Grants United States district courts and other courts of competent jurisdiction the jurisdiction, upon petition of the State or Secretary as appropriate, to restrain youth camp conditions threatening imminent dangers. Directs the Secretary to establish an Advisory Council on Youth Camp Safety to advise and consult on policy matters relating to youth camp safety. States that this Act or regulations issued under this Act shall not be construed to interfere with the religious activities of any youth camp that is operated by any religious corporation, association, or society or operated for a particular religion. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act of $7,500,000 for fiscal year 1976, and for each of the five succeeding fiscal years."
