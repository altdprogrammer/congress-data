Subjects those guilty of genocide or an attempt to commit genocide to a fine of not more than $20,000, imprisonment for not more than 20 years, or both; and if death results, to imprisonment for any term of years. Subjects anyone who directly and publicly incites another to commit genocide to a fine of not more than $10,000, imprisonment for not more than five years, or both. Establishes penalties for conspiring to violate this Act. Declares it the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State, in negotiating extradition treaties or conventions, shall reserve for the United States the right to refuse extradition of a United States national to a foreign country for any offense defined under this Act when the offense has been committed outside the United States and where the violator is or will be prosecuted for such offense by the United States. (Adds 18 U.S.C. 1091, 1092)"
