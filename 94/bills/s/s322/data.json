Designates specified portions of the Rapid River in Idaho and the Snake River in Idaho and Oregon as wild or scenic river areas. Prohibits the licensing of construction by the Federal Power Commission of any dam within such recreation area. Prohibits any limiting, restricting, or conflicting of the present and future use of the waters of the Snake River and its tributaries upstream. Prohibits imposition of any flow requirements on such river below the Hells Canyon Dam. Sets forth standards for the administration of such recreation area by the Secretary of Agriculture, and requires him to submit a comprehensive management plan for such area to the Congress within five years.

Gives the views of the Nez Perce Tribe of Indians a hearing in such possible designation. Allows the continuation of timber harvesting by selective cutting, mining, and grazing during development of the comprehensive management plan.
