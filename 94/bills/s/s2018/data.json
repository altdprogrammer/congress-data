States that it is the purpose of this Act: (1) to establish minimum workers' compensation laws; (2) to establish procedures for their enforcement; and (3) to assist the States in improving existing workers' compensation systems in order to provide a uniform system of compensation, and to restore disabled workers to the fullest possible physical, mental, and economic usefulness through medical and vocational rehabilitation services.
