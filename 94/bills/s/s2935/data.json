    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1976-03-18", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Federal Trade Commission Authorization Act - Authorizes appropriations for the Federal Trade Commission through fiscal year 1978, specifying amounts to be used for maintaining competition. Requires the Commission to submit budget estimates, information, legislative recommendations, and comments to the Congress concurrently with submission of any such items to the President or the Office of Management and Budget. Authorizes the Commission to establish and fix the compensation for 25 attorney, economist, special expert, and outside counsel positions for its responsibilities in maintaining competition. Permits appeals from cease and desist orders of the Commission in the Court of Appeals of the circuit which is the residence or the principal place of business of the person appealing. States that such orders shall become effective 60 days after being served, subject to a stay by the Commission, the appropriate Court of Appeals, or the Supreme Court. Authorizes the court to assess, in addition to monetary penalties, such other equitable relief as it deems appropriate in an action for injunction or other equitable relief brought by the Commission for violations of rules issued under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Provides that if any person, partnership, or corporation required by the Federal Trade Commission Act to submit or file any annual or special report or to obey a subpena or other order requiring access to documentary evidence should fail to do so within the time prescribed by the Commission for filing or obeying, and such failure shall continue for 15 days after notice of default, the person, partnership, or corporation shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 nor more than $5,000 as the court may determine for each day of such failure after the 15th day. Provides that the court shall not issue an order enjoining the Commission or the United States from enforcement of, or invalidating any subpena or any order to file an annual or special report requiring access to documentary evidence unless the plaintiff has first demonstrated: (1) that the subpena or order to file a special or annual report or other order requiring access to documentary evidence is unduly burdensome; or (2) that the information sought by such subpena or order to file a special or annual report or other order requiring access to documentary evidence is not reasonably relevant to the inquiry being conducted by the Commission. Provides that whenever an interested person petitions the Commission for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule the Commission shall grant or deny the petition within 120 days after the date that the petition is received by it. States that if the Commission denies a petition or fails to act on a petition within the 120-day period: (1) a petitioner may commernce a civil action in an appropriate district court of the United States to seek an order directing the Commission to initiate a proceeding to take the action requested in the petition; and (2) if a petitioner can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court, by a preponderance of the evidence in a de novo proceeding before the court, that the action requested in the petition to the Commission is necessary to prevent acts or practices which are unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce and that the failure of the Commission to take such action will result in the continuation of such unlawful acts or practices, then the court shall order the Commission to initiate the action proposed in the petition. Establish a three year program of assistance and grants to States to improve their antitrust capabilities. Authorizes to be appropriated not to exceed $10,000,000 for fiscal years 1976-1978 for such program. Amends the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, and the Robinson-Patman Act in order to expand the jurisdictional scope of these Acts from \"in commerce\" to \"in or affecting commerce\". Permits the FTC to require care labeling with respect to outer coverings of furniture."
