Requires the Secretary to submit to the Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs and to the Committees on Appropriations of the United States Congress a detailed program identifying the lands selected and the annual acquisition program which he recommends for the ensuing five fiscal years. Establishes the Santa Monica Mountains and Seashores National Urban Park Advisory Commission, to be composed of 15 members appointed by the Secretary for terms of three years each. Directs the Secretary to meet at least annually with the Commission to consult on general policies and specific matters related to planning, administration, and development affecting the park.
