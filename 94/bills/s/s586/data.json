    "text": "(Conference report filed in Senate, S. Rept. 94-987) Coastal Zone Management Act Amendments - Redefines \"coastal zone\" under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, and defines, under such Act, \"outer continental shelf energy activity,\" \"energy facilities,\" and \"coastal energy activity. Makes changes in the Management Program Development Grants, under the Coastal Zone Management Act, by adding the following requirements for the coastal zone management program which a State is to develop and maintain under the Act: (1) the program is to include a general plan for the protection of, and access to, public beaches and other coastal areas of environmental, recreational and historical, esthetic, ecological, and cultural value; and (2) the State coastal zone management program is to include a process for the planning for energy facilities likely to be located in the coastal zone and for the planning for, and management of, the anticipated impacts from any energy facility. Increases the maximum Federal share of the costs of the development phase of a coastal zone management program to 80 percent from the present 66 2/3 percent and extends, by one year, the time during which a coastal State may receive such grants for development of a program before it must have an approved program in order to continue to receive grants under the Act. Extends from June 30, 1977 to September 30, 1979, the authority to make such grants. Increases the maximum Federal share for administrative costs of the ongoing State program operation to 80 percent from the present 66 2/3 percent. Requires a coastal State establish an effective coordination and consultative mechanism between a designated State coastal zone agency and local governments within such State. Requires States to consider any applicable interstate energy plans or programs in the planning for and siting of energy facilities in the coastal zone of such States. Requires each Federal lease to be submitted to each State with an approved coastal zone management program for a determination by that State as to whether or not the lease is consistent with such State's program. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, in cooperation with the Executive Office of the President, to mediate the difference between a Federal agency and a State in the implementation of an approved State management program, in cases of serious disagreement. Requires such differences to be resolved through public hearings in the area concerned. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to administer and coordinate a coastal energy impact program. Requires pursuant to this program the provision of financial assistance to meet the needs of coastal States and local governments. Provides for formula grants to coastal States. Specifies the purposes for which such grants may be used. Requires the Secretary to make such grants if the Secretary finds that the coastal zone of such State is being, or is likely to be, significantly affected by the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of new or expended energy facilities. Requires the making of loans to assist any State or local unit of government to provide new or improved public services required by coastal energy activity. Directs each coastal State to apportion any financial assistance granted to such State to units of local government on a basis of need. Establishes the Coastal Energy Impact Fund for the purpose of making payments under the coastal energy impact program. Encourages the coastal States to coordinate coastal zone planning in areas which are contiguous to areas within the coastal zone of other States and to study, plan, and/or implement unified coastal zone policies for such areas. Provides the coastal States with the consent of Congress to negotiate, and enter into interstate agreements and compacts for the development and administration of coordinated coastal zone planning, policies, and programs. Encourages, and provides for, Federal - State consultation procedures by the parties to interstate agreements and compacts and the Federal Government. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a program of research study and training to support development and implementation of State coastal zone management programs for which the States are receiving grants under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to any coastal State to assist such State in carrying out research, studies, and training required in support of coastal zone management up to 80 percent of the cost. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to coastal States for up to 50 percent of the cost of acquisition of access to public beaches and other public coastal areas. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act. Authorizes the appointment within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of an Associate Administrator for Coastal Zone Management to implement and administer the Coastal Zone Management Act. Directs the Secretary to conduct a comprehensive review of the molluscan shellfish industry and to evaluate the impact upon such industry of Federal law concerning water quality. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress the findings of this study."
