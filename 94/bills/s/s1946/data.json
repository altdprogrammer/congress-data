    "text": "Local Rail Service Amendments - States that the purpose of this Act is to establish procedures for reviewing local-service line decisions which will give full and adequate consideration to the national goals specified by the Regional Rail Reorganization Act. Requires the Consolidated Rail Corporation to collect information sufficient to permit an accurate determination of the revenues, costs, and operations of light density rail lines as operating and economic units. Specifies that the final system plan required by the Regional Rail Reorganization Act shall designate those rail lines which the United States Railway Association determines: (1) are not required to provide rail service to meet the goals and requirements of this Act and which should not be transferred to the Corporation or offered for sale to a profitable railroad at that time, and (2) what rail carrier should be required to perform interim service over each such line under subsidy as provided by this Act. Requires that copies of the final system plan and the local service plan be delivered to each district court of the United States or any other court having jurisdiction over a railroad in the region. States that interim service must be provided over such lines until the local service plan is implemented. Authorizes the Secreatry of Transportation to reimburse the Corporation or other railroad performing the service for any loss which it shall incur in the operation of such lines, and to pay to the owner of rail properties over which such service is performed an amount representing the return on the value thereof. Directs the Rail Service Planning Office to solicit, evaluate, and provide the Corporation with a report summarizing the views of specified individuals with respect to present and future rail service on such lines. Sets forth procedures governing reinstitution of service on out-of-service lines. Requires the Corporation to deliver the local service plan to Congress within 660 days following the effective date of the final service plan. Authorizes appropriations of specified sums to carry out the purposes of this Act."
