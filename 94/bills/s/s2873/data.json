Declares that an emergency exists requiring immediate action with insufficient time for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, upon certification by the Governor, of either or both States, to treat roosts with greater than 500,000 birds with chemicals approved for bird control purposes. Declares that the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act shall not apply to any such blackbird control activites undertaken by Kentucky or Tennessee on or before April 15, 1976, or by the Federal Government within those States."
