Requires that assistance extended under this Act be distributed to the maximum extent possible through voluntary relief agencies of the United States and through other international relief and development organizations. Requires that such assistance used for housing construction be, to the maximum extent possible, with seismic resistant materials or materials which will otherwise minimize the danger of injury to occupants in future earthquakes. Directs the President to report, within 60 days of enactment and quarterly thereafter, to the Congress on the programming and obligations of funds under this Act."
