    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1975-03-12", 
    "text": "States the findings of Congress that: (1) air express is essential to the present and future needs of the domestic commerce of the United States; and (2) REA express has continuously and ably provided such service for over 40 years; and (3) the continuation of this vital service, and the interests of shippers, have been threatened with disruption. Directs the Civil Aeronautics Board to issue a certificate to engage in air transportation as a carrier air express, though not directly engaged in the operation of the aircraft, to an applicant who has continuously operated as such from May 14, 1938, for a period of at least 35 years. Directs that each air carrier directly engaged in the operation of aircraft shall provide necessary and adequate service, equipment, and facilities for the transportation of air express shipments upon request by the holder of such certificate, giving such shipments priority on aircraft after passengers, their accompanied baggage and airmail, on the basis of charges which shall not be unjustly discriminatory, unduly prejudicial, or disadvantageous."
