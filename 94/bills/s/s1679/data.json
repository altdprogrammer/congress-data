    "text": "Light Density Railroad Lines Evaluation Act - Provides that cost and revenue computation standards promulgated under the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 shall be used to compute the amounts of rail service continuation subsidies under such Act. Provides for the consideration of the profitability of development and use of local rail services in a region as light density lines, rather than to allow such services to remian in a state of inoperation or underoperation. Authorizes appropriations to the United States Railway Association ($50,000,000) and to the Rail Services Planning Office ($10,000,000) to remain available until expended. Directs the Association to issue a preliminary report on interim light density lines within 570 days after the effective date of the final system plan. Authorizes discontinuance, and abandonment 60 days thereafter, of interim light density lines operated by any responsible person pursuant to the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to make grants for the operation of light density lines and for establishing and implementing the State plan for rail transportation and local rail services."
