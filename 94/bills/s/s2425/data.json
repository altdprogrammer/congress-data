Provides additional Federal funds to States to be employed in such a way as to increase the employment of welfare recipients and other low-income persons in jobs related to the provision of child care services. Limits the tax credit under the Internal Revenue Code with respect to Federal welfare recipient employment incentive expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer to an eligible employee whose services are performed in connection with a child day care services program to $1000. Authorizes direct payments by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in lieu of the income tax credit to tax exempt organizations."
