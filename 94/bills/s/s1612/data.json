    "text": "Communications Privacy Act - Prohibits, under the Communications Act of 1934, all disclosures of telephone records except through service of a court subpena meeting specified criteria. Requires in all cases except where the telephone subscriber is a foreign power, that the party subpenaing the records notify the subscriber simultaneously that records of his telepone conversations are being subpenaed. Allows such notification to be postponed if the Government satisfies the court that notification would impede an ongoing criminal investigation or would hamper the Government's ability to protect national security interests. Prohibits the telephone company from responding to such a subpena for at least ten days."
