Requires that such report include a determination of whether any such agency activity has fulfilled its purposes, whether it is duplicative or conflicts with other agency activity, and whether the benefits of such activity exceed its costs. Directs the President to present in such report his recommendation for reform. States that the Congressional committee to which a proposal made by the President is referred must report to its respective House a bill approving or disapproving, in whole or in part such proposal. Provides that if such a bill has not been reported by November 15 next following the submission of such report, that the President's proposal shall become the pending order of business in both Houses and remain so until acted upon."
