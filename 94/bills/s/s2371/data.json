Imposes a four-year moratorium on further surface disturbance within Death Valley and Organ Pipe Cactus National Monuments and Mount McKinley National Park. Requires the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation to report within two years on the actual or potential effects of surface mining activities on natural and historical landmarks. States that the holder of any patented or unpatented mining claim subject to this Act who believes he has suffered a loss by operation of this Act, or by orders or regulations issued pursuant thereto, may bring an action in a United States district court to recover just compensation, which shall be awarded if the court finds that such loss constitutes a taking of property compensable under the Constitution. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary to acquire lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of any unit of the National Park System. Directs the Secretary to give careful consideration to any offer to sell any property interest in the lands on which a moratorium has been imposed under this Act, and where continued private ownership would result in undue hardship. Requires each employee of the Secretary of the Interior who: (1) performs any functions under this Act concerning the regulation of mining within the National Park System; and (2) has any known financial interest in any person subject to this Act or any person who holds a mining claim within the National Park System to file an annual statement with the Secretary concerning all such interests held during the preceding year."
