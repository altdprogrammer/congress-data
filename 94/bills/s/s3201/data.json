    "text": "(Conference report filed in Senate, S. Rept. 94-939) Public Works Employment Act - =Title I: Local Public Works= - Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Economic Development Administration, to make grants to any State or local government for local public works projects, including but not limited to: (1) those public works projects of State and local governments for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under provisions of law other than this Act; and (2) the architectural design, engineering, and related planning of local public works projects. Stipulates that the Federal share of any project for which a grant is made under this Act shall be 100 percent of the cost of such project. Authorizes the Secretary to make an additional grant for the purpose of increasing to 100 percent the Federal contribution to a public works project for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under provisions of law other than this Act. Stipulates that no such grants shall be made for any project which has as its principal purpose the channelization, damming, dredging, or diversion of a natural watercourse, or the enlargement of any canal other than a canal designated as a historic site. Directs the Secretary to prescribe rules, regulations, and procedures necessary to carry out this Act. Lists factors that the Secretary shall consider in accordance with the relative needs of the various sections of the country, with priority consideration to those areas where unemployment exceeds the national average. Stipulates that not less than one-half of one percent nor more than ten percent of all amounts authorized under this title shall be allocated for local public works projects within any one State. Provides that the unemployment rates of local governments may be based upon such rate in any community of such local areas, except that grants made to local governments based upon such rates must be for projects directly benefiting unemployed residents of such communities. Authorizes the appropriation of $2,000,000,000 through fiscal year 1977 to carry out this Act. =Title II: Antirecession Provisions= - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make payments to States and local governments to coordinate budget-related actions by such governments with Federal efforts to stimulate economic recovery. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose for five calendar quarters beginning July 1, 1976, based upon $125,000,000 plus $62,500,000 multiplied by the number of one-tenth percentage points by which the unemployment rate exceeds six percent. Limits aggregate appropriations under such formula to $1,250,000,000. Allocates one-third of such appropriations for payments to States and two-thirds for payments to local governments. Prescribes a formula by which such appropriations shall be allocated among the States and local governments based upon such units' unemployment rates and revenue sharings amounts. Conditions receipt of such payments upon submission of written assurances to the Secretary that such payments will be used for the maintenance of public employment and customarily provided basic services; that fiscal accounting and audit procedures conforming to guidelines of the Secretary will be used; and that such payments will be expended within six months of receipt. Permits States to file optional allocation plans. Prohibits discrimination in programs funded under this Act. Permits the Secretary, upon a finding of such discrimination, to suspend payments and exercise any authority contained in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Permits parties injured by such discrimination to bring civil suits. Sets forth wage-level requirements applicable to those employed under programs funded by this Act. Requires States and units of local governments receiving payments under this title to report to the Secretary any increase or decrease in taxes and substantial reductions in employees or services. Terminates payments to States and local governments whose unemployment rates drop to 4.5 percent or less. Requires States and local governments receiving payments under this title to assure the Secretary in writing that they have made substantial economies in their operations and that such payments are necessary to maintain essential services. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on amounts paid under this title. Authorizes necessary appropriations to the Secretary to administer this title. Requires the Comptroller General to conduct an investigation of the impact which emergency support grants have on the operations of State and local governments and on the national economy, and to report thereon to the Congress. Requires the Congressional Budget Office and the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations to conduct a study to determine the most effective means by which the Federal Government can stabilize the national economy during periods of rapid economic growth and high inflation through programs directed toward State and local governments. =Title III: Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments= - Authorizes additional appropriations of $700,000,000 for fiscal year 1977 to carry out title II (Grants for Construction of Treatment Works) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act."
