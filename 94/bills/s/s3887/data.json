    "text": "Federal Aid in Nongame Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act - Establishes the Nongame Fish and Wildlife Conservation Fund to provide financial assistance, administered by the Secretary of the Interior, to State nongame fish and wildlife conservation programs. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer personnel, equipment, and scientific information to carry out this Act. Sets forth the formula for the apportionment of revenue to the States and limitations upon administrative expenses of the Secretary and the States chargeable to such Fund. Permits any amount apportioned to a State but not expended or obligated after two fiscal years to be used by the Secretary to assist such programs in other States. Permits any such amount not paid or obligated by the Secretary at the end of two fiscal years to be made available for any nongame fish and wildlife resource project of the Fish and Wildlife Service. Requires any State wishing such assistance (1) to certify to the Secretary the existence of a State agency with adequate authority, resources, and personnel to conserve nongame fish and wildlife, (2) to submit a comprehensive fish and wildlife species management plan to the Secretary, and (3) to submit to the Secretary a detailed proposal for a fish and wildlife species conservation project. Sets forth project funding procedures and restrictions applicable to the States, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the District of Columbia. Directs all Federal departments and agencies to coordinate their programs with nongame fish and wildlife conservation projects administered by the States. Directs each Federal department and agency with management authority over land and water resources (1) to determine which programs under its authority may be extended to include conservation of nongame fish and wildlife species, (2) to notify the appropriate State agency of any such affirmative determination, and (3) to cooperate with the establishment of conservation efforts. Authorizes Federal departments and agencies to enter cooperative agreements with State agencies for such efforts. Authorizes the appropriation of $10,000,000 for each of the fiscal year 1978, 1979, and 1980 to carry out this Act."
