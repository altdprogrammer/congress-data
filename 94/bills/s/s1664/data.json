    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare with amendment, S. Rept. 94-634) Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Amendments - Revises the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act to recommend that local programs for detection and treatment of lead-based paint poisoning include the development and carrying out of intensive follow-up programs to insure that cases of such poisoning are protected against further exposure to lead-based paint hazards in their living environments by eliminating lead-based paint hazards from surfaces in and around residential dwelling units or houses when the owner of such units or houses is financially unable to eliminate such hazards. Conditions receipt of Federal grants for such local programs on the assurance that local programs will implement such recommendation. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to prohibit the application of lead-based paint to any cooking utensil, drinking utensil, eating utensil, and residential structures constructed or rehabilitated by the Federal Government or with Federal assistance. Directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to prohibit the application of lead-based paint to any toy or furniture article. Redefines \"lead- based paint\" to mean any paint containing more than five-tenths of one percent lead and more than six-hundredths of one percent after six months of enactment. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act through fiscal year 1978."
