Requires whenever the waters of any body of water are modified with the assistance of Federal funds that the National Marine Fisheries Service be consulted, as well as the State fish and wildlife agencies, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Redefines \"consultation\" so as to provide a systematic requirement of written findings by the fish and wildlife agencies, and formal reports based on these findings by the departments concerned. Requires that the operation and maintenance costs of studies and investigations made pursuant to such Act be funded by the constructing agency. Provides for annual reports from constructing agencies detailing their rate of progress in installing fish and wildlife measures. Permits any citizen to commence a civil action on his own behalf against any person or Federal agency where there is alleged to be a violation of such Act or a failure to perform a duty under such Act."
