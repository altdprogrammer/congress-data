    "text": "Broadcast License Renewal Act - Permits the Federal Communications Commission to extend three-year broadcast licenses for an additional two years upon a finding of public interest. Requires in making such determination, considerations of whether diffferent term lengths for radio and television stations and for different categories of licensees are in the public interest. Limits other class licenses to a five-year maximum, prescribing the renewal procedures for such licenses and the criteria to be considered in renewal, including responsiveness and lack of serious deficiencies. Sets guidelines for expenditious action on applications for renewal of broadcasting station licenses by limiting material required to be filed. Requires the Commission to examine the renewal process and report within six months on methods of reducing and consolidating filings and supporting documents."
