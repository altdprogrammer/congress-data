Directs the Commission to report to Congress within 33 months after the initial meeting of the Commission its recommendations for reorganization and improvement of all Federal Government programs. Establishes, within the Commission, the Task Force on American Federalism composed of 20 members appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Directs the Task Force to conduct a nonpartisan study of the appropriate levels of responsibility shared among units of local, State, and Federal Governments and the organization required for proper balance and division of Federal, State and local government roles, responsibilities, and authorities. Requires the Task Force to submit a final report to Congress not later than 15 months after its initial meeting or 18 months before the expiration of the Commission, whichever is earlier. Terminates the Commission 90 days after the submission of its final report. Authorizes to be appropriated without fiscal year limitations $12,000,000 to carry out this Act."
