Rept. 94-1115) =Title I: Small Business Development= - Directs the President to undertake a comprehensive review of all Federal disaster loan authorities and report to the Congress, not later than December 1, 1976, recommendations and legislative proposals, including possible consolidation of Federal disaster loan authorities. Defines \"pollution control facilities\" under the Small Business Investment Act. Authorizes the Small Business Administration, whenever it determines that small business concerns are or are likely to be at an operational or financing disadvantage with other business concerns with respect to the planning, design, or installation of pollution control facilities, or the obtaining of financing therefor, to guarantee the payment of rentals or other amounts due under qualified contract. Provides that any such guarantee may be made or effected either directly or in cooperation with any qualified surety company or other qualified company through a participation agreement with such company. Provides that the total amount of debentures purchased or guaranteed by the Administration and outstanding at any one time from specified classifications of small business investment companies shall not exceed 300 and 400 percent, respectively, (currently 200 and 300 percent, respectively) of the combined private paid-in capital and paid-in surplus of such companies. Defines a small business investment company as a limited partnership, as well as an incorporated body. Removes the restriction on national banks and member banks of the Federal Reserve system from purchasing stock in a small business investment company where the bank would hold 50 percent or more of any class of equity securities issued by that company and having actual or potential voting rights. Permits the Administration to make loans for the acquisition of plants by State and local development companies. Increases the loan limits, under the Small Business Act, on economic opportunity loans, local development company loans, and regular business loans. Makes it the policy of the Congress that the Government, through the Small Business Administration, should aid and assist small business concerns which are engaged in the production of food and fiber, ranching, and raising of livestock, aquaculture, and all other farming and agricultural related industries. Increases the authorized capital of the Surety Bond Guarantees Fund from $35,000,000 to $56,500,000. Requires the interest rate on the Administration's share of specified disaster loans to be three percent or lower under specified conditions. =Title II: Study of Small Business= - Establishes within the Administration an Office of Advocacy, which shall assess the effectiveness of Federal assistance programs for small business, measure the costs and other effects of regulation of small businesses; determine the impact of the tax structure on small business, study the ability of financial markets to meet credit needs of small business, and evaluate Federal and business efforts to assist minority enterprises. Requires the Office to counsel small businesses on resolution of problems concerning government relations, propose changes in practices of other agencies to assist small businesses, and represent the views of small businesses before other agencies. Requires a report from the Office within a year relating to findings and recommendations regarding the functions of the Office. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title."
