    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Commerce with amendment, S. Rept. 94-920) Communications Act Amendments - Revises the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 which invoke civil penalty liability. Subjects all persons subject to Federal Communications Commission regulation to forfeiture liability. Increases the maximum forfeiture liability from $1,000 to $2,000. Makes each day of a continuing violation a separate offense. Sets forth the maximum total forfeiture penalty that can be imposed. Authorizes alternative procedures that the Federal Communications Commission may use to enforce forfeiture penalties. Permits the Commission to use the full adjudicatory hearing authorized under the Administrative Procedure Act or the written \"show cause\" proceeding. Prohibits the determination of any forfeiture liability unless specified procedural requirements are followed. Revises the forfeiture limitation periods. Repeals the requirement that forfeitures be recovered in a trial de novo in a U.S. district court if enforcement is sought in the full adjudicatory hearing authorized under this Act. Repeals the requirement that mitigation by the Commission may occur only upon \"application therefor.\" Repeals the forfeiture provisions of the Act dealing with radio stations operating in common carrier, safety and special radio fields."
