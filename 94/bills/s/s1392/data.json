    "text": "Energy Conservation in Buildings Demonstration Act - States that it is the intent of Congress to institute a demonstration program for retrofitting selected existing Federal, State, and municipal buildings for energy conservation, using promising innovative technology to the maximum extent possible, and to disseminate the results of that experience in order to promote this type of conservation nationwide. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration within 90 days of the enactment of this Act to establish procedures for identifying existing buildings as candidates for retrofitting with energy conservation equipment and systems for the purpose of decreasing the cost of supplying such buildings with energy for climate-conditioning, water-heating, lighting, and other major uses of energy. Requires the Administrator of the General Services Administration, on the basis of such procedures and within 6 months of the enactment of this Act, to select no fewer than 40 federally owned buildings as candidates for retrofitting with energy conservation equipment and systems. Directs the Administrator to solict proposals for retrofitting such buildings. Stipulates that in addition to the cost and estimated effectiveness of the proposal in achieving energy conservation, the potential for a novel and innovative approach which would be of particular value in wide application shall be a factor in awarding contracts. Stipulates that grants for Federal buildings shall not exceed $1,000,000 for any one building. Provides that Governors of States and executives of municipalities may submit requests for grants for retrofitting of buildings owned by their respective States or municipalities. States that grants to States and municipalities shall be on a 3-to-1 Federal to State or municipality matching basis. Stipulates that grants may not exceed $10,000,000 for any one State nor $6,000,000 for any one municipality out of one year's appropriation under this Act. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration to submit a report to the President and Congress presenting the results of the program. Requires the Administrator to disseminate to the public results of this program which promise to further promote conservation of energy on a wide scale. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act, not to exceed $30,000,000 for the Federal program, $60,000,000 for the State program, and $60,000,000 for the municipal program for each of fiscal years 1976 and 1977."
