Provides that it shall be unlawful for any employer or any person acting as an agent for such an employer, or any person who for a fee refers an alien for employment by such an employer, to employ, or refer for employment any alien in the United States who has not been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, unless the employment of such alien is authorized by the Attorney General. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act."
