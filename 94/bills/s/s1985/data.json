Directs the Extension Service of the Department of Agriculture to conduct and facilitate activities designed to foster farmers' markets, including: (1) the designation of a specialist in each State responsible for a direct marketing program; (2) the sponsorship of conferences designed to facilitate the sharing of information on direct marketing programs; and (3) the providing of technical assistance to groups establishing direct marketing programs. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to foster the development of innovative farmer-to-consumer marketing arrangements by engaging in specified activities, including the establishment of at least five different projects involving innovative methods of direct marketing from farmers to consumers. Authorizes to be appropriated specified sums for carrying out the purposes of this Act."
