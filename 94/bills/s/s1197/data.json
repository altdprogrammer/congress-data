Requires the Office of Technology Assessment to conduct and complete within three years a comprehensive study of the recycling of plutonium for the purpose of determining the extent of the dangers to the public health and safety and to the environment from such recycling. States that such study shall include: (1) investigation of the toxicity and carcinogenic characteristics of plutonium; (2) investigation of the risks of the unauthorized diversion or theft of plutonium; and (3) consideration of the development of systems for the use of plutonium which will assure the protection of the public health and safety and of the environment."
