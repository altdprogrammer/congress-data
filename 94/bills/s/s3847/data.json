Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to authorize the Secretary, with respect to farm ownership loans, operating loans, or emergency loans made under such Act to modify the repayment schedule on such loans by allowing up to a two-year grace period on principal and interest payments for borrowers whose farming, ranching, or aquaculture operations are in localities designated as major disaster or emergency areas during 1976, 1977, or 1978. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1970 to authorize the Secretary to acquire hay for inclusion in the disaster reserve created under the Agricultural Act of 1970 and to purchase the hay and other commodities in such reserve through the Commodity Credit Corporation."
