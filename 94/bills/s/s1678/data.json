Provides that an administrative rule, and violation of which subjects an individual to a criminal penalty, shall take effect only: (1) if published in the Federal Register; (2) after the expiration of 30 days of continuous session of Congress after the date on which the rule was published; and (3) if neither House of Congress passes a resolution disfavoring such a rule. Sets forth procedures governing the consideration of such rules by the Congress."
