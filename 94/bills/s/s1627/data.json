Provides that housing representing payment of income in kind shall be counted as income of up to $25 per month. Makes any household having an individual 18 years of age or older and claimed as a dependent by an individual outside of the household ineligible to receive food stamps. Authorizes elderly and disabled individuals to use food stamps to purchase meals prepared and delivered by a political subdivision or private nonprofit organization exempt from taxation under the Internal Revenue Code. Revises procedures for certification and informing potential recipients. Provides for the creation of a Food Stamp Advisory Board to be consulted prior to regulation changes."
