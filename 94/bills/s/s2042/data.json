Rept. 94-852) Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act Amendments - Excludes from the definition of the term \"interstate transmission facilities\" as set forth in the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 any facility which transports gas from an interstate gas pipeline to a direct sales customer purchasing gas for its own consumption. States that the provisions of the Act shall not apply to intrastate pipeline transportation when the safety regulations governing such transportation are regulated by a State agency which has adopted the Federal safety standards. Provides for payment to the States by the Secretary of Transportation of the cost of up to three full-time inspectors and up to half of the cost of other personnel, equipment, and activities required for a State safety program. Requires all persons engaged in the transportation of gas to conduct a program to educate the public on the possible hazards associated with gas leaks and on the importance of reporting gas odors and leaks to appropriate authorities. Provides for the bringing of a civil action by a private citizen against any person alleged to be in violation of this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of specified sums for the purposes of carrying out this Act through fiscal year 1978."
