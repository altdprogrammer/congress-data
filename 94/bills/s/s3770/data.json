    "text": "Nuclear Explosive Proliferation Control Act - Requires that United States national policy include initiatives for international nuclear cooperation and nonproliferation. Requires that nuclear fuel service agreements be in conformance with nuclear material and contract restrictions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Specifies initiatives which shall include development of procedures for nuclear material transfer and safetuards through the International Atomic Energy Agency. Directs the Energy Research and Development Administration, in consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, to establish a safeguard and physical security training program for countries acquiring nuclear facilities. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to revise procedural requirements for the implementation of international nuclear cooperation programs. Requires (1) that agreements for such programs include prohibitions against the use of atomic material for any nuclear explosive device, and (2) that such programs not be undertaken until certain guaranties are made relating to consultation with the United States on safeguards, control mechanisms, and assurances for peaceful use. Requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, upon submission of such proposed agreement to the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy, to furnish the Committee with its views regarding the adequacy of the safeguards contained in such agreement. Sets forth procedures for entering into \"subsequent arrangements\" under such agreements for cooperation. Directs the Energy Research and Development Administration to obtain the concurrence of the Secretary of State and to give full consideration to the recommendations of other concerned agencies to assure that such \"subsequent arrangements\" are consistent with the agreement for cooperation and nonproliferation policy. Requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency to furnish a Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement to the Energy Research and Development Administration regarding such \"subsequent arrangements. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to limit the authority of the Energy Research and Development Administration to distribute special nuclear material to not more than 500 grams per year to any recipient, except under an export license issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Revises the procedures for authorization of the production of special nuclear material outside the United States. Sets forth export licensing procedures under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Prohibits the issuance of any license by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the export of any production or utilization facility, any source material or special nuclear material, or any component which could be of significance for nuclear explosive purposes, or the granting of any exemption from any requirement for such an export license, until the Commission has furnished a copy of such application or proposed exemption to the Secretary of State, and has been notified by the Secretary that the issuance of the license or grant of the exemption will not be inimical to the common defense and security. Requires the Secretary of State, in making such judgment, to obtain the views of other concerned departments and agencies, including a Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement from the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, in accordance with procedures established by the President. Stipulates that no court shall have any jurisdiction under any law to compel the performance of, or to review the adequacy of the performance of, any Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement required under this Act. Directs the President (1) to review the activities of Government departments and agencies relating to the nonproliferation of nuclear explosive devices, and (2) to make an annual report to Congress on such activities. Specifies the information to be included in such report and in the annual reports to Congress by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Energy Research and Development Administration. Directs the Department of State, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and the Department of Commerce to keep the Joint Committee informed of their activities to effectuate this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $2,000,000 for contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency for safeguard activities. Authorizes the additional appropriation of $2,500,000 to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for fiscal year 1977 for export licensing functions."
