Limits such deduction to not more than $2,000 for each individual. Prohibits such deduction unless the individual claimed has been a full time student above the secondary level during each of four calendar months. Prohibits such deduction with respect to a spouse unless such spouse is claimed as an exemption, or unless a joint return is filed. Prohibits such deduction with respect to personal or living expenses. Reduces such deduction by the amount by which the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer exceeds $23,500. Reduces the amount of educational expenses qualifying for the deduction by the amounts received as scholarship or veterans' benefits."
