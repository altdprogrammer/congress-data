Exempts any employer of twenty-five or fewer employees from penalty or citation where non-compliance with specified rules or standards has been found if such employer is able to show that he furnished adequate notice, exerted reasonable efforts to obtain the compliance of his employees, and could not have reasonably prevented the violation. Provides that the Secretary of Labor or his representative may render onsite consultation and advice to employers of twenty-five or fewer employees upon request of such employer. Provides that the Secretary may issue recommendations regarding the elimination of any hazards disclosed within the scope of the consultation, but that no citation or civil penalty shall follow from such onsite consultation except for the purpose of eliminating imminent dangers."
