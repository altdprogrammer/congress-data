Amends the medicaid program of the Social Security Act: (1) to authorize payment for professional services furnished by a licensed psychiatric nurse; (2) to prohibit payment for services furnished by any intermediate care facility or skilled nursing facility which does not have a licensed psychiatric nurse available, on at least a consultant basis; and (3) to prohibit payment for inpatient services furnished by a psychiatric hospital unless such hospital provides to licensed psychiatric nurses the same staff privileges which are extended to physicians. Sets forth regulations governing the licensing of psychiatric nurses by the States under the medicaid program."
