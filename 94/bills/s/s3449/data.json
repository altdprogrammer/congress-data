    "text": "National Child Nutrition Information and Education Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to formulate and carry out a program, through a system of grants to State educational agencies, to provide for: (1) the nutritional training of food service and educational personnel; and (2) the conduct of nutrition education activities in schools and child care institutions eligible under the School Lunch and Child Nutrition Acts. States that the amount of such grants shall be based on a rate of 50 cents for each child enrolled in such facilities. Authorizes appropriations of such amounts as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Requires State educational agencies to keep accounts as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to determine whether the provisions of this Act have been complied with. Establishes, within the National Agricultural Library of the United States Department of Agriculture, a Food and Nutrition Information and Education Resources Center to assemble and collect food and nutrition education materials and to disseminate such information to State educational agencies and other interested persons. States that a maximum of $1,500,000 from the funds appropriated under this Act shall be used for the establishment and maintenance of such Center."
