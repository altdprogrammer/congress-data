Provides that where a showing is made giving rise to a presumption pursuant to this Act, the person engaging in such course of conduct of discharging, emitting, or manufacturing shall have the burden of proving: (1) that in fact no threat to public health exists or that the risk of any such threat is negligible; or (2) that the physical and economic considerations in favor of such course of conduct outweigh all costs incident to the conduct, including any possible threat to public health."
