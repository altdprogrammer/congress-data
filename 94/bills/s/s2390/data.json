    "text": "Federal Assistance Program Consolidation Act - Defines the term \"Federal assistance program\" to mean any assistance provided by an agency in the form of grants loans, loan guarantees, property, contracts (except those for the procurement of goods and services for the Government of the United States), or technical assistance, whether the recipients are State or local governments, their agencies, including school or other special districts created by or pursuant to State law, or public, quasi-public, or private institutions, associations, corporations, individuals, or other persons. States that the President, after finding that a consolidation of Federal assistance programs is necessary to: (1) promote better administration and improve planning; (2) improve coordination; (3) eliminate overlapping and duplication; and (4) promote economy and efficiency; shall prepare a plan for such consolidation and submit it to the Congress for review. Requires each plan to place responsibility for administration of the consolidated program in a single agency, and to specify the conditions under which the Federal assistance programs included in the plan shall be administered. Prohibits the inclusion within a consolidation plan of Federal assistance to programs which are not in the same area. States that any such plan shall become effective after 60 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after submission of the plan to Congress. Provides for Congressional disapproval of such plan within the 60-day period."
