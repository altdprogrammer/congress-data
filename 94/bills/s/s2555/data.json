Directs the Secretary to establish procedures, including public hearings where appropriate, to give State and local governments, rangeland users and the public adequate notice and opportunity to comment upon such program. Requires the Secretary to prepare a rangelands report within two years after enactment of this Act, and a five-year intervals thereafter, and to submit such report to the Congress and make it available to the public. Authorizes a five-year term for permits and leases for domestic livestock grazing on lands within the purview of the Taylor Grazing Act or lands within the national forest or administered in connection therewith. Permits cancellation of such permits and leases for violations of grazing regulations or of permit or license conditions, but requires two years' notification before such cancellation. Grants authority to the Secretary to issue permits or licenses for lesser terms, down to two years, under specified conditions. Authorizes to be appropriated for the purpose of this Act additional funds over and above amounts already appropriated to the Bureau of Land Management in fiscal year 1976 for livestock management, soil and water, and wildlife, as follows: (1) an increase of $10,000,000 in fiscal year 1977; (2) additional increases of $5,000,000 per year each and every year in fiscal years 1978, 1979, and 1980; and (3) increases of $500,000 per year each and every year from fiscal year 1981 through and including fiscal year 2006.
