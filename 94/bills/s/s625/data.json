Rept. 94-76) Emergency Unemployment Health Benefits Act - Adds \"Title IV - Emergency Health Benefits Program\" to the Emergency Jobs and Unemployment Assistance Act. Provides to each individual, who is unemployed and is entitled to receive compensation under a State or Federal unemployment compensation law, and who would, if his employment by his previous employer had not been discontinued, be covered under an employer-sponsored health insurance plan, health insurance benefits of the type and scope which would have been provided under the employer-sponsored health insurance plan. Directs the Secretary of Labor to enter into arrangements with the carriers whereby individuals covered for benefits under this title shall be provided such benefits under the particular health insurance plan by which such individuals were covered while employed by their previous employer. Provides for the payment to such carriers of amounts equal to the premiums. Sets forth requirements for agreements with State agencies to assist in carrying out the provisions of this title, including that State agencies shall notify individuals of their eligibility. Terminates entitlement to such benefits on June 30, 1976. Authorizes the appropriation of necessary sums to carry out this title."
