Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to sell or donate excess wild free-roaming horses and burros. Directs the Secretary to give priority to persons seeking such excess animals for private use. Authorizes the Secretary to order the destruction of wild free-roaming horses or burros in a humane manner, but only if it can be shown that such action is the only practical alternative. Stipulates that upon sale, donation, or destruction, such animals shall lose their status as wild free-roaming horses and burros and no longer be subject to Federal laws relating to their protection, management, and control. Authorizes the Secretary to use aircraft or motorized vehicles on public lands for the purposes of this Act. Stipulates that such authority be exercised only in accordance with humane procedures and with other statutes aimed at the protection of wildlife."
