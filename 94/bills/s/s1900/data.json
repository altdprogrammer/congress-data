Requires, under the Truth in Lending Act, the lessor of personal property to give to the lessee, prior to the consummation of the lease, a dated written statement on which the lessor and lessee are identified setting out in a clear conspicuous manner the terms of the lease, as specified by this Act. Imposes specified limitations upon consumer lease advertising. Makes a lessor who violates the provisions of this Act civilly liable to the lessee. Enumerates damage limitations and defenses for the lessor."
