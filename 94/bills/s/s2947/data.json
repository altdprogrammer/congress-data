    "text": "Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments - Includes within the definition of \"advisory committee\" under the Federal Advisory Committee Act ad hoc advisory groups and bodies advising government entities specified by this Act. Requires that the membership of Governmental advisory bodies be publicly solicited. Requires that one-third of such membership be drawn from private citizens to represent public interests. Requires that the members' names and business affiliations be publicly announced at the time they are appointed. Directs the President to report annually to Congress concerning the status of actions he has taken and recommendations he has accepted from his advisory committees. Requires the President to maintain a current list of the names of all members, past and present, of all advisory committees together with such indices as will contain cross references by the name, business affiliation, occupation, and membership on an advisory committee of such members. Requires a similar list naming persons employed as consultants or experts to the Federal Government giving their affiliations. Requires that the annual report concerning advisory bodies prepared by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget include committees which were created to exist for less than one year and include determinations as to whether an advisory committee has any responsibilities of an administrative, executive, or operational nature, other than providing advice or information, and list all such advisory committees and state whether each such advisory committee has filed a charter as required by such Act. States that such determination shall be made by the Director before any member is appointed to such committees and requires such determination to be published in the Federal Register ten days before such appointment. Provides that the charter of any advisory committee must be submitted to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives and must contain the number of members appointed and their method of selection and appointment. Requires that an audio or audio and visual recording be made of any advisory committee meeting not open to the public and requires that such recording be deposited with the Library of Congress within 24 hours after the close of such meeting. States that if the President or head of an agency to which an advisory committee reports determines that a committee meeting should be closed to the public for reasons authorized by law, such determination must be published in the Federal Register 30 days prior to such meeting. States that any such determination made by a delegate of the President or a delegate of the agency head shall be reviewed by the President or the agency head, as the case may be, upon application of any person. Requires the President or the agency head to advise the person applying for review in writing of his determination to require that any such meeting be held in open session or to sustain or modify the determination made by the delegate. Authorizes the President or the agency head to direct that any such meeting be held in open session. Confers jurisdiction upon the United States district courts to enjoin the closing of such meeting. Authorizes the court to award litigation costs to a party who prevails in a suit brought against a committee under this Act. Directs the administrative authority of the agency concerned to take the corrective action that the Commission recommends with respect to officers or employees and to refer the matter to the Department of Justice for appropriate disposition if any member of the advisory committee with respect to whom corrective action appears necessary is not an employee or officer of the Federal Government. Requires the Attorney General to submit an annual report listing the number of cases arising under this Act, their disposition, and the costs, fees, and penalties assessed with respect to such cases. Provides that such report include a description of the efforts undertaken by the Department of Justice to encourage agency compliance with this Act."
