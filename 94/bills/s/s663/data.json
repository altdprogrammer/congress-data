Limits military assistance to Cambodia to $20,000,000; orders for defense articles and services to $7,500,000; economic assistance under the Agriculture Trade Development and Assistance Act to $19,150,000; and unobligated economic assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1974 to $1,150,000. Requires the President, in order for such appropriations to be approved by the Congress, to report on steps being taken by the United States to end such conflict by June 30, 1975, and on the steps being taken by the Khmer Republic to reach a political and military accommodation with the other side. Requires 50 percent of the food commodities made available to Cambodia to be for humanitarian purposes. States that economic assistance to Cambodia shall, as much as possible, be extended through international agencies or private voluntary agencies."
