    "text": "Contract Disputes Act - Declares that this Act applies to any contract entered into by any executive agency for the procurement of: (1) property (other than real property in being; (2) services; or (3) construction, repair, or maintenance of real property. Authorizes each executive agency to compromise any claim or dispute with a contractor. Provides that when no resolution of the dispute is achieved the contracting officer shall promptly issue a decision in writing, which shall be final unless the contractor seeks an appeal as provided by this Act. Allows a contractor within 30 days to seek an informal conference to consider the possibility of disposing of the claim by agreement. Establishes within the executive branch the Experimental Small Claims Panel of Contract Appeals with jurisdiction to settle contract claims or disputes where the amount involved is $25,000 or less. States that appeals from decisions by such Panel shall be made to a district court of the Court of Claims. Requires the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to report to Congress within 30 months after the effective date of this Act with respect to the effectiveness of the Panel. Permits an agency head to establish within his agency a Board of Contract Appeals when the volume of procurement by the agency justifies a full-time Board. Requires such agency Board to adopt regulations which provide expeditious resolution of disputes. Provides that the decision of an agency Board of Contract Appeals shall be final unless the contractor or Government files an appeal. Grants to a member of an agency Board of Contract Appeals the power to administer oaths, authorize depositions, and require by subpoena the attendance of witness and the production of books and papers. Permits a contractor to appeal an adverse decision by a contracting agency official to the Panel, an agency Board, the Court of Claims, or a United States district court. Requires that appeals by contractors to a district court or Court of Claims be commenced within one year after an adverse ruling by the Panel, agency, Board, or contracting agency official. Gives the Government 90 days to file an appeal from a decision by an agency Board. States that interest shall be paid to a contractor who prevails against the United States on appeal to an agency Board, the Panel, or a court on the amount finally awarded to him from the date such appeal is filed at the prevailing interest rate. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act for three years. Grants to the district courts original jurisdiction, concurrent with the Court of Claims, over any civil action not exceeding $100,000 in amount in contract cases. (Amends 28 U.S.C. 1346, 2401, and 2517)"
