    "text": "Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to establish the Federal Banking Appeals Board which shall be composed of two members appointed by the President and one member appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Specifies three areas of competence and experience which shall be embodied in the Board. Designates the terms of membership and the salaries of the members. Empowers the Board to: (1) conduct hearings; (2) hear appeals taken by any insured bank from any decision, order, instruction, or requirement of the appropriate Federal banking agency of the insured bank; and (3) issue such orders as it deems appropriate where it determines that any decision, order, instruction, or requirement is in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority or limitations or motivated by bias, prejudice, or interest. States that this Act in no way limits the right to judicial review of any person adversely affected by an action of any appropriate Federal banking agency or of the Board."
