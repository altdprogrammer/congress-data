Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to collect information on agriculture, irrigation, and drainage on a sample basis, which is comparable to the information previously collected evey five years in the agricultural census. Allows the Secretary, when sampling methods would be inappropriate, to use other statistical methods to collect information relating to the classification of farms. (Amends 13 U.S.C. 142)"
