Requires Federal agencies to use a form of procurement contract whenever acquiring property or services or whenever otherwise appropriate. Requires such agencies to use a form of grant agreement whenever transferring anything of value to the recipient to accomplish a public purpose and whenever no substantial involvement is anticipated between such agency and the recipient. Requires Federal agencies to use a form of cooperative agreement to transfer anything of value to a recipient to accomplish a public purpose whenever substantial involvement is anticipated between the agency and recipient. Authorizes each agency to make contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements for the conduct of scientific research at nonprofit institutions of higher education or at nonprofit scientific research organizations and to vest in the recipients title to equipment or other tangible property purchased with such funds. Directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to undertake a study to develop a better understanding of alternative means of implementing Federal assistance programs. Requires the Director to report the results of such study to the Committees on Government Operations of both Houses within two years of the enactment of this Act."
