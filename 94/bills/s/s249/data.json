    "text": "(Conference Report filed in House, H. Rept. 94-229) Securities Act Amendments - States that neither an issuer of municipal securities nor an employee of any such issuer acting in the course of his official duties shall be deemed to be a broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer for the regulatory purposes of the Act by reason of the purchase or sale of securities of the issuer. Establishes minimum statutory standards for exchange rules regarding membership and commission rates, as well as rulemaking and disciplinary procedures. Grants the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) authority to require an exchange to file such documents and information as it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Sets statutory requirements that must be satisfied before an exchange may be registered as a national securities exchange, including that: (1) an exchange must be organized and have the capacity to carry out the purposes of the Securities Exchange Act and comply with such Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the exchange; (2) the rules of the exchange must provide that any registered broker or dealer or natural person associated with a registered broker or dealer may become a member of the exchange; (3) the rules of an exchange would be required to allocate equitably reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members, issuers and other persons utilizing the exchange's facilities; (4) exchange rules would be required to be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices; and (5) an exchange's rules would be required to provide that members and persons associated with members will be appropriately disciplined for any violation of the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder or the rules of the exchange. Requires an exchange's rules to permit any registered broker dealer and any natural person associated with a registered broker or dealer to join the exchange and any person to become associated with a member. Authorizes an exchange to deny membership to any registered broker-dealer or natural person associated with a broker-dealer and bar from being associated with a member any person who is subject to a statutory disqualification, as defined in the Securities Exchange Act. Authorizes a national securities exchange to deny membership or condition the membership and to bar or condition on the basis of prescribed standards in the exchange rules of financial responsibility, operational capability, and competence. Prescribes exchange procedures for instituting disciplinary actions, denying membership, and summarily suspending a member or a person associated with a member of the exchange. Specifies the minimum procedural requirements which a national securities exchange would be required to observe in determining whether a member or person associated with a member should be disciplined. Prescribes the procedural requirements applicable to proceedings in respect of exchange action denying membership, barring persons from being associated with a member, or prohibiting or limiting access to services offered by an exchange or a member thereof. Authorizes a national securities exchange to take summary action against a member or person associated with a member or against any person permitted access to services offered by the exchange under limited circumstances and prescribe the procedures applicable to such exchange action. Specifies the authority of national securities exchanges to impose schedules or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts or other fees to be charged by its members for transacting business on the exchange. Permits the Commission to allow national securities exchanges to impose reasonable schedules or fix reasonable rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees to be charged by its members for effecting transactions on such exchanges prior to November 1, 1976, if such allowance would be in the public interest. Permits the Commissions to allow such exchanges to so act after such date if it finds that such rates are reasonable in relation to costs and do not impose any burden on competition not necessary in carrying out this title. States that before approving or disapproving any proposed rule change submitted by a national securities exchange which would impose a schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees to be charged by its members for effecting transactions on such exchange, the Commission shall afford interested persons an opportunity for oral presentation of data, views, and arguments; and with respect to any such rule concerning transactions effected after November 1, 1976, if the Commission determines there are disputed issues of material fact, to present such rebuttal submissions and to conduct (or have conducted) such cross-examination as the Commission determines to be appropriate and required for full disclosure and proper resolution of such disputed issues of material fact. Empowers the Commission to regulate any broker or dealer who effects transactions on an exchange on a regular basis but who is not a member of that exchange or any person effecting transactions on an exchange without the services of another person acting as broker. Prohibits stock exchange members from effecting any transaction on the exchange for their own account, the account of an associated person or an account with respect to which the member or an associated person exercised investment discretion.

Requires the Commission to assure that all securities information processors, i.e., vendors, have access for purposes of distributing, or publishing, on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms to securities quotation and transaction information collected, processed, or prepared for distribution or publication by any exclusive processor of such information. States that if the Commission finds that allowances, discounts or other fees to be charged by its members for effecting transactions on such exchange have been eliminated so that the fairness or orderliness of the market for listed securities has been adversely affected by transactions in the third market, the Commission shall take appropriate action to eliminate or mitigate these consequences. Authorizes the Commission to prohibit brokers and dealers from effecting transactions in registered securities otherwise than on a national securities exchange, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that as a result of transactions in such securities effected otherwise than on a national securities exchange the fairness or orderliness of the markets for such securities has been affected in a manner contrary to the public interest or the protection of investors.
