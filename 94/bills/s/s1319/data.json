Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations exempting specified drugs from the requirements of this Act. States that any interested person may file a petition with the Secretary proposing the issuance of any regulation contemplated by this Act. Directs that such proposal shall be made public and all interested persons shall be afforded an opportunity to present their views concerning such proposal. Requires the Secretary to make public his action upon the proposal. Provides that under specified circumstances any interested person may request a public hearing on the Secretary's action. Requires drug manufacturers to maintain records and make reports to the Secretary concerning clinical experience and other data determined by the Secretary to be necessary to insure that such drug complies with the requirements of this Act.
