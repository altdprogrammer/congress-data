Sets up procedures to be followed in making initial research grants. Provides that each land grant college submitting a research project approved by the Secretary shall be entitled to an initial grant of $100,000. Authorizes the appropriation of $7,100,000 for fiscal year 1976 and the three succeeding fiscal years for such grants. Authorizes the Secretary to make supplemental grants to land grant colleges after specified requirements are met. Authorizes the appropriation of $10,000,000 for 1976; $12,000,000 for 1977; $14,000,000 for 1978; and $16,000,000 for fiscal year 1979 for the purpose of making supplemental grants. Requires that in order to be eligible for such grants under this Act the institutions concerned must expend, on the same general type of research for which funds are made available, an amount at least equal to the amount of funds such institution averaged spending on such type of research in the three calendar years before this Act was enacted."
