    "text": "Materials Research and Development Acts - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a materials research and development program and to make grants and contracts for research, development, and demonstration projects pursuant thereto. Instructs the Secretary to identify, support, and endeavor to create technologies of potentially broad applicability which will promote more efficient utilization, conservation, and substitution of materials that are important to national or economic security. Directs the Secretary to facilitate the commercial application of technologies developed under this Act. Requires the Director of the Office of Technology Assessment to begin, within 180 days after the enactment of this Act, an evaluation of the program and to submit such evaluation to Congress within one year after enactment of this Act. Requires the Secretary to submit annual reports on the administration of the program to Congress. Directs the Secretary, in awarding grants and entering into contracts under the program, to establish procedures for periodic consultation with representatives of science, industry and such other groups as may have special expertise in the area of materials research, development, and technology. Stipulates that the Secretary shall (1) share research and development costs with potential producers of a technology, and (2) take steps to maximize the participation of small business concerns and qualified individuals. Vests in the United States title to inventions made or conceived during or as a consequence of activities conducted in relation to a contract made under this Act. Permits the Secretary to waive such rights in accordance with specified guidelines. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations specifying the terms and conditions upon which licenses may be granted in any invention to which title is vested in the United States under this Act. Permits the reservation of a revocable or irrevocable, nonexclusive, and paid-up license for the practice of such invention to the contractor or inventor thereof. Specifies prerequisite findings for the award of exclusive or partially exclusive licenses. Empowers the Secretary to set such conditions upon the grant of an exclusive or partially exclusive license or upon a waiver of rights as appropriate for protection of the interests of the United States and of the general public. Directs the Secretary, whenever a right under any patent is reasonably necessary to further the goals and policies of this Act, to petition an appropriate United States district court to order the owner and/or the exclusive licensee of such patent to grant a license thereunder at such reasonable royalty and on such reasonable terms as the court may determine."
