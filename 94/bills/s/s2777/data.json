    "text": "Youth Employment Service Act - Establishes the Youth Employment Service within the Department of Labor. Directs the Secretary of Labor to make such arrangements as he deems necessary to assure that there is established a State youth employment service in the State employment service of each State. Authorizes the Secretary to provide grants, through the Service, for the purpose of improving job information, job matching, counseling, and placement for youths both in and out of school. Recommends that placement programs include the establishment of Service offices in: (1) secondary and postsecondary schools; (2) disadvantaged areas; and (3) correctional institutions. Requires the Secretary, through the Service, to make grants to public and nonprofit private agencies for the purpose of training and retraining job placement personnel. Directs the Service to make grants for the procurement of computer programs, survey and statistical data on areas of occupational need, information on educational institutions and opportunities, and other information concerning development of job skills and job placement. Directs the Service to evaluate programs providing employment assistance and to encourage and develop new programs to better meet the needs of youth. Requires that 80 percent of all funds appropriated under this Act be distributed among the States in the proportion which the total number of youths in each such State bears to the total number of youths in all States. Gives the Secretary discretion to disburse the remaining 20 percent as he deems appropriate. Requires that recipients of grants under this Act keep detailed records of all receipts and expenditures of the proceeds of such grants. Provides that such recipients are subject to audit by the Secretary or the Comptroller General of the United States. Directs and authorizes the Secretary to coordinate the programs carried out under this Act with existing programs. Authorizes to be appropriated to carry out the provisions of this Act, $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1976, $10,000,000 for the period beginning July 1, 1976 and ending September 30, 1976, and $75,000,000 for the period beginning September 30, 1976 and ending September 30, 1977."
