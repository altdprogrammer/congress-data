    "text": "Older Americans Amendments - Title I: Amendments to Older Americans Act of 1965 - Adds a new title, Title VIII, Special Service Programs for the Elderly, to the Older Americans Act. States that it is the purpose of this title to provide elderly persons homemaker and other home services, legal counseling assistance, residential repair and renovation, and home mortgage interest reduction and insurance payments. Provides for disbursement by the State agency on aging of funds allotted to recipients of grants or contracts who agree: (1) to utilize methods of administration, including outreach, that will ensure that the maximum number of elderly persons have an opportunity to participate; and (2) to utilize the advice of persons competent in the field of service involved, of elderly program participants, and of persons knowledgeable about the needs of older persons. Authorizes the appropriation of sums necessary to carry out this title, including sums necessary to make interest reduction payments under contracts entered into by the Commissioner on Aging according to the provisions of this title. Provides for the disbursements by the State agency of funds allotted to it to public or private nonprofit organizations which agree to: (1) establish programs to provide elderly persons with homemaker services, reader services, letter writing services, or other services designed to assist such persons in leading a more independent life; (2) establish programs to provide necessary and appropriate legal and other counseling services, including tax counseling and counseling to assist elderly persons living in nursing homes to meet problems and needs arising out of the manner in which such homes are administered, and to train lawyers, lay advocates, and paraprofessional persons; to develop law school curricula and clinical education programs which address the problems and needs of elderly persons; (3) establish programs to make home repairs and renovations necessary for such homes to meet minimum housing standards and to adapt existing housing, or construction of new housing, to meet the needs of elderly persons suffering from physical disabilities; and (4) establish programs to meet the transportation needs of elderly persons. Authorizes the Commissioner on Aging to make interest reduction payments on behalf of sponsors lowering their effective interest rates on mortgages to 1 percent per year. Requires the sponsor to demonstrate that it is providing a fully comprehensive system of supportive services for elderly persons, and to operate the project in accordance with such requirements with respect to tenant eligibility and rents as the Commissioner may prescribe. Authorizes the Commissioner to enter into agreements with States which wish to make interest reduction payments, whereby the Commission will administer the payments for the States. Requires that preference be given in such projects to elderly persons whose incomes are within the lowest practicable limits. Older American Community Service Employment Act - States that in order to foster and promote useful part-time work opportunities in community service activities for unemployed low-income persons who are 55 years old and older and who have poor employment prospects, the Secretary of Labor is authorized to establish an Older American Community Service Employment Program. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations, including national organizations, State or local governmental agencies and Indian tribes in order to carry out the purposes of this title. Directs the Secretary to pay not in excess of 90 percent of the cost of any project which meets the conditions specified in this title, except that the Secretary may pay 100 percent of the cost of emergency or disaster projects, or projects located in an economically depressed area. Directs the Secretary to consult with State and local agencies concerning the areas in which community service programs are most needed. Forbids contracts to be entered into under this title with a contractor who is, or whose employees are, exempted from State workmen's compensation law, unless the contractor makes alternative provisions so that employees enjoy coverage equal to that provided by law for covered employment. Authorizes an appropriation of $100,000,000 for fiscal years 1975 and 1976, $37,500,000 for the fiscal year 1976 transitional period, $150,000,000 for fiscal year 1977, $200,000,000 for fiscal year 1978, and $250,000,000 for fiscal year 1979 for purposes of this title. Directs the Commissioner to reserve from sums appropriated for any fiscal year, not less than 100 percent nor more than 105 percent of an amount which bears the same ratio to such sums for the fiscal year involved as the population of all Indians aged 60 or over on all Federal or State reservations bears to that same population in all States. Allows the Commissioner to make grants to assist in the training of lawyers, lay advocates, and paraprofessional persons who will (1) provide legal counseling assistance to older persons, or (2) monitor the administration of any program by any public or private nonprofit institution, organization, or agency, or any State, designed to provide assistance or services to older persons, including nursing home programs. Provides that during fiscal years 1975 and 1976, the Secretary of Agriculture shall purchase high protein foods, meat and meat alternates on the open market at prices not in excess of market prices to be used for providing nutritional services in accordance with the provisions of title VII (Nutrition Program for the Elderly) of the Older Americans Act. Authorizes and extends appropriations for various programs under the Older Americans Act, including the National Information and Clearing House for the Aged; the Area Planning and Social Service Programs; the Model Projects; the Gerontology programs; the Multipurpose Senior Centers; and the Nutritional Program for the Elderly.

Requires at least one-third of the funds made available for consumer and homemaker education programs under the Vocational Education Act to be used for persons aged 60 and over. Requires that the Director of ACTION make grants to State agencies on aging established under the Older Americans Act. Title III: Prohibition of Discrimination Based on Age - Age Discrimination Act - Provides that no person shall, on the basis of age, be excluded from or denied benefits of any program or activity receiving financial assistance. Directs the heads of Federal departments and agencies to achieve compliance with this title by terminating or refusing to grant assistance to any recipient after certain conditions have been met. Provides that whenever the Attorney General of the United States has reason to believe that any person has violated the provisions of this title, he may bring a civil action in any appropriate United States district court in order to obtain appropriate relief."
