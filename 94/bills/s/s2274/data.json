Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to provide incentives for grain producers to continue the production of grain during times of oversupplyand to take specified steps to protect producers against excessive price reductions during periods of oversupply. Calls for policies to provide adequate quantities for grain to meet extraordinary export demands during periods of below-normal production. States the goal of avoiding the imposition of normal export controls by assuring consumers in the United States an abundant supply of basic food commodities while providing adequate exports."
