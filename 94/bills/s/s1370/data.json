Declares that Congress consents to: (1) the accepting and retaining by an employee of a gift of minimal value; and (2) the accepting by an employee of a gift of more than minimal value when it appears that to refuse the gift would likely have an adverse affect on the foreign relations of the United States. Requires the donee of a gift, within sixty days of acceptance of a gift of more than minimal value, to deposit the gift for disposal with the appropriate agency of the government, or deposit the gift for official use with the agency in which the donee is employed. Requires the donee to file a statement with the appropriate agency of the Government within 30 days. Declares that Congress consents to the accepting, retaining, and wearing by an employee of a decoration given in recognition of combat operations. Directs each agency after December 31, to compile a listing of all statements filed with such agency. Specifies the information to be included in such listing. Imposes a penalty of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than twelve months, or both, for violating the provisions of this Act."
