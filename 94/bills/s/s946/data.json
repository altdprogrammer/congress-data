    "text": "Energy and Resource Recovery Act - States the findings of the Congress that recent shortages of petroleum products and other resources illustrate that the Nation no longer possesses an overabundance of the natural resources necessary for commerce, economic well-being, and the national defense and that resources currently disposed of as waste must be recovered and reused in order to minimize the depletion of remaining virgin natural resources. Provides for the discretionary treatment by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency of specified classes of discoveries and inventions in a manner designed to encourage the participation by private individuals in the Agency's energy and resource research and demonstration program. Provides for the promotion of the commercial utilization of such inventions. Authorizes the Administrator to assist, at the culmination of any successful recovery research projects which are developed pursuant to assistance under this Act or developed without Federal assistance, in the construction of pilot plant facilities for the purpose of investigating or testing the technological feasibility of any promising new fuel, energy, or resource recovery method or technology. Authorizes the Administrator to demonstrate each such method and technology which is evaluated affirmatively at such pilot plant stage or at a pilot plant stage developed without Federal assistance. Requires that each such demonstration shall incorporate new or innovative technical advances or shall apply such advances to different circumstances and conditions, for the purpose of evaluating design concepts or to test the performance, efficiency, and economic feasibility of a particular method or technology under actual operating conditions. Provides that such demonstration shall be so planned and designed that, if successful, it can be expanded or utilized directly as a full-scale operational fuel, energy, or resource recovery facility. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to a regional authority, State or local government agency, or any other person for the construction, operation, or maintenance of fuel, energy, or resource recovery facilities. Authorizes the appropriation of specified amounts to carry out this Act."
