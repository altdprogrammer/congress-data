Stipulates that such authority is also contingent upon the President determining and certifying to the Congress that the furnishing of such defense articles and defense services, and the issuance of such licenses are important to the national security interests of the United States. Authorizes, under the same conditions, the suspension of the prohibitions of this Act with respect to sales, credits, and guaranties for the procurement of such defense articles and services as are necessary in order to enable Turkey to fulfill her responsibilities under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Requests the President to initiate discussions with Greece to determine the most urgent needs of Greece for military and economic assistance. Directs the President to submit to Congress within 60 days after enactment of this Act and each succeeding 60-day period a report on progress during such period toward a negotiated solution of the Cyprus conflict."
