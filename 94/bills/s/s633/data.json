    "text": "Automobile Fuel Economy Act - Declares the findings of Congress that: (1) each day the United States uses approximately 6,000,000 barrels of oil more than it produces from domestic sources; and (2) the amount of oil required for automobile transportation could be reduced by more than 1,000,000 barrels a day through technologically feasible improvements in automobile fuel economy. States that the purposes of this Act are: (1) to mandate the manufacture of cars that use less fuel but without reducing safety or environmental standards; and (2) increase the industry-wide average fuel economy for new automobiles to achieve at least a 50 percent improvement in such average by model year 1980 and at least a 100 percent improvement by model year 1985 over the model year 1974 industry-wide average fuel economy level of 14 miles per gallon. Defines terms used in this Act, including \"average fuel economy. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish, not later than June 1, 1975, minimum average fuel economy performance standards for new automobiles manufactured in model years 1975-1985. Provides that each manufacturer shall comply with the applicable minimum average fuel economy standard for the applicable model year. States that compliance shall be determined by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Allows any person who may be adversely affected by any rule promulgated under this Act to file a petition in the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, or other appropriate circuit, for judicial review of such rule. Authorizes the Secretary or the Administrator to hold hearings, take testimony, and subpena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documents as they deem advisable to carry out the purposes of this Act. Grants U.S. district courts the authority to order compliance with a duly authorized subpena. States that every manufacturer of automobiles shall establish and maintain such records, make such reports, and conduct such tests as the Secretary or Administrator may reasonable require to enable the Secretary or Administrator to carry out his duties under this Act. Provides for public disclosure of information obtained by the Secretary or Administrator, with specified exceptions. Requires each manufacturer to affix on each new automobile, in a prominent place, a sticker indicating the fuel economy which a prospective purchaser can expect from such automobile. Sets forth prohibited conduct under this Act, including: (1) the failure to comply with any provision of this Act or any standard, rule, regulation, or order issued pursuant thereto; and (2) to failure to provide information as required by this Act. Prescribes civil penalties ranging from $50 to $1,000 for violations of this Act, the amount to be assessed by the Secretary or Administrator by written notice. Provides that no State or political subdivision shall adopt or enforce any standards relating to such matters which are inconsistent with this Act. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress and the President a comprehensive report setting forth his or her findings and containing his or her conclusions and recommendations with respect to the 55 miles per hour national maximum speed limit. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Secretary for carrying out the provisions of this Act such sums as are necessary, not to exceed $1,000,000 for fiscal years 1975 and 1976; not to exceed $750,000 for the transitional fiscal quarter ending September 30, 1976; and not to exceed $3,000,000 annually for the fiscal years ending September 30, 1977, and September 30, 1978."
