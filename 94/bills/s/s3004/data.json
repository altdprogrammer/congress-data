Requires the Commission to analyze and appraise the costs, pricing, functioning, and structure of the food marketing industry. Directs the Commission to make interim reports and to submit to the President and to the Congress a final report of its findings and conclusions within 18 months after the date on which funding commences. States that such report shall include treatment of (1) recent changes in the food industry; (2) the responsiveness of food prices to changes in farm-level prices; (3) the kind of food marketing system that would best achieve efficiency of production and distribution; and (4) the effectiveness of the present national policy with respect to the food marketing system. Sets forth the powers and administrative authority of the Commission. Authorizes appropriations of up to $2,500,000 to carry out the provisions of this Act."
