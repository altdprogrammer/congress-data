States that, in order for the court to receive and consider information relating to consent, the defendant must show a pattern of past conduct relevant to the facts in the case and relevant to the consent issue. Provides that the court shall not require the prosecution to produce evidence that supports the victim's testimony if the testimony, if believed, establishes every element of the crime of forcible rape. Directs that, except when physical injury to the victim is alleged by the prosecution, physical injury or evidence of resistance by such victim shall not be required for the prosecution to meet its burden of proof. States that information or other evidence of prior sexual relations or acts between the female and the defendant shall be admissible on the issue regarding consent. (Amends 18 U.S.C. 2031)"
