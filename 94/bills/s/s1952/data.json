Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to establish such office. Requires the Export-Import Bank to provide at least $5,000,000 worth of loans, guarantees, or insurance to finance exports by small business concerns. Transfers existing SBA functions relating to disaster loans to the Secretaries of Commerce, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development. Provides that whenever the SBA determines that small business concerns are or are likely to be at an operational or financing disadvantage with other business concerns with respect to the planning, design, or installation of pollution control facilities, or the obtaining of private financing therefor, it may guarantee the payment of rentals or other amounts due under qualified contracts, and any such guarantee shall be for the full amount of the payments due under such qualified contract."
