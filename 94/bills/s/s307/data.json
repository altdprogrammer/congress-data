    "text": "Motor Vehicle Fuel Economy Act - Expresses the findings of Congress and declares the purposes of this Act, including; to encourage the manufacture of automobiles which reduce the amount of fuel consumed per mile traveled without reducing safety, damageability, or environmental standards. Defines the terms used in this Act - Directs the Secretary of the Department of Transportation to prescribe such minimum average fuel economy standards for any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines as in his judgment are necessary to assure the efficient utilization of fuels by such motor vehicles or engines. Sets forth the objectives of and the factors to be taken into consideration in such regulations. States that regulations shall be applicable to new light-duty motor vehicles manufactured during model year 1977 shall be promulgated not later than two hundred and seventy days after the date of enactment of this Act. Provides that in order to determine whether new vehicles or new engines conform with regulations pursuant to this Act, the Secretary is authorized to test or require testing by such manufactures. Empowers the Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to require manufacturers of new vehicles and engines to submit information and data as to sales and fuel economy and such other information as may be required to ascertain compliance with the requirements of this Act. Requires automobile manufacturers to affix on each new motor vehicle subject to regulation under this Act a label indicating the fuel economy as determined through testing required by or performed under this Act or under title II of the Clear Air Act, and such other fuel economy information as the Secretary may require. Provides that whenever the Secretary determines that new motor vehicles fail or will fail to achieve the fuel economy reported by the manufacturer or that the sales for any subclass or model are or will be substantially different than those reported by the manufacturer he shall inform the manufacturer of such determination and shall recommend corrective action to achieve the established standards. States that if the manufacturer fails to take corrective action within the time required, as determined in a proceeding, the Secretary may order the curtailment or suspension of sales of any models manufactured by such manufacturer. Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Clear Air Act."
