    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service with amendment, S. Rept. 94-211) Part-Time Career Opportunity Act - Makes it the policy of the Government of the United States that at least a certain percentage of all positions in each grade in each agency shall be restructured to the requirements of part-time employment and made available on a part-time career employment basis to individuals who are unable, or do not desire, to work on a full-time basis. Requires that not later than five years after the date of enactment of this Act, at least 10 percent of all positions in each grade of each agency shall be restructured to the requirements of part-time employment and made available to individuals on a part-time career employment basis. Provides for a waiving of such requirements where they would be substantially disruptive. Requires each agency to adopt and maintain procedures, continuously conduct activities and projects, and undertake such other efforts as may be appropriate, to carry out this Act. Directs the Civil Service Commission to promptly formulate and implement, and thereafter supervise, a program to assist agencies in carrying out this Act. Requires each agency to report annually to the Commission on the procedures, activities, projects, and other efforts undertaken to carry out this Act. Prohibits an agency from abolishing a full-time position, subject to this Act, occupied by an employee, in order to establish two or more positions to be made available to individuals on a part-time career employment basis. States that if, on the date of enactment of this Act, a collective-bargaining agreement is in effect with respect to positions occupied by employees which establishes the number of hours of employment in a week, then this Act shall not apply to those positions. Provides that any employee employed on a part-time career employment basis shall not compete for promotion, as the result of being so employed, with any employee in the competitive service employed on a full-time basis."
