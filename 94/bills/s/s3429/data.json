    "text": "Monopolization Reform Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to reform the law with respect to civil monopolization actions brought by the United States to restore competition to markets dominated by monopoly power. Makes the monopoly of trade or commerce a felony (presently a misdemeanor) and increases the penalties for conviction from a fine of $50,000 to $1,000,000 for a corporation, and $100,000 for a person. Increases the term of imprisonment for such offense from one to three years. States that the United States shall have the burden of proving that the defendant has monopoly power in a relevant market. Stipulates that monopoly power due to superior product, business acumen, or historic accident shall not be a defense to any action brought under this Act which alleges monopolization."
