Rept. 94-1632) Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments - =Title I: Findings and Purposes with Respect to Managing the Resources of the Outer Continental Shelf= - Sets forth the purposes of this Act, including the preservation and development of oil and natural gas resources in the Outer Continental Shelf; provision of assistance to States affected by such oil and gas exploration and development; minimization of conflict between such activity and fishing; and establishment of an oil spill liability fund. =Title II: Amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act= - Redefines terms under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, including \"lease,\" \"coastal zone,\" \"affected State,\" \"exploration,\" \"development,\" and \"production. Makes it the policy of the United States that, since exploration, development, and production of mineral resources of the Shelf will significantly affect the various States, such States may require assistance in protecting their coastal zones and other areas, and are entitled to participate in the policy and planning decisions relating to the Shelf. Makes the civil and criminal law of the adjacent States applicable to the subsoil and seabed of the Shelf. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to administer the leasing of the Shelf and to prescribe necessary regulations thereto, including: those for the suspension of activities under any lease or permit in the interest of conservation and prevention of harm to the marine or human environment; those for the cancellation of any lease or permit where a threat to human or marine life or to the national security exists; and those for the development of safety regulations. Allows the issuance of pipeline rights-of-way through the submerged lands of the Shelf. Requires lessees to produce oil and gas, under Shelf leases, at rates issued by the President. Prohibits lessees from flaring natural gas, except under specified conditions. Authorizes six new methods of competitive, sealed bidding and two percentage leasing methods for Shelf leases. Directs the Secretary to choose from among such methods so as to accomplish the purposes of this Act, including providing a fair return to the Federal Government, increasing competition, assuring safety, and developing and discovering new oil and gas resources in a timely manner. Limits use of the bidding system selected to not more than 66 2/3 percent of the total area offered for lease each year during the five year period in each region where there has been no development of oil or gas prior to October 1, 1975. Authorizes the Secretary, after making specified findings, to exceed such limitation if either the Senate or the House of Representatives passes a resolution of approval of the Secretary's finding. Sets forth the procedural rules to be followed by each House with respect to any such resolution of approval. Allows the Secretary, during the first year after enactment, without comgressional approval, to use cash bonus bidding for more than two-thirds of the areas offered for lease if he finds that compliance with the limitation would unduly delay OCS oil and gas development.

Limits oil and gas leases, under such Act, to five years, with a possible five-year extension. Authorizes lease terms of up to ten years in areas of unusually deep water or unusually adverse weather conditions. Permits lessees to explore, develop, and produce gas and oil under such leases. Directs the Secretary to provide the Governor of the relevant State an identification and schedule of areas offered for leasing at the time of soliciting nominations for leasing of lands within three miles of the seaward boundary of such a State. Provides that the Governor of such a State and the Secretary may jointly offer an area for lease, or that the Secretary may independently offer a Federal area for lease. Permits any Federal agency or any person authorized by the Secretary to conduct geological and geophysical explorations in the Shelf which do not interfere with lease operations or unduly harm the marine environment. Requires lessees to submit exploration plans for approval before beginning any exploration. Requires annual reports to the Congress on leasing and production in the Shelf and on ways of promoting competition in Shelf leases. Directs the Secretary to prepare and periodically revise any oil and gas leasing program to implement the purposes of this Act. Requires such program to indicate as precisely as possible the size, timing, and location of leasing activity which will best meet national energy needs for the ensuing five-year period. Requires such program to recognize the principle that management of the Shelf shall consider all of the economic, social, and environmental values of the resources of the Shelf, and shall consider the impact of oil and gas exploration on other resources and on the marine, coastal, and human environments. Authorizes the Governors of coastal and affected States to establish Regional Outer Continental Shelf Advisory Boards after consultation with the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce. Provides that if any such Board or the Governor of any affected State makes specific recommendations regarding the size, timing, or location of a proposed lease sale or with respect to a proposed development and production plan, the Secretary shall accept such recommendations unless he determines they are not consistent with national security or with the overriding national interest. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to conduct a study of any area or region included in any lease sale in order to establish baseline information concerning the status of the human, marine, and coastal environments of the Shelf and other areas which may be affected by lease activities. Requires the Secretary of the Interior and specified other departmental or agency heads, as appropriate, to develop safety regulations applicable to the construction and operation of any fixed structure and artificial island on the Shelf. Requires the National Academy of Engineering to study the adequacy of existing safety regulations for Shelf lease operations, and requires appropriate Federal officials to promulgate a complete set of safety regulations within one year to apply to such operations.

Subjects violators of this Act and regulations thereunder, after failure to take corrective action, to a civil penalty of $10,000 per day of continuing violation; and subjects knowing, willfull and fraudulent violators to a fine of $100,000 and ten years' imprisonment, or both.
