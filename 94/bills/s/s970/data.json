Requires an individual to have established entitlement to weekly benefits under a State or Federal unemployment compensation law in order to be eligible for benefits under this Act. Stipulates that every such individual, and such individual's dependent spouse and children, shall be entitled to hospital and medical insurance benefits if such individual is: (1) unemployed; (2) not entitled under any other provision of law to hospital insurance benefits; and (3) not the dependent spouse. Provides for grants to States equal to 100 percent of the costs and administration for the implementation of programs which supply health benefits to the unemployed. Sets forth the types of hospital and medical services eligible for coverage. Prescribes the portion of the cost of eligible services payable by the program. Creates within the Treasury of the United States a Federal Catastrophic Health Insurance Trust Fund for the Unemployed.

Creates a Board of Trustees of the Trust Fund, to be composed of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.
