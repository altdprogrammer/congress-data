    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1976-06-14", 
    "text": "Credit Information Protection Act - Amends the Consumer Credit Protection Act to prohibit any employee, officer, or agent of the United States from obtaining information contained in the credit records of any credit card issuer with respect to an identifiable credit and customer unless the procurement of such information is permitted by the informed written consent of such customer or is obtained by a search warrant or subpeona issued in accordance with the procedures required by this Act. States that if a subpeona is used to obtain such information, the customer to whom such records relate must be sent a copy of such subpoena and must be given 18 days in which to respond to prevent such obtainment. Provides that notice to such customer of a judicial subpeona may be delayed if a United States court finds that such notification would seriously jeopardize a continuing investigation of specified criminal offenses including murder, kidnapping, robbery, or extortion. Requires a judge granting such delay to report within 30 days after the expiration of such delay to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts with respect to the reasons for such delay. Prohibits transfering from one Federal agency to any other information obtained pursuant to this Act in the absence of specific legislation authorizing such transfer. Permits any person injured by anyone in violation of this Act to sue for actual damages, punitive damages if such violation was willful, and costs of bringing such suit including reasonable attorney's fees."
