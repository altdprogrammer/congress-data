Provides that not more than 25 percent of the total amount allocated to a State in any year may be approved by the Secretary of the Interior for the planning and development of sheltered facilities for swimming pools and ice skatiung rinks if he determines that: (1) the unavailability of land or cilimatic conditions provide no alternative, and (2) the increased public use justifies the construction of such facilities."
