    "text": "Snowmobile Safety Standards Act - Requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to establish safety standards for the performance, design, and construction of snowmobiles and helmets pursuant to its authority under the Consumer Product Safety Act. Lists as minimum safety standards the requirement of headlights, tail lights, a reserve power system to light such lights, reflectors, throttle and emergency control systems, wind and safety shields, a noise suppression system and specified helmet standards. Requires any individual operating or riding as a passenger on a snowmobile on public lands of the United States to wear a helmet. Prohibits the carrying of a firearm on a snowmobile or on a device being towed by a snowmobile while on public lands. Prohibits the operation of a snowmobile on public lands to chase or disturb wildlife and prohibits such operation in an area designated as a wilderness area or cultural or historic site. Sets maximum speeds for such operation in specified areas. Sets a penalty for violation of this Act of imprisonment for up to 15 days or a fine of not more than $100 or both. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a national snowmobile safety training program through the National Park Service and the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation. Sets minimum standards for such program including technical assistance in the establishment of safety programs in each State. Prohibits assistance under this Act to any State that does not require a snowmobile operator or passenger to wear a helmet. Authorizes to be appropriated out of the Highway Trust Fund up to $1,000,000 per year to operate such training program and makes the Fund available to meet obligations resulting from assistance provided under the program established by this Act."
