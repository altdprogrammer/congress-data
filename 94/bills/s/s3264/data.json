Authorizes an individual to take a tax deduction for a part of the acquisition costs of any qualified solar heating and cooling equipment for any residence. Limits such deduction to the lesser of ten percent of the acquisition costs or $800 for the first two years of such acquisition, and five percent or $400 for the third year of such acquisition."
