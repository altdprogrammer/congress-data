Makes the suspension of the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to acquire improved property within the park by condemnation where approved zoning ordinances are in effect contingent upon the Secretary being given the first opportunity to purchase such property. Revises provisions regarding retention of the right of use and occupancy by owners of improved property after such property has been acquired by the Secretary. Increases the membership of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Advisory Commission. Authorizes the appropriation of sums for acquisition of lands and interests in land and for development. Requires the Secretary to complete by the end of 1978 a final master plan detailing the development of the lakeshore.
