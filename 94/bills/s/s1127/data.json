States that the Commission shall, not later than 120 days from the filing of the charge, make a determination whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true. Provides that the Commission can only bring a civil action against an alleged violator if no conciliation agreement is reached between such alleged violator and the person claiming to be aggreived within 30 days after a charge is filed. Takes away the power of the person or persons aggrieved to intervene in a civil action brought by the Commission or the Attorney General in an unlawful employment practice case involving a government, governmental agency, or political subdivision. States that if a charge of an unlawful employment practice is dismissed or not filed within a specified time, or no conciliation agreement has been reached, the Commission, or the Attorney General in a case involving a government, governmental agency, or political subdivision shall take no further action. Provides that notice shall be given to the aggrieved party. States that no civil action concerning an alleged unlawful employment practice may be brought by the Commission or the Attorney General after three years after the date on which a charge is filed alleging an unlawful employment practice by a private party or a government, governmental agency, or political subdivision."
