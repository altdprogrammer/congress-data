Directs the President to order priorities among classes of users and to take such action as may be necessary to meet the needs of handicapped individuals who are unable to use public transportation. Provides that a user for whom rationing is established may petition for a review or modification of his ration, and allows the use of State and local officers or boards to perform such functions. Forbids the imposition of any tax, user fee, or tax credit system in regulations or orders under this Act. Provides that this Act shall terminate 12 months from the date of promulgation of the rule by the President."
