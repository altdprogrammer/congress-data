Prohibits any provision of law or any rule prescribed by the Supreme Court from precluding a Federal court from granting appropriate relief to a prisoner whom it has sentenced upon its finding that the judgment was rendered without jurisdiction, that the sentence imposed was unauthorized, or that the prisoner's constitutional rights have been denied or infringed, unless it also finds that the prisoner deliberately bypassed a procedure available to assert his constitutional rights. (Amends 28 U.S.C. 2254; 2255)"
