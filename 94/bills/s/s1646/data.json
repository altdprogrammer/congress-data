    "text": "Extra Long Staple Cotton Act - Authorizes a target price program for the 1976 and 1977 crops of extra long staple cotton. Sets acreage allotments and planting requirements for eligibility for nonrecourse loans and subsidy payments for such crops under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. Provides for the loss of a farm's acreage allotment if such farm is not planted in extra long staple cotton for 3 consecutive crop years, except where planting was prevented by conditions beyond control of the producer. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to provide for a set-aside program if the total supply of extra long staple cotton becomes excessive or to divert acreage to wildlife food plots or habitats if such acreage is in danger from erosion, insects, weeds, and rodents."
