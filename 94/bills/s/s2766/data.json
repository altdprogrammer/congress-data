Defines \"social research and development\" as research, experimentation, demonstration, program evaluation, policy analysis, statistical data gathering and analysis, or synthesis and dissemination of any of the above involving primarily the application of one or more of the social sciences of economics, sociology, education, psychology, statistics, political science and public administration. Forbids the obligation by any agency of $25,000 or more for any such activity unless: (1) the agency has submitted to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget a statement describing any such activity, including such information as the Director may request; and (2) the Director has informed the agency in writing that he does not disapprove. Requires, under the Budget and Accounting Act, inclusion of information regarding all such planned social research and development in the budget. Prescribes that such information shall include: (1) total estimated outlays for all social research and development activities; (2) estimated outlays for each of the following: research, experimentation and demonstration, program evaluation, other social research and development activities; and (3) a listing and description of any such activity with estimated outlays of $25,000 or more. Requires each agency to maintain at its principal office public documents in the form of summaries of any contracts, grants, and records of such activity, together with information as to where requests may be made for inspection of such records."
