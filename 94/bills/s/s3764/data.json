Requires that a lead agency be designated and that notice of such application be published in the Federal Register. Requires that the designated lead agency publish a draft environmental impact statement within 12 months of designation. Requires public hearings and issuance of a final decision approving or disapproving the pending application be made within an additional 30 days. Authorizes applicants to recover damages for delays in Federal agency decisions on such applications where the delay has exceeded a 540-day period, by petitioning any district court of the United States. Authorizes judicial review of agency decisions with respect to environmental impact statements in the United States courts of appeals."
