    "text": "Open Windows Act - States the finding of the Congress that the projected demand for energy demonstrates the need for a national effort to conserve energy, yet air conditioning of buildings accounts for a substantial and rapidly growing consumption of energy, so that in order to conserve energy, buildings constructed by or for the Federal Government should be so designed and constructed as to permit the manual opening and closing of windows. Includes for purposes of this Act those buildings which are to be leased in whole or in part by the United States after the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes the Administrator of General Services to prescribe such standards for the design, construction, and alteration of buildings as may be necessary to insure compliance with the provisions of this Act."
