    "text": "Provides that a Federal administrative agency may provide by rule that decisions, or catagories of decisions including agency appeal board decisions, become final, unless reviewed by the agency at its descretion. Provides for the establishment of a Committee on Uniform Rules to draft uniform procedural rules for Federal regulatory agencies. Authorizes the appropriation of $50,000 for fiscal year 1976, $100,000 for fiscal year 1977, and $100,000 for fiscal year 1978 for such proposes. Prohibits any agency, or member or employee of an agency, from making any written or oral public statement or release concerning an agency investigation or proceeding if the contents of the statement or release: (1) evidence prejudicial bias or prejudgemnt concerning facts in issue in the investigation or proceeding, or (2) may otherwise harm any person in his business, property or reputation, unless public benefit clearly exceeds such harm. Requires that when any agency makes such statement or release which may reasonably be expected to cause such harm, the agency shall: (1) notify the adversely affected person prior to such statement or release, except where impracticable, and (2) make public by the same means as the statement or release any further agency action or determination the publication of which may reasonably be expected to alleviate the harm to which the adversely affected person had been exposed. Provides for judicial relief for persons aggrieved by violations of this Act. Authorizes a reviewing court to set aside any agency action taken in an agency proceeding or enter such other order as it deems appropriate, if it finds that the provisions of this Act have been violated. (Amends 5 U.S.C. 551,554,556,557,575, and 576; adds 5 U.S.C. 560)."
