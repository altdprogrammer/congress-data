    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, text as amended inserted in H. R. 6755) Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act - Authorizes an appropriation for fiscal year 1975, in addition to amounts otherwise available for such purposes, of $405,000,000 for the performance of functions set forth in the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962 as amended with respect to aliens who have fled from Cambodia or Vietnam. Prohibits obligation of such funds for any purpose after September 30, 1977. Requires the President to make every effort, and to report monthly through calendar 1975 on such efforts, to retrieve all amounts previously authorized and appropriated for assistance to South Vietnam and Cambodia but not expended before the date of enactment of this Act, exclusive of the $98,000,000 of Indochina Postwar Reconstruction funds allocated to the State Department for movement and maintenance of refugees prior to the date of enactment of this Act. Makes such retrieved amounts available to carry out this Act. Reduces the $405,000,000 by such amounts as are retrieved. Requires a survey by the President to determine which refugees want to return to South Vietnam or Cambodia, and provision of funds under this Act for return transportation for such refugees. Defines \"refugee\" for purposes of this Act. Requires a report by the President within 30 days after enactment of the status of refugees from Cambodia and South Vietnam and of his plans for their resettlement. Specifies the contents for such report. Requires the resettlement plan to provide for, on a priority basis, those refugees who have relatives or sponsors in the United States, for resettlement in areas where refugees' skills are in demand, and for resettlement outside areas with high unemployment and housing shortages. Sets forth additional requirements for reports by the President on the status of and resettlement of refugees."
