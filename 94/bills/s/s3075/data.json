    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1976-03-04", 
    "text": "Intergovernmental Coordination Act - Declares the finding of Congress that areawide planning has greatly contributed to the solution of problems which affect the Nation's urban and rural areas, that the differences in the administrative components of Federal planning requirements make it difficult to achieve the purpose of areawide planning, and that failure to integrate planning leads to conflict among public policy objectives. Declares that it is national policy to encourage coordination of all levels of government and of all Federal agencies assisting or requiring areawide planning to achieve the benefits of such planning and eliminate the conflicts arising in the absence of such planning. Amends the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 to provide that any Federal agency which administers programs requiring a State plan as a condition of assistance must require that the Governor of the State or his designee be given an opportunity to comment on the relationship of such plan to comprehensive and other State plans where such plans have applicability to areawide or local planning. Authorizes any areawide agency created by State law or interlocal agreement and answerable to elected officials of local government to perform areawide planning under any Federal assistance program. Requires every metropolitan areawide agency established under the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966 or the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 to adopt and update annually a program for the coordinated use of Federal areawide planning assistance. Prohibits the making of any areawide planning grant after July 1, 1968, to any area that has not adopted such program. Requires that before planning assistance grants are made to any areawide agency not established by such Acts, an agreement must be reached between such areawide agencies and the Federal agency administering the appropriate program which declares the relationships, coordination, cooperative arrangements, and plans which such areawide agency has made with respect to other activities related to areawide growth management. Requires the appropriate Federal agency which permits or requires the division of a State into two or more planning districts to utilize a district plan established by the State upon the request of the Governor of the State as long as the program establishing such district plan meets criteria set forth in this Act. Permits funds to be made available to areawide planning agencies established under the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966 or the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 jointly with funds made available under any other Federal assistance program. Authorizes the Office of Mangement and Budget or any other agency designated by the President to formulate rules to administer this Act."
