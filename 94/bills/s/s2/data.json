Provides, under such Act, that the term \"public interest, convenience, and necessity\" shall not be construed to give the Federal Communications Commission jurisdiction to require the provision of broadcast time to any person for the expression of any viewpoint or otherwise to exercise any power, supervision, or review, over the content or schedule of any program broadcast by licensees, except where the broadcast of such material is otherwise prohibited by law. Repeals the prohibition under such Act relating to political editorials."
