Stipulates that compliance schedules established for such facilities shall be enforceable to the same extent as other compliance schedules established under the Act. Prohibits the construction or modification of major emitting facilities where such facilities will prevent the attainment or maintenance of a national ambient air quality standard. Establishes an exception for construction or modification at existing sites, provided the proposed facility will utilize the best available control technology and will not, in combination with existing facilities at the site, prevent reasonable progress towards the achievement of ambient air quality standards. Authorizes the States and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to issue an order to any primary nonferrous smelter to postpone the date required under an applicable implementation plan for compliance by such source with emission limitations under such plan.

Directs the Administrator to conduct a study of the health and welfare effects of sulfates, cadmium, vinyl chloride, arsenic, and polycyclic organic, and methods for their abatement. Directs the Administrator to make arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences for an independent study of indirect source review programs. Limits the Administrator's authority to require indirect source review programs as part of a State Implemenation Plan. Authorizes the States to suspend or revoke existing programs included in such plans. Requires that State Implementation Plans contain provisions prohibiting the emission of pollutants from any stationary source within a State which will prevent attainment or maintenance of standards in another State. Directs the Administrator to contract for a National Academy of Sciences study of the nature and likelihood of potential effects on the public health and welfare from the release of halocarbons into the atmosphere. Requires further studies of the effects of halocarbons on the ozone in the stratosphere. Directs the Secretary of Labor, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to submit reports on studies of related matters. Directs the Administrator to consider such information and promulgate final regulations for the control of halocarbon discharges no later than April 1, 1978, subject to Congressional review. Imposes civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day for violation of such regulations. Directs the Administrator to establish a Coordinating Committee for the coordination of the efforts of other Federal agencies carrying out research and studies on stratospheric protection. Requires a report to the Congress on the work of such Committee. Sets restrictions on the maximum allowable concentration of any air pollutants. Requires designation of specified national wilderness and park lands as class I areas for purposes of setting allowable ambient air concentrations. Grants States authority with respect to the designation of areas for the purpose of preventing significant deterioration in air quality. Prevents the Administrator from making redesignations without the approval of the Governor of the State affected. Requires the Administrator to adjust any model used for determining the effect of emissions for the unique terrain or meteorological characteristic of an affected area. Directs the Administrator to conduct triennial conferences on air quality modeling. Authorizes the Administrator to grant extensions of up to five years for the attainment of national primary ambient standards where transportation measures are required. Details requirements for the submission of any such extension application by the Governor of the affected State. Directs the Administrator to make grants to local officials in order to assist in the development of transportation control plans for the area. Authorizes decreases in levels of such assistance if localities fail to implement conditions imposed as a result of an extension granted the region by the Administrator. Directs the State to provide a satisfactory process of consultation with general purpose local governments and designated organizations of elected officials of local governments to assure adequate consultation. =Title II: Amendments Primarily Relating to Title II of the Clean Air Act= - Revises emission standards for light duty vehicles to extend for two years from model year 1977 to 1979 the compliance date for light-duty vehicles to achieve a 90 percent reduction of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions from 1970 levels. Revises the applicable nitrogen oxides standard to require model year 1981 light duty vehicles to achieve a standard of 1.0 gram per vehicle mile. Extends the 2.0 gram per mile interim standard through model year 1980. Requires as a condition of certification of new motor vehicles or engines that the manufacturer establish to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the emission control system used will not cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety. Requires the Administrator to revise for model year 1978 the existing evaporative emissions test procedure to measure hydrocarbon emissions from the vehicle as a whole.
