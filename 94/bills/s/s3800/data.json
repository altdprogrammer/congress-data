    "text": "Victims of Crime Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Steets Act of 1968 to authorize the compensation of persons injured by violent criminal acts. Establishes within the Department of Justice the Violent Crimes Reimbursement Board to carry out the purposes of this Act. Specifies the composition of the Board. Requires the Board to order payments, with respect to a violent crime: (1) in the case of the personal injury of an intervenor or victim, to or on behalf of that person; or (2) in the case of the death of the intervenor or victim, to or on behalf of the surviving dependent or dependents of either of them. Limits reimbursements made under this Act to $50,000. Prohibits reimbursement of any claim made more than one year after the commission of the crime. Stipulates the procedure to be followed by the Board for disposition of claims. Specifies the crimes for which resulting injury shall be compensible under this Act. Creates on the books of the United States Treasury a fund known as the Criminal Victim Indemnity Fund from which reimbursements under this Act shall be paid. Stipulates that the Fund shall be the repository of (1) criminal fines paid in the Federal courts; (2) additional amounts that may be appropriated to the Fund as provided by law; and (3) such other sums as may be contributed by public or private agencies, organizations, or persons. Establishes an Advisory Council on the Victims of Crime consisting of the members of the Board and one representative of each State crime victims compensation or reimbursement program. Directs the Council to review the Federal and State crime victims reimbursement programs and advise the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration on matters of policy relating thereto. Requires the Board to transmit to the Congress an annual report of its activities under this Act. Authorizes the Federal Prison Industries to withhold from the wages of any offender employed in such Industries, an amount not to exceed ten percent of such wages to be deposited in the Criminal Victim Indemnity Fund established by this Act. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to make grants to States for the costs of administering crime victims reimbursement programs similar to the Federal program. Establishes eligibility criteria for such State programs. Authorizes the appropriation of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 to carry out the purposes of this Act."
