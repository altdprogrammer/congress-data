Stipulates that such study shall not preclude the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs from initiating action which will insure that veterans wishing to convert from coverage under veterans' group life insurance to an individual life insurance policy will be able to obtain adequate and appropriate information concerning costs of the various conversion policies offered by life insurance companies participating in the veterans' group life insurance program."
