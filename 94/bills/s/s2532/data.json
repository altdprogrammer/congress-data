    "text": "Energy Independence Authority Act - Title I: Findings and Purposes - Declares it to be the finding of Congress that the achievement of energy independence for the United States by 1985 is essential to the health of the national economy, the well-being of the citizens and the maintenance of national security, and that achieving the goal of energy independence in an expeditious manner which gives due regard to the need to protect the environment can be facilitated by establishing an independent entity of limited duration which will provide additional capital, in conjunction with private sources of capital, to assist the development and conservation of domestic energy resources and by encouraging the prompt resolution of questions coming before Federal regulatory or licensing entities. States that it is the purpose of this Act to encourage and assure the flow of capital funds to those sectors of the national economy which are important to the development of domestic sources of energy independence for the United States by 1985 or the long-term security of energy sources and supplies, and to expedite and facilitate Federal regulatory and licensing decisionmaking.

Requires the submission to the Congress and the President of an annual report containing the certified financial statements and general description of the Authority's operations. Title VI: Federal Agency Proceedings - Sets forth the duties and authorities of the Federal Energy Administration in the energy project licensing process. Defines the term \"every project\" to mean any activity in connection with the planning, initiation, construction, or operation of facilities involving the production, distribution, transmission, or transportation of energy, fuels, or energy-related commodities, facilities, or products. Provides for the certification by the Administration of energy projects which meet specified criteria of critical importance.
