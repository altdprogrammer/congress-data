    "text": "Prohibits, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from: (1) establishing maximum limits on the potency of any synthetic or natural vitamin or mineral; (2) classifying any natural or synthetic vitamin or mineral as a drug solely because it exceeds the level of potency which the Secretary determines is nutritionally rational or useful; and (3) limiting the combination or number of any synthetic or natural vitamin, mineral or other ingredient of food within a food to which this Act applies. States that such restrictions do not apply in the case of a vitamin, mineral, or other ingredient of food represented for use by children or pregnant or lactating women. Defines food for purposes of this Act as meaning a food for special dietary use which is or contains any natural or synthetic vitamin or mineral and which is intended for ingestion in tablet, capsule, or liquid form. States that the labeling and advertising for such foods may not give prominence to or emphasize ingredients which are not vitamins, minerals, or a source thereof. Revises procedures for determining liability for misbranded foods. Directs the Secretary to consult and coordinate with the Federal Trade Commission before initiating actions with respect to any food to which this Act applies which is deemed misbranded because of its advertising."
