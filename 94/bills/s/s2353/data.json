Defines \"displaced homemaker\" as any individual who is likely to have difficulty in securing employment because that individual has worked only in the home. Directs the Secretary to furnish to the Congress an evaluation of the model programs with recommendations concerning the administration and viability of such programs. Requires the Secretary to prepare a study to determine the feasibility of allowing displaced homemakers to participate in specified Government programs. Authorizes the appropriation of $4,400,000 to carry out the provisions of this Act until September 30, 1977."
