Rept. 94-438) Provides, under the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act prohibiting specified secondary activity in labor disputes, that such provisions shall not be construed: (1) to prohibit any strike or refusal to perform services or any inducement of any individual employed by any person to strike or refuse to perform services at the site of the construction, alteration, painting, or repair of a building, structure, or other work and directed at any of several employers who are in the construction industry and are jointly engaged as joint venturers or in the relationship of contractors and subcontractors in such construction; (2) to authorize picketing, threatening to picket, or causing to be picketed, any employer where an object thereof is the removal or exclusion from the site of any employee on the ground of sex, race, creed, color, or national origin, or because of the membership or nonmembership of any employee in any labor organization; and (3) to permit any attempt by a labor organization to require an employer to recognize or bargain with any labor organization if another labor organization is lawfully recognized as the representative of his employees or to exclude any such labor organization on the ground that such labor is not affiliated with a national or international labor organization which represents employees of an employer at the common site. Requires a labor organization to provide prior written notice of intent to strike or to refuse to perform services of not less than 10 days to all unions and the employers and the general contractor at the site and to any national or international labor organization of which the labor organization involved is an affiliate and to the Construction Industry Collective Bargaining Committee. Requires notice of 10 days before a strike at munitions or space vehicles installations. Provides that any employer at a common construction site may bring an action for injunctive relief under the Labor Management Relations Act to enjoin any strike or picketing at a common site in breach of a no-strike clause of a collective-bargaining agreement relating to an issue which is subject to final and binding arbitration or other method of final settlement of disputes as provided in the agreement."
