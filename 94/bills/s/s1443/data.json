Includes within the definition of \"test and device\" of the Voting Rights Act, any practice or requirement by which any State provided any ballots, voting or registration notices, forms, or voting registration instructions to voters only in the English language without providing printed translations of such materials in the Spanish language with respect to the Presidential election occurring in November 1972 or any election occurring after such Presidential election where a significant community of persons of voting age reside in such State. Title II: Prohibits prior to August 6, 1985, any State from providing ballots, voting or registration notices, registration forms, voting or registration instructions, or voting or registration assistance to voters in English only, if: (1) a significant community of persons of voting age of such State are of any single mother tongue other than English; and (2) the illiteracy rate in the English language of the members of such group of persons residing in such State or political subdivision is equal to or more than the nationwide illiteracy rate in the English language. Specifies procedures for enforcement of such prohibition."
