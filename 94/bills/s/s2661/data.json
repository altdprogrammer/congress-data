Directs the Board in determining whether to issue such order to consider whether such order (1) is necessary to assure full Board participation, and (2) will unduly prejudice the interests of litigants. Prohibits any such order (1) for a period longer than two years; (2) if the host state has treated the information as non-confidential; or (3) if the host state has stated it has no objection to such disclosure. Authorizes appropriations for the Board for fiscal years 1977 and 1978."
