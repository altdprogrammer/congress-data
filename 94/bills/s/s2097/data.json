Rept. 94-934) Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge Act - Establishes the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge and, in cooperation with the State of Minnesota in an adjacent area, a wildlife recreation area. Requires development, in cooperation with the State, of a three-year comprehensive plan for the conservation, protection, preservation, and interpretation of such refuge and wildlife area. Affords financial assistance to the State to enable it to acquire and develop lands, waters, and interests therein in the wildlife recreation area. Directs the United States Fish and Wilflife Service and the United States Corps of Engineers to assist local authorities in the designation of sites for deposit of spoil material. Prohibits the construction of this Act so as to prevent continuation of vital public services. Authorizes appropriations for acquisition and development of the refuge and wildlife area."
