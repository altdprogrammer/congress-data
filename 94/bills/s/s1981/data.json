    "text": "Emergency Small Business and Agricultural Employment Act - Defines terms used in this Act. States that the provisions of this Act shall apply whenever the Secretary of Labor determines that the national unemployment rate is seven percent or higher for three consecutive months. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a program to identify unemployed individuals who desire to work for a small business concern and to encourage such concerns to employ such individuals. States that employees hired under this Act shall receive not less than $2.30 per hour. Directs the Secretary to assure that employees hired under this Act obtain insurance for workmen's compensation and health benefits when such protection is not otherwise available. Sets forth the conditions and priorities under which unemployed individuals will be referred to small business concerns under this Act. Sets forth the procedures and conditions under which small businesses may apply for participation in the program authorized by this Act. States that prospective employers must certify that: (1) no employee hired pursuant to this Act will displace a regular employee; and (2) no regular employee will be laid off as a result of the employment of a worker under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to pay to each small business employer a supplement of $1.00 per hour for each employee hired pursuant to this Act in order to assure that such employees are paid a minimum of $2.30 per hour. Limits the period of such payments to two years except that such payments will be paid for only one year when started within six months of the termination of the provisions of this Act because of a decline in unemployment. States that no unemployment tax shall be collected with respect to employment under this Act, nor shall unemployment benefits accumulate. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act for fiscal year 1976 and the transition period ending September 30, 1976, and for fiscal years 1977 and 1978."
