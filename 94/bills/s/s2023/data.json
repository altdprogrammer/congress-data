Rept. 94-712) Prohibits any common carrier by water subject to the Shipping Act of 1916 from submitting to the Department of Defense (DOD) rates or charges covering shipments of household goods, moving in whole or in part by water, in the foreign commerce of the United States, unless those rates or charges have been filed with the Federal Maritime Commission at least 30 days prior to the date of such submission. Provides that upon the filing of such rates or charges, interested persons shall have 15 days within which to file a protest, otherwise such rates or charges shall become effective without further leave to petition. States that if it should appear upon protest to the Commission that such rates or charges may be higher or lower than those of any common carrier by water subject to these provisions applicable to substantially the same transportation services performed for the DOD pursuant to tariffs, the Commission shall institute a hearing whereupon the protested rates or charges shall be of no force and effect until the Commission determines that they are not higher or lower, or that they are compensatory on a fully-distributed cost basis."
