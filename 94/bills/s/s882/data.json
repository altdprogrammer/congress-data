    "text": "States that the purpose of this Act is to provide supplemental nutritious food to pregnant women, infants, and young children in order to prevent the occurrence of health problems due to poor or inadequate nutrition. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make cash grants to the health department or comparable agency of each State, the Indian Health Service, and Indian tribes to enable them to carry out health and nutrition programs under which supplemental foods will be made available to all pregnant or lactating women and to infants determined by competent professionals to be nutritional risks because of inadequate nutrition and inadequate income, in order to improve their health status. Authorizes appropriations of $300,000,000 for each fiscal year to carry out such programs. States that if such sum has not been appropriated by July 1 of each fiscal year, the Secretary is authorized to use $300,000,000 out of funds already appropriated for other programs. Directs the Secretary to pay up to 25 percent of the administrative costs of State or local agencies administering the program authorized by this Act. Requires State and local agencies to maintain adequate medical records on participants in the program to enable the Secretary to determine and evaluate the benefits of the nutritional assistance program. Directs the Secretary to convene an advisory committee to study methods to evaluate the health benefits of special supplemental food program. Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress his recommendations based on this study no later than March 1, 1976. Defines the terms used in this Act. Establishes the National Advisory Council on Maternal, Infant, and Fetal Nutrition, to be composed of fifteen members appointed by the Secretary. Directs the Council to make a continuing study of the operation of the special supplemental food program and any related Act under which diet supplementation is provided to women, infants, and children, with a view to determining how such programs may be imposed. Requires the Council to annually submit to the President and Congress a written report of the results of its study together with such recommendations for administrative and legislative changes as it deems appropriate."
