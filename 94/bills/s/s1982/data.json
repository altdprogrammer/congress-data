    "text": "Ozone Preservation Act - Declares it to be the finding of Congress that the discharge of certain fluorocarbons into the atmosphere from aerosal spray containers threatens to deplete the protective layer of ozone in the earth's atmosphere thereby increasing the incidence of solar ultraviolet radiation and threatening human health and agricultural crops. States that one year and a half after the enactment of this Act the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, under the Clean Air Act, shall prohibit the sale and distribution of aerosol spray containers which use certain fluorocarbons. Directs the Administrator, at the same time, to issue regulations controlling other uses of flurocarbons and chlorofluoromethane compounds such as in air conditioning systems. Provides for the waiving of any such regulations if scientific information later determines that flurocarbon compounds do not pose a threat to the public health. Provides a civil penalty of a fine of up to $1,000 per day or one year of confinement, or both, for violation of regulations promulgated under this Act. Authorizes the appropriations of such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1975, 1976, 1977, and for the transition period ending September 30, 1976."
