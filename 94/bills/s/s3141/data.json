    "text": "United States Grain Standards Act Amendments - Title I: Declaration of Policy - Revises the U.S. Grain Standards Act to declare the Congressional finding that the regulation of grain transactions provided in this Act is necessary to prevent or eliminate burdens on grain commerce and to regulate such commerce. Title II: Official Inspection - Revises definitions under the Grain Standards Act to meet purposes of this Act. Requires the official inspection at export grain elevators required or authorized to be inspected under this Act be performed by authorized employees of the Department of Agriculture. Authorizes the Secretary to require that grain loaded at an interior point in the United States for transportation from the United States be inspected in a similar manner. Allows the Secretary to enter into contracts with any State or person for such inspection functions if such State or person meets specified requirements. Forbids the Secretary from entering into such contracts with any person or business entity currently engaged in the storage or merchandising of grain. States that official inspection contracts entered into terminate within five years and may be renewed in accordance with criteria specified in this Act. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to audit the books and records of official inspection contractors at least biennially and at the expiration of such contract. Allows the Secretary to revoke such contracts, after an opportunity for a hearing has been afforded, when the Secretary determines the contractor has not complied with any provision of this Act. Allows the suspension of such contract for 30 days without a hearing when the Secretary has reason to believe there is cause for revocation. Provides for the inspection of American grain in Canadian ports for overseas shipment. Title III: Official Inspection Personnel - Requires the licensing of any person performing inspection functions under this Act. States that all such licenses shall expire triennially and any license shall be suspended automatically when the licensee ceases to be employed by an official grain inspection contract. Provides for the periodic rotation of supervisory personnel for grain inspection for the stated purpose of preserving the integrity of the inspection system. Allows the Secretary to automatically revoke any license issued under this Act if the licensee has been convicted of any offense specified in this Act. Title IV: Refusal of Inspection and Civil Penalties - Allows the Secretary to refuse to provide official inspection of grain or assess a civil penalty of $100,000 per violation or both for any individual violating the provisions of this Act. Allows the Secretary to refuse inspection for seven days without a hearing pending final determination of the proceedings when the Secretary has reason to believe there is sufficient cause. Title V: Records - Requires the maintenance of records of purchases, sales, transportation and handling by any person who receives official inspection and that such records be made available to authorized representatives of the Secretary. Title VI: Weighing - Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) investigate the weighing of grain shipped in interstate or foreign commerce; (2) prescribe regulations and standards for accurate weighing and certification procedures; and (3) require the maintenance of accurate records of the weighing of all grain shipped in or out of grain elevators. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations regarding all weights and scales used in such weighing. Requires that representatives of the Secretary be afforded access to any elevator or warehouse from which grain is delivered or shipped in interstate or foreign commerce. Title VII: Funding - Directs the Secretary to charge and collect reasonable fees to cover the performance of official inspection and supervision of weighing functions. States that such fees and any proceeds from the sale of samples obtained for inspection purposes which become the property of the United States, shall be deposited in a fund for the expenses of the Department in providing official inspection services. Title VIII: Criminal Provisions - Prescribes criminal penalties for specified offenses under this Act. Title IX: Department of Agriculture Reporting Requirements and Studies - Directs the Secretary to report annually to specified Congressional committees regarding the effectiveness of the official grain inspection system together with recommendations for legislation. Directs the Secretary to notify such Committees of complaints regarding faulty grain delivery made by a foreign purchaser. Requires an annual summary of all complaints make by foreign purchasers or prospective purchasers. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study regarding the adequacy of current grain standards and make such changes as are determined to be necessary and appropriate.
