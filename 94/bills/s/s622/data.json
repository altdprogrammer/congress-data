    "text": "(Motion to strike certain provisions of conference report passed house, roll call #786 (300-103)) Energy Policy and Conservation Act - =Title I: Matters Related to Domestic Supply Availability= - Extends through June 30, 1977, the authority of the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration under the Enery Supply and Environmental Coordination Act to issue orders prohibiting power plants and major fuel burning installations from using natural gas or petroleum products as fuel if they had been capable on June 22, 1974, of burning coal. Extends the period during which such orders may be enforced to December 31, 1984. Increases such authority of the Administrator to include such plants and installations which acquire the capability of using coal after June 22, 1974. Authorizes the Administrator to guarantee loans for the purpose of developing new underground coal mines. Permits such loans to equal $30,000,000 for any one individual and $750,000,000 in the aggregate, not more than 20 percent of which may be for new high sulfur coal mines. Makes eligible for such loans those persons (including those affiliated with such persons) who did not produce more than 1,000,000 tons of coal and did not produce more than 300,000 barrels of crude oil or own an oil refinery in the year preceding application. Permits the President to restrict exports of coal, petroleum products, natural gas, or petrochemical feedstocks, and supplies of materials or equipment for exploration, production, refining, or transportation of energy supplies. Authorizes the President to exempt crude oil and natural gas exports from such restriction where he deems such exemption to be in the national interest, such as in recognition of the historic trading relations with Mexico and Canada. Requires quarterly reports to the Congress on any such restrictions made. Authorizes the President to require the allocation of, or the priority performance under contracts or orders relating to, supplies of materials and equipment in order to maximize domestic energy supplies if he finds that maintenance or furtherance of exploration, production, refining, transportation or conservation of energy supplies or the construction and maintenance of energy facilities cannot reasonably be accomplished without exercising such authority. Directs the President to report within 60 days of enactment of this Act on the manner in which such authority will be administered. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to prescribe and effectuate, not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act, a rule which prohibits the bidding for any right to develop crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on any lands located on the Outer Continental Shelf by any person if more than one major oil company, more than one affiliate of a major oil company, or a major oil company and any affiliate of a major oil company, has or have a significant ownership interest in such person. Directs the Secretary to determine the maximum efficient rate of production and, if any, the temporary emergency production rate for each field on Federal lands which produces, or is determined to be capable of producing, significant volumes of crude oil or natural gas, or both. Permits the President to require crude oil or natural gas, or both, to be produced from fields on Federal lands designated by him at the maximum efficient rate of production, and during a severe energy supply interruption, at the temporary emergency production rate. Permits such rates to be determined by the States and to be followed at the President's discretion. Creates a Strategic Petroleum Reserve Office in the FEA. Requires creation of a Strategic Petroleum Reserve for storage of up to 1,000,000,000 barrels of petroleum products. Requires storage within three years of enactment of at least 150,000,000 barrels of petroleum products in such Reserve or in the Early Storage Reserve. Requires the FEA Administrator to transmit to the Congress by December 15, 1976, a Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan, which provides, in part, that within seven years of enactment the crude oil stored in the Reserve shall equal the total volume of crude oil imported during a specified three-month base period. States that such Plan shall include an environmental assessment, a description of the type and proposed location of storage facilities, a cost estimate, an evaluation of the impact on petroleum prices of developing the Reserve, and a distribution plan. Provides for establishment of an Early Storage Reserve in existing facilities to provide for meeting regional needs for residual fuel oil and refined petroleum products. Requires submission to the Congress within 90 days of enactment of an Early Storage Reserve Plan. Authorizes the Administrator to establish an Industrial Petroleum Reserve, to be created by requiring each importer of petroleum products and each refiner to store such products in amounts of up to three percent of their previous years imported or refined amount. Requires the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan to provide for the establishment and maintenance of a Regional Petroleum Reserve in, or readily accessible to, each Federal Energy Administration Region, in which imports of residual fuel oil or any refined petroleum product, during the 24-month period preceding the date of computation, equals more than 20 percent of demand for such oil or product in such regions during such period, as determined by the Administrator. Directs the Administrator to submit, within six months of enactment, a report on his recommendations regarding establishment of utility reserves, coal reserves, and remote crude oil and natural gas reserves. States that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan must be submitted to the Congress before becoming effective, and gives the Congress a right of disapproval of such plans. Authorizes the Administrator, for purposes of implementing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan or the Early Storage Reserve Plan, to place in storage, transport, or exchange: (1) crude oil produced from Federal lands, including crude oil produced from the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the extent that such production is authorized by law; (2) crude oil which the United States is entitled to receive in kind as royalties from production on Federal lands; and (3) petroleum products acquired by purchase, exchange, or otherwise. States that no drawdown or distribution of the Reserve may be made except in accordance with the Distribution Plan. States that neither the Distribution Plan contained in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan nor the Distribution Plan contained in the Early Storage Reserve Plan may be implemented, and no drawdown and distribution of the Reserve or the Early Storage Reserve may be made, unless the President has found that implementation of either such Distribution Plan is required by a severe energy supply interruption or by obligations of the United States under the international energy program. Permits the Administrator to require any person to prepare and maintain such records or accounts as the Administrator, by rule, determines necessary to carry out the purpose of this title, and to audit the operations of any storage facility. Requires the Administrator, in cooperation with the Secretaries of the Navy and the Interior, to submit, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, to the Congress a report recommending procedures for the exploration, development, and production of Naval Petroleum Reserve Number 4. Requires the Administrator to report to the President and the Congress, not later than one year after the transmittal of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan to the Congress and each year thereafter, on all actions taken to implement this title. Authorizes necessary appropriations to implement the Early Storage Reserve, and $100,000,000 to develop the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan. =Title II: Standby Energy Authorities= - Requires, within 180 days after enactment, the President to transmit to the Congress one or more energy conservation contingency plans and a rationing contingency plan. States that such plan may remain in effect for a period specified in the plan but not more than nine months, unless earlier rescinded by the President. Provides that no contingency plan shall be effective unless: (1) the President has transmitted such plan to Congress; (2) such contingency plan has been approved by a resolution by each House of Congress; and (3) after approval of such contingency plan the President has found that putting such contingency plan into effect is required by a severe energy supply interruption or in order to fulfill obligations of the United States under the international energy program, and has transmitted such finding to the Congress, together with a statement of the effective date and manner of exercise of such plan. Requires any such plan which the President transmits to the Congress to contain a specific statement explaining the need for and the rationale and operation of such plan and shall be based upon a consideration of, and, to the extent practicable, be accompained by an evaluation of, the potential economic impacts of such plan, including an analysis of: (1) any effects of such plan on (a) vital industrial sectors of the economy; (b) employment; and (c) the availability and price of consumer goods and services; and (2) any potential anticompetitive effects. Requires the President to prescribe one or more energy conservation contingency plans. States that an energy conservation contingency plan may not: impose rationing or any tax, tariff, or user fee; contain any provision respecting the price of petroleum products; or provide for a credit or deduction on computing any tax. Requires the President to prescribe a rationing contingency plan, which shall be deemed a part of the regulation under the Emergency Petroleum Act, which shall provide: (1) for the establishment of a program for the rationing and odering of priorities among classes of end-users of gasoline and diesel fuel used in motor vehicles; and (2) for the assignment of rights, and evidence of such rights, to end-users of gasoline and such diesel fuel. Directs the President to provide for the use of local boards with authority to receive petitions from any end-user of gasoline and diesel fuel used in motor vehicles with respect to the priority and entitlement of such user under a rationing contingency plan; and order a reclassification or modification of any determination made under a rationing contingency plan with respect to such end-user's rationing priority or rights. Provides that no rationing contingency plan under this title may: (1) impose any tax; (2) provide for a credit or deduction in computing any tax; or (3) impose any user fee, except to the extent necessary to defray the cost of administering the rationing contingency plan. Permits the President to require that persons engaged in producing, transporting, refining, distributing, or storing petroleum products, take such action as he determines to be necessary for implementation of the obligations of the United States under the international energy program insofar as such obligations relate to the international allocation of petroleum products. States that no such requirement may take effect unless the President has transmitted such rule to the Congress; has found that putting such rule into effect is required in order to fulfill obligations of the United States under the international energy program; and has transmitted such finding to the Congress, together with a statement of the effective date and manner for exercise of such rule. Limits the effective period of any such requirement to 12 months. Directs the Administrator, with the approval of the Attorney General, after each of them has consulted with the Federal Trade Commission and the Secretary of State, to prescribe, by rule, standards and procedures by which persons engaged in the business of producing, transporting, refining, distributing, or storing petroleum products may develop and carry out voluntary agreements, and plans of action, which are required to implement the allocation and information provisions of the international energy program. Requires meetings held to develop or carry out a voluntary agreement or plan of action to permit attendance by representatives of committees of Congress and interested persons, including all interested segments of the petroleum industry, consumers, and the public. States that interested persons permitted to attend such a meeting shall be afforded an opportunity to present, in writing and orally, data, views, and arguments at such meetings. Requires a full and complete record, and where practicable a verbatim transcript, be kept of any meeting held, and a full and complete record to be kept of any communication (other than in a meeting) made, between or among participants or potential participants, to develop or carry out a voluntary agreement or a plan of action. Provides that the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission shall participate in the development, and when practicable, in the carrying out of voluntary agreements and plans of action. Requires any action taken pursuant to such voluntary agreement or plan of action be reported to the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission. Provides that a plan of action may not be approved by the Attorney General unless such plan describes the types of substantive actions which may be taken under the plan. Requires the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to monitor the Development and carrying out of voluntary agreements and plans of action authorized under this Act in order to promote competition and to prevent anticompetitve practices and effects. Requires a report to the Congress every six months on the effect on small business of such international agreements and plans of action. Terminates authority relating to such agreements and plans on June 30, 1979. Permits the Administrator to provide for the establishment of such advisory committees as he determines are necessary to achieve the purposes of the international energy program with respect to international allocation of petroleum products and the information system provided in such program. Permits the Administrator, after consultation with the Attorney General, to provide to the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State to transmit to the International Energy Agency established by the international energy program, the information and data related to the energy industry certified by the Secretary of State as required to be submitted under the international energy programs. States that if the President determines that the transmittal of data, or information pursuant to the authority of this Act would prejudice competition, violate the antitrust laws, or be inconsistent with United States national security interests, he may require that such data or information not be transmitted. =Title III: Improving Energy Efficiency= - Adds to the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act a new title as follows: \"Title V: Improving Automotive Efficiency\". Requires that the average fuel economy for passenger automobiles manufactured by any manufacturer in any model year after model year 1977 shall not be less than the number of miles per gallon established for such model year, as follows: 18.0 miles per gallon in 1978, increasing to 27.5 miles per gallon in 1985 and thereafter. Requires a yearly report to the Congress on the implementation of average fuel economy standards. Permits manufacturers to apply for a modification of any average fuel economy standard for model years 1978, 1979, or 1980. Provides that if a manufacturer demonstrates and the Secretary finds that a Federal standards fuel economy reduction is likely to exist for such manufacturer for the model year to which the application relates, and such manufacturer applied a reasonably selected technology, the Secretary shall reduce the average fuel economy standard. Defines \"Federal standards fuel economy reduction\" to mean reduction of a manufacturer's average fuel economy standard resulting from application of Federal standards under the Clean Air Act, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, and the Noise Control Act. Specifies the method by which the EPA Administrator shall calculate average fuel economy. Requires separate consideration in such calculation of domestically and foreign manufactured automobiles. Permits judicial review for those adversely affected by rules prescribed under the provisions of this title relating to automobile fuel economy. Requires each manufacturer to submit a report to the Secretary during the 30-day period preceding the beginning of each model year after model year 1977, and during the 30-day period beginning on the 180th day of each such model year, containing: (1) a statement as to whether such manufacturer will comply with average fuel economy standards; (2) a plan which describes the steps the manufacturer has taken or intends to take in order to comply with such standards; and (3) such information as the Secretary may require. Requires each manufacturer to cause to be affixed, and each dealer to cause to be maintained, on each automobile manufactured in any model year after model year 1976, in a prominent place, a label indicating the fuel economy of such automobile, the estimated annual fuel cost associated with the operation of such automobile, and the range of fuel economy of comparable automobiles (whether or not manufactured by such manufacturer). Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this title, and a system of credits toward such penalties based upon the extent to which a manufacturer exceeds average fuel economy standards. Imposes an additional civil penalty of $10,000 per day of continuing violation of this title by any person. Provides that the President shall, within 120 days after the date of enactment of this title, promulgate rules which shall require that all passenger automobiles acquired by all executive agencies in each fiscal year which begins after such date of enactment achieve a fleet average fuel economy for such year not less than 18 miles per gallon, or the average fuel economy standard for the model year which includes January 1 of such fiscal year, whichever is greater. Requires the Federal Trade Commission to establish a program for systematically examining fuel economy representations made with respect to retrofit devices. Requires the Administrator to direct the development of test procedures for the determination of estimated annual operating costs for home appliances. States that effective 90 days after a test procedure rule applicable to a covered product is prescribed under this title, no manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler may make any representation in writing (including a representation on a label), or any broadcast advertisement, respecting the energy consumption of such product or cost of energy consumed by such product, unless such product has been tested in accordance with such test procedure and such representation fairly discloses the results of such testing. Directs the Federal Trade Commission to prescribe labeling rules applicable to all covered products, except to the extent that the Administrator determines that test procedures cannot be developed which meet the requirements of this title; or the Commission determines that labeling is not technologically or economically feasible. States that a rule prescribed under this title shall require that each covered product bear a label which discloses the estimated annual operating cost of such product. Provides that, not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall, by rule, prescribe an energy efficiency improvement target for each type of covered product, which shall be designed so that, if met, the aggregate energy efficiency of covered products which are manufactured in calendar year 1980 will exceed the aggregate energy efficiency achieved by products of all such types manufactured in calendar year 1972 by a percentage which is the maximum percentage improvement which the Administrator determines is economically and technologically feasible, but which in any case is not less than 20 percent. Sets forth the procedure by which an energy efficiency standard shall be prescribed. Provides that the provisions of this Act relating to home appliances and the labeling thereof shall supersede any State regulation insofar as such State regulation may provide for the disclosure of information with respect to any measure of energy efficiency or energy use of a covered product. Prohibits importation of such appliances not meeting the requirements of this Act. Makes it unlawful for any manufacturer or private labeler to distribute in commerce any new covered product unless such covered product is labeled in accordance with this Act; or for any manufacturer or private labeler to distribute in commerce any new covered product which is not in conformity with an applicable energy efficiency standard. Allows any person to commence a civil action against any manufacturer or private labeler who is alleged to be in violation of any provision of this title or any rule thereunder; or any Federal agency which has a responsibility under this title where there is an alleged failure of such agency to perform any act or duty under this part which is not discretionary. Directs the Administrator to carry out a program of consumer education regarding the significance of estimated annual operating costs; and to report annually to the President on the progress of the program relating to home appliances and labeling. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1978 to carry out such program. Provides that the Administrator shall, by rule, within 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, prescribe guidelines for the preparation of a State energy conservation feasibility report; and shall invite the Governor of each State to submit, within 3 months after the effective date of such guidelines, such a report. Requires such report to include: (1) an assessment of the feasibility of establishing a State energy conservation goal, which goal shall consist of a reduction, as a result of the implementation the State energy conservation plan described in this title, of 5 percent or more in the total amount of energy consumed in such State in the year 1980 from the projected energy consumption for such State in the year 1980; and (2) a proposal by such State for the development of a State energy conservation plan to achieve such goal. Provides that the Administrator shall, by rule, within 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, prescribe guidelines with respect to measures required to be included in, and guidelines for the development, modification, and funding of, State energy conservation plans. Requires the Administrator to invite the Governor of each State to submit, within 5 months after the effective date of such guidelines, a report which shall include a proposed State energy conservation plan designed to result in scheduled progress toward, and achievement of, the State energy conservation goal of such State. Makes technical and financial assistance available to States for the development and implementation of energy conservation plans. Requires the Administrator to set an energy conservation goal for each State by 1980. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such provisions relating to energy conservation plans; and requires annual reports to the Congress and the President on the operation of such provisions. Directs the Administrator to establish and maintain, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration, a program to promote increased energy efficiency by American industry, and to establish voluntary energy efficiency improvement targets for at least the 10 most energy-consumptive major energy-consuming industries. Requires the President to establish or coordinate Federal agency actions to develop mandatory standards with respect to energy conservation and energy efficiency to govern the procurement policies and decisions of the Federal Government and all Federal agencies, and to develop and implement a 10-year plan for energy conservation with respect to buildings owned or leased by an agency of the United States. Directs the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Maritime Commission, the Federal Power Commission, and the Federal Aviation Administration to each conduct a study and report to the Congress within 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act with respect to energy conservation policies and practices which such agencies have instituted subsequent to October 1973. Requires the Federal Trade Commission to prescribe: (1) test procedures for the determination of substantial equivalency of re-refined or otherwise processed used oil or blend of oil; and (2) labeling standards applicable to containers of recycled oil. =Title IV: Petroleum Pricing Policy and Other Amendments to the Allocation Act= - Requires that, not later than the first day of the second full calendar month following the date of enactment of this title, the President shall promulgate and make effective an amendment to the regulation under of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act which regulation, as amended, shall establish ceiling prices applicable to any first sale of crude oil produced in the United States, such that the resulting actual weighted average first sale price for all such crude oil during such calendar month and each of the 39 months thereafter shall not exceed a maximum of $7.66 per barrel, except as may be adjusted pursuant to this title. States that no amendment to such regulation may permit an increase in the price for any volume of old crude oil production from any properties, unless the President finds that such amendment will give positive incentives for enhanced recovery techniques. Provides that the President may submit to the Congress, in accordance with the procedures specified in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, an amendment to the regulation promulgated which provides for a production incentive adjustment to the maximum weighted average first sale price in excess of the 3 per cent limitation, a combined adjustment limitation in excess of the 10 per cent limitation, or both. Disallows such an amendment from taking effect if the Congress disapproves it. Requires that on February 15, 1977, the President shall submit to the Congress a report containing an analysis of the impact of any such amendment adopted on the economy and on the supply of crude oil, residual fuel oil, and refined petroleum products. Permits the President to submit with such report to the Congress, in accordance with the procedures specified in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, an amendment to the regulation promulgated which: (1) provides for the continuation or modification of the adjustment as a production incentive; (2) provides for a modification of the combined adjustment limitation. Provides that on April 15, 1977, the President shall submit to the Congress a report as to whether the regulation promulgated and in effect on such date will provide positive price incentives for the development of the domestic crude oil production without lessening needed incentives for sustaining or enhancing crude oil production in the remainder of the United States. States that if the President determines that a price required to provide positive price incentives for the development of the domestic crude oil production would, because of the maximum weighted average first sale price, as adjusted, have the effect of reducing or limiting ceiling prices permitted for crude oil produced in the remainder of the United States to levels which would result in less production of such crude oil than would otherwise occur, the President may, together with such report, submit to the Congress an amendment to the regulation which: (1) excludes up to 2,000,000 barrels a day of crude oil production transported through the trans-Alaska pipeline from the computation of the maximum weighted average first sale price; and (2) establishes ceiling prices for the first sale of crude oil production. States that the promulgated regulation shall provide for a dollar-for-dollar passthrough in prices at all levels of distribution from the producer through the retail level of decreases in the cost of crude oil, residual fuel oil, and refined petroleum products. Requires such regulation to provide for a dollar-for-dollar passthrough of net increases in the cost of crude oil, residual fuel oil, and refined petroleum products at all levels of distribution from the producer through the retail level. Provides that the President shall have no authority, under this Act, or under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, to prescribe minimum prices for crude oil (or any classification thereof), residual fuel oil or any refined petroleum product. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of such regulation. States thay any individual director, officer, or agent of a corporation who knowingly and willfully authorizes, orders, or performs any of the acts or practices constituting in whole or in part a violation shall be subject to penalties without regard to any penalties to which that corporation may be subject. Provides that, not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this title, the President shall give appropriate notice and afford interested persons an opportunity to present written and oral data views, and arguments, respecting the appropriateness of, or the continuing need for, the application of any provision of such regulation. Disallows the President to amend such regulation in any manner which exempts crude oil produced in the United States from any provision of such regulation required to be made a part of such regulation. Grants the Congress a right of disapproval of any Presidential amendment of such regulation. Permits the President, by amendment to such regulation, to provide for and implement a procedure pursuant to which the United States may exercise the exclusive right to import and purchase all or any part of the crude oil, residual fuel oil, and refined petroleum products of foreign origin for resale in the United States. Directs the President to submit, within 90 days after enactment, a report which evaluates the feasibility of reducing the price of crude oil, residual fuel oil, or refined petroleum products of foreign origin for resale in the United States by providing incentives for domestic producers who also import such oils or products into the United States, to work for the reduction of the price of such oils or products. Authorizes the President to require adjustments in the operations of refineries, respecting proportions of residual fuel oil or refined petroleum products produced through such operations. Authorizes the President, if he finds an existing or impending regional or national supply shortage of any fuel, by amendment to such regulation, to require adjustments in the amounts of crude oil, residual fuel oil or any refined petroleum product which are held in inventory by persons who are engaged in the business of importing, producing, refining, marketing, or distributing such oils or products. Prohibits any person, during a severe energy supply interruption, from willfully accumulating crude oil, residual fuel oil, or any refined petroleum product in inventories, or otherwise, in amounts which are in excess of such person's reasonable needs. Authorizes the allocation of asphalt. Sets an expiration time for the President's mandatory power to amend regulations pursuant to the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act. Terminates on September 30, 1981, his power to promulgate and amend regulations or to issue any order pursuant to such Act. =Title V: General Provisions= - Empowers the Comptroller General to conduct verification examinations with respect to the books, records, papers, or other documents of: (1) any person who is required to submit energy information to the Federal Energy Administration, the Department of the Interior, or the Federal Power Commission; (2) any person who is engaged in the production, processing, refining, transportation by pipeline, or distribution of energy resources; and (3) any vertically integrated petroleum company with respect to financial information of such company related to energy resource exploration, development, and production and the transportation, refining and marketing of energy resources and energy products. Grants the Comptroller General powers of subpena and onsite inspection to carry out such powers. Requires him to report annually to the Congress on the exercise of such powers. Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to take such steps as may be necessary to assure the development and observance of accounting practices to be followed in the preparation of accounts by persons engaged, in whole or in part, in the production of crude oil or natural gas in the United States. Provides that actions taken in the allocation of petroleum products or electrical energy among classes of users or resulting in restrictions on use of petroleum products and electrical energy shall not be based upon unreasonable classifications of, or unreasonable differentiations between classes of, users. States that each officer or employee of the Federal Energy Administration or of the Department of the Interior who performs any function or duty under this Act; and has any known financial interest in any person engaged in the business of exploring, developing, producing, refining, transporting by pipeline, or distributing (other than at the retail level) coal, natural gas, or petroleum products, or in property from which coal, natural gas, or crude oil is commercially produced shall, beginning on February 1, 1977, annually file with the Administrator or the Secretary of the Interior, as the case may be, a written statement disclosing all such interests held by such officer or employee during the preceding calendar year. Sets forth administrative procedures and judicial review applicable to this Act. Requires any officer or agency authorized to issue rules, regulations, or orders under this Act to provide for the making of such adjustments, consistent with the other purposes of this Act, as may be necessary to prevent special hardship, inequity, or an unfair distribution of burdens and to establish procedures which are available to any person for the purpose of seeking an interpretation, modification, or rescission of, or an exception to or exemption from, such rules, regulations, and orders. Makes it unlawful to violate any provision of titles I or II or this title, or any rule, regulation or order under such titles. Sets forth penalties for such violations. Permits any person suffering legal wrong because of violations of this Act to bring an action in Federal district court for relief. Terminates authority under titles I and II as of June 30, 1985. Directs the President to transmit any energy action to both Houses of Congress on the same day. States that if an energy action is transmitted to the Houses of Congress, such action shall take effect at the end of the first period of 15 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after the date on which such action is transmitted to such Houses, unless between the date of transmittal and the end of such 15-day period, either House passes a resolution stating in substance that such House does not favor such action. Sets forth Congressional procedure for review of such energy actions, as well as for expedited review of such actions."
