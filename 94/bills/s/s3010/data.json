Requires a permit in cases where the agricultural point source is determined by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to be causing a violation of a numerical standard for any pollutant in the receiving waters. Directs the Administrator and the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to develop regulations to define normal and reasonable irrigation practices to govern the issuance of such permits. Authorizes the Administrator to delegate to States or interstate programs the authority to exempt discharges of agricultural pollutants from permit requirements in accordance with conditions prescribed by this Act."
