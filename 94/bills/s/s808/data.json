    "text": "Fuel Stamp Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into agreements with States authorizing them to establish a fuel stamp program under which eligible households (to include individuals over age 60) will be provided with financial assistance (in the form of coupons) in the purchase of fuel for domestic heating and cooking. Authorizes the Secretary to make a determination, on the basis of regional differences in the cost of fuel and the nature of climatic conditions, which States have the greatest need for fuel stamps and to allocate such stamps in accordance with such criteria. Stipulates that the criteria for eligibility under this Act shall, except to the extent otherwise provided by this Act, be the same as those of the Food Stamp Act of 1964, as amended. States that households that meet the requirements of this Act and such criteria in the Food Stamp Act of 1964 will be eligible for assistance under this Act. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
