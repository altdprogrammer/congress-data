    "text": "Federal Taxpayers' Rights Act - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare pamphlets which set forth in nontechnical terms: (1) the rights and obligations of a taxpayer and the Service during an audit; (2) the procedures by which a taxpayer may appeal any adverse decision of the Service (including administrative and judicial appeals); (3) the procedures for prosecuting refund claims and filing of taxpayer complaints; and (4) the procedures which the Service may use in enforcing the internal revenue laws (including assessment, jeopardy assessment, levy and distraint, and enforcement of liens). Establishes within the Internal Revenue Service an office to be known as the Office of Taxpayer Services to be under the supervision and direction of an Assistant Commissioner of Internal Revenue who shall assist taxpayers in obtaining easily understandable tax information and answering questions on tax liability, among other functions. States that, upon application filed by a taxpayer with the Office of Taxpayer Services, in such form, manner, and at such time as the Secretary or his delegate shall by regulations prescribe, the Assistant Commissioner for Taxpayer Services may issue a Taxpayer Assistance Order if, in the determination of the Assistant Commissioner, the taxpayer is suffering from an unusual, unnecessary, or irreparable loss as a result of the manner in which the internal revenue laws are being administered by the Secretary or his delegate. Authorizes the President of the Legal Services Corporation to establish Taxpayer Representation Offices in four cities selected by such President for purposes of providing legal assistance to individuals in connection with: (1) any audit by the Service of any return made by or on behalf of the individual with respect to any tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or (2) an assessment or collection from any such individual of any tax imposed by such chapter. Provides for show cause hearings with respect to jeopardy assessments and termination of taxable years. Increases the monetary value of specified items to be exempt from levy. Provides criminal penalties (a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisonment for up to 2 years or both) for investigations into or surveillance over the beliefs, associations, or activities of any individual or organization which are not directly related to such revenue laws. Provides a civil cause of action for damages or an injunction, or both, for such violations. Prohibits inspection of tax returns pursuant to a criminal investigation unless a search warrant has issued upon probable cause to believe that no alternative source of necessary information is available. Provides rules for civil investigation related to: (1) payment of Social Security and Railroad Retirement taxes; (2) pension administration; (3) census information; (4) enforcement of taxpayers' rights under this Act; (5) inspection by States; (6) inspection by Committees of Congress; and (7) disclosure to persons having substantial interest (agents of partnerships and corporations, and shareholders of corporations). Provides a civil action for damages for unauthorized disclosure of tax information."
