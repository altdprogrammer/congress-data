Permits the killing or capturing of whales by any aboriginal group for subsistence. Directs the Secretary of Commerce: (1) to determine, with the assistance of any other Federal agency, if any enterprise is engaged in such prohibited activities; (2) to publish the name of such enterprise or otherwise inform the enterprise of such a finding; and (3) to hold hearings upon objections to such a finding. Sets forth procedures for the prohibition of fish imports under this Act and the termination of such prohibition. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to take actions necessary to administer such import prohibition. Directs the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce to consider such import prohibitions in the administration of the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 with respect to the allocation to each foreign nation of the total allowable level of foreign fishing subject to exclusive fishery management authority of the United States."
