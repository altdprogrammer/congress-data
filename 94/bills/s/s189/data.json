Sets forth the membership of the Committee. States that it shall be the function of the joint committee: (1) to make a continuing study of the need to reorganize the departments and agencies of the United States engaged in the investigation or surveillance of individuals, (2) to make a continuing study of the intergovermental relationship between the United States and the States insofar as that relationship involves the area of investigation or surveillance of individuals; and (3) to file reports at least annually, and at such other times as the joint committee deems appropriate, with the Senate and the House of Representatives, containing its findings and recommendations with respect to the matters under study by the joint committee. Requires that the joint committee shall, at least annually, receive the testimony under oath, of a representative of every department, agency, instrumentality, or other entity of the Federal Government, which engages in investigations or surveillance of individuals. States that such testimony shall relate to: (1) the full scope and nature of the respective department's agency's instrumentality's, or other entity's investigations or surveillance of individuals; and (2) the criteria, standards, guidelines, or other general basis utilized by each such department, agency, instrumentality, or other entity in determining whether or not investigative or surveillance activities should be initiated, carried out, or maintained. Sets forth the powers of the Committee. Specifies that the provisions of this Act shall not in any way limit or otherwise interfere with the jurisdiction or powers of any committee of the Senate, or the House of Representatives, or of Congress to request or require testimony or the submission of information from any representative of any department, agency, instrumentality, or other entity of the Federal Government."
