Establishes a National Commission on the Olympic Games composed of nine members appointed by the President. Provides that no more than two such members at any one time shall hold or have held membership in the United States Olympic Committee or any national athletic association or federation. Sets forth the duties of the Commission. Requires the Commission to recommend the form of future United States participation in the Olympic movement, if any, with proposals for the legislative action required to carry out such recommendation. Requires a final report of the Commission's findings and recommendations to be submitted to the President and the Congress not later than August 31, 1975. Provides for the compensation of Commission members. Authorizes the appropriation of $750,000 to remain available until expended to carry out the provisions of this Act. Provides that the Commission shall cease to exist 30 days after submission of its final report."
