Authorizes appropriations of $1,500,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1977 through 1981 to carry out the provisions of this Act. Directs that at least three percent of such sums be alloted to the American Territories. Specifies the allocation of the remaining amounts among the States. Sets forth the requirements which a State educational agency must include in its application for funds under this Act. Directs State educational agencies to distribute payments under this Act to local educational agencies. States that whenever the Commissioner, after giving reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to a grant recipient under this Act, finds that the program or activity of which such grant was made no longer complies with the provisions of this Act or that in the operation of such program there has been a failure to comply substantially with any such provision, no further payments may be made until such noncompliance has been, or will promptly be, corrected."
