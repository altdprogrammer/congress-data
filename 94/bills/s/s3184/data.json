    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 94-1285) Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act Amendments - Amends the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act of 1970 to declare it the policy of the United States to approach alcohol abuse and alcoholism from a comprehensive community care standpoint. Authorizes the appropriation of specified amounts in fiscal years 1976 through 1979 for formula grants and for special project grants under such Act. Requires comprehensive State plans to include: (1) an inventory of public and private resources available for the purpose of alcohol abuse and alcoholism treatment, prevention, and rehabilitation; (2) assurance that the State agency will coordinate its planning with local agencies; (3) assurance that State certification, accreditation, or licensure requirements, if any, applicable to alcohol abuse and alcoholism treatment facilities and personnel take into account the special nature of such programs and personnel; (4) assurance that there will be some means of evaluating the effectiveness of treatment or rehabilitation programs funded under such Act; and (5) a requirement that the State agency will review admissions to hospitals and outpatient facilities to assist in determining compliance with such Act. Requires that each State receiving funds under such Act submit a report to the Secretary every third year, assessing progress in implementing its State plan. Expands the purposes for which the Secretary may make grants to public and nonprofit private entities to include alcoholism treatment and prevention services, with emphasis on underserved racial and ethnic minorities, native Americans, youth, female alcoholics, and rural areas. Requires State alcohol abuse programs and the Secretary to give special consideration to alcohol abuse treatment and prevention for women and juveniles, and effectuates such provision with respect to State plan requirements after June 30, 1976. Permits the Secretary to designate National Alcohol Research Centers for the purpose of interdisciplinary research relating to alcoholism and other alcohol problems. Allows annual grants of up to $1,000,000 for any such center, and authorizes appropriations for such purpose through fiscal year 1979. Amends the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974 to require the Secretary to evaluate and make recommendations regarding improved coordinated activities for public education and other alcoholic abuse prevention programs. Entitles alcohol abusers and alcoholics to be treated at outpatient facilities receiving Federal funds for treatment of alcoholism."
