    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendment with amendment) Emergency Medical Services Amendments - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize a second planning grant, or contract to assist an entity in updating its emergency medical services (EMS) plan for the purposes of: (1) expansion and improvement; or (2) improving such services for rural and medically underserved population areas. Requires entities applying for such grants to submit evidence that the executive or legislative governing bodies in their jurisdictions have pledged support of the regional or statewide EMS system. Requires entities receiving such grants to report, at such intervals as the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare shall prescribe, on the results of planning projects funded by such grants. Directs that in awarding grants for research related to the delivery of emergency medical services to rural areas, special emphasis be placed on research which concentrates on the identification and utilization of methods to apply the results of rural-related EMS research. Limits grant or contract support to five years, with the exception of specified planning grants. Requires, to be eligible for grants and contracts, that an EMS system: (1) have the capability to communicate in the language of the predominant population groups with limited English speaking ability in the system's service area; (2) have the capability to communicate with those who have auditory handicaps; (3) make maximum use of communications equipment made available under the Highway Safety Act and the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration; and (4) provide the Secretary with such information as requested in the conduct of periodic, comprehensive, and independent evaluations. Authorizes the appropriation of specified sums for purposes of making EMS grants and contracts in fiscal years 1976 through 1979. Revises the administration of EMS grants and contracts, increasing the role of EMS units in the development of regulations and guidelines. Requires the Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services to disseminate information on Federal programs relating to emergency medical services funding, to recommend uniform standards of quality and health and safety related to emergency medical services, and to take steps to encourage States to reinforce such standards. Makes hospitals and entities meeting specified requirements eligible for EMS training grants. Requires hospital training programs to meet such requirements as may be established by the Secretary. Requires that 30 percent of such grants be used for the training of physicians in emergency medicine. Allows the Secretary to make grants to, and enter into contracts with, public or private nonprofit entities for the conduct of programs to: (1) demonstrate the effectiveness of techniques used in treating burns and rehabilitating burn victims; (2) research treatment and rehabilitation of such individuals; and (3) provide training in such treatment, rehabilitation, and research. Directs the Secretary to conduct studies to identify the categories of patients which should be included in a uniform reporting system used to evaluate the effectiveness of EMS systems and burn injury programs under such Act. Extends the expiration date of the National Commission on Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases to December 31, 1976. Extends the expiration date of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research to December 31, 1977. Amends the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Rehabilitation Act of 1970 to permit the Secretary to review and approve National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism grants in the amounts lower than $250,000."
