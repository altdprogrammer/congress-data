Provides that if the Administrator does not approve the reclamation performed by the permittee he shall notify the permittee within twenty days after the request for release is filed. Provides for judicial review of any decision. Title II: State Regulatory Program - Provides that each State in which surface mining for coal is conducted shall adopt and submit to the Administrator, within 8 months after the promulgation of criteria and guidelines by the Administrator, a program which provides for the regulation of surface mining in such State. States that the Administrator shall approve or disapprove such program within four months. Sets forth criteria that such a program shall include. States that after the effective date of any regulatory program under this title, each State shall transmit to the Administrator a copy of any permit application received by such State and provide notice to the Administrator of all actions related to the consideration of the applications, including all permits proposed to be issued by the State. Provides that no permit shall be issued until the Administrator is satisfied that the conditions to be imposed by the State meet the requirements of this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to require any person owning or operating any surface coal mine to establish and maintain records, install, use, and maintain monitoring equipment and provide such other information as he may reasonable require. Provides that the Administrator or his representative shall have a right of entry to, upon, or through any surface coal mine or any premise in which any records required to be maintained are kept.

Makes provisions for judicial review of actions of the Administrator in approving a State regulatory program under this title. Title III: - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture upon request of States to provide to the States and soil conservation districts technical assistance for developing plans for the reclamation and rehabilitation of land damaged by surface mining.
