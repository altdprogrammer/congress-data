Title II Interstate Railroad System - Requires, within 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, all rail carriers to provide the Secretary of Transportation and the Rail Services Planning Office with copies of the latest edition of all employees' operating timetables; \"slow orders\" currently in effect; all other current restrictions on train operation; and a statement indicating the maximum speeds authorized on each rail line for freight and passenger trains at all times since January 1, 1935, including the dates between which such speeds were authorized. Requires changes in such information to be forwarded to the Secretary and the Office within seven days. Provides that the initial Interstate Railroad System shall consist of all rail lines operated within the United States by domestic railroad companies which as of the date of enactment of this Act are subject to traffic usage of at least 10,000,000 gross ton-miles per year per mile of rail line. Authorizes, and provides procedures for, additions to, and deletions from, such System. Requires the System to promote and enhance the ability of rail carriers to provide modern, efficient, and economical interstate rail freight and passenger service. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of the Army to study the long term capital improvement needs of System rights-of-ways. Authorizes to be appropriated $2,000,000 for such study. Title III: Interstate Railroad Administration - Establishes in the Department of Transportation, the Interstate Railroad Administration. Declares that the function of such Administration shall be to acquire, rehabilitate, maintain, and modernize the rail lines of the System so as to fully develop the potential of modern rail service in meeting the transportation requirements of the Nation. Requires the Administration to make quarterly and annual reports on its activities and finances. Title IV: Acquisition of Rail Lines by Administration and States - Permits any railroad company to convey to the Administration its right, title and interest in all its rail lines included within the System. Directs the Administration to convey rail lines deleted from the System to the State in which such rail line is located. Directs the Administration and the States to assume responsibility for the maintenance and rehabilitation of rail lines so acquired. Establishes within the Treasury a Rail Rehabilitation Trust Fund. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Trust Fund $500,000,000 for each fiscal year through 1981. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to hold the trust fund. Stipulates that amounts in the trust fund shall be available for rehabilitating rail lines in the System in accordance with maintenance standards prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation, and for making grants to the States to rehabilitate State rail lines. Requires rail carriers operating over rail lines of the Administration to pay a specified user charge. Establishes a Rail Maintenance Fund in the Treasury to provide funds for the maintenance of rail lines operated by the administration. Directs that amounts received from the user charge be deposited in the Fund. Title V: Maintenance of and Access to Rail Lines of Railroad Companies - Requires rail lines in the System which are not conveyed to the Administration to be maintained in accordance with specified standards. Prohibits the abandonment of rail lines by railroad carriers without permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission. Title VI: Protection of Employees - Provides that no owner or operator of rail lines shall contract out any project for rehabilitation or maintenance work required by this Act of a value of over $450 per month in labor and materials which is normally performed by employees in any bargaining unit covered by a labor agreement between such owner or operator and any labor organization. Provides for a guarantee of the prevailing wage. Requires that specified protective arrangements be made for railroad employees in any transaction for access to rail lines, transfer of freight traffic, reduction of rail line capacity, or abandonment of rail lines. Title VII: Oversight and Enforcement - Establishes an Advisory Committee to: (1) monitor the activities of the Secretary, Commission, Administration, and States pursuant to this Act; and (2) submit to the Secretary a report evaluating the effectiveness of this Act in achieving its objectives. Makes it unlawful for any State or rail carrier to disobey, disregard, or fail to adhere to the provisions of this Act or standards prescribed under it. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to carry out the provisions of this Act and to perform any other related duties which may be imposed upon him by law. Title VIII: Miscellaneous Provisions - Exempts persons contracting for the joint use of railroad tracks and facilities from all prohibitions of existing law, including the antitrust laws of the United States, insofar as may be necessary to enable them to enter into such contracts and to perform their obligations thereunder."
