    "text": "Includes the condition, in any grant offer for airport development made by the Secretary of Transportation under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, that any sponsor of such airport shall not permit the landing, except for emergency purposes, of any commercial supersonic aircraft which generates a noise level above that level prescribed for new subsonic aircraft. Provides that if any sponsor who has expended funds received from such grant violates such condition then: (1) such sponsor shall immediately repay to the United States all funds received from such grant, and (2) the Secretary shall not make any other grant to such sponsor for airport development at any airport or to any other sponsor for airport development at the airport at which such aircraft landed. Makes it unlawful, except for emergency purposes, for any civil aircraft capable of supersonic speed which generates noise in excess of subsonic noise regulations to land at any place under United States' jurisdiction."
