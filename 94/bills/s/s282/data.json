Directs the Secretary of the Interior to issue to any person a prospecting license. States that no person may conduct mineral prospecting for commercial purposes for any hardrock mineral on Federal lands without such a prospecting license. Penalizes violations of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to issue to any person an exploration lease on Federal lands for hardrock minerals under this Act. Provides that no lease for Federal lands may be issued under this Act unless the lease includes a development plan which has been approved by the Secretary, and the lease provides that failure to comply with such plan will terminate the lease. Prescribes the terms governing such issuance of a hardrock mineral exploration leases, the acreage limitations, and issuance of multiple leases. States that the lessee shall have, under his lease, the right to use, free of charge, so much of the surface of the leased area as may be reasonably required for the actual extraction and removal of the hardrock mineral subject to his lease. Empowers the Secretary to suspend operations or production, or both, under any lease granted under this Act. Provides for termination of a lease for default in payment of rental and prescribes procedures for reinstatement. Authorizes the Secretary: (1) to issue regulations to carry out the provisions and purposes of this Act; and (2) to make such inspections and investigations as he considers necessary or appropriate to develop or enforce Federal regulations, or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Act."
