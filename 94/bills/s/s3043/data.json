    "text": "Law Enforcement Improvement Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to direct the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to provide constructive leadership and direction in the formulation of federally funded State plans for law enforcement. Allows State and local judiciaries to establish their own planning committees to plan the judicial needs of the State, such committee to work closely with the State law enforcement planning agency in developing a judicial plan consistent with the State's overall comprehensive crime reduction plan. Entitles States to Federal grants for law enforcement purposes only if the comprehensive State plans include provisions for improving the availability and quality of justice and developing programs designed to prevent crime against the elderly. Authorizes cities, urban counties, or local government units to submit their own comprehensive crime reduction plans to the State planning agency for approval by such agency. Charges the Administration with the primary responsibility of evaluating the effectiveness of State plans it approves. Directs the Administration to fund State planning agencies for the purpose of funding the State's judicial planning committee if such committee has filed a multiyear comprehensive plan meeting specified requirements. Authorizes additional funds to areas characterized by high crime rates and serious court congestion. Removes the funding priority previously given programs to control riots and other civil disorders and grants priority to programs designed to reduce court backlogs and improve judicial efficiency. Directs the National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice to assist the Administration in its evaluation and assistance functions under this Act. Requires the Administration to establish rules and regulations to assure the proper auditing, monitoring and evaluation of programs funded under such Act. Extends the authorization for carrying out programs under such Act to 1978. Authorizes the Attorney General to establish an Advisory Board to the Administration to review programs for grants under such Act. Specifies subjects to be included in the Administration's annual report to the President and Congress, including its policies and priorities for reducing crime, its evaluation procedures, the number of State plans approved and disapproved, and the number of programs discontinued. Allows the Committees on the Judiciary in both Houses of Congress to conduct public hearings to review and examine the activities of the Administration. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as are necessary, with specified limitations, for fiscal years 1976-1978 to carry out the provisions of such Act."
