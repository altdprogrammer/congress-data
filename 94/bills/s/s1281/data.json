Rept. 94-726) =Title I: Regulation of Interest Rates= - Directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to maintain an interest rate differential of at least one-fourth of 1 percent, and to take no action to eliminate or lessen any such differential, which is in existence on the date of enactment of this Act with respect to any category of accounts between: (1) any bank (other than a savings bank) the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and (2) any mutual savings bank as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the deposits or accounts of which are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation or any savings bank the deposits or accounts of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, except that such financial regulatory agencies may, upon a finding of competitive disadvantage lessen or eliminate the differential for selected geographic areas and by category accounts. Prohibits the reduction of an interest rate differential by any bank whose deposits are Federally insured unless written notice is given by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to the appropriate committees of Congress, which may disapprove the reduction during the 45-day period after which the proposal is submitted to such committees. Directs the Federal agencies regulating banking to study the housing portfolios of State-chartered thrift institutions with special emphasis upon possible disentermediation effects. =Title II: Electronic Fund Transfers= - States the date on which the National Commission on Electronic Fund Transfers is required to submit reports of its finding and recommendations. =Title III: Home Mortgage Disclosure= - Home Mortgage Disclosure Act - States that each depository institution which has a home office or branch office located within a standard metropolitan statistical area, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, shall compile and make available, in accordance with regulations of the Board, to the public for inspection and copying at the home office, and at least one branch office within each standard metropolitan statistical area in which the depository institution has an office the number and total dollar amount of mortgage loans which were (1) originated, or (2) purchased by that institution during each fiscal year beginning with the full fiscal year or that institution which immediately preceded the effective date of this title). Requires that any information compiled according to this Act shall be maintained for five years after the close of the first year during which such information is required. Directs the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to develop methods of insuring compliance by depository institutions. Provides that the authority granted by this title shall expire four years after its effective date. Effectuates this Act 180 days after enactment. Exempts from the provisions of this title any depository institution which has total assets as of its last full fiscal year of $10,000,000 or less."
