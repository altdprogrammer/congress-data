Rept. 94-163) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to undertake, in consultation with other interested Federal, State, local, and private agencies and interests, the development of a comprehensive plan for the lands and waters adjacent or related to the Assateague National Seashore. Requires such plan to set forth the most feasible and prudent methods for providing solid waste disposal, wetlands managements, development of visitor facilities, and other land uses. Provides that no Federal loan, grant, license, or other form of assistance for any project which, in the opinion of the Secretary, would significantly affect the administration, use, and environmental quality of the seashore shall be made, issued or approved by the head of any Federal agency without the concurrence of the Secretary unless such project is consistent with the plan developed pursuant to this section. Deletes existing provisions of Federal law authorizing construction of specified roads related to the Seashore. Increases the land acquisition funds authorization from $21,050,000 to $22,400,000."
