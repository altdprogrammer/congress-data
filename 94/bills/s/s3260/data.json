    "text": "Provides, under the Intercoastal Shipping Act of 1933, that commencing in 1976 a carrier may file a general increase in rates, with a frequency of not more often than once each 12 months, without suspension of that portion of such changed rates bringing about an increase of seven percent or less in its gross annual revenues. Requires the United States Maritime Commission to promulgate numerical guidelines as to common carrier rate of return on rate base and common equity which the Commission deems to be prima facie reasonable, as a means of assisting in insuring that the noncontiguous States, territories and possessions of the United States have efficient ocean transportation to and from the mainland."
