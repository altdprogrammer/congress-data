    "text": "National Energy Conservation Fuel Economy Performance Standards Act - Title I: Statement of Findings and Purpose - States that the goal of this Act is an improvement in fuel economy at the earliest possible date. Title II: Automobile Fuel Efficiency - Sets forth a mandatory fuel economy automobile performance standard. Provides that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall prescribe minimum fuel-economy performance standards for all classes of new passenger motor vehicles for model year 1977 and each year thereafter. Specifies that the fuel-economy standard for model year 1980 shall not be less than 22 miles per gallon and the standard for model year 1985 shall not be less than 24.5 miles per gallon. Requires the Administrator, in formulating standards, to take into account the available technology, the time necessary to develop and apply the requisite technology, and the economic and environmental impact of such standards. Makes it the duty of the Administrator to determine and publish for the benefit of consumers, information with respect to motor vehicle fuel efficiency. Directs each manufacturer to affix and each dealer to maintain, in a prominent place, a sticker indicating the minimum fuel economy as determined by the Administrator. Empowers the Administrator to require any person to file reports, or answers in writing, to questions relating to any function of the Administrator under this title. Requires every manufacturer of passenger motor vehicles to establish records and provide the Administrator with information necessary to enable the Administrator to carry out the duties under this Act. Specifies prohibited conduct by manufacturers and civil penalties for such conduct. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Administrator for carrying out the provisions of this title such sums as necessary, not to exceed $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1976 and not to exceed $2,000,000 annually through fiscal year 1981."
