    "text": "States, under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, that the purpose of this Act is to encourage the improvement of law enforcement agencies of the State and units of local government on a voluntary basis. Establishes in the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration a Commission on the Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies. Authorizes the Commission to (1) establish criteria for the accreditation of law enforcement agencies, (2) establish national and regional accrediting associations, (3) provide for the establishment of accrediting boards by the regional accrediting association, (4) provide for the general policy with respect to accrediting such agencies, (5) make grants, and (6) perform such other functions as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Authorizes the Commission to make grants to any State or unit of general local government if such State or unit of general local government has been accredited. States that no such grant shall exceed 25 percent of the amounts received by such State for operating purposes. Stipulates that it is the intention of Congress that the national and regional accrediting associations and boards shall be totally independent of any officer or agency of the Department of Justice or any other agency of the Federal Government. Authorizes appropriations of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1976 and $1,000,000 for the succeeding fiscal year for purposes of this Act."
