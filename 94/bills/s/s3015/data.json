    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1976-03-25", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #101 (73-3)) Airport and Airway Development Act Amendments - Increases the obligational authority for airport development grants, under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, for the ten-year period ending September 30, 1980, from $2,500,000,000 to $4,695,000,000. Redefines \"airport development,\" under such Act, to include: (1) construction, alteration, repair, or acquisition of airport passenger terminal buildings or of facilities directly related to the movement of passengers and baggage; (2) security equipment; (3) snow removal equipment; (4) noise suppression hardware and barriers (including land); (5) preparation and establishment of an airport master plan or capital improvement program; (6) planning for adequate ground transportation to and from a public airport; and (7) acquisition of land for and the construction of multimodal terminal buildings. Defines, under such Act, \"air carrier airport\", \"capital improvement program\", \"general aviation airport\" (public airports which are not air carrier airports), and \"reliever airport\" (general aviation airports designated by the Secretary of Transportation). Redefines \"terminal area,\" to include vehicles and facilities related directly to movement of passengers and baggage. Directs the Secretary to prepare and publish a revised national airport system plan by January 1, 1978, which shall be designed to improve the orderly development of a public airport system. Designates fiscal years 1971 through 1975 as the period in which the Secretary may make planning grants for airport system planning and master planning. Authorizes appropriations for developing air carrier and reliever airports and airport system planning as follows: $625,000,000 through September 30, 1976; $535,000,000 for fsical year 1977; $570,000,000 for fiscal year 1978; $605,000,000 for fiscal year 1979; and $640,000,000 for fiscal year 1980. Authorizes appropriations for developing general aviation airports as follows: $50,000,000 through September 30, 1976; $45,000,000 for fiscal year 1977; $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1978; $55,000,000 for fiscal year 1979; and $60,000,000 for fiscal year 1980. Authorizes the Secretary to incur obligations to make grants for airport development from such funds. Authorizes the Secretary to incur obligations of $250,000,000 annually through fiscal year 1980 for establishing and improving air navigation facilities. Authorizes the Secretary to incur obligations of $50,000,000 annually through fiscal year 1980 for research, development and demonstration projects, under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. Provides that the balance of moneys, within specified limits, in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund may be appropriated for (1) costs of services provided under international agreements relating to the joint financing of air navigation services which are assessed against the United States Government, and (2) direct costs incurred by the Secretary to flight check and maintain air navigation facilities in a safe and efficient condition. Requires that by October 1 of each fiscal year funds made available for such period for grants under such Act for air carrier and reliever airports shall be apportioned by the Secretary according to a dollar-for-passenger formula to carrier airports. Provides that no carrier airport shall receive less that $150,000 nor more than $10,000,000 in any fiscal year. Requires that by such dates the Secretary shall also apportion funds for general aviation airport development according to a population and land area formula to the States, and in part, according to the Secretary's discretion. Permits up to $10,000,000 per fiscal year, of the funds for air carrier and reliever airports, to be made available for airport system planning. Requires project applications, under such Act, to not propose any airport development which is not included in the current revision of the national airport system plan; and requires that after January 1, 1978, no project applications shall propose any airport development which is inconsistent with such plan. States that the Secretary's approval of a capital improvement program for an air carrier airport shall be considered approval of each project identified in such program plan, subject to a specification by such airport of the source of available funds under such Act, for each project under the program. Requires projects for terminal area development to certify installation of requisite safety and certification equipment. Permits the Secretary to accept conclusory certifications of fulfilled or expected fulfillment by airport sponsors of the requirements of such Act. Allows the Federal share of project costs under such Act to be 90 percent with respect to airports enplaning less than one-quarter of one percent of the total of enplaned passengers each year, and 90 percent for reliever and general aviation airports, and 75 percent for all other airports. Permits such Federal share to be 50 percent of the development costs for construction, repair, or acquisition of public passenger terminal facilities related directly to passenger or baggage movement; and 75 percent of such costs for multimodal passenger terminal facilities; and 75 percent of the costs of an airport system planning project. Requires airport sponsors to consult with air carriers in deciding to undertake development projects, and not to include Federal cost shares in the establishment of user charges. Directs the Secretary to offer terms and conditions in project approvals which provide for obligation of funds over more than one fiscal year for projects extending more than one fiscal year at carrier airports and reliever airports. Permits the Secretary to make grants, from funds for general aviation airport development projects, to States for the management of a demonstration program for administering grants-in-aid for such airports in such State. Sets forth certifications which the chief executive officer of such a State shall make to the Secretary regarding the State's eligibility and interest in such management. Directs the Secretary report by March 31, 1978, on the results of any such demonstration programs, of which there shall be no more than three. Empowers the Secretary to exempt specified Alaskan airports from requirements of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 relating to airport security. Permits the Secretary to compensate air carriers for amounts expended for security-screening facilities and procedures attributable to foreign air transportation. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose through fiscal year 1978. Directs the Secretary to attempt to reduce the capital, operating, maintenance, and administrative costs of the national airport and airway system. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to make it clear that the Federal Aviation Administrator may exempt specified smaller airports from regulations relating to fire and rescue ability. Requires the Secretary to study, and report within one year, on the feasibility of land bank planning and development for future and existing airports; on the establishment of new major public airports; and on the feasibility, practicability, and cost of the soundproofing of schools, hospitals, and public health facilities located near airports. Provides that required inspection and quarantine services at airports of entry shall be performed during regular Sunday and holiday hours without reimbursement from the owners of aircraft operated by the Federal Government. Provides that administrative overhead costs associated with any inspection or quarantine service required to be performed by the United States Government, or any agency thereof, at airports of entry as a result of the operation of aircraft, shall be performed without reimbursement from the owners or operators thereof. Makes it a condition precedent to receipt of funds for airport development projects, under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, that each air carrier, authorized to engage directly in air transportation pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, using such airport shall be subject to nondiscriminatory and substantially comparable rates, fees, rentals and other charges and non-discriminatory and substantially comparable rules, regulations and conditions as are applicable to all such air carriers which make similar use of such airport and which utilize similar facilities, subject to reasonable classifications. Requires that the transportation of persons or property in interstate air transportation between two places within the United States or between a place in the United States and a place outside thereof procured by or under contract with any department or agency of the United States (including the Department of Defense) shall be provided exclusively by air carriers holding certificates under the Federal Aviation Act. Requires the Secretary to take affirmative action to assure that no person shall, on the grounds of race, creed, color, national origin, or sex, be excluded from participating in any activity conducted with funds received from any grant made under this title."
