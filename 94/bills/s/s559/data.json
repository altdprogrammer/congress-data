Directs the Secretary of Labor to formulate, and submit to the Congress, recommendations for appropriate legislative action which would accord to workers in other industries, who by reason of their employment are threatened with pneumoconiosis or similar lung disease, protection (for themselves, their dependents, and survivors) comparable to that accorded to coal and iron miners (and their dependents and survivors) under the Federal Coal Mine Health Safety Act."
