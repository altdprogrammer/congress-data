Directs the Commission to make a comprehensive study and analysis of the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo between the United States and Mexico and determine: (1) what property rights were vested by the treaty in private land holders and their heirs; (2) whether those rights have been properly protected by the United States since 1848; and (3) if the Commission finds that such rights have not been properly protected, the most equitable means of setting claims it deems meritorious. Sets forth the membership and administrative powers of the Commission. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
