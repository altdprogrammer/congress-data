Establishes as an independent agency in the executive branch of the Government a Federal Full Employment Board, to consist of five members appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Authorizes the Board to perform specified functions, including the following: (1) recommend to the President and the Congress by January 20 of each year (beginning January 20, 1976) a program to achieve full employment in each fiscal year and alternative means of attaining that objective; (2) review and make recommendations with respect to monetary, fiscal, income, and other governmental policies in terms of the impact of such policies upon achieving full employment; (3) review and make recommendations with respect to decisions made by public and private employers and establish appropriate procedures for the collection of information, from such employers, necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Sets forth the powers and authority of the Board. Directs the Board to transmit annually to the Congress a report, to be known as the Full Employment Report, setting forth a program to achieve full employment for the following fiscal year, and alternative means of attaining that objective, as required under the provisions of this Act, together with a statement of the Board's activities for the following fiscal year. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 1975, and for each of the two succeeding fiscal years for the activities of the Board."
