    "text": "United States Postal Service Amendments - Redefines the United States Postal Service as an organization within the executive branch of the Government, rather than \"an independent establishment\". Repeals the provisions of Federal law providing for a Board of Governors of the Postal Service. Declares that the head of the Postal Service is the Postmaster General. Provides that he be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Provides for a Deputy Postmaster General and Assistant Postmasters General. Directs that the Postal Rate Commissioners be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Provides that the commissioners may be removed from office by the President for stated reasons. Transfers the powers of the Board of Governors to make changes in postal rates and fees and mail classification matters to the Postal Rate Commission. Stipulates that a temporary rate of postage for a class of mail not be greater than 10 percent of the permanent rate of postage for such class of mail. Stipulates that the Postal Service may borrow money and issue and sell obligations only for capital improvements. Requires that whenever the Postal Service submits any budget program or request to the President, it concurrently transmit a copy of such program or request to the Congress. Prohibits an appropriation for any fiscal year to the Postal Service unless, for such year, an authorization for an appropriation is enacted by Congress."
