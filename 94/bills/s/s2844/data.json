    "text": "Postal Reorganization Act Amendments - Authorizes appropriations for the United States Postal Service for fiscal years 1977-79 in amounts not exceeding ten percent of the total estimated operating expenses of the Postal Service for the fiscal year for which such appropriations are requested. Requires the Postal Service, in requesting appropriations, to present to appropriate congressional committees a comprehensive statement relative to its operations, its estimated revenue requirement, its compliance with policy directives, and other specified matters. Directs the Postal Service to provide door or curbline delivery to all permanent residential addresses during any fiscal year for which the Congress has appropriated all of the funds authorized to be appropriated to the Service. Allows cluster box delivery service in lieu of door or curbline service where the appropriate unit of local government has approved the provision of cluster box service. Requires the President to appoint members of the Postal Rate Commission with the advice and consent of the Senate. Increases to ten months the time limit for recommended decisions by the Commission on requests submitted by the Postal Service for alteration of rates, fees, or mail classifications. Revises criteria regarding maximum temporary rates and fees established by the Postal Service where the Commission exceeds such time limit. Allows temporary changes in rates, fees, and mail classifications to remain in effect up to 150 days after the Commission transmits its recommended decision to the Postal Service. Establishes the Commission on Postal Service. Directs the Commission: (1) to study the public service functions of the Postal Service and recommend to what extent and by what means such functions may be defined and costs thereof reasonably estimated; (2) to identify any difference between the costs that the Postal Service should reasonably expect to incur in providing services in accordance with codified policy directives and the revenues that the Postal Service may reasonably be expected to receive from rates and fees for such services; and (3) to determine the extent to which the public service functions of the Postal Service should be supported by appropriations. Requires all proceedings of the Commission to be open to the chairman of the appropriate congressional committees or their designees and notice of such proceedings to be given to such chairmen or designees. Requires the Commission to transmit to the President and each House of the Congress an interim report and a final report containing a detailed statement of its findings and recommendations, together with any individual views, within two years after the date of the enactment of this Act. Terminates the Commission's existence 60 days after the transmission of its final report. Requires that expenses incurred by the Commission be paid out of the Postal Service Fund."
