Rept. 94-1042) Directs the Court of Claims, upon application by claimants of the Sioux Nation, to review on the merits the Indian Claims Commission's February 15, 1974, determination that the Black Hills were taken by the United States in violation of the fifth amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Waives the defenses of res judicata and collateral estoppel with respect to such claim. Grants the Court of Claims jurisdiction to render judgment for claims the Wichita Indian Tribe of Oklahoma and affiliated groups have against the United States for lands acquired from the tribe without adequate compensation. Waives the defenses of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Authorizes either party to petition the U.S. Supreme Court for certiorari."
