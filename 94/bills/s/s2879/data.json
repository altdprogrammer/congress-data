Disqualifies the individual to whom the estate passes from the tax benefit authorized by this Act if such individual fails to retain the interest passed in the family farm or small business for at least five years after the decedent's death. States that a spouse's services shall be taken into account in determining the consideration furnished to purchase jointly owned property for purposes of the Federal estate tax."
