    "text": "Interns for Political Leadership Act - Authorizes the Commissioner of Education to make grants, under the Higher Education Act of 1965, to institutions of higher education for an internship program for providing students with practical political involvement with elected local, State and Congressional officials. Requires that arrangements for such grants provide for coordination between the on-campus educational programs of the persons selected and their activities as interns, with commensurate academic credit given for their work and achievement as interns. Provides that the students who are to participate in the internship program shall be selected by the institutions of higher education receiving grants. Directs the Commissioner, in order to assist him in the selection of institutions of higher education within a State to receive grants, to appoint a National Advisory Council for Political Leadership Interns. Provides that such Council shall be composed of 12 members appointed from among individuals especially qualified to serve on the Council. Directs the Council to advise the Commissioner with respect to the distribution of grants and with respect to other matters of policy. Limits the Federal share of the cost of student stipends under this Act to 50 percent. Authorizes to be appropriated to carry out this Act $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1976, $1,250,000 for the ensuing three-month transition period, and $5,000,000 in each of the two succeeding fiscal years."
