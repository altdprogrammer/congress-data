    "text": "Occupational Safety and Health Act Amendments - Provides that an employer who is issued a citation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and who believes that he maintains work conditions which would meet specified variance criteria, may apply to the Secretary of Labor for such a variance within a designated time to give notice of intent to contest a citation. Provides that except where the Secretary finds it frivolous and submitted for the purpose of delay, such application shall result in the suspension of all further proceedings with respect to such citation pending final action by the Secretary on such application. States that if a variance is granted, the Secretary shall enter an order vacating such citation. Directs the Secretary to provide for visits to the workplaces of employers having 100 or fewer employees for the purpose of affording consultation and advice to such employers. Provides that such visits: (1) may be conducted only upon a valid request by an employer and (2) shall be limited to the matters specified in the request. Provides that where, after evaluating a request by an employer, the Secretary determines that an alternative means of affording consultation and advice is more appropriate and equally effective, he may provide for such alternative means rather than onsite consultation. Directs the Secretary to make recommendations regarding the elimination of any hazards disclosed within the scope of the onsite consultation. Provides that no visit authorized by this Act shall be regarded as an inspection or investigation and no notices or citations shall be issued nor shall any civil penalties be proposed by the Secretary upon such visit, except that nothing in this Act shall affect in any manner any provision of this Act the purpose of which is to eliminate imminent dangers."
