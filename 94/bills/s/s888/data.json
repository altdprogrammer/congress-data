    "text": "Allows the President, under the Trade Act of 1974, to withhold preferential tariff treatment from nations determined to be beneficiary developing nations only if such nations actively participate in embargos or other similar activities (rather than mere membership in OPEC or similar organizations) which result in the withholding of essential commodities from trade or in disruptively high prices. Authorizes the President to extend preferences notwithstanding the country's participation in such activities if he determines such preference to be in the national interest. Requires the President to justify such determination to the Congress."
