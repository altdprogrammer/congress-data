    "text": "Benefit Program Coordination Act - Declares the finding of Congress that a number of financial benefit programs for individuals or families have been developed without sufficient coordination and that some individuals are recipients under more than one program which has resulted in effects inconsistent with the intent of such programs. Declares the purpose of this Act is to provide improved legislative procedure and technological assistance to consider the effects on recipients of existing financial benefit programs of proposed legislation designed to change or establish a financial benefit program. Requires that effective the first day of the Ninety-fifth Congress, whenever a congressional committee reports legislation establishing or changing a financial benefit program (including a change in the Federal income tax laws which is expected to have a significant impact on such a program) such report must contain a statement describing any expected significant impact on any such program. States that if such committee determines that the inclusion of such information is not practicable it need not include it. Requires the Congressional Budget Office to designate a unit within such Office to assist the committees in carrying out the provisions of this Act. Requires the President to designate a Federal agency to monitor the interactions among financial benefit programs. Requires the President to report annually to Congress on the developments in coordination of such programs and the impact which legislation changing or establishing a financial benefit program enacted during the preceding three years had on other such programs."
