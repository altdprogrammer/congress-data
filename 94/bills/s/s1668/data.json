Excludes nonfood commodities from shipment under such Act. Directs the President to take reasonable precautions to safeguard usual marketings of countries receiving assistance under such Act. Repeals the prohibition in such Act against aid to countries that trade with North Vietnam or Cuba. Removes the restriction in such Act on sales to the United Arab Republic. States that no agricultural commodities may be made available to any foreign country under such Act which is not, at the time, a country designated by the United Nations as \"most seriously affected\" by economic crisis unless, at the time such commodities are made available, food needs of all countries designated as \"most seriously affected\" have been adequately met."
