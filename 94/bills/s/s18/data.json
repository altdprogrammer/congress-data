Provides that honeybees and honeybee semen imported under this Act shall be imported under rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Treasury. States that with the exception of such imports, all honeybees and honeybee semen offered for import or intercepted entering the United States shall be destroyed or immediately exported. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, either independently or in cooperation with States or political subdivisions thereof, farmers' associations, and similar organizations and individuals, to carry out operations or measures in the United States to eradicate, suppress, control, and to prevent or retard the spread of undesirable species and subspecies of honeybees. Authorizes the Secretary to cooperate with the Governments of Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rico, Panama, and Colombia, or the local authorities thereof, in carrying out necessary research, surveys, and control operations in those countries in connection with the eradication, suppression, control, and prevention or retardation of the spread of undesirable species and subspecies of honeybees."
