Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to pay 37 1/2 percent of such funds to the State within which leased lands or deposits are located (except Alaska), such funds to be used for the construction and maintenance of public roads or for the support of public schools or other public educational institutions. Directs the Secretary to pay 40 percent of such funds into the reclamation fund created by the Reclamation Act. Requires that money accrued to the United States under such Acts from lands within the naval petroleum reserves be deposited in the Naval Petroleum Reserve Special Account. Permits revenues returned to Utah and Colorado from the prototype oil shale tracts C-A, C-B, V-A, and V-B to be used for general public purposes."
