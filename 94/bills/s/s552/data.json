Establishes in the Executive Office of the President a Council on Mineral Resources. Sets forth the duties and functions of the Council, including: (1) to develop and recommend to the President national policies to foster and promote the improvement of domestic mining, minerals, and metal and mineral reclamation industries goals of the Nation; (2) to conduct investigations, studies, surveys, research, and analyses relating to domestic mining and mineral resources; and (3) to document and define changes or trends on the state of domestic mining, minerals, and metal and mineral reclamation and to interpret the underlying causes.
