Provides that no payments shall be made pursuant to this Act for services, equipment, facilities ordered, purchased, leased, or otherwise procured by persons other than officers or employees of the Federal Government duly authorized by the Director of the United States Secret Service to make such procurements. States that public funds not specifically appropriated to the United States Secret Service for carrying out the provisions of this Act shall not be used for the purpose of securing any nongovernmentally owned property owned, leased, occupied, or otherwise utilized by persons entitled to protection under Federal law.
