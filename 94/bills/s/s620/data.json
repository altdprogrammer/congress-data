    "text": "Standby Energy Authorities Act - States that the purposes of this Act are to grant specific standby authority to impose end-use rationing and to reduce demand by regulating public and private energy consumption, and to authorize other specific temporary emergency actions to assure that the essential energy needs of the United States will be met in a manner which, to the fullest extent practicable: (1) is consistent with existing national commitments to protect and improve the environment; and (2) minimizes any adverse impact on employment. Allows the President to require by regulation, rule, or order, as a condition to any person engaging in commerce, and in the business of importing, producing, refining, marketing, or distributing petroleum, that such person maintain inventories of petroleum in excess of his normal business or operating requirements. Empowers the President to order the use, sale, disposal, and allocation of all or any part of inventories held pursuant to this Act in order to alleviate domestic shortages, and for other purposes consistent with this Act. Authorizes the President to require measures to supplement domestic energy supplies, including: (1) production of specified designated existing domestic oil and gas at maximum practicable rates of production necessary to meet the objectives of this title; and (2) the utilization of production on any oil and gas producing properties on Federal lands. Gives the President the authority to provide for the allocation of petroleum for such purposes and to control the prices of petroleum allocated and to ration among classes of end-users of such product. States that the President shall provide for the making of such adjustments pursuant to the authority of this Act as are practicable to prevent special hardship, inequity, or unfair distribution of burdens. Allows the President to promulgate by regulation one or more energy conservation plans which shall be designed to result in a reduction of energy consumption. Provides that the President shall transmit any energy conservation plan to each House of Congress on the date on which it is promulgated. States that actions taken under authority of this Act shall not be arbitrary or capricious. Authorizes the President to encourage, support, and promote the planning and conduct of appropriate joint projects and cooperative programs in the United States and in foreign countries. Authorizes the President to restrict the export of coal, natural gas, petroleum products, and petrochemical feedstocks subject to the Export Administration Act. Makes it unlawful for any person to violate any provisions of this Act or to violate any rule, regulation, or order issued pursuant to any provision and makes such violator subject to a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each violation. States that whoever willfully violates any provision of this Act or rules issued pursuant thereto shall be fined not more than $10,000 for each violation. Makes it unlawful for any person to offer for sale or distribute in commerce any product or commodity in violation of an applicable order or regulation issued pursuant to this Act. States that any person who knowingly and willfully violates this Act after having been subjected to a civil penalty for a prior violation of the same provision shall be fined not more than $50,000 or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both. Authorizes the President to provide financial assistance in accordance with this title for the purpose of assisting eligible State or local energy conservation programs. Sets forth criteria for determining the amounts of financial assistance to be provided to each State. Provides that the authority under this title to prescribe any rule, regulation, or order shall expire at midnight June 30, 1985, but such expiration shall not affect any action or pending civil or criminal proceedings not finally determined on such date, nor any action or proceeding based upon any act committed prior to such time. Authorizes to be appropriated such funds as are necessary for the implementation of the provisions of this Act."
