Requires the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with interested Federal agencies and other public and private organizations and with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior, to establish national objectives for aquaculture development. Requires the Secretary to act as the interagency coordinator for all Federal programs and activities in aquaculture. Sets forth activities regarding aquaculture development which the Secretary may, as he deems appropriate, carry out pursuant to this Act, including: (1) construction, operation, and maintenance of hatcheries or similar facilities and undertaking of natural habitat improvement activities; (2) assistance to public and private organizations and individuals interested or engaged in aquaculture through advisory and other services; (3) consultation and cooperation with Federal, State, and local governments, regional commissions, institutions of higher learning, private industry; and (4) performance of basic and applied research to establish a sound information base for the development of aquaculture. Provides that the Secretary, in consultation with affected States, shall locate, construct, operate, and maintain such pilot aquaculture facilities as he deems appropriate in order to develop aquaculture technology relative to particular species of fish and shellfish. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out such functions and duties authorized by this Act as he deems appropriate through grants to or contracts with the States, regional commissions, local governments, institutions of higher learning, private industry, and other public and private organizations. Authorizes an appropriation for each fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 1976, equal to 30 percent of the gross receipts from duties collected under the customs laws on fishery products during the period January 1 to December 31, both inclusive, preceding the beginning of each such fiscal year.
