    "text": "Adds to the Occupational Safety and Health Act specific provisions for the administration of that Act with respect to small businesses. Directs the Secretary of Labor, in applying to small businesses the safety and health standards established pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act, to consider: (1) the differences between large and small businesses; (2) the applicability of each standard on an industry-by- industry basis; and (3) when feasible, exceptions for small business concerns. Requires the Secretary to provide or establish for small businesses: (1) a detailed description of action or equipment necessary to effect compliance with standards; and (2) simplified requirements designed to eliminate unnecessary and duplicative record keeping and reporting. Exempts small businesses from compliance with standards until determination is made that applicable small business concerns are able to comply, and that compliance will improve the occupational safety and health of the employees. Provides for the non-punitive on-site inspection of small businesses upon request. Directs the Secretary to assure that small business firms are not injured economically to the detriment of competition by the operation of this Act."
