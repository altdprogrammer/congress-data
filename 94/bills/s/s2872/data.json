    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 12169 passed in lieu) =Title I: Federal Energy Administration Extension= - Federal Energy Administration Extension Act - Requires the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration (FEA), in order to foster the construction of new refineries by small and independent refiners to promulgate eligibility criteria for entitlements in such amounts whereby such refinery constructors shall be assured not less than the industry-wide average net profit on the sale of processed oil. Amends the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 to provide a five-day period during which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may comment on rules, regulations, and policies of the Federal Energy Administration (FEA) which affect the quality of the environment. Requires that FEA make public within 90 days guidelines which it applies to serious hardship and inequity cases, under the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974. Prohibits retroactive application of FEA rules and interpretations to the operations of persons engaged solely in petroleum marketing, to independent and small refiners, or to independent producers. Authorizes the FEA to obtain information from United States firms with foreign affiliates or foreign firms with respect to supply and consumption activities of those firms in the United States. Sets forth penalties and equitable remedies for violations relating to such information-gathering authority. Requires the Administrator, in collecting information, to take into account the size of the business, so as to avoid overly burdensome reporting requirements on small business marketers and distributors of petroleum products. Provides for the disposition of the FEA's functions and authorities if such Act terminates, as follows: those originally transferred to the FEA shall revert to the agency from which they were transferred; and those created by such Act shall be transferred according to specific functions to specified agencies.

Extends such Council through September 30, 1977. Requires the Administrator to conduct an annual, comprehensive, interdisciplinary study of the energy needs of the United States and the methods by which those needs can be met. Requires the FEA to analyze the degree to which an energy tax, including a (BTU) British Termal Unit tax, might contribute to an acceptable level of energy imports by 1985. Provides that any allocation regulation relating to crude oil prices, to crude oil ceiling prices, or to the weighted average first sale price for crude oil, under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, shall not apply to the first sale of stripper well crude oil produced and sold in the United States, or to the first sale of crude oil produced and sold from a property in the United States which production results from an enhanced recovery operation and which volume of production is in excess of the volume of production which would have been produced from the property in the absence of the enhanced recovery operation. Places in the Department of Commerce the functions of the FEA and the Department with respect to the energy efficiency standards and labeling of consumer appliances. =Title II: Electric Utility Reform Act= - Directs the Administrator of the FEA to prepare voluntary guidelines establishing the parameters within which utility regulatory commissions should approve electric utility rates in order to encourage electric utility companies to utilize innovative electric utility rate structures, which are cost-based, energy conserving, equitable in operation and effect, and which provide incentive for maximum use of existing electrical generating facilities. Authorizes the Administrator to assist State utility regulatory commissions to develop such rate structures, and to intervene in administrative or court proceedings from the purpose of developing such rate structures. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to States to establish and operate offices to assist consumers in their presentations before utility regulatory commissions.

Directs the Office to review the energy information gathering activities of Federal agencies with a view toward avoiding duplication of effort and minimizing the compliance burden on business enterprises and other persons. Requires specified reports from the Office to the Congress and the public. Directs the Office to require each major energy-producing company to file with the Office a financial report at least annually. =Title IV: Energy Conservation Standards for New Buildings= - Building Energy Conservation Standards Act - Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to publish, within three years of enactment of this title, proposed performance energy conservation standards for new commercial and residential buildings. Requires such standards to be effective within 18 months after such publication. Prohibits approval by any Federal officer of assistance for construction of any building in any State or areas which do not have similar standards to such Federal standards in effect. Directs Federal entities responsible for regulation or insuring of banks and savings and loan institutions to adopt regulations prohibiting such institutions from making or purchasing construction loans, unless such buildings are to be located in areas where Federal assistance is permitted under this title. Requires the head of each Federal agency responsible for construction of Federal buildings to adopt necessary procedures to assure that such construction meets applicable energy conservation standards under this title. Authorizes grants to States to assist them in developing standards or State certification procedures to carry out the provisions of this title. =Title V: Energy Conservation Assistance for Existing Buildings= - Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act - Authorizes the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration to provide financial assistance to States and to transfer to other Federal departments or agencies funds for use to serve Native Americans to assist in carrying out projects to improve insulation and energy conservation in dwellings in which heads of households are low-income persons, particularly where elderly and handicapped low-income persons reside. Directs the Administrator to publish regulations designed to carry out this title, which: (1) set forth standards for insulation materials and energy conservation techniques; and (2) insure that the benefits of insulation assistance will accrue, in case of leased dwellings, primarily to low-income tenants. Permits designated Federal agencies to implement the assistance provided under this title in States which do not apply to so implement. Authorizes such assistance to States, upon annual application, which designate a State agency having special qualifications with respect to the problems of low-income persons. Makes such agencies solely responsible for administration and allocation of financial assistance under this title. Requires applications for assistance to specify the location and scope of projects to be funded, including the number of low-income persons to be assisted, the type of insulation work to be done, and policies to assure that such funds will not supplant State or local funds. Requires that not less than 50 percent of assistance under this title be allocated to community action agencies carrying out programs under title II (Urban and Rural Community Action Programs) of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, or other appropriate qualified public or nonprofit entities in the State. Sets forth monitoring and record-keeping requirements relative to extension of assistance under this title.
