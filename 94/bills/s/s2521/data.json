    "text": "Revises the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act by authorizing the Farmers Home Administration to make or insure loans to applicants who meet the current loan criteria for up to 25 percent or $50,000, whichever is less of the value of the farm. Replaces the current five percent interest rate with an interest rate determined by the cost of money to the Treasury. Increases the maximum loan per borrower from $50,000 to $100,000. Exempts the real estate, operating, and business loans that are guaranteed by the Government but funded by private lenders from inclusion in the Federal budget."
