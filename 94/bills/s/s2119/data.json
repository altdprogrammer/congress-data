States that a license granted for the operation of any class of station shall be for not more than five years. Permits such licenses to be renewed if the Commission finds that the public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served thereby. States that in making such a determination, the Commission shall consider whether the licensee followed applicable procedures for the ascertainment of the problems, needs, and interests of the residents of its service area for purposes of its broadcast operations. Authorizes the Commission to prescribe the period or periods for which licenses should be granted and renewed for particular classes of stations. States that appeals from any order or decision of the Commission should be brought in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in which such broadcast facility is located. Directs the Commission to review its rules and regulations to determine which ones no longer serve the public interest. Requires the Commission to report to specified committees of the Congress and to include any recommendations for legislation resulting from its review."
