    "text": "National Oil Pollution Liability and Compensation Act - Declares that the purposes of this Act are to enact a comprehensive national law governing oil pollution liability and compensation and to establish a strict liability standard for cleanup costs and damages resulting from the discharge of oil. Provides that the owner and operator of a vessel, an onshore or offshore facility, and the licensee of a deepwater port shall be liable for cleanup costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil into the marine environment. Places specified monetary limitations on the amount of such liability. Provides that no such liability shall be imposed if the owner, operator, or licensee involved establishes that such discharge was caused solely: (1) by an act of war, or as a proximate result of negligence on the part of the Federal Government in failing to maintain adequate aids to navigation; or (2) by the negligence of the party damaged. Provides that any agreement, the effect of which is to hold harmless any person or any Federal, State, or local government from liability for the discharge of oil, even if agreed to by a government entity, is contrary to public policy, void, and of no effect. Establishes within the Department of Transportation a National Oil Pollution Liability and Compensation Administration, and within the Administration, a National Oil Pollution Compensation Fund. Provides that moneys in the Fund shall be disbursed to cover oil discharge cleanup costs not otherwise compensated. Declares that the Fund shall be provisioned through the levy and collection by the Administration of a 5-cent-per-barrel fee imposed on the owner of oil: (1) when the oil is loaded on or off a vessel at an onshore or offshore facility; (2) when the oil is transferred from a well to a pipeline or a vessel; or (3) when the oil is loaded on or off a vessel at a deepwater port. Authorizes specified appropriations for the administration of this Act for fiscal years 1976 through 1978."
