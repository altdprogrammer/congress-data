Rept. 94-1744) Agricultural Resources Conservation Act - Declares it to be the policy of the United States that the conduct of land, water, and related resources conservation programs administered by the Secretary of Agriculture be responsive to the long-term needs of the Nation. Declares it to be the policy of the United States to utilize as fully as possible to achieve the purposes of this Act the arrangements under which the Federal Government cooperates with State soil and water conservation agencies and other appropriate State natural resource agencies. Provides for an appraisal of quality and quantity of the land and water resources of the Nation. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to formulate resource appraisal reports by December 31, 1978, and by December 31, 1980. Directs the development, through the Soil Conservation Service, of a National Land and Water Conservation Program for furthering land and water conservation on private and non-Federal lands. Stipulates that the program shall set forth the direction of future soil and water conservation efforts based on the current resource appraisal as formulated under the provisions of this Act. Requires a report on such appraisal and Program to be transmitted to the Congress on the first day Congress convenes in 1979 and in 1981, together with a detailed statement of policy intended to be used in framing budget requests for Soil Conservation Service activities. Permits Congress a right of disapproval of such appraisal, program, or policy statement. Provides that commencing with the budget for fiscal year 1979, requests presented by the President to the Congress governing Soil Conservation Service activities shall express in qualitative and quantitative terms the extent to which the programs and policies projected under the budget meet the policies approved by Congress in accordance with this Act. Requires the Secretary, during preparation of the fiscal year 1979 budget and annually thereafter, to prepare a report which evaluates the Program's effectiveness in attaining the purposes of this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of such funds as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Makes these provisions effective on October 1, 1977, and terminates such provisions on December 31, 1981."
