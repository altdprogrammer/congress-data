    "text": "Reading Improvement Program Amendments - Authorizes the Commissioner of Education to enter into national contracts with public agencies and private nonprofit organizations which have as their primary purposes motivating children to learn to read, to support and promote the establishment of reading motivational programs which include the distribution of inexpensive books to students. Authorizes the Commissioner to pay the Federal share of the cost of such programs. Sets forth conditions and standards to be met in each such national contract under this Act. Stipulates that the Commissioner shall make no payment of the Federal share of the cost of acquiring and distributing books pursuant to a contract unless he determines that the national contractor or the subcontractor, as the case may be, has made arrangements with book publishers or distributors to obtain books at discounts at least as favorable as discounts that are customarily given by such publisher or distributor for book purchases made under similar circumstances in the absence of Federal assistance. Defines terms used in this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of specified sums through September 30, 1978, to carry out this Act."
