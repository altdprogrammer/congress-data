Rept. 94-689) Veterans' Insurance Amendments Act - Entitles a person insured under Servicemen's Group Life Insurance (SGLI), who is eligible for automatic conversion of SGLI to Veterans' Group Life Insurance (VGLI), and who elects not to be insured under VGLI, to convert, effective the day after the insured's SGLI insurance coverage ceases, the SGLI policy to an individual policy of life insurance. Provides that veterans converting VGLI policies to individual policies may purchase an individual term policy. Extends, by one year from the effective date of this Act, the period during which veterans extended retroactive eligibility for VGLI may apply for VGLI policies. Makes technical amendments to chapter 19, (Insurance) of title 38, Veterans' Benefits, of the United States Code. Removes gender references in such chapter."
