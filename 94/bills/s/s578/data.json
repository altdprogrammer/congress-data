    "text": "Energy Transportation Security Act - Provides, under the Merchant Marine Act, that the Secretary of Commerce shall take such action as is necessary to assure that at least 20 percent of the gross tonnage of oil transported on ocean vessels for import into the United States shall be transported on privately owned U.S.-flag commercial vessels. Provides that the quantity to be transported on such U. S. vessels shall be not less than 25 percent of gross tonnage after June 30, 1976, and not less than 30 percent after June 30, 1978. Allows the Secretary of Commerce to, by rule, establish a system of reasonable classification of persons and imports subject to the provisions of this Act. Permits a person to challenge such classification. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Congress and the President on the implementation of the provisions of this Act. States that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to any refiner whose total refinery capacity does not exceed 30,000 barrels per day. Declares that license fees payable pursuant to Presidential proclamation for imports of crude oil imported into the United States shall be reduced by 15 cents per barrel for a period of five years from the date of enactment of this Act if the Secretary of the Treasury determines: (1) such crude oil is transported by privately owned U.S.-flag commercial vessels; and (2) the amount resulting from the nonpayment of such license fees is passed on to the ultimate consumers of such crude oil in whatever form it is when utlimately consumed."
