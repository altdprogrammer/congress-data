    "text": "Comprehensive Oil Pollution Liability and Compensation Act - Title I: Domestic Oil Pollution Liability, Compensation and Fund - Establishes a fund of $200,000,000 in the Tresury to carry out the purposes of this title. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to collect a fee from owners of oil refineries and from owners of export-import terminals to maintain the fund at that level. Permits recovery of damages from the fund for loss or injuries due to oil contamination. Imposes strict liability on the owner and operator of a ship or oil facility for all damages due to discharged oil. States that no liability shall be imposed where the discharge was caused solely by: (1) an act of war; (2) an act of God; or (3) a combination thereof. Establishes limits on such liability. Requires vessels or ships over three hundred gross tons to file evidence of financial responsibility to the extent of the limit of liability. Sets forth penalties for violations of the provisions of this title. Authorizes appropriations of sums necessary to carry out the purpose of this title. Title II: International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage - Stipulates that ship owners shall be liable for pollution damage caused by oil discharges. Limits such liability to an aggregate amount equal to the dollar equivalent of 2000 francs for each ton of the ship's tonnage. Requires the owner to guranatee his limited liability by establishing a fund or equivalent guarantee. Provides for the issuance of certificates to attest that insurance or an equivalent guarantee has been obtained. Title III: International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage - Establishes an international fund for compensation for oil pollution damage. Sets forth provisions governing contributions to the fund. States that any person suffering pollution damage arising out of an incident occurring more than one hundred and twenty days after the entry into force of the convention shall be entitled to compensation from the fund if that person has been unable to obtain full and adequate compensation for the damage under the terms of this Act. Stipulates that the fund shall incur no obligation for pollution damage resulting from an act of war or if the claimant cannot prove that the damage resulted from an incident involving one or more ships. Limits the aggregate amount of liability for any one incident to the dollar equivalent of 450,000,000 francs. Title IV: Apportionment of Claims and Subrogation; Exclusive Remedy; Effective Date; Conforming Amendments - Sets forth provisions governing the apportionment of claims which exceed the liability limit imposed by this Act. Provides that no action for compensation for oil pollution damage may be maintained unless it is in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Makes technical and conforming amendments."
