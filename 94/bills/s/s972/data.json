Prescribes additional requirements that the student be full-time and maintain good standing. Authorizes the Commissioner to enter into agreements with eligible institutions in which any student receiving a scholarship award under this Act has enrolled or is accepted for enrollment. Specifies the content of such agreements. Authorizes to be appropriated $1,750,000 for fiscal year 1977 and $3,500,000 for fiscal years 1978-1982 to carry out this Act.
