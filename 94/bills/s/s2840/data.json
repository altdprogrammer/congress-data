    "text": "National Food Stamp Reform Act - Deletes, under the Food Stamp Act, the prohibition against students receiving food stamps and makes them eligible under specified circumstances. Lowers the work registration age limit from 65 to 60. Revises the provisions related to employer housing, standard deductions, and Government vendor payments. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to formulate and administer the food stamp program so that eligible households are furnished with a coupon allotment sufficient to provide them with a nutritionally adequate diet, with the amount of such allotments adjusted semi-annually to reflect changes in the price of food. Provides that, where the Secretary determines that there has been gross negligence or fraud on the part of the State agency in the certification of applicant households, the State shall, upon request of the Secretary, deposit into a separate account of the Federal Treasury a sum equal to the face value of any coupon issued as a result of negligence or fraud, such funds to be available without fiscal year limitation for the redemption of coupons. Directs the Secretary to institute procedures whereby Federal, State, and local officials meet monthly to reconcile all records related to the disbursement of food stamp coupons. Requires the Secretary and State agencies to carry out an effective program of nutrition education and directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress on progress in this area. Makes provision for retroactive benefits where food coupons are wrongfully denied and for bilingual assistance in areas where there are numerous potentially eligible, non-English speaking persons. Requires the issuance of food stamps at all Postal Service facilities where postage stamps are sold. Expands program notification requirements and opportunities to use food stamps for \"meals on wheals\" where members of eligible households are elderly or disabled. Grants the Secretary authority to carry out experimental projects designed to increase the program's efficiency. States that the amount of assets households may own and still be eligible for the program shall be adjusted annually to reflect cost changes in the Consumer Price Index. Provides for prompt certification of eligible applicant households."
