    "text": "Mental Health Act - Provides that every individual who is a resident of the United States, or who is a nonresident citizen of the United States, shall be eligible to receive the benefits provided by this Act. Lists the mental health services covered by this Act and provides that benefits under this Act shall consist of entitlement to have payment made on his behalf, without limit as to duration except as otherwise specifically indicated. States that the recipient of half-way house care shall contribute 100 percent of cost, not to exceed 25 percent of his income, for such care. Sets forth qualifications for a psychiatric hospital for participation in the program under this Act, including that it provide active diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services with respect to mental illness, and that it be accredited by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to periodically determine the amount which should be paid under this Act to each provider of care and services with respect to the care and services furnished by it. Provides that no payments may be made under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, under any State plan approved under title XIX (Medicaid) of such Act, or under any other Federal law or program, with respect to any care or services for which payment is made under this Act. Provides that the program under this Act shall be administered by the Secretary with the advice and assistance of a Committee on Mental Health which shall be appointed by the Secretary. Provides that the Committee shall be specifically responsible under the direction of the Secretary for the approval of all providers of care and services for participation in the program under this Act and for the establishment of the guidelines and qualifications to be applied to any of such providers not affiliated with any specific psychiatric hospital. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act, including any sums necessary to establish and maintain a reasonable reserve for the payment of benefits under this Act. Directs the Secretary to conduct a full and complete study of the costs of providing mental health insurance under various conditions and with varying specifications, in order to determine the feasibility of establishing a national program providing such insurance, or expanding the program under this Act. Requires the Secretary to submit to the President and the Congress a report on the results of such study together with his recommendations. Provides that the Secretary shall submit annually to the President and to the Congress a full report on the program under this Act, including his recommendations for any improvements or modifications therein."
