    "text": "Conversion of Abandoned Railroad Rights-of-Way Act - Declares the purpose of this Act is to modify the Interstate Commerce Act to direct the Secretary of Transportation to establish a program for development of railroad rights-of-way for use of transportation by bicycle. Directs the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with Federal, State and local authorities, to identify those railroad rights- of-way, on which rail service has been permanently terminated, is scheduled for termination, or is likely of termination and which are potentially suitable for public recreational use. Describes recreational use to include: (1) inclusion in the National Trails System; (2) utilization by a State, regional, or local entity for use as a State administered bikeway, walkway, or similar facility. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical and financial assistance for the conversion of such railroad rights-of-ways to such recreational uses. Authorizes $25,000,000 to be appropriated for fiscal year 1976 and the next two fiscal years to carry out the provisions of this Act."
