Authorizes the Secretary to promulgate bookkeeping regulations and to conduct investigations to enforce this Act. Authorizes a civil penalty of not more than $100,000 for failure to file a required report, failure to maintain records, negligent omission of required information from such a report, or for negligent statement of false information in such a report. Permits the Attorney General to bring an action in a district court of the United States to enjoin such act or practice. Imposes a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, except that a legal entity shall be fined not more than $100,000, for failure to file under this Act.
