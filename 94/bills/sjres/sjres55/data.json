    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Provides that, on or before the fifteenth day after the beginning of each regular session of the Congress, the President shall transmit to the Congress a budget which shall set forth separately: (1) his estimate of the receipts of the Government, other than trust funds, during the ensuing fiscal year under the laws then existing; (2) his recommendations with respect to outlays to be made from funds other than trust funds during such ensuing fiscal year; and (3) if such recommendations exceed such estimate, a surtax rate which the President determines to be necessary to be applied with respect to the income tax of taxpayers to those portions of taxable years of the taxpayers occurring during such fiscal year, so that such receipts will equal such outlays. Directs the Speaker of the House of Representatives during the first quarter of each fiscal year, and during the third quarter of each fiscal year to: (1) estimate the receipts of the Government, other than trust funds, during such fiscal year; (2) estimate outlays to be made from funds other than trust funds during such fiscal year; and (3) (A) if such estimate of outlays exceeds such estimate of receipts, determine a surtax rate which the Speaker considers necessary to be applied, with respect to the income tax of taxpayers, to those portions of taxable years of taxpayers remaining in such fiscal year, so that such receipts will equal such outlays; or (B) if such estimate of outlays equals such estimate of receipts, determine that no surtax rate is necessary to be applied. Directs the President during the last month of each fiscal year to review whether the receipts of the Government, other than trust funds, for such year will be less than the outlays other than trust funds for that fiscal year. Provides that if he finds that such receipts are going to be less than such outlays, he shall determine a surtax rate which he consideres necessary to be applied with respect to the income tax of taxpayers, so that taxes received by the Government from such surtax, when added to other receipts of the Government, will equal such outlays. Authorizes the suspension of the provisions of this Article in the case of a grave national emergency declared by Congress (including a state of war formally declared by Congress) by a concurrent resolution agreed to by a rollcall vote of three-fourths of all the Members of each House of Congress, with each such resolution providing the period of time (not exceeding one year) during which those provisions are to be suspended."
