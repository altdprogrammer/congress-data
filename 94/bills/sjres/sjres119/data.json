Provides that the members be appointed by the President from representatives of concerned parents and from the field of education and law. Directs the Commission to make an investigation with respect to school busing compelled by order of the court or by a plan approved by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Requires the Commission to submit a final report to the President and Congress not later than March 1, 1976. Calls upon the Commission to consider the feasibility of a constitutional amendment to prohibit compulsory school busing, a modification of court orders and plans formulated by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and alternatives to achieving quality education. Authorizes the Commission to hold hearings and issue subpenas as necessary to carry out this resolution. Provides for the appointment of and compensation for the members and their staff. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums, but not to exceed $1,000,000, as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this joint resolution."
