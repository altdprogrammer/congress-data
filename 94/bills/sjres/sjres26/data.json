Provides that such individual shall serve as President only until a President elected in such special election takes the oath of office of President. Directs the Speaker of the House of Representatives, in addition to his duties as Speaker, to act as Vice President, and to perform the duties of that office, with one exception that the President pro tempore of the Senate shall serve as President of the Senate with voting privileges, until a Vice President elected in such special election takes the oath of office, and in the event the Senate shall be equally divided, the Secretary of State may cast a vote to break the tie."
