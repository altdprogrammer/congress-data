    "text": "Declares that the Treasury did not adequately consult the Congress with regard to the basic decision to support changes in the character of the International Monetary Fund and to accede to the use of IMF gold for aid to the less developed nations rather than to restitute such gold to the member nations. Directs the Treasury to work to insure that any future disposition of IMF gold beyond the sale of one-third of the current stock proposed by the IMF shall require the votes of nations holding 85 percent of the quotas of the IMF. Provides that the Secretary of the Treasury, in his capacity as United States Governor of the Fund, shall not vote for further disposition without the approval of the Congress. Directs that if a Trust is established with funds from the release of IMF gold, the Secretary shall attempt to prevent loans by said Trust for any but the traditional balance of payments adjustment purposes of the IMF. Requires the Secretary to report to the Senate and House of Representatives on the final form of the charter of said Trust, and annually thereafter, on the nature of the loans made by the Trust, as well as any irregularities in the actions of the Trust."
