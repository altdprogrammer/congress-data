Provides that during the eighth year of each term of office of any such judge, his nomination for an additional term of office for the judgeship which he holds shall be placed before the Senate in the manner provided by the law, for the advice and consent of the Senate to such additional term, unless that judge requests that his nomination not be so placed. Allows any judge whose nomination for an additional term of office is so placed before the Senate to remain in office until the Senate gives its advice and consent to, or rejects, such nomination. Provides that if the Senate gives it advice and consent to an additional term of office, that term shall commence from the date of such advice and consent, or the day immediately following the last day of his prior term of office, whichever is later."
