Directs that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed two hours, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule. Allows the consideration of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce now printed in the bill as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule, and States that said amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be read for amendment by titles instead of by sections. States that it shall also be in order to consider without the intervention of any point of order the text of the bill H.R. 10631 as reported by the Committee on Public Works and Transportation if offered by Representative Howard of New Jersey as a new title to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. Provides that, at the conclusion of the consideration of H.R. 10979 for amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and that any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. Provides that the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. States that after the passage of H.R. 10979, it shall be in order in the House to take from the Speaker's table the bill S. 2718 and to move to strike out all after the enacting clause of said Senate bill and insert in lieu thereof the provisions contained in H.R. 10979 as passed by the House."
