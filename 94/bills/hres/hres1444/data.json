States that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed one hour, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on House Administration, the bill shall be considered as having been read and open at any point for amendment under the five- minute rule. Provides that it shall be in order to consider en bloc the amendments printed on pages H7906-H7907 of the Congressional Record of July 28, 1976, by Representative Thompson, and said amendments shall not be subject to a demand for a division of the question in the Committee of the Whole or in the House. Directs the committee, at the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment, to rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted.
