Directs that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed three hours, two hours to be equally divided and controlled by the Chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Public Works and Transportation, and one hour to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule. States that it shall be in order to consider without the intervention of any point of order the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Public Works and Transportation now printed in the bill as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule, said substitute to be read for amendment by titles instead of by sections, and title III of said substitute to be considered as having been read for amendment. Directs that no amendment to title III of said substitute, including an amendment in the nature of a substitute for said committee amendment which would change title III, shall be in order in the House or in the Committee of the Whole except amendments offered by direction of the Committee on Ways and Means, which may be offered in the Committee of the Whole, and said amendments shall not be subject to amendment. Provides that it shall be in order to consider without the intervention of any point of order the text of an amendment by Representative Edgar of Pennsylvania printed in the Congressional Record of December 15, 1975, if offered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute for the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. Directs that, at conclusion of the consideration of H.R. 8235 for amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. Provides that the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions."
