R. 7567) to amend the Arms Control and Disarmament Act, and for other purposes. Directs that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed one hour, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on International Relations, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five- minute rule by titles instead of by sections. States that at the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit."
