    "text": "Requests the President of the United States to transmit a report about the freedom of citizens of Romania to exercise their rights and cultural freedoms, and especially their right to emigrate, to each House of Congress and to the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Requests that such a report be transmitted each time the President makes a request for authority to waive the application of the Trade Act of 1974, or for authority to extend the United States-Romanian Trade Agreement itself. Requests the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe to transmit a report with respect to the freedom of the citizens of Romania to emigrate, and on the status of minorities in that country, to both Houses of Congress. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that if Romania restricts fundamental rights of its citizens, it should be denied its current most-favored nation treatment, and the 1975 United States-Romanian Trade Agreement should be ended. Provides an additional $50,000 for the Trade Subcommittee of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House to assist in carrying out its duties under the Trade Act of 1974."
