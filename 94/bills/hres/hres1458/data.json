States that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed one hour, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule. Provides that it shall be in order to consider the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce now printed in the bill as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule and said substitute shall be read for amendment by titles instead of by sections. Directs the Committee, at the conclusion of such consideration, to rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. States that any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. States that the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. Provides that after the passage of H.R. 14032, it shall be in order to proceed to the consideration of the bill S. 3149, section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-344) to the contrary notwithstanding, and it shall be in order in the House to move to strike out all after the enacting clause of said Senate bill and insert in lieu thereof the provisions of H.R. 14032 as passed by the House."
