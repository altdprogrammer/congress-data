Allows the closing of a meeting by a roll call vote of a majority of those Members voting. Prohibits a conference committee from conducting any business through the use of a subcommittee. Affords any Member who has successfully offered an amendment to any measure to a conference committee, the opportunity to appear before the conference committee to make comments respecting the amendment.
