Provides that it shall be in order to consider the amendment recommended by the Committee on Banking, Currency and Housing now printed on page 24, line 3, through page 37, line 12, not withstanding the provisions of clause 5, rule XXI. Provides that, at the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit. States that after the passage of H.R. 12945, the Committee on Banking, Currency and Housing shall be discharged from the further consideration of the bill S. 3295, and it shall then be in order in the House to move to strike out all after the enacting clause of said Senate bill and insert in lieu thereof the provisions contained in H.R. 12945 as passed by the House."
