Stipulates that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed two hours, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Ad Hoc Select Committee on the Outer Continental Shelf, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule. States that it shall be in order to consider the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Ad Hoc Select Committee on the Outer Continental Shelf now printed in the bill as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule, the provisions of clause 7, rule XVI to the contrary notwithstanding, and said amendment shall be read by titles instead of by sections. Directs the Committee, at the conclusion of such consideration, to rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and any Member may demand a separate vote in the House of any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the Committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. States that the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instruction. Directs that after the passage of H.R. 6218, it shall be in order in the House to take from the Speaker's table the bill S. 521 and to move to strike out all after the enacting clause of the said Senate bill and insert in lieu thereof the provisions contained in H.R. 6218 as passed by the House."
