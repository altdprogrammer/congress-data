Directs the Committee, at the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment, to rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. Provides that after the passage of H.R. 14940, the House shall proceed to the consideration of the bill S. 3557, section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-344) to the contrary notwithstanding, and it shall be in order in the House to move to strike out all after the enacting clause of said Senate bill and insert in lieu thereof the provisions of H.R. 14940 as passed by the House."
