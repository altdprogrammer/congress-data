States that it shall be in order to consider the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs now printed (in italic) in the bill as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule, and said substitute shall be read for amendment by titles instead of by sections. Provides that it shall also be in order to consider the amendments recommended by the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, notwithstanding the provisions of clause 7, Rule XVI. Directs that no amendment to the amendment recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means now printed on page 52, line 2 through page 55, line 8 (in boldface roman) shall be in order except amendments recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means and except pro forma amendments. Directs the Committee, at the conclusion of the consideration of H.R. 2525 for amendment, to rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. States that the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. Directs that after the passage of H.R. 2525, the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs shall be discharged from further consideration of the bill S. 522, and it shall then be in order in the House to move to strike out all after the enacting clause of the said Senate bill and insert in lieu thereof the provisions contained in H.R. 2525 as passed by the House."
