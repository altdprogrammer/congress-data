Provides that consideration shall be given problems which contribute to the financial plight of cities, including: (1) net outmigration of population; (2) decline in employment opportunities; (3) adverse city/suburban relationships; (4) cost of public services; (5) rising crime rates; (6) lack of new investment in housing; and (7) racial, ethnic, and economic segregation. Calls upon the committee to develop a policy regarding the appropriate role of various levels of government in the solution of such problems.
