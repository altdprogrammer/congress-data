Directs that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed two hours, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule by titles instead of by sections. Provides that it shall be in order to consider en bloc the amendments printed on pages H2189-2191 of the Congressional Record of March 22, 1976, by Representative Melcher. Requires that, at the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit."
