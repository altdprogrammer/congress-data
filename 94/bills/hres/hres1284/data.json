States that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed two hours to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five minute rule by titles instead of by sections. Directs the Committee, at the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment, to rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted and the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions."
