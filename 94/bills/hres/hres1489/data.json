States that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed one hour, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule by titles instead of by sections. Directs the Committee, at the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment, to rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit. Provides that after the passage of H.R. 14578, it shall be in order in the House to take from the Speaker's table the bill S. 3283 and to move to strike out all after the enacting clause of the said Senate bill and insert in lieu thereof the provisions contained in H.R. 14578 as passed by the House."
