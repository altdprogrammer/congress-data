Provides that any individual employed by a Member of the House may be paid from the clerk hire allowance only for duties and activities as may be necessary to assist such Members in carrying out their official duties. Prohibits any Member of the House from making expenditures from the compensation of such Member, or from any private source, to defray any expense relating to the official duties of such Member. Requires each Member of the House to transmit to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct of the House, no later than April 30 of each year, a report of the net worth of such Member as of the close of the preceding year.
