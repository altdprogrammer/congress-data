States that after general debate which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed three hours, two hours to be equally divided and controlled by the Member recognized to call up the bill and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, and one hour to be controlled by Representative Krueger of Texas, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule. Provides that it shall be in order to consider the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce now printed in the bill as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule. Provides that it shall be in order to consider without the intervention of any point of order the amendment inserted in the Congressional Record on December 8, 1975, by Representative Krueger on pages H 12022-26 if offered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute for the committee substitute. Directs that if said amendment in the nature of a substitute is not agreed to in the Committee of the Whole, it shall then be in order to consider without the intervention of any point of order, the amendment inserted in the Congressional Record on December 8, 1975, by Representative Brown of Ohio on pages H 12021-22 if offered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute for the committee substitute. Provides that, at the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions."
