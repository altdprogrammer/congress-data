    "text": "Establishes the House Committee on Intelligence to oversee and make continuing studies of the intelligence activities and programs of the United States Government. Provides that the committee shall make every effort to assure that the appropriate departments and agencies of the United States provide complete, informed, and timely intelligence necessary for the executive and legislative branches to make sound decisions affecting the security and vital interests of the Nation. Provides that the committee shall review all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, authorizations for appropriations, and other matters relating to the intelligence activities of all departments and agencies of the Government. Specifies that this resolution in no way restricts the authority of any other committee to study and review any intelligence activity to the extent that such activity directly affects a matter otherwise within the jurisdiction of such committee. Requires the committee to make regular and periodic reports to the House on the nature and extent of the intelligence activities of the various departments and agencies of the United States. Provides that the committee shall formulate and carry out such rules and procedures as it deems necessary to prevent the disclosure of information in the possession of such committee. Authorizes the committee to disclose publicly any information in its possession after a determination by such committee that the public interest would be served by such disclosure. Requires approval by a committee vote before such disclosure is allowed and the vote must be reported to the President. Directs that upon certification by the President that the disclosure of such information would be a threat to the national interest of the United States that outweighs any public interest in the disclosure, the information shall be withheld; unless decided otherwise by a vote of the entire House. Provides that the House may vote to disclose all or any part of the information or to return the issue to the committee for final determination. Provides that it shall be the duty of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to investigate any unauthorized disclosure of intelligence information by a Member, officer, or employee of the House and to report such findings to the House. Provides that no funds shall be appropriated for any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1976, for the use of any department or agency of the United States to carry out intelligence activities, unless such funds shall have been previously authorized by a bill or joint resolution passed by the House during the same or preceding fiscal years. Limits the expenses of the committee, for the period from the date this resolution is agreed to through the end of the 94th Congress, to $250,000."
