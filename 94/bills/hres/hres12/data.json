    "text": "States that the House of Representatives of the United States expresses its firm belief that the Vladivostok agreement in principle must lead to immediate actual reductions of nuclear stockpiles and that both the United States and the Soviet Union should make every effort to halt the continuing competition in strategic arms by refraining from the development or deployment of additional nuclear weapons systems beyond current levels. Expresses the sense of the House that the President should make every possible effort to include these reduction measures as part of the final accord carrying out the Vladivostok agreement, including but not limited to, the following: (1) the negotiation of overall levels lower than those contained in the Vladivostok agreement and not to exceed present levels, both in numbers of delivery vehicles and in numbers of missiles capable of carrying multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles; (2) the negotiation of restraints on the pace of deployment by the United States and the Soviet Union of new strategic delivery systems, with the mutually agreed upon lower numerical levels referred to in paragraph (1) of this resolution; (3) the negotiation of limitations on the number of strategic ballistic missile flight tests which may be conducted annually by the United States and the Soviet Union; and (4) an agreement to continue negotiations on a timely and sustained basis to achieve further mutual limitations with regard to nuclear weapons systems not presently limited as part of the 1972 arms control agreements and the Vladivostok agreement."
