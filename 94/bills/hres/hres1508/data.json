Directs the committee to conduct a study to identify the nature and causes of problems afflicting large cities which face severe fiscal imbalance. Provides that consideration shall be given problems which contribute to the financial plight of cities, including: (1) net outmigration of population; (2) decline in employment opportunities; (3) adverse city/suburban relationships; (4) cost of public services; (5) rising crime rates; (6) lack of new investment in housing; and (7) racial, ethnic, and economic segregation. Calls upon the committee to develop a policy regarding the appropriate role of various levels of government in the solution of such problems. Requires the committee to evaluate the consequences of, and coordination among, existing Federal policies and programs which relate to the major problems identified by the committee. Directs the committee to formulate specific recommendations regarding Federal legislation and executive administrative action for modifications of or alternatives to present Federal programs."
