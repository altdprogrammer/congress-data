Directs that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and to the amendments made in order by this resolution and shall continue not to exceed two hours, one hour to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Public Works and Transportation, and one hour to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule. States that it shall be in order to consider without the intervention of any point of order the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Public Works and Transportation now printed in the bill as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule, and said substitute shall be read for amendment by titles instead of by sections. Provides that it shall be in order to consider without the intervention of any point of order an amendment inserted in the Congressional Record of December 15, 1975, by the chairman of the Committee on ways and Means if offered as a new title III to the said amendment in the nature of a substitute, and said amendment shall not be subject to amendment in the House or in the Committee of the Whole except, in the Committee of the Whole amendments offered by direction of the Committee on Ways and Means and an amendment inserted in the Congressional Record of December 15, 1975, by the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. Provides that if said amendment inserting a new title III is agreed to in Committee of the Whole, it shall not then be in order in the House or in the Committee of the Whole to offer an amendment which would change title III. Provides that, at the conclusion of the consideration of H.R. 9771 for amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or the Committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. Directs that the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions."
