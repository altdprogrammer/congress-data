States that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed three hours, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Government Operations, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five- minute rule. Provides that no amendment shall be in order to said bill except germane amendments printed in the Congressional Record at least one calendar day prior to the offering of said amendment, and except for pro forma amendments. Directs that it shall be in order to consider en bloc, in lieu of the separate committee amendments printed in the bill, each group of amendments numbered 1 through 12 printed in the Congressional Record of June 8, 1976, if offered from the floor, and said amendments if offered en bloc shall not be subject to a demand for a division of the question in the House or in the Committee of the Whole. Directs the Committee, at the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment, to rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions."
