    "text": "Community Mental Health Centers Amendments and Rape Prevention and Control Act - Sets forth the findings of Congress that until legislation is enacted which insures all Americans financial access to mental health services presently available through community mental health centers, Federal funds should continue to be made available for initiating new community mental health centers. Community Mental Health Centers Act - Revises title II of the Community Mental Health Centers Act.

States that the provision of services through a center shall be coordinated with services by other agencies in the center's catchment area to insure that persons receiving services through the center have access to all such health and social services as they may require. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to public and nonprofit private entities to carry out projects to plan community mental health center programs. Provides that the amount of any such grant may not exceed $75,000. Authorizes appropriations of planning for payment grants of $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1975, and $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1976.

States that the Secretary may provide grants for consultation and education services, and to cover operating deficits arising from the provision of the new services authorized by this Act. States that no grant may be made to any entity or community mental health center unless a State plan for the provision of comprehensive mental health services has been approved by the Secretary. Sets forth procedures governing the approval of applications for grants. Directs the Secretary to pay the Federal share of projects for (1) the acquisition or remodeling, of facilities for community mental health centers; (2) the leasing of facilities for such centers; (3) the construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities for community mental health centers if not less than 25 per cent of the residents of the centers' catchment areas are members of low income groups; and (4) the initial equipment of a facility.

Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a continuing study and investigation of : (1) the effectiveness of existing Federal, State, and local laws dealing with rape; (2) the relationship, if any, between traditional legal and social attitudes toward sexual roles, the act of rape, and the formulation of laws dealing with rape; (3) the treatment of the victims of rape by law enforcement agencies, hospitals or other medical institutions, prosecutors, and the courts; (4) the causes of rape; (5) sexual assaults in correctional institutions; (6) the actual incidence of forcible rape as compared to the reported cases and the reasons therefor; and (7) the effectiveness of existing private and local and State government education and counseling programs designed to prevent and control rape. Directs the Secretary to appoint an advisory committee to advise, consult with, and make recommendations to him on the implementation of these provisions. Authorizes for the purposes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 and $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1976. Sets forth general provisions governing the regulation of community mental health centers and the implementation of State plans."
