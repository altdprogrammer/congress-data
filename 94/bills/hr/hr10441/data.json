    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1975-10-30", 
    "text": "Food Stamp Reform Act - Eliminates the requirement, under the Food Stamp Act, that individuals receiving supplemental security income benefits under title XVI (grantss to States for the Aged, Blind or Disabled) of the Social Security Act shall not be considered eligible for food stamps if the supplemental income payments include the bonus value of food stamps. States that households in which a member is eligible to participate in the nutrition program for the elderly under the Older Americans Act, or is authorized to use coupons for meals on wheels, shall not be required to have cooking facilities. Modifies the eligibility standards for students. Lowers the work registration age limit for eligibility purposes from 65 to 60. States that the actual value of employer-provided housing (up to $25 per month) shall be taken into account for eligibility purposes. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, in computing eligibility, to allow a standard deduction of $125 plus $25 for each elderly person, after deductions for disaster or casualty losses, taxes, and other mandatory deductions. Eliminates the purchase price requirement and establishes an income formula for determining eligibility. Requires the Secretary to carry out a nutrition education program for recipients, including distribution of printed materials designed to teach recipients how to buy and prepare nutritious and economical meals. States that wrongfully denied food coupons shall be restored through a lump sum cash payment. Requires bilingual assistance to be made available in areas where numerous potentially eligible persons speak a language other than English. Directs the Secretary to conduct a survey and report to Congress on the average and distribution of assets held by participants in the food stamp program. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out pilot experiments for purposes of increasing the program's efficiency and improving the delivery of benefits to eligible households."
