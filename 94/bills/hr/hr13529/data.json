Prohibits a franchisor from cancelling a franchise unless the franchisee has acted in bad faith, or has violated a material requirement of the franchise, or the franchisor is effecting a market area withdrawal. Prohibits a franchisor from failing to review a franchise except for the reasons stated above or the franchisor has a legitimate business reason for failing to renew. Makes any franchisor that has violated the requirements of this Act civilly liable to the aggrieved franchisee."
