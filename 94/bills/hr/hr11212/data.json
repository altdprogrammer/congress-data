Permits the Bank to obtain funds through the public or private sale of its bonds, debentures, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness. Authorizes the Bank to make loans to eligible organizations which shall be repayable in not more than forty years. States that the objective of the Bank shall be to provide the type of credit needed by eligible borrowers, at the lowest reasonable cost on a sound business basis, taking into account the cost of money to the Bank. Defines \"eligible cooperatives\" for purposes of assistance under this title as an organization chartered or operated on a cooperative, not for profit basis for producing or furnishing goods, services, facilities, or financing primarily for the benefit of its members or voting stockholders who are ultimate consumers, if it meets specified criteria, or any other institution chartered or operated in such a way as to enhance competitive market forces or to reduce the price spread between producers and the ultimate consumers of products or services.

Permits the Cooperative Bank and Assistance Administration to make a capital investment advance out of the Fund to any eligible cooperative if the Administration determines that the applicants' initial or supplemental capital requirements exceed its ability to obtain a Title I loan from the Bank or other sources, and the membership of the applicant consists substantially of low-income persons. Title III: Cooperative Technical Assistance - Directs the Cooperative Bank and Assistance Administration to make available information and services concerning the organization or reorganization of cooperatives to best achieve the objectives of this Act and to best provide the means through which various types of goods, services, and facilities can be made available to members and patrons.
