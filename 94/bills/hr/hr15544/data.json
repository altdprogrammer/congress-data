    "text": "Emergency Federal Power Act Amendments - Amends the Federal Power Act to require that the operation of proposed rate schedules become effective only upon a determination by the Federal Power Commission that such schedules are lawful. Authorizes the use of special interim proceedings whereby the Commission may order parts of proposed rate schedules into effect pending results of a final determination. Prohibits public utilities from proposing additional rate increases where such proposed increases were part of a rate schedule pending before the Commission for 18 months or less. Directs the Commission to require public utilities to report anticipated shortages of electric energy. Authorizes the Commission to order such utilities to take actions necessary to alleviate the effects of such shortages."
