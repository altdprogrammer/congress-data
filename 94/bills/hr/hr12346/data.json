    "text": "Amtrak Improvement Act - Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to authorize the National Railroad Passenger Corporation to establish a through route and rate with qualified motor carriers, including the transportation of passengers not using the rail service of the Corporation. Exempts such transportation from specified provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act and any State, regional or local law except as it may relate to safety. Requires, in establishing such through service, the Corporation to first offer in writing to establish such service with authorized motor carrier or carriers. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1978 to the Secretary of Transportation for the benefit of the Corporation: (1) to meet specified expenses; (2) to make capital acquisitions or improvements of the basic system; and (3) for the payment of the principal amount of obligations of the Corporation. Sets forth the maximum amount from such appropriations which shall be available for payment of operating and capital expenses of intercity rail passenger service. Reduces the maximum aggregate unpaid principal limitation under such Act by an amount equal to the total principal amount of such obligations paid by the Corporation from funds available under specified provisions of this Act."
