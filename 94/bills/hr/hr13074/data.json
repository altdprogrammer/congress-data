    "text": "Amends the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1974 to permit the use of area triggers within States to determine the payment of Federal emergency unemployment compensation benefits. Stipulates that there will be an area \"emergency on\" indicator in any area if the rate of insured unemployment in such area equals or exceeds five percent for at least 12 weeks. States that for purposes of determining an individual's period of eligibility or additional eligibility period, to the extent that an emergency benefit period is not in effect in all areas of a State, the determination shall be made by reference to the area in which the individual was last employed for at least five work days before the beginning of the benefit year. Sets forth a formula to determine the amount of funds available to individual accounts."
