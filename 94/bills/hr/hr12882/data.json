Permits any present or former judge or justice of the United States who has voided the right to receive an annuity by receiving a refund of the lump-sum credit, and any surviving spouse of such an individual, to reestablish the right to receive an annuity by repaying, within one year of the effective date of this Act, the amount of the lump-sum refund, plus interest. Extends provisions allowing an irrevocable election of a reduced annuity by individuals who marry after retirement to specified annuitants who married after retirement but before January 8, 1971."
