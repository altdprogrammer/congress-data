    "text": "Opportunities Industrialization Centers Job Creation and Training Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to provide special authority for the Opportunities Industrialization Centers in order to create and provide job opportunities for specific unemployed persons. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to enter into a contract with Opportunities Industrialization Centers, Incorporated (OIC) in order to provide comprehensive employment services and jobs for unemployed persons. Requires each such contract to contain provisions assuring that specific requirements are complied with, including requirements that (1) special consideration in providing jobs will be given to unemployed persons who are most severely disadvantaged in terms of the length of time they have been unemployed; (2) due consideration will be given to persons who have participated in manpower training programs for whom unemployment opportunities would be otherwise available, and (3) the program will to the maximum extent feasible contribute to the elimination of artificial barriers to employment and occupational advancement. Sets forth special conditions to be met prior to providing financial assistance pursuant to a contract entered into under this Act. Requires the programs to contribute, to the maximum extent feasible, to the occupational development or upward mobility of individual participants. Prohibits the Secretary from providing financial assistance unless he determines that: (1) periodic reports will be submitted to him to measure the effectiveness of the program; (2) there will be no discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, sex, political affiliation, or beliefs within the program; and (3) the participants in the program will not be employed in the construction, operation, or maintenance of sectarian religious facilities. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act of $150,000,000 for fiscal year 1977, $200,000,000 for fiscal year 1978, $300,000,000 for fiscal year 1979, and $350,000,000 for fiscal year 1980."
