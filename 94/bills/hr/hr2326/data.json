    "text": "Parole Reorganization Act - Establishes, as an independent entity in the Department of Justice, a United States Parole Commission, to consist of a national office and five regional offices. States that the Commission shall have the power to establish general policies, guidelines, rules, and regulations for the Commission, including rules with respect to the factors to be taken into account in determining whether or not a prisoner should be released on parole. Provides that the Commission shall meet not less frequently than quarterly to establish its general policies and rules. States that, whenever confined and serving a definite term or terms of over one hundred and eighty days, a prisoner shall be eligible for release on parole after serving one-third of such term or terms or after serving ten years of a life sentence or of a sentence over thirty years. Stipulates that a prisoner shall be released on parole if his record shows that he has substantially observed the rules of the institution in which he is confined on the date of his eligibility for parole, unless it is determined by an examining panel that he should not be released on such date for one or more of the following reasons: (1) there is a reasonable probability that such prisoner will not live and remain at liberty without violating any criminal law; (2) there is a reasonable probability that such release would be incompatible with the welfare of society; or (3) the prisoner's release on such date would so deprecate the seriousness of his crime as to undermine respect for the law. Requires the regional offices to hold a hearing in making a determination of whether to release a prisoner on parole. Sets forth the procedure to be followed in such hearings. Authorizes the regional Commissions to impose such conditions of parole as are deemed reasonably necessary to insure that the parolee will lead a law-abiding life or to assist him in doing so. Provides, with certain exceptions, that the jurisdiction of the Commission over the parolee shall terminate no later than the date of the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced. States that if the regional commissioner believes that any parolee has violated a condition of his parole, or that there is reason to terminate any parolee's assignment to a center or similar facility, he may order such parolee to appear before him or before a hearing examiner, or issue a warrant and retake the parolee as provided in this Act. Requires that a hearing be held on such a matter. Authorizes the courts to fix eligibility for parole at the time of sentencing of an individual. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to provide that any prisoner shall be eligible for release on parole if such prisoner is ineligible for such release under any other provision of law. Requires the Commission to report annually to each House of Congress on the activities of the Commission."
