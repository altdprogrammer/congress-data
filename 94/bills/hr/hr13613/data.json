    "as": "Reported to House amended",

    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Agriculture with amendment, H. Rept. 94-1460) Food Stamp Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to formulate and administer a food stamp program under which, at the request of the State agency which administers federally aided public assistance programs, eligible households within the State shall be provided with an opportunity to obtain a nutritionally adequate diet through the issuance to them of a coupon allotment. Stipulates that the coupons received by such households shall be used only to purchase food from retail food stores which have been approved for participation in the food stamp program. Prohibits the distribution of federally donated foods in areas where a food stamp program is in operation except where such distribution is required for a period of time on an Indian reservation, or where distribution is made to meet disaster relief needs, or the needs of a supplemental food program. Directs the Secretary to establish uniform national standards by which the eligiblity of households for participation in the food stamp program may be determined. States that, in determining the income of a household for the purpose of determining the household's eligibility to participate in the program, all income shall be calculated by focusing upon the income anticipated to be received in the certification period for which eligibility is being determined so as to ascertain as best as possible the income that will be actually available to a household. Specifies deductions which may be made from gross income in determining the income of a household. States that, for eligibility purposes, a household may possess up to $1,500 in liquid and nonliquid assets, except for households of two or more persons, one of whom is elderly, which will be permitted to hold assets not exceeding $3,000. Specifies allowable exemptions from such assets, including a household's home and farmland not exceeding 20 acres, common household goods of minor value, and an automobile valued at less than $3,000. Precludes from being declared eligible under the program: (1) for a period of one year, any household which has been found quilty of fraud in connection with the program; (2) any household which refuses to provide required information with respect to a determination of eligibility; (3) any individual between the ages of 18 and 65 who refuses to register for work or to accept an offer of employment fulfilling conditions specified in this Act; (4) any individual 18 years of age or older who is enrolled in an institution of higher education unless such individual is the head of a household; and (5) any individual who is not a resident of the United States and either a citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Prohibits households from transferring assets for the purpose of qualifying for the food stamp program. States that individuals receiving supplemental security income payments, the level of which was increased specifically to include the bonus value of food stamps, shall not be eligible for the food stamp program. Directs the Secretary to promulgate procedures for insuring an adequate inventory of food coupons in the hands of each vendor, and to prescribe procedures for the delivery of coupons in the hands of vendors. States that the face value of the coupon allotment which State agencies shall be authorized to issue to any eligible households shall be equal to the cost to such households of a nutritionally adequate diet. Establishes the charge for such allotment at 27.5 percent of the household's income. Stipulates that the value of the coupon allotment provided to any eligible household shall not be considered to be income or resources for any purpose under any Federal or State laws including, but not limited to, laws relating to taxation, welfare, and public assistance programs. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations governing the disposition of funds received by food coupon vendors. States that all such funds are monies of the Federal Government and may not be used in any manner by any person or corporation. Sets forth accounting procedures to be followed by coupon vendors. Provides for the approval of retail foodstores and wholesale food concerns which desire to be authorized to accept and redeem coupons under the Food Stamp Act. Prohibits States and political subdivisions thereof from decreasing welfare grants to any individual or individuals because of such individual's participation in the food stamp program. Requires each State agency desiring to participate in the food stamp program to submit a plan of operation specifying the manner in which such program will be conducted within the State. Requires such plans to provide: (1) for action to inform low-income households of the program, including multi-linqual announcements where necessary; (2) that each household requesting assistance under the program shall be permitted to file for assistance on the same day that the first request is made; (3) that the determination of eligibility shall be made within 30 days; and (4) for safeguards restricting the use or disclosure of information obtained from applicant households. Directs the Secretary and participating State agencies to carry out a program of nutritional education for recipient households. Provides for the review of the conduct of State food stamp programs by the Secretary. Sets forth remedial procedures. Provides for the disqualification of retail food stores and wholesale food concerns for violations of State regulations, subjecting such violators to a civil penalty of up to $5,000. Establishes procedures for the administrative and judicial review of such disqualifications. Establishes criminal penalties for fraud in connection with the obtaining for sale of food coupons or authorization to purchase cards. Authorizes the Secretary to pay 50 percent of the administrative costs of the food stamp program. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct experimental projects designed to increase the efficiency of the food stamp program. Directs the Secretary to implement, by March 1, 1977, a pilot project testing the elimination of the purchase requirement. Requires such project to be carried out in at least ten areas, appropriately divided between urban and rural regions. Stipulates that the value of a household's coupon allotment under such project shall be the cost of a nutritionally adequate diet reduced by 30 percent of the household's income. Directs the Secretary to study and develop alternative poverty line definitions at different levels. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act for fiscal year 1977."
