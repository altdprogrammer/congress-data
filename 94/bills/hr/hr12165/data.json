    "text": "United States Air Traffic Services Corporation Act - States the finding of Congress that the Office of the Secretary of Transportation has exercised arbitrary and capricious control over the entire range of Federal Aviation Administration activities and that the proper conduct of the responsibilities associated with civil aviation development and safety requires action by an independent Federal aviation corporation. Establishes the United States Air Traffic Services Corporation as a body corporate with its principal office in the District of Columbia to be managed by a ten member Board of Directors. Sets forth the membership, pay, terms of office, and categories of expertise from which the members of such Board shall be chosen. Authorizes the Board to appoint such corporate officers as necessary to carry out the functions of the Corporation and to contract for the temporary or intermittent services of experts and consultants. Sets forth the powers of the Board of Directors and the Corporation. Allows the Corporation to change the rates of tax imposed under the Internal Revenue Code relating to taxes on special fuels, taxes on the transportation of persons and property by air and taxes on the use of civil aircraft. Transfers to the Corporation all the functions, powers, and duties of the Secretary of Transportation, including those which are exercised by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration under specified laws and provisions of law relating to civil aviation. Tranfers the personnel, assets, liabilities, contracts, unexpended appropriations, and funds of the Department of Transportation relating to civil aviation to the Corporation. Makes technical amendments in specified laws to carry out the provisions of this Act. States that all orders, determinations, rules, regulations, permits, contracts, certificates, licenses and privileges currently in effect shall continue in effect until modified or terminated by the Board. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act in an amount equal to 50 percent of the total funding requirement of the Corporation for any fiscal year."
