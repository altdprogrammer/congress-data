    "text": "Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act - Provides for a Federal minimum death and dismemberment benefit to be paid to public safety officers, or surviving dependents of such persons. Defines the term \"public safety officer\" as meaning a person serving the United States or a State or unit of general local government, with or without compensation, in any activity pertaining to: (1) the enforcement of the criminal laws, including highway patrol, or the maintenance of civil peace by the national guard or the Armed Forces; (2) a correctional program, facility, or institution where the activity is potentially dangerous because of contact with criminal suspects, defendents, prisoners, probationers, parolees; (3) a court having criminal or juvenile delinquent jurisdiction where the activity is potentially dangerous because of contact with criminal suspects, defendents and prisoners; and (4) firefighting. Provides that no benefit shall be paid under this Act: (1) if the death or dismemberment was caused by the intentional misconduct of the public safety officer or by such officer's intention to bring about his death or dismemberment; (2) if voluntary intoxication of the public safety officer was the proximate cause of such officer's death or dismemberment; (3) in the event the public safety officer was killed, to any person who would otherwise be entitled to a benefit under this part, if such person's actions were a substantial contributing factor to the death of the public safety officer; or (4) if a notification of death or dismemberment has not been filed by or on behalf of a public safety officer under this part with the Attorney General or the Governor or highest executive of a State within one year after the date of death or dismemberment, unless the Administration finds that the failure to file was justified by good cause. Sets forth procedures for the payment of such benefits. Authorizes the appropriation of $40,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 to carry out this Act."
