    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Government Operations with amendment, S. Rept. 94-1325) Presidential Protection Assistance Act - Defines the term \"protectee\" to mean the following persons: the President of the United States; members of the President's immediate family; the Vice President and members of his immediate family; other officers next in the order of succession to the Office of the President; the President-elect and Vice President-elect; a visiting head of a foreign state or government and, at the direction of the President, other distinguished foreign visitors to the United States and official representatives of the United States who are performing special missions abroad; major Presidential or Vice Presidential candidates; a former President and his wife during his lifetime; the widow of a former President until her death or remarriage; and minor children of a former President until they reach 16 years of age. Authorizes each protectee to designate one non-governmental property to be fully secured by the Secret Service on a permanent basis. Provides that such designation may be transferred to another non-governmental property by the protectee. Limits expenditures by the Secret Service at non-governmental properties other than the one property designated to a cumulative total of $10,000 at each such property. Requires Executive departments and agencies to assist the Secret Service in the performance of its protective duties by providing services, equipment and facilities on a temporary and reimbursable basis at the request of the Director of the Secret Service. Requires the Secret Service, the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard to report semi-annually, on March 31 and September 31, on expenditures made pursuant to this Act to the Committees on Appropriations, the Committees on the Judiciary and the Committees on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Directs that expenditures made pursuant to this Act be subject to auditing by the General Accounting Office. Repeals section 2 of Public Law 90-331, relating to furnishing protection to major Presidential and Vice-Presidential Candidates."
