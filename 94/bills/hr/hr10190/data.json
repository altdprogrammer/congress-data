States that for purposes of this Act, the term \"direct marketing from farmers to consumers\" means the marketing of agricultural commodities at any marketplace (including, but not limited to, roadside stands, city markets, and vehicles used for house-to-house marketing of agricultural commodities) established and maintained for the purpose of enabling farmers to sell their agricultural commodities directly to individual consumers, or organizations representing consumers. Directs the Extension Service of the Department of Agriculture to conduct and facilitate activities designed to foster traditional methods of direct marketing from farmers to consumers, including: (1) compiling regulations relevant to direct marketing within such State; (2) the sponsorship of conferences designed to facilitate the sharing of information on direct marketing programs; and (3) the providing of technical assistance to groups establishing direct marketing programs. Authorizes appropriations of specified sums to carry out the purposes of this Act."
