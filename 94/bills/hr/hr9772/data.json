    "text": "Airport and Airway Development Act Amendments - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to prepare and publish a revised national airport system plan for the development of public airports in the United States. States that such plan should include: (1) an identification of the levels of public service and the uses made of each public airport in the plan, and the projected airport development which the Secretary deems necessary to fulfill the levels of service and use of such airports during the next 10-year period; and (2) a listing of the amount of funds expended in each of the fiscal years 1971 through 1975 for terminal area development at each air carrier, commuter, and reliever airport, showing separately the amounts expended for nonrevenue producing public use areas and for other areas. Authorizes appropriations of up to $2,000,000 to carry out such purpose. Authorizes specific appropriations under the Airport and Airway Development Act to develop air carrier airport programs and general aviation airports in the territories of the United States. Specifies the apportionment and distribution of funds under the Airport and Airway Development Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to make grants of up to $25,000 to any State for up to 75 percent of the cost of developing standards for airport development at general aviation airports in each State, other than standards for safety of approaches. Authorizes appropriations of $1,275,000 to carry out such purposes. Stipulates that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, no part of any funds authorized to be obligated for fiscal years 1978, 1979 and 1980 shall be obligated or otherwise expended except in accordance with a statute enacted after the date of this Act. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a study of airports in areas where land requirements, local taxes or a low revenue return per acre may require the closing of such airports, together with recommendations concerning the preservation of such airports. Directs the Secretary to establish a civil aviation information distribution program within each region of the Federal Aviation Administration. Prohibits the closure of any existing flight service station operated by the Federal Aviation Administration, except under specified conditions. Authorizes appropriations of $72,000,000 to the Secretary to undertake a demonstration project related to ground transportation services to the Oakland International Airport, California, which will be consistent with the objectives of the Urban Mass Transportation Act."
