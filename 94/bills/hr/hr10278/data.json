Limits to $7,000,000,000 the total amount of loans and loan guarantes which may be outstanding at any one time.

Sets forth conditions governing the eligibility of political subdivisions for assistance under this Act. States that no loan made under authority of this Act may be used directly or indirectly for debt service.
