Requires the Secretary of Commerce to formulate the questions and type of information, subject to the approval of the appropriate committees of Congress, to be compiled in the decennial census and the mid-decade sample surveys not less than 3 years before the date of such census or survey. Allows the Secretary to submit, when circumstances necessitate, new questions during the remaining period before the decennial census or mid-decade sample survey. States that the geographic scope of each sample survey shall be the same as that of each decennial census. Authorizes the Secretary to call upon any other department, agency, or establishment of the Federal Government, or of the municipal government of the District of Columbia, for information pertinent to the work provided for in this title. Provides that the Secretary shall not have access to financial information contained in individual income tax returns filed with the Internal Revenue Service except as provided by law. Directs the Secretary to use information already available to the maximum extent possible instead of conducting direct inquiries. (Amends 13 U.S.C. 6, 141, and 191)"
