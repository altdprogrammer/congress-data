    "text": "National School Lunch and Child Nutrition Act Amendments - Authorizes appropriations for the fiscal years subsequent to that of 1975 to enable the Secretary of Agriculture to formulate and carry out a program of assistance to the States to initiate, maintain, or expand nonprofit breakfast programs in schools. States that as a national nutrition and health policy, it is the purpose and intent of the Congress that the school breakfast program under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 be made available in all schools where it is needed to provide adequate nutrition for children in attendance. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, in cooperation with State educational agencies, to carry out a program of information to the schools in furtherance of this policy. Requires that within ninety days after the enactment of this legislation, the Secretary shall report to the committee of jurisdiction in the Congress his plans, and those of the cooperating State agencies, to bring about the needed expansion in the school breakfast program. Sets forth the schedule of income limitations for reduced price lunches. Provides for the disbursement of funds under this Act to nonprofit private schools. Provides for the inclusion of specified commodities, such as cereal and shortening, in the food donations to the school lunch program covered by this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as are necessary to enable the Secretary of Agriculture to formulate and carry out a program to assist States through grants-in-aid and other means to initiate, maintain, or expand nonprofit food service programs for needy children in institutions providing child care. Sets forth requirements for the apportionment of funds under this Act to the States. Authorizes the use of funds under the National School Lunch Act for nonfood assistance for the special food service program. Establishes a National Advisory Council on Maternal, Infant, and Fetal Nutrition. Provides for the membership of such Council. Makes it the function of the Council to make a continuing study of the operation of the special supplemental food program and any related Act under which diet supplementation is provided to women, infants, and children, with a view to determining how such programs may be improved. Directs the Council to submit to the President and the Congress annually a written report of the results of its study together with such recommendations for administrative and legislative changes as it deems appropriate."
