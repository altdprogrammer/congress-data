    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Requires all passenger automobiles manufactured after model year 1977 to meet specified fuel consumption rates. Permits the Secretary of Transportation to exempt small manufacturers from such requirements if such exemption is necessary to avoid an unreasonable burden on such manufacturer. Directs the Secretary to prescribe fuel economy standards for all light duty trucks and multi-purpose passenger vehicles manufactured after model year 1977. Directs the Secretary, not later than July 1, 1977, to prescribe average fuel economy standards for new automobiles manufactured from model year 1981 through model year 1984. Permits the Secretary to revise such standards. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to determine if the fuel economy standards established by to this Act are being complied with. Provides that test procedures to determine compliance shall be those utilized by the Administrator for model year 1975. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations requiring each manufacturer to submit a report to the Secretary during the 30-day period preceding the beginning of each model year, and during the 30- day period beginning on the 180th day of each model year. Provides that each such report shall contain a statement as to whether such manufacturer will comply with applicable fuel economy requirements; a plan which describes the steps the manufacturer intends to take in order to comply with such requirements; and such other matter as the Secretary may require. Provides that beginning no later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, each manufacturer shall cause to be affixed and each dealer shall cause to be maintained on each new automobile, in a prominent place, a sticker indicating the fuel economy which a prospective purchaser can expect from such automobile, representative average annual fuel costs associated with the operation of such automobile, and the range of fuel economy performance of automobiles of similar size and weight (as determined by the Administrator). Provides for the imposition of civil penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act."
