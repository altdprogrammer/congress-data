    "text": "Broadcast License Renewal Act - Requires the Federal Communications Commission to establish procedures to be followed by licensees of broadcasting stations to ascertain the needs, problems, and interests of their viewers. Sets the term of a broadcast station license, or renewal at 5 years. Provides that any license granted may, upon its expiration, be renewed, if the Commission finds that the public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by the renewal of such license. Requires that in considering any application for renewal of a broadcast license, the Commission shall not consider: (1) the ownership interests or official connections of the applicant in other stations or other communications media or other businesses; or (2) the participation of ownership in the management of the station for which such application has been filed. States the criteria under which the Commission may decide between granting renewal of a broadcast license and granting a mutually exclusive construction permit for a broadcast station."
