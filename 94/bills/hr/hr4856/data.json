Requires each policy purchased under this Act to provide for the following: (1) reinsurance with other insurers which meet the Administrator's criteria; (2) that the Administrator may discontinue a whole policy, or exclude from coverage loans made after a date fixed by him; (3) issuance to each insured veteran of a certificate setting forth the benefits to which he is entitled; (4) any other provisions necessary to carry out this Act; and (5) an annual accounting to the Administrator of the amount of premiums paid, the total of all mortality and other claim charges incurred, and the amount of the insurer's expenses and risk charges. States that insurance under this Act shall terminate upon whichover of the following events first occurs: (1) satisfaction of the veteran's indebtedness under the loan upon which the insurance is based; (2) the veteran's 70th birthday; (3) termination of the veteran's ownership of the property securing the loan; (4) discontinuance of payment of premiums by the veteran; or (5) discontinuance of the entire contract or agreement.
