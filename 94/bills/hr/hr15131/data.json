    "text": "Employment and Training Act - Directs the Secretary of Labor to formulate and administer an employment and training program under which Federal grants will be made available to State agencies upon request for distribution to unemployed individuals within the State through employers. Requires each State agency desiring to participate in the program to submit to the Secretary for approval a proposed plan of operation. States that subsidies shall be provided under this Act to employers who provide unemployed individuals with employment and training. Specifies requirements which each State plan of operation must include. Directs the Secretary to deliver quarterly to each State participating in the program a grant constituting the Federal share for the program. Sets forth a formula for grants based on: (1) the average unemployment rate in such State; and (2) the number of unemployed individuals in such State. Defines individuals who are eligible for subsidized employment under such Act. States that the United States shall pay 80 percent of the subsidies distributed in each State under the program established by this Act. Authorizes appropriations of $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 1978 and for each fiscal year thereafter."
