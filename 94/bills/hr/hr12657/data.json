    "text": "Equal Opportunity for Second Careers Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to provide specific employment and career opportunities for individuals over 40 years of age. Directs the Secretary of Labor to allot grants to regional employment councils in regions of the United States to assist second career programs for individuals aged 40 or over who are unemployed or underemployed. States that regional allotments shall be based on a formula derived from the respective characteristics of each region. Authorizes appropriations for grants of $1,500,000,000 for fiscal year 1977, $1,800,000,000 for fiscal year 1978, and sums necessary for each fiscal year thereafter. Specifies that each regional employment council shall consist of 15 members, with equitable numbers of minority group and women representatives. Requires that applications for grants under this Act include assurances that funds under such grant will be used only for a second career program, for individuals aged 40 and over. States that second career programs shall include: (1) a search and inventory of all jobs currently available in the jurisdiction to be served, (2) a detailed plan for special outreach and promotion efforts to locate individuals eligible for assistance under this plan, (3) screening and appraisal procedures to meet the needs and abilities of individuals eligible to participate in the program, (4) job-matching services, (5) job referral, trial work experience, and placement services, and (6) special counseling services and techniques. Sets forth conditions and limitations on expenditure of grant funds for wages and fringe benefits for participants in the program. Directs the Secretary to conduct research which will develop data, information, and conclusions to help unemployed and underemployed individuals aged 40 and over to enter, reenter, remain, and advance in the labor force. Requires the Secretary to submit an annual report to the Congress on the implementation of this Act."
