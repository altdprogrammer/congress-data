Requires that to the maximum extent feasible programs conducted under this Act be linked to work and training programs conducted pursuant to the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973. States that assistance shall be provided, to the maximum extent feasible, for a minimum period of three years. Requires the Director of the Office to conduct necessary studies to assess the effectiveness of the programs and to keep appropriate Congressional committees fully informed.
