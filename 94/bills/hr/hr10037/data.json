    "text": "Solid Waste Energy and Resource Recovery Act - Sets forth the findings of Congress that there is a demand for new fuel sources in the United States; that fuels can be produced from solid waste, but that research into such fuel production is not coordinated at this time and that local municipal governments now bear the largest portion of the cost of such research; and that, therefore, there is a need for a federally coordinated program to provide State, regional, and local communities with assistance in developing solid waste energy and resource recovery systems and technology. Defines terms added by this Act to the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency: (1) to assist with research projects for the development of pilot plant facilities for the purpose of investigating new fuels, recovery methods, or technology; (2) to conduct demonstrations of new methods and technology; and (3) to test and evaluate such pilot plants and demonstration projects. Directs the Administrator to establish a program for the collection and dissemination of information to assist Federal, State, interstate, regional, and local agencies in planning and building solid waste collection, recycling and recovery facilities. Sets forth specific areas to be covered by such program. Requires the Administrator to make grants to State, interstate, municipal and intermunicipal agencies for: (1) the implementation of solid waste management plans and planning programs; (2) the development and revision of solid waste disposal plans as part of regional environmental protection systems; (3) the development of interlocal regions and establishment of regional agencies; (4) the development of proposals for specified projects; and (5) the planning of programs for the removal and processing of abandoned motor vehicle bulks. Authorizes the Administrator to guarantee loans incurred by States, regional, or local government agencies to finance the construction of large-scale fuel, energy, or resource recovery facilities. Limits the total outstanding indebtedness allowed under this Act to $75,000,000. Sets forth procedures for applying for loan guarantees under this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to a State, regional authority or local government agency for the construction, operation, or maintenance of fuel, energy or resource recovery facilities when such facilities cannot be financed by any other means. Limits the amount of each such grant to 25 percent of the total cost of the project. Authorizes appropriations for the purposes of this Act."
