    "text": "Crime Control Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to entitle States to Federal grants for law enforcement purposes only if the required comprehensive State plans include provisions for improving the availability and quality of justice, developing programs designed to prevent crime against the elderly, and evaluating all law enforcement programs funded under such Act. Directs the National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice to assist State planning agencies in their evaluation functions under such Act and to disseminate information about law enforcement programs successfully implemented. Directs the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to make grants to local government units having a population of 250,000 or more which demonstrate a high incidence of violent crime. Extends the authorization for the continuation of programs under such Act through fiscal year 1977. Specifies subjects to be included in the Administration's annual report to the President and Congress, including the amounts expended for each component of the criminal justice system, the number of State plans approved and disapproved, successful and unsuccessful, the number of programs discontinued, and the procedures used in evaluating programs. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as are necessary, within specified limitations, for fiscal years 1976 and 1977 to carry out the provisions of such Act."
