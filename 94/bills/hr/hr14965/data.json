Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a management program to coordinate solid waste research and development activities. Directs the Administrator to make special studies and reports on (1) resource recovery from glass and plastic waste; (2) potential utility of future components of the solid waste stream; (3) promising techniques of energy recovery from solid waste; (4) systems of small-scale solid waste management; (5) compatibility of front-end source separation systems with high technology resource recovery systems; (6) solid waste from mining; (7) sludge; (8) discarded motor vehicle tires; (9) economics of resource recovery; (10) environmental, social, economic, and other impacts of alternative waste reduction systems; and (11) hazards to aviation caused by birds congregating on landfill sites near airports. Directs the Administrator to collect and coordinate information on solid waste, resource recovery, and management practices, to be housed in a central reference library. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants for the construction and operation of full-scale demonstration facilities. Directs the Administrator to establish an Intra-Agency Coordinating Committee to promote coordination of research goals with regulatory functions within the Environmental Protection Agency. Authorizes the appropriation of $35,000,000 for fiscal year 1978 to carry out the additional authority granted by this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1978 and 1979 for the special studies authorized by this Act. Requires disclosure of known financial interests by employees or officials of the Environmental Protection Agency where such interests are in any person or corporation applying for assistance under the Solid Waste Disposal Act."
