Requires the President to undertake a comprehensive review of all Federal disaster loan authorities and to report to the Congress concerning the most effective and efficient delivery of disaster relief.

Provides that any such guarantee may be made or effected either directly or in cooperation with any qualified surety company or other qualified company through a participation agreement with such a company. Permits the Administration to fix a uniform annual fee for any guarantee issued under this title and to require that measures be followed in connection with the guarantee of rentals in order to minimize financial risk assumed by the guarantee.
