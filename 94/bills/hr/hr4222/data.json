    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 94-474) National School Lunch Act and Child Nutrition Act Amendments - Extends indefinitely the authorization for appropriations for the school breakfast program under the Child Nutrition Act. States that as a matter of national policy the breakfast program should be made available in all schools where it is needed and requires that the Secretary of Agriculture carry out a program of information to implement this policy. Waives the matching requirement under the National School Lunch Act with respect to the amount of general food assistance payments received by a State with respect to free or reduced price lunches. Provides that the level of State revenues required to be appropriated or utilized specifically for program purposes for any fiscal year could not be reduced, but would be computed without regard to such waiver. Directs the establishment, in cooperation with State education agencies, of procedures designed to diminish waste of foods served by schools participating in the school lunch program. States that high school students shall not be required to accept foods, under this Act, which they do not intend to consume. Provides that any child eligible for a reduced price lunch under income guidelines prescribed for schools in a particular State shall be served a reduced price lunch. States that, beginning with fiscal year 1976, the income guidelines prescribed by each State educational agency for reduced price lunches shall be 95 percent above the applicable family size income levels in the income poverty guidelines prescribed by the Secretary, and any child who is a member of a household if that household has an annual income which falls between the applicable family size income level of the income guidelines for free lunches and 95 percent above the applicable family size income levels in the income poverty guidelines prescribed by the Secretary shall be served a reduced price lunch at a price not to exceed 20 cents. Requires that the Secretary, by June 1 of each fiscal year, issue revised income poverty guidelines for use during the subsequent 12-month period. States that any child who is a member of a household which has an annual income not above the applicable family-size income level set forth in the income poverty guidelines prescribed by the Secretary shall be served a free lunch. Requires local school authorities to announce income guidelines on the opening of school each fiscal year, and make determinations with respect to the annual incomes of any household solely on the basis of a statement executed in such form as the Secretary may prescribe, provided that the local school authorities may for cause seek verification of the data in such application. States that no physical segregation of or other discrimination against any child eligible for a free lunch or a reduced price lunch shall be made by the school nor shall there be any overt identification of any child by special tokens or tickets, announced or published list of names, or by other means. Requires that any child of a parent or guardian who is the principal support of such child and is unemployed shall be served a free lunch during such time within the period of unemployment if the parent's or guardian's income falls within the income criteria for free lunches. Revises the definition of \"school\" contained in the National School Lunch Act to include public or licensed nonprofit private residential child care institutions. Extends the authority to purchase commodities for child nutrition programs and for programs for the elderly, when acquisitions under agricultural authorities are not available. Requires purchases of cereal, shortening and oil products. Allows a State which phased out its commodity distribution facilities prior to June 30, 1974, to elect to receive cash payments in lieu of donated foods for its child nutrition programs. Authorizes a summer food service program for children through September 30, 1977 and provides for payment to service institutions of the full cost of obtaining, preparing, and serving food and related administrative costs. Extends the special supplemental food (WIC) program through September 30, 1977, and requires the program to be made available to pregnant or lactating women and to infants, under five years, determined to be eligible for competent professionals because of inadequate nutrition and inadequate income. Authorizes an appropriation of $250,000,000 for such program for each fiscal year through 1978. Establishes a National Advisory Council on Maternal, Infant, and Fetal Nutrition, to be composed of State and local program officials, parent recipients, medical specialists, a food retail sales person, and Department of Agriculture and Department of Health, Education, and Welfare specialists in health and nutrition. Authorizes the appropriation of necessary funds to carry out a child care food program. Requires the Secretary to make payments to State educational agencies no less frequently than on a monthly basis in amounts obtained by application of the formula set forth in this Act. Requires that meals served under the program consist of a combination of foods and meet nutritional requirements prescribed by the Secretary. Changes the definition of \"school\" in the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to include public or licensed nonprofit private residential child care institutions. Permits the amount of commodity donations for a State for child day care centers to include an amount for suppers, as well as lunches. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a study to determine how the States are utilizing Federal funds provided to them for the administration of the child nutrition programs authorized by this Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, and to determine the level of funds needed by the States for administrative purposes. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on such study by March 1, 1976. Prohibits the Secretary from delaying or withholding, or causing any State to delay or withhold, payments for reimbursement of per-meal costs with respect to school food service programs authorized pursuant to the National School Lunch Act and Child Nutrition Act of 1966 on the basis of noncompliance with full cost accounting procedures unless and until he studies the additional personnel and training needs of States, local school districts, and schools resulting from the imposition of a requirement to implement full cost accounting procedures. Directs the Secretary to make cash grants to State educational agencies for the purpose of conducting experimental or demonstration projects to teach schoolchildren the nutritional value of foods and the relationship of nutrition to human health."
