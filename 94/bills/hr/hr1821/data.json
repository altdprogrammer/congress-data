    "text": "Overseas Citizens Voting Rights Act - Expresses the Congressional declarations that it is necessary to: (1) abolish for citizens residing overseas the domicile and residence requirements as preconditions to voting in Federal elections, and (2) establish standards relating to absentee registration and balloting by such citizens in federal elections. Provides that no citizen residing overseas shall be denied the right to register for, and to vote by an absentee ballot in, any Federal election solely because he is not domiciled and does not have a place of abode in a State or district, if he meets specified requirements. Requires each State to provide for the registration of and casting of absentee ballots by all citizens residing overseas and entitled to vote in a Federal election in such State. Provides that each State shall mail the following by airmail to such citizen; (1) an absentee ballot; (2) instructions concerning voting procedures; and (3) an airmail envelope for the mailing of such ballot. Sets forth the form of the overseas citizen Federal election postcard. States that whoever deprives any person of any right secured by this Act shall be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. Sets forth additional penalties for falsifying registration materials. Provides that the exercise of a right to register or vote by any citizen residing overseas shall not affect the determination of his place or residence or domicile (as distinguished from this place of voting) for purposes of any tax imposed under Federal, State or local law. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Administrator of General Services such sums as are necessary to carry out his duties under this Act."
