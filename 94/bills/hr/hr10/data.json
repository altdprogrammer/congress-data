Requirs that, within six months of the granting of an application for registration, the Commission, or an exchange or the NASD as designated by the Commission, examine the new broker-dealer to determine whether it is operating in conformity with the federal securities laws. Adds armed robbery and grand larceny to the list of statutory offenses which bar a person from becoming a broker-dealer. Requires the Commission, in cooperation with the exchanges and the NASD, to devise and administer a uniform examination which, with respect to partners, officers, and supervisory employees shall include questions relating to enumerated matters.

Empowers the Commission to prescribe rules with respect to the form or format of securities issued by companies, any class of whose securities is registered under the Act, or which would be required to be so registered except for the exemption from registration provided for securities of registered investment companies or insurance companies under certain conditions. Directs every issuer whose securities are registered on a national securities exchange to consolidate in a single person the functions of transfer agent and registrar. Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to conduct a study to consider the public policy implications of the growing practice of registering securities in \"street name\" and to determine whether steps can be taken to facilitate communications between corporations and their shareholders while, at the same time, retaining benefits of such registration.

Title VI: Development of a National Securities Market System - Directs the Commission to establish a national market system for transactions in securities.
