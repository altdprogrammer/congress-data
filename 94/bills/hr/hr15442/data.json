    "text": "Surface Transportation Procedural Reform Act - Amends the Interstate Commerce Act to make specified Interstate Commerce Commission procedures currently applying to railroads applicable to other surface common carriers. Changes the name of the Office of Rail Public Counsel established under the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act to the Office of Public Counsel. Revises the duties and authority of such Counsel to include proceedings before the Commission involving all surface common carriers subject to economic regulation under specified titles of the Interstate Commerce Act. Renames the Rail Services Planning Office established under the Regional Rail Reorganization Act as the Transportation Services Planning Office and expands the duties of such Office to include the evaluation of all the surface transportation needs of the United States. Eliminates the present requirement that at least 30 days expire before certain orders of the Interstate and Commerce Commission may go into effect."
