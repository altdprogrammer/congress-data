Directs the Federal Power Commission to prohibit any interruption or curtailment of natural gas and to take such other steps as are necessary to assure as soon as possible the availability in interstate commerce of sufficient quantities of natural gas for use as a raw material feedstock or process fuel in the production of fertilizer, animal feed grade chemicals, essential agricultural chemicals, and for use in agricultural crop drying. Defines \"sufficient quantities of natural gas\" for purposes of this Act. Provides that the rule implemented by the Commission shall also apply with respect to the availability of natural gas sold in intrastate commerce in any State which has not, within ninety days, adopted a rule to implement the purposes of the first provision of this Act. Directs the Commission to, by rule, prohibit boiler fuel use of natural gas in interstate and intrastate commerce not contracted for prior to the date of enactment of this Act by users other than residential or small commercial users unless, upon petition by a user, the Commission determines that enumerated criteria are met."
