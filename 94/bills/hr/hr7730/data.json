States that seed of a variety for which an application for a certificate or a certificate of plant variety protection under the Plant Variety Protection Act specifies sale only as a class of certified seed shall be certified only when: (1) the basic seed from which the seed was produced was furnished by authority of the owner of the variety if the seed is certified while the application is pending or during the term of protection, and (2) it conforms to the number of generations designated by the application or certificate, if the application or certificate contains such a designation."
