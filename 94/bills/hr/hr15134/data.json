I)) =Title I: Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act= - Amends the Public Buildings Act of 1959 and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to require the Administrator of General Services, when acquiring or managing space necessary for Federal agencies, to: (1) utilize space in buildings of historic, architectural, or cultural significance where feasible; (2) encourage the location of commercial, cultural, educational, or recreational activities within or near public buildings; and (3) encourage the public use of public buildings outside of regular Federal working hours. Requires the Administrator to place on the access level of Federal buildings those activities requiring regular public contact. =Title II=: Directs the United States Postal Service, in consultation with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, to prescribe such standards for the design, construction, and alteration of its buildings to insure whenever possible that physically handicapped persons will have ready access to, and use of, such buildings. Requires the Administrator to report annually to Congress with respect to his activities and those of other departments with regard to standards issued, revised, repealed, or waived under the Act to insure that certain buildings financed with Federal funds are so designed and constructed as to be accessable to the physically handicapped. Requires the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board to report annually to the Public Works and Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives and the Public Works Committee of the Senate on its actions to insure compliance with Federal standards designed to make public buildings accessible to the handicapped."
