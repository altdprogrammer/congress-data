Provides for the compensation and staffing of the Office of Special Prosecutor. States that the Special Prosecutor has exclusive jurisdiction to investigate and to prosecute in the name of the United States: (1) all offenses or allegations of offenses arising out of the conduct of domestic intelligence or counterintelligence activities within the United States by the Central Intelligence Agency or any other law enforcement agency of the Federal Government; (2) all violations or suspected violations of any Federal statute by any intelligence or law enforcement agency of the Federal Government or by any persons on their behalf, such as surreptitious entries, wiretapping, or illegal opening of the United States mail; and (3) such related matters which he consents to have assigned to him by the Attorney General of the United States. Provides that all files, records, documents, and other materials in the possession or control of the Department of Justice, or any other department or agency of Government, which relate to matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Special Prosecutor appointed under this Act, are transferred to the Special Prosecutor as of the date on which he takes office. Authorizes the Special Prosecutor to request from any department or agency of Government any additional files or other materials which he may deem necessary to the conduct of his duties under this Act. Stipulates that the Office of Special Prosecutor shall terminate three years after the date the panel first appoints a Special Prosecutor. Requires the Speical Prosecutor to make as full and complete a report of the activities of his office as is appropriate to the panel, to the Attorney General of the United States, and to the Congress, on the first and second anniversaries of his taking office and not later than thirty days after the termination of the Office of Special Prosecutor. Grants the panel exclusive jurisdiction to remove the Special Prosecutor. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
