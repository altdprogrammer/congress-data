    "text": "State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act Amendments - Allows the use of funds to State and local governments under the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 for nonpriority expenditures and for projects which the Federal Government will provide additional matching funds. Authorizes appropriations to the National Trust Fund under such Act in amounts as follows: (1) for the period July 1, 1976, to September 30, 1976, $1,625,000,000; (2) for fiscal 1977, $6,537,500,000; (3) for fiscal 1978, $6,687,500,000; (4) for fiscal 1979, $6,837,500,000; (5) for fiscal 1980, $6,987,500,000; (6) for fiscal 1981, $7,137,500,000; and (7) for fiscal 1982, $7,287,500,000. Authorizes to be appropriated to such trust fund additional amounts for the same years for the noncontiguous States adjustment payments authorized by such Act. Exempts all revenue sharing funds from the new spending restrictions of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Authorizes to be appropriated in addition to such amounts beginning October 1, 1976, for each of the next 20 calendar quarters an amount equal to $125,000,000 plus $62,500,000 multiplied by the number of one-half percentage points by which the rate of national unemployment exceeds six percent. Provides that such additional funds must be distributed to the State and local governments which experience unemployment in excess of six percent. Provides formula for use by the Secretary of the Treasury to distribute such funds to such State and local governments in proportion to the amount of unemployment in such jurisdictions that exceeds six percent. Prohibits such additional amounts from being appropriated if the national unemployment rate does not exceed six percent. Requires the Comptroller General to study the impact such supplemental grants have on the operation of State and local governments and on the national economy and to report the results of such study within two years. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office and the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations to conduct a study to determine the most effective means by which the Federal Government can stabilize the national economy during periods of high inflation and to report their findings within two years. Requires that governments receiving revenue sharing funds must report to the Federal Government each year summarizing anticipated revenues and expenditures for the coming year. Requires such jurisdictions to publicize the receipt and proposed expenditure of such revenue sharing funds 90 days before the start of such recipient government's fiscal period and to hold public hearings concerning such expenditures. Places primary authority for investigating cases of alleged discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or sex in those agencies charged with enforcement of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Authorizes the Secretary to inform the Governor of the affected State where cases of discrimination are found. Withholds revenue sharing funds from any State which fails to cease such discrimination. Provides for hearings and judicial review to determine compliance with the nondiscrimination requirements of this Act. Eliminates the present requirement to establish local trust funds in which recipient governments must deposit revenue sharing funds."
