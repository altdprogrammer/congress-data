Stipulates that no loan or grant shall be made unless the National Institute of Corrections determines that: (1) offenders shall receive wages at a rate not less than similar workers in the locality; (2) any products or services may be sold just as if non-offenders provided them; (3) the offenders are likely by reason of their involvement in such projects to find employment following their release; (4) benefits, such as unemployment compensation, are available to offenders and non-offenders alike; and (5) deductions from gross wages shall not exceed 80 percent of gross wages. Authorizes annual appropriations to the fund to make its income not less than $10,000,000 in any fiscal year. Provides for the monitoring and evaluation of any project entered into pursuant to this Act by the Comptroller General of the National Institute of Corrections."
