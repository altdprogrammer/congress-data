    "text": "United States Grain Standards Act Amendments - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to hire, without regard to the regulations governing appointments in the competitive service, as official inspection personnel, any individual licensed to perform functions of official inspection under the United States Grain Standards Act. Permits the Secretary to require the periodic rotation of Federal and State official grain inspection personnel. Includes, as a prohibited act under the United States Grain Standards Act, the deceptive weighing of grain. Requires all scales used for weighing grain in commerce to automatically stamp the correct weight of grain weighed on a receipt or a ticket which shall be made immediately available to both buyer and seller. Directs the Secretary to provide for the registration with the Secretary of all persons engaged in the buying for sale, the handling, the weighing, or the transporting of grain for sale in interstate or foreign commerce as a prerequisite to doing business. Sets forth specified exceptions to the registration requirement. Provides for the criminal prosecution of an individual who registers falsely or who deals in grain without being registered. Provides for the revocation of registration for violations of the regulations governing grain dealings. Sets forth prohibitions for official inspection personnel with respect to conflicts of interest. Requires grain dealers registered pursuant to this Act to maintain specified records of all transactions relating to grain deals. Makes it a prohibited act to knowingly add any foreign material to grain which would change its character or test weight. Increases the fine and term of imprisonment for commission of the prohibited acts enumerated in the United States Grain Standards Act. Provides for the treatment of the murder or manslaughter of any Federal or State official inspection personnel under the Federal law governing murder and manslaughter. Authorizes the Secretary to designate a State agency to carry out official inspections under this Act. Requires such inspections to meet the same standards as those imposed by Federal inspection personnel. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations requiring all foreign material in grain to be considered dockage items, as defined in this Act. Requires the Secretary to promulgate instructions governing the testing of the protein content of wheat. Directs the establishment of grades of wheat to assure: (1) that the production, conservation, and delivery of high grade grain will be rewarded; and (2) that in a normal year for each kind and class of United States grain, there is a grade which is competitive in reputation for quality in the world market."
