    "text": "Energy Conservation Act - Title I: Truth In Energy - Federal Trade Commission Act - Provides for the disclosure of the annual operating cost of major energy consuming products and systems, so that consumers can readily compare them and thereby avoid purchasing those which unnecessarily waste energy. Requires the National Bureau of Standards to identify those products which are major energy consuming household products and to devise a procedure for estimating the annual operating costs of such products. Requires the Federal Trade Commission to establish model calculation procedures for use by suppliers in determining the estimated annual operating costs of climate conditioning systems. Provides that the disclosure of the annual operating cost estimate must appear in the same place as the purchase price on the article. Title II: Automobile Fuel Economy Standards - Automobile Fuel Economy Act - Declares it to be the purpose of the Congress to encourage the development, manufacture, and sale of automobiles which are more economical to operate in terms of the amount of fuel consumed per mile traveled, and increase the industry-wide average fuel economy for new automobiles by at least 75 percent by 1984 in comparson to the industry-wide average fuel economy for new automobiles in 1974. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish a minimum fuel economy standard for new automobiles introduced into commerce during and after the 1978 model year. States that such a standard shall represent the first step in a progression toward achievement of the national purpose stated in this Act. Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress no later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this title a plan for achieving the national purpose set forth in this Act. Provides for judicial review in a United States Court of Appeals of regulations promulgated in furtherance of such a plan by any person who may be adversely affected by such a regulation. States that, no later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this title, each manufacturer shall cause to be affixed and each dealer shall cause to be maintained on each new automobile, in a prominent place, a sticker indicating the fuel economy and the estimated average annual fuel costs associated with the operation of such automobile. Requires the information regarding fuel economy and average annual fuel cost be a conspicuous part of any advertisement for new automobiles which mentions purchase price or acquisition cost of such automobiles. Defines prohibited conduct and unfair trade practices under this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated to carry out the purposes of this title not more than $3,000,000 annually for fiscal years 1976, 1977, and 1978. Title III: Automotive Research and Development - Automotive Transport Research and Development Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to make grants for, and support through loan guarantees, research and development leading to production prototypes of an advanced automobile or automobiles within four years from the date of enactment of this title and to secure the certification after testing of those prototypes which are likely to meet the Nation's long-term goals with respect to fuel economy, environmental protection, motor vehicle safety, and other objectives; and to interpret and carry out this title to preserve, enhance, and facilitate competition in research, development, and production of existing and alternative automobiles and automobile components. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Secretary not more than $50,000,000 to pay the interest on, and the principal balance of, any obligation guaranteed by the Secretary as to which the obligor has defaulted. Provides that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall test each production prototype of an automobile developed in whole or in part with Federal assistance under this Act. States that the Low-Emission Vehicle Certification Board shall, upon application by a developer or by the Secretary and the receipt of test data and test results, issue or deny certification as an advanced automobile. Authorizes to be appropriated to carry out the purposes of this title not more than $15,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1976, 1977, and 1978."
