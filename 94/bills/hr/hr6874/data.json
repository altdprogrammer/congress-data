Rept. 94-505) Authorizes the use of loan funds, under the Small Reclamation Projects Act, for the purchase of existing facilities that may be useful in a water resource development plan, provided that the cost of such existing facilities represents less than 50 percent of the cost of the project. Provides that the maximum allowable estimated total project cost of a proposal submitted during any given calendar year shall be determined by the Secretary of the Interior using the Bureau of Reclamation composite construction cost index. Permits increases in existing loans to cover the escalation in construction costs. Allows the maximum loan or grant under such Act to be two-thirds of the maximum project cost. Authorizes $400,000,000 in appropriations for the small projects program."
