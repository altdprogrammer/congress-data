    "text": "Equal Educational Opportunities Amendments - Declares that involuntary transportation of students, except in special and limited circumstances, is undesirable, unwise, and counterproductive in attempting to assure equal educational opportunity and equal protection of the laws to all students. Amends the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 to require a three judge court in all actions brought in which the relief sought involves the involuntary transportation of students. Prohibits such courts from ordering the involuntary transportation of students except to the extent that present patterns of assignment of students to public schools are based on race in violation of constitutional or statutory rights. Directs such three judge panels, when ruling in involuntary student transportation actions, to include in their orders or decisions specific findings of fact on the adequacy or inadequacy of alternatives to forced busing, the probable effects of such busing on the quality of education in the district, and its effect on desegregation through shifts in the racial composition of the school district. Requires that the supervision of any courts order regarding the transportation of students be conducted by a panel of three judges. Specifies procedures for designation of panel members. Extends authorizations for appropriations under the Emergency School Aid Act until September 30, 1978, and lists percentages of amounts to be reserved for specified uses under such Act."
