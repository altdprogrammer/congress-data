Increases the amount of pensions for veterans with non-service-connected disabilities. Provides that when a veteran with a non-service-connected disability, who is ineligible for a pension solely for the reason that his annual income exceeds the maximum income limitation, is in need of aid and attendance he shall be entitled to an allowance not to exceed specified amounts. Increases the amount of non-service-connected disability pensions by 25 percent when the veteran reaches the age of 80. Changes the amounts by which the pensions of widows and children are reduced in relation to the survivor's income. =Title III: Dependency and Indemnity Compensation for Parents= - Increases the maximum income limitations for dependency and indemnity compensation for parents of veterans. =Title IV: Miscellaneous and Effective Date Provisions= - Authorizes the head of any Federal agency or department to provide such information to the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs as he needs to determine the eligibility of individuals for veterans' benefits. Directs the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, not later than October 1, 1977, to submit to the President and Congress a study of the adequacy of the present pension program and the necessity and feasibility of its reform. States that titles II and III of this Act shall take effect January 1, 1977."
