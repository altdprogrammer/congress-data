    "text": "Comprehensive Right-to-Quality Medical Care Act - Requires that any Federal officer or agency proposing any health care regulation submit such regulation to each House of Congress together with a report containing a full explanation thereof. Allows either House of Congress to keep the proposed regulation from becoming effective by adopting a resolution disapproving the regulation because: (1) it contains provisions contrary to law; (2) it is inconsistent with the intent of Congress; or (3) it goes beyond the mandate of the legislation which it is designed to implement or in the administration of which it is designed to be used. Establishes rules for the consideration of any resolution regarding such proposed regulations. Requires the head of any Federal agency or department, at least 60 days prior to the initial publication of any health cost regulation, to submit notice of intended publication and the text of such regulation to the appropriate committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Amends the Social Security Act to repeal specified Medicare utilization review provisions, specified utilization review provisions and maternal and child health programs, and specified professional standards review provisions. Guarantees the confidentiality of medical records of any patient whose medical or dental care is not paid by the Federal Government, under a Federal program, or by any program receiving Federal financial assistance, unless such patient has authorized such disclosure."
