Requires that a hearing be held before a parent can be deemed ineligible for benefits under such program because of failure to cooperate. Abolishes the locater service. Revises the procedure for locating a parent. Specifies additional circumstances in which voluntary support payments shall be made directly to the family rather than assigned to the State."
