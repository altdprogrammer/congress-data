States that such funds shall be used for the following purposes: (1) 25 percent for consumer education programs designed to provide consumers with information on the handling, purchasing, and preparation of fish and shellfish products; (2) 25 percent to promote the free flow of domestically produced fishery products into normal trade channels; and (3) 50 percent to be placed in a special reserve for the direct purchasing of fish and shellfish products when it is determined that a market glut exists which deters the free flow of fishery products into normal trade channels. Sets forth provisions regulating such direct purchasing when the Secretary of Commerce determines that it is in the best interests of the fishing industry, the general economy, and consumers."
