Grants the Council authority to intervene in rulemaking, ratemaking, licensing, and other proceedings in order to present its views as to the inflationary impact which might possibly result from such proceedings. Extends the life of the Council to September 30, 1977, and authorizes appropriations of $1,700,000 per fiscal year."
