    "text": "Emergency Health Insurance Extension Act - Title I: Continuation of Employment - Based Health Insurance Coverage for the Unemployed - States that any individual who (1) is entitled to receive compensation for any week under a State or Federal unemployment compensation law, and (2) would be covered under an employment-based health insurance plan in such week through his most recent previous employment if such employment had not been terminated or discontinued, shall be entitled as a former employee to continued coverage under such plan without additional cost for the month or months during which such week or any part thereof falls. Specifies requirements consistent with the provisions of this act applicable to employers and carriers in order to maintain full deductibility (for income tax purposes) of any payments or contributions to employee health insurance plans. Title II: Temporary Health Insurance Protection for the Currently Unemployed - Provides that persons unemployed during emergency periods shall be entitled to coverage under employee health insurance plans, if they meet the requirements for coverage imposed under Title I. Creates on the books of the Treasury of the United States the Federal Emergency Health Insurance Trust Fund to be funded by the proceeds from the one percent tax imposed on health insurance premiums under this Act, to be paid by the carrier. Title III: Tax Provisions Applicable in Case of Nonparticipation by Employers or Carriers - Reduces by one-half the deduction otherwise allowable to employers for payments to employee health insurance plans if the plan does not call for continued coverage of such employers during periods of unemployment as required by this Act. Denies any deduction whatsoever to carriers for the one-percent tax imposed on health insurance carriers if the plan does not comply with this act. Denies tax-exempt status to both employers and carriers not offering employee health insurance plans in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - Defines terms used in the Act. Makes required technical amendments. Authorizes the President to provide for the administration of this Act."
