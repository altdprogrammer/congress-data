Provides that in any action alleging that the inclusion or enforcement of any of the provisions of this Act (with respect to the granting of any rights) is a violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act or any of the Antitrust Acts, the Commission or any court may apply the Federal Trade Commission Act or any of the Antitrust Acts on any basis other than a per se basis that the Commission or the court deems appropriate. Stipulates that the provisions of this Act shall become effective six months after the Commission submits to Congress a report with respect to the effects of exclusive territorial and customer arrangements."
