    "text": "Airport and Airway Development Act - Declares that financial assistance from the Federal Government is necessary to provide the required incentive to States and airport owners to meet the needs of aviation. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to conduct studies respecting: (1) the feasibility, practicality and cost of performing land bank planning and development for future and existing airports through Federal, State, or local government action; and, (2) the examination of potential locations in the United States for major new airports and the identification of various options for financing land acquisition and development costs. Authorizes appropriations for such studies. Authorizes the Secretary to incur obligations through September 30, 1980, to make grants for airport development projects, airport system planning, air way facilities, and research and development planning for safety in air navigation. Sets forth regulations for the apportionment and distribution of such grants. Sets forth airport development project requirements. Establishes the United States share of project costs at 80 percent for sponsors of air carrier and air reliever airports and 90 percent for sponsors of general aviation airports. Provides that whenever the Secretary determines that use of any lands owned or controlled by the United States is reasonably necessary for carrying out a project for airport development under this Act, or for the operation of any public airport, including lands reasonably necessary to meet future development of an airport, he shall file with the head of the department or agency having control of the lands a request that the necessary property interests therein be conveyed to the public agency sponsoring the project in question or owning or controlling the airport. Provides that, if the department or agency head determines that the requested conveyance is not inconsistent with the needs of that department or agency, the department or agency head is hereby authorized and directed, with the approval of the Attorney General of the United States, and without any expense to the United States, to perform any acts and to execute any instruments necessary to make the conveyance requested. Provides for the termination and settlement of all existing agreements between airport sponsors and the United States Government regarding grants, deeds and instruments of conveyance by September 30, 1980. Provides for punishment of up to 5 years in prison, or a fine of up to $10,000, or both, for any officer, agent, or employee of the United States, or any officer, agency, or employee of any public agency, or any person, association, firm, or corporation who, with intent to defraud the United States: (1) knowingly makes any false statement or false representation in any report, certification or representation required to be made under this Act; or (2) knowingly makes any false statement, false representation, or false report as to the character, quality, quantity, or cost of the material used or to be performed, or the costs thereof, in connection with the submission of plans, maps, specifications, contracts, or estimates of project costs for any project submitted to the Secretary for approval under this Act; or (3) knowingly makes any false statement, false representation, or false report or claim for work or materials for any project approved by the Secretary under this Act."
