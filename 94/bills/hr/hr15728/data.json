    "text": "Elementary and Secondary Education Optional Consolidation and Reorganization Act - Declares it the purpose of this Act to afford States the option of consolidating and reorganizing specified programs of assistance to State and local educational agencies for elementary, secondary, vocational, and adult education into three broad categories: (1) special educational needs programs; (2) vocational education programs; and (3) special emphasis projects. Title I: Special Needs Program - Requires each State which desires to consolidate Federal educational aid programs under this Act to include the following in its comprehensive consolidation plan: (1) a program designed to address the special educational needs of educationally deprived children in local education agencies having high concentrations of children from low-income families, of neglected and delinquent children in State-operated programs, and of children in adult correctional institutions; (2) a program designed to provide comprehensive health, educational, nutritional, social, and other similar services primarily for children from low-income families; (3) a program designed to address the special educational needs of children of migratory agricultural workers and of migratory fishermen; (4) a program designed to provide and establish standards for specified educational programs for handicapped children; (5) a program of instruction designed for children of limited English-speaking ability; and (6) a program of bilingual vocational training. Requires every agency operating educational programs for the handicapped which is to receive assistance under this Act to establish and maintain procedures to assure safeguards to handicapped children and their parents with respect to the provision of appropriate free public education. Sets forth guidelines for the distribution of the funds received by the States for each program required under this title. Title II: Vocational, Adult and Continuing Education and Employment Training - Requires each State which does not have a separate State agency for vocational education and desires to participate in the consolidation program authorized by this Act to include specified programs in its comprehensive consolidation plan, including: (1) a program designed to improve existing and develop new programs of vocational education; (2) a program to provide part-time employment for youths who need the earnings from such employment to continue their vocational training on a full-time basis; (3) a program to provide vocational education to persons who are handicapped and persons who have limited English-speaking ability; and (4) a program to meet the needs for adult basic education and to plan and operate community education projects. Authorizes each State to include in its comprehensive plan a program to provide the education program portion of the manpower services program under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act. Sets forth guidelines to the distribution of the funds received by States for programs under this title. Title III: Special Emphasis Projects - Requires each State desiring to participate in the consolidation program authorized by this Act to include in its comprehensive plan a program to provide services and make grants to local educational agencies for the acquisition of printed materials and instructional equipment and for the development of specified guidance, innovation, curricula improvement, health services, and support project programs. Sets forth guidelines for the distribution of funds received by States under this title. Title IV: General Provisions - Directs the Commissioner of Education to reserve from amounts appropriated for fiscal years 1978-82 to carry out programs which may be consolidated under this Act such sums as are necessary to make allotments to States which choose to consolidate such plans for programs under their respective comprehensive plans. Sets forth formulae to determine the amount of such allotments. Extends planning grants to States desiring to participate in the consolidation program authorized by this Act to assist such States in the preparation of consolidated plans. Details administrative prerequisites for receiving such grants. Directs the Commissioner to make payments for administration of State consolidation programs. Requires each State to establish procedures in developing its comprehensive State plan which are designed to assure specified administrative safeguards and flexibility. Lists additional requirements relative to such plans. Directs the Commissioner to make supplemental grants to States participating in the consolidation program the proceeds of which are to flow through to local educational agencies or be used in programs administered by the State which provide direct services to students. Requires (1) each State participating in the consolidation program to adopt an evaluation model by which to assess the effectiveness of such consolidation and (2) each local education agency to prepare and submit annual evaluation reports in accordance with the State model. Directs the Commissioner to conduct a monitoring program in each State participating in the consolidation program and to carry out a program of making grants to such States for the purpose of interstate cooperation. Requires the consolidation program authorized by this Act to be administered by a separate identifiable unit to be established by the Commissioner in the Office of Education. Directs the Commissioner to reduce or stop payments to States which fail to comply with specified requirements of this Act. Permits States which are not satisfied with the Commissioner's actions to have such action reviewed in a United States court of appeals. Permits funds paid to a State under this Act to be made available for construction of facilities for which funds would have been available under any program consolidated in this Act. Subjects funds made available under this Act to specified provisions prohibiting discrimination in the administration of federally-assisted programs. Requires that certain children enrolled in private nonprofit or in Indian tribal elementary or secondary schools be given an opportunity to participate on an equitable basis in activities assisted under this Act."
