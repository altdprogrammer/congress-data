Sets forth the types of projects eligible for assistance under this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated for purposes of this Act for fiscal year 1976, $8,500,000,000. Provides that a project may not be approved under this Act unless such project: (1) meets a genuine local need; (2) provides for the employment of unemployed individuals; (3) pays the prevailing wage for individuals employed in similar occupations by the same employer under the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act; (4) requires no employment for more than 30 hours per week; and (5) employs a work force that would be at least 50 percent union. Provides that no funds shall be obligated for new projects under this Act in any county in which the rate of unemployment falls below 6 percent for three consecutive months, as determined by the Secretary."
