    "text": "Energy Conservation and Oil Policy Act - Title I: Findings, Purpose, and Definitions - Sets forth congressional findings and purposes with respect to this Act and defines the terms used in the Act. Title II: Standby Energy Authorities and National Civilian Strategic Petroleum Reserve - Authorizes the President to promulgate energy conservation plans, except that such plans may not impose gasoline rationing or any tax, tariff user fee, provide for a minimum price, or provide for a credit or deduction in computing any tax. Provides that such plans shall be subject to congressional approval. Authorizes the President to establish rationing programs pursuant to the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act, and to prevent increases in consumption of motor gasoline above the base volume during the 3-year period beginning on the date of implementation of a mandatory gasoline rationing program under this title. Allows the President to require reductions in consumption under specified circumstances. Authorizes the President to make provision for voluntary agreements among retail operators to reduce inconvenience to motorists in purchasing gasoline during periods when mandatory allocation programs are in effect. Provides for the international allocation of petroleum products to other countries pursuant to the international energy program. Authorizes the making of international voluntary agreements and provides for procedures to achieve the purposes of such program with respect to international allocation. Provides that the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission shall monitor the development and carrying out of such voluntary agreements which shall not be subject to the Federal antitrust laws. Provides administrative safeguards for the exchange of information necessary to carry out the international energy program. Creates, subject to congressional review, a National Civilian Strategic Petroleum Reserve of not more than one billion barrels of petroleum products, such Reserve to be established for the purpose of reducing the impact of disruptions in imports of petroleum products. Creates as part of such Reserve an Early Storage Reserve of not more than 150,000,000 barrels of petroleum products, such Early Storage Reserve to be established for the purpose of providing limited protection from the impact of near term disruptions of imports of petroleum products. Directs the President, within one year after the date of enactment of this Act, to prepare and submit to the Congress a National Civilian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan which details his proposals for designing, constructing, and filling the storage and related facilities of the Reserve. Grants to the President the specific authority required to implement the Plan, including authority to purchase and dispose of petroleum products for the Reserve. Authorizes specific appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act relative to the National Civilian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan. Title III: Measures to Increase Energy Supplies - Provides a formula for computing a ceiling price for a first sale of domestic crude oil to take effect upon imposition of a windfall profits tax on producers. Authorizes the President to require production of oil and gas from designated fields at the maximum efficient rate. Provides for: (1) allocation of and restrictions on the export of materials and equipment found to be scarce, critical, and essential for development and transportation of energy supplies; and (2) construction and maintenance of energy facilities. Title IV: Energy Conservation Measures - Authorizes the President to change regulations issued pursuant to the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act upon a determination that such change will serve the purposes of the Act. Appropriates $2,000,000 for grants to State and local agencies to inform the public with respect to energy conservation grant programs, tax benefits, and inspections of homes and businesses. Provides for the establishment of guidelines for industrial energy conservation by the Federal Energy Administrator. Title V: Improving Energy Efficiency of Consumer Products - Specifies minimum fuel economy performance standards for passenger automobiles for model years 1978, 1979, and 1980. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to determine and establish maximum feasible average fuel economy levels for light-duty trucks and multipurpose passenger vehicles in each model year after model year 1977. Provides for labeling of new automobiles with respect to expected fuel economy. Provides civil penalties for manufacturers failing to meet required fuel economy levels established pursuant to this Act. Directs the Federal Energy Administrator to prescribe test procedures for determining energy use characteristics or energy efficiency (or both) of any class of product using more than 100 kilowatt hours of electricity each year. Authorizes the Administrator to require labeling with respect to energy consumption characteristics (1) major appliances, and (2) under specified circumstances, any product for which determination of consumption characteristics is required. Requires full disclosure of the energy characteristics are a subject of advertisement of such product. Provides for the assessment of civil penalties and issuance of injunctions for violations of the foregoing provisions. Title VI: Conversion from Oil or Gas to Other Fuels - Authorizes the Federal Energy Administrator to prohibit: (1) any major fuel burning installation, other than a powerplant, from burning natural gas or other petroleum products as its primary energy source; and (2) use of natural gas as boiler fuel, such authority to be conditioned on the existence of specified circumstances. Requires new major fuel burning installations to be constructed with a coal-burning capability. Authorizes the Federal Energy Administrator to guarantee loans made to small coal producers for the purpose of opening new underground coal mines which produce low-sulphur coal. Title VII: General Provisions - Provides for the administrative procedure with respect to, and judicial review and enforcement of, this Act, including the assessment of civil penalties for violations of any provision of titles II, III, or IV, or a violation of any rule or order issued pursuant to any such provision. Provides that the authority to issue or enforce any rule or order under this Act shall terminate on June 30, 1985. Specifies the procedure for congressional review of energy action (as defined by this title) taken pursuant to this Act."
