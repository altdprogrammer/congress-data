    "text": "National Vitiligo Control Act - Declares the findings of Congress that vitiligo is a disfiguring, inheritable disease which cripples the personality of individuals suffering from it and which afflicts about three percent of the U.S. population. Provides, under the Public Health Service Act, that the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare shall carry out a program to develop information and educational materials relating to vitiligo and to distribute such information and materials to persons providing health care and to the general public. States that the Secretary may carry out such program through grants to or contracts with public and nonprofit public entities, and authorizes to be appropriated for such purpose $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1975, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1976, and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1977. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to public and nonprofit private entities, and enter into contracts with such entities and with individuals for projects for: (1) research and research training in the diagnosis, treatment, and control of vitiligo; and (2) the development or programs to educate the public concerning the nature and inheritance of the disease. Authorizes to be appropriated for such purposes $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1975, $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1976, and $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1977. States that participation by any person in any program under this Act shall be wholly voluntary. Sets forth requirements for applicants of grants under this Act, including the requirement that all test results, medical records, and other information regarding treatment of any person treated in connection with a project assisted under this Act shall be kept confidential, unless such person consents to the release of such information. Requires the Secretary to prepare and submit to the President for transmittal to Congress, on or before April 1 of 1976, 1977, and 1978 a comprehensive report on the administration of this Act."
