    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1975-10-07", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #599 (302-95)) Construction Industry Collective Bargaining Act - Establishes in the Department of Labor a Construction Industry Collective Bargaining Committee consisting of ten members qualified by experience and affiliation to represent the viewpoint of employers engaged in collective bargaining in the construction industry; ten members qualified by experience and affiliation to represent the viewpoint of the standard national labor organizations in the construction industry; and up to three public members qualified by training or experience to represent the public interest, one of whom shall be designated by the President to serve as Chairman. Provides that where there is in effect a collective bargaining agreement covering employees in the construction industry between a local construction labor organization or other subordinated body affiliated with a standard national construction labor organization, or between a standard national construction labor organization directly, and an employer or association of employers, neither party shall terminate or modify such agreement or the terms or conditions thereof without serving a written notice of the proposed termination or modification in the form and manner prescribed by the Committee 60 days prior to the expiration date. Requires the parties to continue in full force and effect, without resorting to strike or lockout, all the terms and conditions of the existing collective bargaining agreement, whichever occurs later. States that in the event that the Committee has received such notice, it may take jurisdition of the matter by transmitting written notice to the signatory labor organization or organizations and the association or associations of employers directly party to the collective bargaining agreement during a specified period; and that no such party may, at any time prior to the expiration of a 90-day period, engage in any strike or lockout. States that no standard national construction labor organization or national construction contractor association shall have any criminal or civil liability because of a request by the Committee for its participation in collective bargaining negotiation or the approval or refusal to approve a collective bargaining agreement. Provides that such immunity shall not insulate from civil or criminal liability standard national construction labor organizations or national construction contractor associations when the performance of acts under this statute are willfully used to achieve a purpose which they know to be unlawful. Permits the Committee to take action under this Act only if, in its discretion, it believes such action would: (1) facilitate collective bargaining in the construction industry, improvements in the structure of such bargaining, agreements covering more appropriate geographical areas, or agreements more accurately reflecting the condition of various branches of the industry; or (2) promote stability of employment. Authorizes the Committee to promote and assist in the formation of voluntary national craft or branch boards or other appropriate organizations composed of representatives of one or more standard national construction labor organizations and one or more national construction contractor associations for the purpose of attempting to seek resolution of local labor disputes and review collective bargaining policies and developments in the particular craft or branch of the construction industry involved. Makes the failure or refusal to fulfill any obligation imposed by this Act on any labor organization, employer, or association of employers remediable only by a civil action for equitable relief brought by the Committee in a district court of the United States. Authorizes appropriations sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act. Effectuates this Act on the date of its enactment, and its expiration on February 28, 1981. Provides that no later than one year following the date of enactment of this Act, and at one year following the date of enactment of this Act, and at one-year intervals thereafter, the Committee shall transmit to the President and to the Congress a full report of its activities under this Act during the preceding year. Provides that no later than September 1, 1980, the Committee shall transmit to the President and to the Congress a full report on the operation of this Act."
