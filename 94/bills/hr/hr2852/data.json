    "text": "United States Amnesty Commission Act - Establishes the United States Amnesty Commission. Provides that an application for amnesty may be filed with the Commission under this Act not later than January 1, 1980, by any individual who, during the period beginning August 4, 1964, and ending January 1, 1974, violated, or is subject to prosecution for violation of the Military Selective Service Act or other specified provisions of Federal law pertaining to military service. Prohibits the Commission from recommending amnesty or any other action with respect to any applicant unless it has determined that the overriding purpose of such applicant in violating the law was to dissent from the policy of the United States with respect to the Vietnam war. Allows an applicant 90 days in which to appeal Commission determinations. Provides that, upon completion of its determinations with respect to any applicant, the Commission shall submit to the President its recommendations for amnesty (conditional or unconditional) and other appropriate actions to be taken by him with such respect to such applicant. Sets forth the method of selection of the members of the Commission. Permits the Commission to issue subpenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any evidence that relates to any matter under investigation by it. States that any individual filing an application for amnesty who is entitled under this Act to appear before the Commission may not be arrested or prosecuted for any violation described in this Act during: (1) the period beginning 48 hours prior to his first scheduled appearance before the Commission and ending 48 hours after his final appearance before the Commission; and (2) any additional period which the Commission certifies is necessary to facilitate the appearance of such an individual before the Commission. Terminates the Commission on January 1, 1983."
