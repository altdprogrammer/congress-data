Stipulates, that in the event of such disapproval, the rescission or reservation shall cease immediately to the extend disapproved. Declares that the effect of such disapproval shall be to make available for immediate obligation the budget authority involved, and shall preclude the President or any other Federal officer or employee from causing such budget authority to be unobligated pending congressional action with respect to any subsequent proposed rescission or reservation set forth in a special message."
