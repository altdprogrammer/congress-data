    "text": "Provides, under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, that an application for credit shall not be denied on the basis of the race, color, religion, national origin, or age of the applicant. States that the declination of credit on terms offered pursuant to: (1) any loan assistance program expressly authorized by law for an economically disavantaged class of persons; (2) any loan assistance program administered by a nonprofit organization for its members or an economically disadvantaged class of persons; or (3) any special purpose loan program offered by a profitmaking organization to meet special social needs which is specifically approved or meets standards prescribed in regulations, shall not constitute a violation of this Act. Stipulates that: (1) an inquiry by or on behalf of a creditor of the marital status of any applicant is not a violation if the inquiry is to ascertain the creditor's rights and remedies; and (2) a request by or on behalf of a creditor for the signature of both parties to a marriage to create a valid lien, pass clear title, waive inchoate rights to property, or to assign earnings; is not a violation of this Act. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act."
