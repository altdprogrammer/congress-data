Eliminates the requirement imposed by such Act that health maintenance organizations offer annual open enrollment for individual membership. Redesignates medical treatment and referral services for drug or alcohol abuse or addiction and home health services as supplemental health services for purposes of such Act. Enables private entities to obtain federally guaranteed loans for the planning, initial development, and operation of a health maintenance organization to serve populations in addition to medically underserved populations. Includes State and local governmental employers as among those employers which must offer employees the option of membership in a health maintenance organization. Sets forth new procedures, penalties, and other requirements, to be applied by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare where health maintenance organizations are alleged to be in noncompliance with such Act. Extends the authorization of appropriations for programs under such Act an additional two years."
