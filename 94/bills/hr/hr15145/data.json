    "text": "Family Farm Energy Conversion Act - Directs the Administrator of the Rural Electrification Administration of the Department of Agriculture to conduct a study of anaerobic digesters. Defines \"anerobic digester\" as any device whose primary function is to convert animal or vegetable waste products into usable flammable gas, methane, or other gases, or fertilizers. Requires the Administrator to: (1) submit a report regarding the results of such study to the President and the Congress; (2) have printed and make available to the public a brief pamphlet describing no fewer than two models of anaerobic digesters which he considers efficient and safe for operation; (3) institute a pilot project to demonstrate the field performance of optimum anaerobic digesters in at least 100 farms throughout the United States; and (4) issue a report summarizing the results of such trials which shall be presented to the appropriate congressional committees and made available to the public. Authorizes the Administrator, if a pilot project has proved an anaerobic digester to be cost effective and safe, to make grants to farmers owning farms of 640 acres or less for the construction of such digesters. Requires the Administrator to consult with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration at least every six months to determine whether the grant program under this Act is working to the benefit of the small business community. Authorizes appropriations of $8,000,000 for fiscal year 1978 for purposes of this Act."
