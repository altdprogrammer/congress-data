Sets forth the powers and authority of the Board. Directs the Board to transmit annually to the Congress a report, to be known as the Full Employment Report, setting forth a program to achieve full employment for the following fiscal year, and alternative means of attaining that objective, as required under the provisions of this Act, together with a statement of the Board's activities for the following fiscal year.
