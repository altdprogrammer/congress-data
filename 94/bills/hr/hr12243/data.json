Requires that the Federal Energy Administrator be given five days' notice in order to comment on proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulations affecting the exploration, development, or production of energy supplies and resources. Includes foreign affiliates of United States firms, and foreign firms doing business in the United States within the disclosure provisions of such Act. Imposes criminal and civil penalties for failure to provide information to the Administrator as required by the Act. Deletes specified requirements for recordkeeping by the Administrator with respect to exports of domestic coal and petroleum products. Extends the expiration date of such Act to September 30, 1979."
