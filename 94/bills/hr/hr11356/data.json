Stipulates that: (1) the execution or imprisonment of any prison term imposed under this Act may not be suspended or probation granted; and (2) such prison terms may not run concurrently with any term of imprisonment imposed for the commission of any listed felony. Grants State courts having jurisdiction over the trial of any such offense the jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this Act. (Amends 18 U.S.C. 924)"
