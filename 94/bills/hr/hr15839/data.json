Provides that the reasonableness of the location of such meetings shall be determined under specified criteria in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. Disallows any deduction for conventions held upon any water vessels sailing within or without the territorial waters of the United States. Applies to such meetings held after December 31, 1977."
