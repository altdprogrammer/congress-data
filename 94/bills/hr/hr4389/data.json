    "text": "Unit Pricing Act - Provides that no person engaged in business in the sale at retail of any packaged consumer commodity which has been distributed in commerce, or the distribution of which affects commerce, shall sell, offer for sale, or display for sale any such commodity unless: (1) the total selling price of such commodity is plainly marked by a stamp, tag, or label affixed to a principal display panel of the package or by a label or sign at the point of display of such package; and (2) the retail unit price of such commodity is plainly marked by: (a) stamp, tag, or label affixed to a principal display panel of the package, or (b) a label or sign in close proximity to the point of display of such package, which label or sign shall also contain the name and quantity of contents of such commodity. Exempts from the requirement of marking the unit price of commodities: (1) any individual retail outlet which sells or offers for sale packaged consumer commodities and whose total gross sales do not exceed $250,000 per annum, unless such an outlet is one of a number of outlets owned substantially or whose inventory is supplied substantially, by a single person, partnership, or corporation whose total gross sales exceed $500,000 per annum; and (2) any retail outlet in any State or any political subdivision thereof which has enacted mandatory unit pricing laws and whose laws, in the judgment of the Federal promulgating authority, are in scope and comprehensiveness superior to the requirements of this Act; except that retailers (including chainstores and affiliated stores) who operate outlets in any such geographical area shall be subject to the unit pricing requirement of this Act if they also operate outlets in one or more other States or political subdivisions."
