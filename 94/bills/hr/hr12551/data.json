Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to pay specified amounts from the Fund to States with qualifying real property tax relief programs. Defines \"qualifying real property tax relief program\" as a program established by any State which provides low-or moderate-income households, where the head of the household is age 65 or older, with a credit against the State income or property tax for all or a portion of real property taxes. Limits amounts paid to States from the Fund to 50 percent of the revenue loss under a State's real property tax relief program."
