    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Amtrak Improvement Act - Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of the Rail Passenger Service Act. Authorizes the National Railroad Passenger Corporation to employ security guards for the protection of rail passengers and property. Prohibits the Corporation from entering into incentive payment contracts with railroads or regional transportation agencies for a level of service which is equal to or less than the level provided by such railroad or agency before the date such contract was entered into. Prohibits the Corporation from entering into such contracts on any basis other than a train-by-train basis or for any level of on-time performance for any train not operated within five minutes of its scheduled time for not less than 90 percent of its scheduled operations. Requires the Interstate Commerce Commission to report to the Congress all requests filed by the Corporation to issue, modify, or grant an exemption from regulations under such Act regarding adequacy of service together with the results of any Commission action on such results. Requires the establishment of guidelines to govern the expenditure of funds by the Corporation for entertainment and promotional expenses. Exempts local public bodies which provide rail mass transportation services from the Interstate Commerce Act if the interstate fares or the ability to apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for rate changes of such body is subject to the approval or disapproval by the Governor of the State in which it provides services."
