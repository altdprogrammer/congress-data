Establishes in the Peace Corps the Vietnam Assistance Volunteers Program. Authorizes the Director of the Peace Corps to enroll qualified citizens of the United States for voluntary civilian assistance in the Republic of Vietnam. Establishes the terms and conditions of employment, training, compensation, hours of work, benefits, leave, and termination of such volunteers. Provides that civilian assistance under the Act shall be: (1) refugee relocation assistance; (2) medical assistance to war victims; and (3) medical, educational, and material assistance to orphans. Authorizes the use of United States foreign aid materials for purposes of assistance under the Act. Authorizes the President, upon agreement with the potential host nation, to extend the Vietnam assistance volunteers program to any of the following: Loas, Cambodia, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."
