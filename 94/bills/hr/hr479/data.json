States that in carrying out his authority to determine prices for petroleum products and coal under the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 or under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, the President may not allow any such prices (at other than the retail level) to be based on the inclusion of any advertising expense unless any such expense is approved pursuant to this Act. Establishes an advisory board to approve only those advertising expenses under this Act which are for a public service announcement or otherwise consistent with the purpose of conserving energy during the period of shortage."
