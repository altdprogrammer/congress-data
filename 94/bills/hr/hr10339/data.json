Rept. 94-1516) Farmer-to-Consumer Direct Marketing Act - States that it is the purpose of this Act to foster and promote, through appropriate means and on an economically sustainable basis, the development and expansion of both traditional and innovative approaches to direct marketing of agricultural commodities from farmers to consumers. States that for purposes of this Act, the term \"direct marketing from farmers to consumers\" means the marketing of agricultural commodities at any market place (including, but not limited to, roadside stands, city markets, and vehicles used for house-to-house marketing of agricultural commodities) established and maintained for the purpose of enabling farmers to sell their agricultrual commodities directly to individual consumers, or organizations representing consumers. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, through State agriculture departments and through the Extension Service of the Department of Agriculture, to conduct and facilitate activities designed to foster methods of direct marketing from farmers to consumers. Authorizes the appropriation of $1,500,000 to carry out the provisions of this Act for fiscal years 1977 and 1978. Requires, in carrying out any emergency hay program for farmers or ranchers, that the Secretary of Agriculture pay 80 percent of the cost of transporting hay (not to exceed $50 a ton) from areas in which hay is plentiful to disaster or emergency areas where such hay is needed."
