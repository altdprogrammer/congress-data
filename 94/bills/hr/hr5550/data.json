Defines new natural gas to mean natural gas sold or delivered by a producer in interstate commerce: (1) which is dedicated to interstate commerce for the first time on or after January 1, 1975; (2) which is continued in interstate commerce after the expiration of a contract by its own terms for the sale or delivery of such natural gas existing as of such date; or (3) which is produced from wells commenced after such date."
