States that the function and duty of the Commission shall be: (1) to conduct a full and complete study, investigation, and review of the provision of home health care and services to individuals in the United States, including care and services furnished by agencies which do not qualify as providers of services under the Social Security Act as well as care and services furnished by agencies which do so qualify, with the particular objective of determining: (a) the extent to which additional quality assurance and utilization control in the provision of such care and services is needed; and (b) the manner in which the standards, conditions, and requirements of Title XVIII, Title XIX, or Title XX should be modified in order to provide additonal assurance and control; and (2) on the basis of such study, investigation, and review, to develop a detailed plan for quality assurance and utilization control in home health care.
