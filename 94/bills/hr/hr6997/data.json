States that the President may issue such letter of offer thirty days after the statement has been so transmitted unless, before the end of the first period of thirty calendar days of continuous session of Congress after the date on which the statement is transmitted, Congress adopts a concurrent resolution disapproving the proposed sale, credit sale, or guaranty with respect to which the statement is made. Specifies the procedures by which such a resolution shall be considered by the Congress."
