    "text": "Hazardous Waste Management Act - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop and promulgate criteria for identifying the characteristics of hazardous waste and to list particular hazardous wastes which shall be subject to the provisions of this Act. Prohibits the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste identified or listed by the Administrator unless a permit is issued pursuant to this Act. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations for the issuance of such permits and authorizes the Administrator to issue the permits subject to such conditions as deemed necessary to assure compliance with this Act and to minimize any risk to the public health and the environment. Directs the Administrator, after consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, to issue minimum criteria for the establishment of a transportation manifest system for hazardous waste whereby a manifest shall originate with the generator of hazardous waste and accompany each quantity, unit, or load of such waste from the point of generation through transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal. Requires the Administrator to authorize any State which has implemented a program for the control of hazardous waste disposal which meet the minimum requirements established under this Act to issue and enforce permits for the transportation, disposal, treatment, or storage of hazardous wastes. Establishes criteria for the withdrawal of such authorization. Requires any person who handles hazardous waste, upon request of any officer or employee of the Environmental Protection Agency duly designated by the Administrator, or any duly designated officer or employee of a State having an authorized hazardous waste program, to furnish or permit such person at all reasonable times to have access to, and to copy all records relating to, such wastes. Authorizes the Administrator to issue orders requiring compliance with this Act or commence a civil action against a violator in the appropriate United States district court to obtain appropriate relief. Imposes penalties for continued noncompliance with this Act. Sets forth criteria for the revocation of permits issued pursuant to this Act. Requires the Administrator, in consultation with the appropriate Federal and State agencies, to promulagate regulations establishing standards applicable to generators and transporters of hazardous waste, and to operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. Authorizes the Governor of any State to petition the Adminstrator at any time to identify or list a particular discarded material as a hazardous waste. Stipulates that nothing in this Act shall be construed to apply to any activity or substance which is subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 except to the extent that such application is not inconsistent with the requirements of such Acts. Directs the Administrator to integrate all provisions of this Act and avoid duplication, to the maximum extent practicable, with the appropriate provisions of the Clean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and such other Acts of Congress as grant regulatory authority to the Administrator."
