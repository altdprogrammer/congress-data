    "text": "Stipulates that an action by a Federal employee in a court of the United States seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the United States or that the United States is an indispensable party. States that the United States may be named as a defendant in any such action, and a judgment or decree may be entered against the United States. Provides that this Act does not confer authority to grant relief if any other statute consent to suit for money damages forbids the relief which is sought."
