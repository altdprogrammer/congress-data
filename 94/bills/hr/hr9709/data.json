Exempts from the regulation of the Federal Power Commission the facilities of a gas distribution company used to transport natural gas produced by an independent producer from lands not within the Outer Continental Shelf and sold directly to a high priority consumer of natural gas. States that such transportation is a matter to be regulated by the States. Defines the terms \"high priority consumer of natural gas\" and \"independent producer.\""
