States that it shall be unlawful for any person to disseminate or cause to be disseminated any cigarette advertisement which fails to contain the required statements and which is either disseminated by United States mails or in commerce or which is likely to induce, directly or indirectly, the purchase in, or have an effect upon, commerce of cigarettes. Requires cigarettes for export to contain the required statements in the language of the country to which such package is exported. Title II: Smoking in Federal Buildings and Interstate Facilities - Federal Nonsmokers Protection Act - States that smoking shall not be permitted in any enclosed area open to the public in any Federal facility or in any stairway, elevator, hallway, conveyance, waiting room, reception room, conference room, or hearing room in any such facility. Provides that smokers shall be effectively separated from nonsmokers in any restaurant, cafeteria, snack bar, other dining facility, recreation room or lounge in any Federal facility, and that all reasonable efforts shall be made to otherwise effectively separate the workplaces of employees who do not smoke from those of employees who do smoke. States that smoking shall be unlawful in any ticket office, waiting line, or boarding area in any interstate passenger carrier facility. Requires smokers to be effectively separated from nonsmokers in any cafeteria, restaurant, other eating facility, waiting room, recreation area, or lounge in any interstate passenger carrier facility.
