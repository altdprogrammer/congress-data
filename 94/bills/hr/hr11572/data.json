Repeals provisions (1) requiring the Director to prepare comprehensive plans for the establishment of a \"Science for Citizens Program\" and for facilitating citizen participation in the formulation and conduct of the Foundation's programs and policies and (2) directing the Foundation to coordinate specified energy research and development activities with the Energy Research and Development Administration."
