    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on the Judiciary with amendment, H. Rept. 94-506) Removes, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, from the class of aliens whose status may be adjusted by the Attorney General in his discretion to that of aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence those aliens who continue in or accept unauthorized employment prior to the filing of an application for adjustment to such status. Makes it unlawful for any employer, or any agent, or any person who for a fee, refers an alien for employment by such an employer, knowingly to employ, continue to employ, or refer for employment any alien in the United States who has not been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, unless the employment of such alien is authorized by the Attorney General. Requires that if, in a proceeding initiated within two years after the service of a citation by the Attorney General informing an employer of a violation under this Act, the Attorney General finds that any employer, agent, or referrer upon whom such citation has been served has thereafter violated the provisions of this Act, the Attorney General shall assess a penalty of not more than $500 for each alien with respect to whom any such violation is found to have occurred. Provides that further violation of this Act following the assessment of the above civil penalty shall make the employer guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof such employer shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both, for each alien with respect to whom any violation of this Act occurs. Requires disclosure by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare of information on illegal aliens who are receiving assistance under the Social Security Act. Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action against any employer failing to hire any person lawfully in the United States on the basis of national origin. Provides for the deportation of an alien who becomes a public charge regardless of whether such alien is legally liable to repay for public assistance which he has received or whether a demand has been made for such repayment."
