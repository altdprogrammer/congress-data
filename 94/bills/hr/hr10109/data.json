    "text": "Postal Service Reorganization Act - Abolishes the Postal Rate Commission which sets postal rates and establishes classes of mail. Authorizes the Postal Service to make one change in postal rates and fees during any fiscal year, such change to be no greater than the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index during the preceding year. Sets forth procedures for congressional approval of such increase. Provides that a rate increase greater than the increase in the Index may be implemented if not disapproved by the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the House or Senate. Requires that any change in mail classification be approved by such committees. Requires that the General Accounting Office transmit a report to each House of Congress reviewing the operation of amendments made by this Act."
