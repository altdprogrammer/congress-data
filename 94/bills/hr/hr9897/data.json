    "text": "Home Mortgage Disclosure Act - States that each depository institution which has a home office or branch office located within a standard metropolitan statistical area, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, shall compile and make available, in accordance with regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, to the public for inspection and copying at each office of that institution the number and total dollar amount of mortgage loans which were (1) originated, or (2) purchased by that institution during each fiscal year (beginning with the last full fiscal year of that institution which immediately preceded the effective date of this Act). Provides for enforcement of the provisions of this Act by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Directs the Board, in consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to carry out a study to determine: (1) the feasibility and usefulness of requiring depository institutions located outside standard metropolitan statistical areas, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, to make disclosures comparable to those required by this Act; (2) the feasibility, cost, and usefulness of requiring all institutions covered by this Act to disclose by geographical location the source of savings deposits; and (3) the practicality of requiring disclosure of the average terms and downpayment ratios of mortgage loans by geographical location."
