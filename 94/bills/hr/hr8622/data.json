    "text": "Provides that concerted activities on the part of labor organizations or laborers employed in the construction business shall be unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act when directed at any of several employers on a construction site only if such acts would otherwise be unfair labor practices within the meaning of the Act. States that nothing in such provison shall be construed: (1) to permit any conduct which was previously an unfair labor practice; or (2) to permit any attempt by a labor organization to require an employer to recognize another labor organization if another is the lawfully recognized employee representative. Requires that ten days' notice of intent to strike be given to all unions, the employer, the general contractor, to the Collective Bargaining Committee in construction, and to any labor organization of which the striking organization is an affiliate. Requires ten days' notice to be given to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service of intent to strike a military installation engaged in specified activities."
