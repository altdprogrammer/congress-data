    "text": "Financial Assistance for Health Care Act - Declares it the purpose of this Act to assist each State, territory, and the District of Columbia in assuring all residents, particularly low income persons, of access to needed health services of acceptable quality. Title I: Financial Assistance for Health Care - Authorizes the appropriation of specified sums for the purposes of carrying out this title, and sets forth the manner and methods of distribution. Requires each State to expend not less than 90 percent of the amount payable to it to provide personal health services to low- income persons, and not less than five percent on: (1) community health protection; (2) community-based services in mental health, alcoholism, and drug abuse; and (3) developmental disabilities programs. Requires each State to formulate a State health care plan setting forth a description of: (1) State health services activities; (2) the needs of individuals living in rural or medically underserved areas; (3) the supply and distribution of health facilities, services, and manpower; and (4) the relationship of the plan's provisions to its effect on children, the elderly, migrants, the mentally ill, the handicapped, alcoholics, drug abusers, and those suffering from developmental disabilities. Directs that each State plan provide for the administration of a certificate of need program to review the need for new institutional health services. Requires such plan to provide for an annual audit of State expenditures, assessment of the plan's implementation, and a report of such audit and assessment. Directs each State to create two or more sub-State health planning districts, each with a health planning body to develop proposed provisions for inclusion in the State plan. Directs each State receiving financial assistance for health care to certify to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare that it has a qualified State health care plan. Allows the Secretary, upon determination that the plan fails to comply with requirements, to make no further payments or to reduce payments until the Secretary is satisfied that there will no longer be a failure to comply. Title II: Federal Health Planning Acivities - Permits the Secretary to undertake health planning activities, including the establishment of a National Health Planning and Policy Council. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for such purpose. Title III: Repeal of Various Health Laws - Repeals specified portions of existing laws in conformance with the provisions of this Act. Title IV: Conforming Amendments - Makes specified technical and conforming amendments for purposes of this Act. Title V: Effective Date - Declares that this Act is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1976."
