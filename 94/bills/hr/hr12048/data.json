    "text": "Administrative Rule Making Reform Act - Requires a Federal agency preparing to hold a rule making session to make a reasonable effort to inform those likely to be affected by the proposed rule making. Requires that if the affected group is large, representatives of such group must be notified. Requires, in addition to present requirements, that the notice of rule making include the projected effective date of the rules, the purpose of the rule making, the text of the proposed rules, and the technical or other studies on which the agency intends to rely in the rule making proceedings. Applies the requirements of this Act to all rule making sessions except (1) those specifically authorized to be kept secret in the interest of national security, and (2) those relating to agency management. Requires public notice and public opportunity for comment of all rule making proceedings under this Act unless the agency finds that the rules to be proposed are emergency rules or are of routine or insignificant impact in which case the rule must be published with reasons for its adoption. Requires Federal agencies to give interested persons at least 45 days to participate in the rule making. Requires the agency to maintain a file of each proceeding to be made available to the courts, Congress, and to the public in connection with review of the rule. Limits the period for public comment to a maximum of 90 days. Requires a copy of all proposed rules to be sent to Congress. States that such rule, other than an emergency rule, shall not become effective if it is disapproved within 90 days by both Houses of Congress, or it is disapproved within 60 days by one House and no action is taken on the disapproval resolution by the other House. Provides that either House of Congress may, by resolution, require any agency to reconsider and resubmit any rule to which this Act applies. Requires that such proposed rule be repromulgated anew in accordance with all the provisions of this Act unless it is reconsidered and resubmitted to Congress within 180 days after the adoption of the resolution requiring such reconsideration. Sets forth procedures for adoption of resolutions to approve, disapprove, or compel reconsideration for both Houses. Requires the Administrative Conference of the United States to study Congressional review of agency rule making under this Act and report the effect of such review on such rule making before July 1, 1982. Authorizes to be appropriated $200,000 to finance such study. Makes this Act effective on the first day of the first session of the Ninety-fifth Congress. Terminates the Congressional review required by this Act at the adjournment of the Ninety-seventh Congress."
