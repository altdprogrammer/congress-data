Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to entitle a grant recipient to an additional grant if such recipient plans to use such additional grant for the construction or maintenance of a senior center providing recreational, health, and nutritional services. Directs the Secretary to insure mortgages made in connection with senior centers offering health, nutritional, recreational, and social facilities to elderly persons, regardless of whether such centers offer housing facilities."
