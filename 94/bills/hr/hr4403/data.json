Requires that any person engaged in business in the sale at retail of any packaged consumer commodity, must clearly display the total selling price on such package. Exempts from this requirement any individual retail outlet whose total gross sales does not exceed $250,000 per year, unless such outlet is controlled substantially, by a single person, partnership, or corporation whose total gross sales exceed $500,000 per annum."
