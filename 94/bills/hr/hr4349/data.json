States it to be the purpose of this Act to establish and expand comprehensive child development programs, building on the Headstart experience, with emphasis on economically disadvantaged individuals and including children of working mothers and single parents, involving parents and community groups in the decision-making process, and establishing the legislative framework for eventual universally available child development programs. Title I: Comprehensive Child Development Programs; Direction to Establish Program - Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to direct programs under this title. Lists activities for which funds can be provided, including: planning and development of programs; establishing, maintaining, and operating comprehensive programs with a broad range of activities; design, acquisition, construction, alteration, renovation or remodeling of facilities including mobile facilities; training programs for professionals, paraprofessionals, parents, older family members and prospective parents; public information activities; child advocate staff; and administrative expenses. Authorizes any State, city, county, combination of units of local government, or federally recognized Indian reservation to serve as prime sponsors. Permits the Secretary to designate such prime sponsor upon receipt of an application which: (1) establishes a Child Development Council (CDC) to plan, conduct, coordinate, and monitor programs; (2) establishes Local Policy Councils (LPC's) elected by parents of eligible children to serve appropriate subdivisions within the prime sponsorship area; and (3) delegates administrative responsibility to an appropriate local agency. Authorizes a public or private non-profit agency or organization to become a prime sponsor if the appropriate unit of local government has not submitted an application or is out of compliance, or if the Secretary determines such prime sponsor is necessary to meet the needs of economically disadvantaged children. Provides an opportunity for a State to comment on all applications for designation, notice and hearing before the Secretary makes any adverse decision on any designation. Requires submission by a prime sponsor and the Secretary's approval of a Comprehensive Child Development Plan before a governmental prime sponsor may receive financial assistance under this title. Requires that each such plan must: (1) identify needs and goals and describe purposes for which funds will be used; (2) meet the needs of children in the area including infant care and before and after school programs including 24-hour child care services; (3) give priority to economically disadvantaged children by reserving funds equal to the highest level of funds expended in the prime sponsorship area under Headstart in fiscal years 1973-1974 and then reserving the following percentages; 65 percent for fiscal year 1975, 60 percent for fiscal year 1976, and 55 percent for fiscal year 1977; (4) give priority thereafter to children of single parents and working mothers; (5-6) provide free services for economically disadvantaged children and fees on a sliding scale for others; (7) require cooperative arrangements of State and local agencies serving the handicapped; (8) provide jobs and training in so far as possible for residents of the community; (9) provide in so far as possible for socioeconomic mixture in centers; (10-11) provide for special needs of minority, bilingual migrant and Indian children in the area; (12) assure benefits for children in nonpublic preschool and school programs; (13) coordinate programs so family members relate to each other during the day; (14) provide for parental participating in plans and programs; (15) provide for paraprofessional volunteers, including parents, senior citizens, students, other children, and those preparing for child development careers; (16) provide for dissemination of program information in language of parents; (17) eliminate barriers pertaining to State teacher certification standards; (18-20) assure coordination with schools and other child development programs in the community; and (21) provide that emphasis will be given to continued funding of on-going projects. Requires such a plan to assure payment of the non-Federal share, to provide for fiscal control and fund accounting procedures, to provide for continuing evaluation and analysis of needs and reports to the Secretary to emphasize on-going programs, and to provide adequate staff and administrative expenses of LPCs. Provides the opportunity for comment by a Governor, Mayor or community action agency, Headstart agency or educational agency; and provides for notice and hearing before an adverse decision is made on a plan by the Secretary. Authorizes funding by a prime sponsor of a qualified public or private agency which submits an application to run a child development program, which provides comprehensive services for children served, assures adequate personnel, and meets the appropriate provisions of the Comprehensive Child Development Plan.

Provides that the non-Federal share may be in cash or kind including fees paid by parents. Reserves for the Secretary funds for migrant and Indian programs at a ratio equal to the ratio of such children to the total number of economically disadvantaged children in the nation; 5 percent for the Secretary's discretionary use, with the remainder apportioned among the States as follows: (1) 50 percent according to the ratio of economically disadvantaged children in the States; (2) 25 percent according to the ratio of children through age 5; and (3) 25 percent according to the ratio of children of working mothers and single parents.
