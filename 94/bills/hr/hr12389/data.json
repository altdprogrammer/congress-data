    "text": "Authorizes the appropriation of the following sums to the Energy Research and Development Administration: (1) for nuclear energy research and development, $4,935,362,000; (2) for nonnuclear energy research, development, and demonstration of fossil, solar, geothermal, and other forms of energy, and for energy conservation, $812,550,000; and (3) for environmental research and safety, basic energy sciences, and related programs, $612,408,000. Amends prior appropriation authorizations Acts to increase the amount authorized for specific energy research projects. Extend such authorizations through fiscal year 1977. Title I: For Nuclear Energy Research and Development, Basic Research, Space Nuclear Systems and Other Technology, Uranium Enrichment, National Security, and Related Programs - Authorizes the appropriation of $3,312,966,000 in operating expenses for nuclear energy research and development programs. Lists authorizations for additional plant and capital expenditures. Imposes limits and conditions on such expenditures. Places percentage limitations on the amount of cost overruns allowable without additional Congressional authorization. Title II: For Nonnuclear Energy Research Development and Demonstration of Fossil, Solar, Geothermal, and Other Forms of Energy, and for Energy Conservation - Authorizes the appropriation of $725,430,000 in operating expenses for nonnuclear energy research and development programs. Lists authorizations for additional plant and capital expenditures. Title III: For Environmental Research and Safety, Basic Energy Sciences, Program Support, and Related Programs - Authorizes the appropriation of $580,730,000 in operating expenses for environmental research and safety, program support, and related activities. Lists authorizations for additional plant and capital expenditures. Places percentage limitations on cost overruns. Authorizes the appropriation of $1,000,000 to the Water Resources Council for the water resources evaluation study authorized by the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974. Authorizes the appropriation of $500,000 to the Council on Environmental Quality for the environmental evaluation on nonnuclear energy technologies authorized by such Act. Title IV: General Provisions - Authorized the Administrator of Energy Research and Development Administration to perform construction design services prior to Congressional approval of construction projects where the Administrator determines that such project is of such urgency as to require prompt completion upon its approval by Congress. Stipulates that amounts appropriated to the Administration for operating expenses may remain avialable until expended."
