Revises criteria for issuance of loans at the special rate of two percent by the Administration by deleting reference to the factor of average gross revenue per mile of the REA-financed electric system, under which a borrower previously could automatically qualify for such special rate. Revises criteria for issuance of loans by the Rural Telephone Bank to authorize the Telephone Bank Board to lower as well as revise net income production requirements in terms of stated percentage of interest on loans."
