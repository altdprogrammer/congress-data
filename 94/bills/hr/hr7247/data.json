Establishes, as an agency of the Department of Agriculture, a Federal Crop Insurance Corporation. Authorizes the Corporation to insure producers of wheat, cotton, grain, sorghum, corn, barley, and other agricultural commodities on an experimental basis, against loss of the insured commodity due to specified natural occurences. Authorizes the Corporation to limit or refuse insurance on the basis of the risk involved. Establishes within the Treasury a seperate fund for the use of the Corporation."
