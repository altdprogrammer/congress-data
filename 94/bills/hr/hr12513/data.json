Prohibits State and local laws which permit the construction of buildings or other obstructions which would interfere with the amount of sunlight necessary for the operation of solar heating and cooling equipment in buildings. Declares that State and local laws which are not inconsistent with the purposes of this Act are not preempted by this Act."
