    "text": "Truth-in-Octane Act - Declares that the purposes of this Act are: (1) to assist consumers in avoiding the purchase of automotive gasoline with octane ratings unnecessarily high for the proper operation of their automobiles; and (2) to enhance competition in the sale to consumers of automotive gasoline. Prohibits the sale of gasoline to a consumer unless: (1) the person offering such gasoline for sale has affixed to the unit from which gasoline is dispended (otherwise known as a gas pump) a label clearly stating the octane rating; and (2) all advertising about such gasoline clearly discloses the octane rating and such other information as the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration shall by regulation prescribe. Prohibits the sale of any automobile unless the manufacturer provides written information to the consumer stating the octane or octanes of gasoline appropriate for use in the engine of such automobile. Sets forth penalties for violations of this Act. Directs the Administrator to establish standard methods to measure octane ratings and to conduct a study of the quality of performance of various brands of gasoline. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
