Requires each State and election district to provide for the casting of absentee ballots by all citizens residing overseas and entitled to vote in a Federal election in such State or district. Provides that each State shall mail the following by airmail to such citizen; (1) an absentee ballot; (2) instructions concerning voting procedures; and (3) an airmail envelope for the mailing of such ballot. Sets forth the form of the overseas citizen Federal election postcard. States that whoever deprives any person of any right secured by this Act shall be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. Sets forth additional penalties for falsifying registration materials. Provides that the exercise of a right to register or vote by any citizen residing overseas shall not affect the determination of his place or residence or domicile (as distinguished from this place of voting) for purposes of any tax imposed under Federal, State or local law."
