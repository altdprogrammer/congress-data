    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 94-1719) Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to furnish, upon written request, authenticated copies of census surveys or reports filed by, or on behalf of, an individual or organization to such individual or organization or to the heir or agent of such individual or organization. Allows the Secretary to furnish copies of tabulations and other statistical materials which do not disclose the information reported by any individual or organization to any private person or agency requesting such information upon payment of the cost of such work. Directs that in no case shall information furnished pursuant to a census be used to the detriment of any respondent. Directs the Secretary in the year 1985, and every ten years thereafter, to conduct a mid-decade census of population. Requires that the determination of the elibility of States, local governments, and other recipients for Federal benefits be based on the most recent data obtained in either the mid-decade or decennial census. Stipulates that information obtained in such mid-decade census shall not be used for apportionment of Representatives in Congress, nor for prescribing congressional districts. Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress the questions proposed to be included in the decennial and mid-decade censuses. Directs the Secretary, to the extent feasible, to annually produce and publish current total population data on each State, county, and local unit of general purpose government which has a population of 50,000 or more and to biennially produce and publish such information for other units of general purpose government. Expands the geographic scope of censuses undertaken by the Secretary to include the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct special censuses for the government of any State or political subdivision thereof upon the payment to the Secretary of the cost of such special census. Increases the penalty for wrongful disclosure of census information by census employees or staff members from a $1,000 fine and/or two years imprisonment to a $5,000 fine and/or five years imprisonment. Eliminates the penalty of imprisonment for refusing or willfully neglecting to answer questions asked on a census questionaire. Provides that a person may not be compelled to disclose information regarding his religious beliefs or membership in a religious body."
