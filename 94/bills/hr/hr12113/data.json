Title I: Nonnuclear Programs - Lists amounts authorized for specific programs of fossil energy development, including coal, petroleum, natural gas, solar energy, and geothermal energy development programs. Imposes limits and conditions on operating expenses for such programs. Title II: Nuclear Programs - Authorizes the appropriation of $3,312,966,000 in operating expenses for fiscal year 1977. Lists authorizations for additional plant and capital expenditures. Imposes limits and conditions on such expenditures. Places percentage limitations on the amount of cost overruns allowable without additional Congressional authorization. Title III: Supporting Programs - Lists amounts authorized for specific programs of biomedical and environmental research, operational safety, and basic energy sciences. Authorizes the appropriation of $1,000,000 to the Water Resources Council for the water resources evaluation study authorized by the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974. Authorizes the appropriation of $500,000 to the Council on Environmental Quality for the environmental evaluation of nonnuclear energy technologies authorized by such Act.
