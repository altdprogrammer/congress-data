Permits the Commissioner to enter into contracts with nonprofit groups or public agencies which have, as a primary purpose, the motivation of children to learn to read, to support and promote the establishment of reading motivational programs (including distribution of inexpensive books to students), and to pay the Federal share of such program costs. Authorizes appropriations for inexpensive book distribution programs of $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1976, and $9,000,000 for each of the following two fiscal years. Authorizes to be appropriated during fiscal year 1976 and the period from July 1, 1976, through September 30, 1976: (1) for State leadership and training activities, $5,300,000; and (2) for reading programs, $600,000. Authorizes to be appropriated for fiscal year 1977 and for the succeeding fiscal year: (1) $6,400,000 for State leadership and training activities; and (2) $800,000 for reading programs."
