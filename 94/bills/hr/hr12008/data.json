    "text": "Defines \"institution\" for purposes of this Act. Authorizes the Attorney General, whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that a State or its agents are as a matter of practice subjecting persons involuntarily confined in an institution to conditions which deprive them of Constitutional or other federally protected rights, privileges, or immunities, to institute a civil action against such parties to insure the full enjoyment of such rights, privileges, and immunities. Directs the Attorney General to certify, prior to the institution of such suit, that notice was given to appropriate officials of the institution of alleged deprivations. Permits the Attorney General to intervene in any action based upon such deprivations upon certification that the case is of general public importance. Prohibits the granting of relief by district courts to individuals alleging such deprivations unless it appears that the individual has exhausted any plain, speedy, and efficient State administrative remedy as is available. Makes it unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any person seeking any remedy pursuant to this Act."
