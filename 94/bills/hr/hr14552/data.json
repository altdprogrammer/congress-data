    "text": "Amends the Social Security Act to reduce the requirements for eligibility for disability benefits for blind persons under title II of such Act (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance). Requires that a blind individual have at least six quarters of coverage to be eligible for disability benefits. Sets forth a method of computing the average monthly wage of a blind individual for the purpose of determining such individual's primary insurance amount. Provides that in no case shall such amount be less than the amount which would be determined without regard to an individual's blindness. States that no reductions will be made from the benefits to which a blind person is entitled because of such person's refusal to accept State-approved rehabilitative services under the Vocational Rehabilitation Act. Continues the payment of such benefits as long as blindness lasts, the amount of an individual's earnings notwithstanding."
