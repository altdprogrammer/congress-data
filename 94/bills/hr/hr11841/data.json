    "text": "States that it shall be an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act for a labor organization to strike after a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit have voted not to strike in a secret referendum. Provides that any such referendum may be requested by: (1) the labor organization; (2) the employer; or (3) ten percent or more of the members of the bargaining unit. Authorizes direct court appeals to the appropriate United States circuit court of union elections results where the National Labor Relations Board has certified a particular collective bargaining representative as being the exclusive representative of employees in a unit and such Board certification is disputed."
