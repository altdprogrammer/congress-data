    "text": "Electric Vehicle Research, Development and Demonstration Act - Declares it to be the policy of the United States and the purpose of this Act to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of electric and hybrid vehicles for urban indiviual and business use, and to encourage research and development in new technologies for electric vehicles with wider applications, in order to promote long-range conservation of liquid fuel and reduce environmental pollution. Defines terms as used in this Act. States that a hybrid vehicle is one propelled by a combination of an electric motor and an internal combustion engine. Directs the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to initiate and provide for the conduct of research and development in areas related to electric and hybrid vehicles. Directs the Administrator to enter into such contracts as may be necessary and appropriate: (1) for the production, within one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, of significant numbers of urban passenger and commercial vehicles which have electric propulsion systems on conventional chassis; and (2) for the production, within three years after such date, of significant numbers of urban passenger and commercial vehicles which are specifically designed for electric propulsion as the primary power source. Directs the United States Postal Service, the General Services Administration, the Secretary of Defense, and the heads of other Federal agencies to arrange for the introduction of electric and hybrid vehicles into their fleets as soon as possible. Provides guaranties of loans made to small businesses for commercial development of electric and hybrid vehicles. Authorizes the appropriation of an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1976, $40,000,000 for 1977, $30,000,000 for 1978, $60,000,000 for 1979 and $20,000,000 for 1980; to carry out the provisions of this Act."
