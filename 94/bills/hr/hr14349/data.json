Sets forth requirements which the State plans must meet before receiving such grants, including: comprehensive health care to school-age girls (associated with the continuation of pregnancy) and to their children, family planning and counseling, infant and child day care and a coordinated program of social services. Directs that no identifying information of persons receiving services shall be collected by the Federal or State government. Authorizes the appropriation of $30,000,000 for fiscal year 1976 and for each of the next two succeeding fiscal years to carry out the purposes of this Act. Establishes a unit within the Maternal and Child Health Service of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to administer and coordinate the program established by this Act."
