Provide for a certificate issued by the exporting country assuring compliance with prescribed standards as to the quality of the milk farm, plant facilities, equipment, and procedures used in the production and transportation of milk, and the production, manufacture, and processing of all imported dairy products. Requires all imported dairy products, after entry into the United States, to be subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other dairy product inspection Acts. Provides for cooperation between the Secretary and foreign governments as well as other executive departments in carrying out this Act, and authorizes necessary inspections and investigations.
