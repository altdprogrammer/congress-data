    "text": "Illegal Alien Employment Prohibition Act - Prohibits, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the employment or referral for employment of aliens who have not been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, unless such employment is authorized by the Attorney General. Provides that a person not be deemed to have violated this Act if he has made a bona fide inquiry whether a person employed or referred is a citizen or alien. States that a signed statement from such person that he is a citizen or authorized alien constitutes a bona fide inquiry provided that the writing conforms with regulations prescribed by the Attorney General. Directs the Attorney General to serve a citation upon first-time violators of this Act. Provides a civil penalty of not more than $500 for each alien if a violation occurs within two years after the service of a citation. Permits a civil penalty to be imposed only after an opportunity for hearing and after the Attorney General has determined that a violation did occur. Provides that one who is assessed a civil penalty and thereafter violates this Act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by one year imprisonment, or both, for each alien in respect to whom any violation of this Act occurs. States that nothing in this Act be construed to affect the validity of any document or proceeding valid at the time this Act shall take effect."
