    "text": "Revises the Agricultural Adjustment Act to set a fixed national acreage allotment of rice for 1976 and subsequent crops. Stipulates that such allotment will be 2,000,000 acres in any year unless the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the supply of rice for the marketing year is greater than 20 percent above such normal supply. Directs that, if the Secretary makes such determination, an adjustment be made which will result in a supply of rice on hand at the end of the marketing year which is less than 20 percent of the supply for such year. Imposes a penalty on a producer equal to the cost of production of the farm marketing excess whenever marketing quotas are in effect. Directs the Secretary to make nonrecourse loans and purchases for the 1976 and subsequent crops of rice to persons producing rice on land allocated under the Agricultural Adjustment Act."
