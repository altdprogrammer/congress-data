    "text": "Alaskan Natural Gas Pipeline Authorization and Environmental Protection Act - Expresses the intent of Congress that Alaskan natural gas be delivered to midwestern domestic markets at the earliest feasible moment in an environmentally acceptable manner. Directs the Federal Power Commission to issue all necessary permits and authorizations within 60 days in order to expedite the construction of facilities relating to the Fairbanks-Alcan Highway corridor natural gas pipeline. Requires that the pipeline follow the most environmentally acceptable route through Canada to the lower 48 States. Directs the Secretary of the Interior and other appropriate Federal officials to issue all necessary permits and take appropriate action within 60 days to expedite the enforcement of all rights-of-way related to the construction and operation of such pipeline. Prohibits the issuance of rights-of-way and other authorizations through lands under the jurisdiction of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and lands which are part of, or proposed for, inclusion in the National Wilderness System. Stipulates that this Act shall not prevent environmental reviews required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Recognizes that approval by the Government of Canada is necessary in order to construct such pipeline. Declares it to be in the national interest of the United States to cooperate with Canada should such approval be forthcoming. Declares that authorizations issued pursuant to this Act shall grant no immunity from Federal antitrust laws. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this Act."
