Directs the Secretary to establish within the boundaries of the recreation area a national wildlfe refuge known as the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Stipulates that establishment of the refuge and recreation area shall not be construed to prohibit commercial navigation and construction of highways and bridges in the area or any other such activities as may be approved by the Secretary. Requires that all such activities be conducted with minimum disruption of wildlife, recreational, and scenic values of the area, consistent with economic feasibility. Directs the Secretary to establish at an appropriate site within the refuge a wildlife interpretive and educational center for the purpose of providing adequate fish and wildlife management, and promoting environmental education. Directs the Secretary, acting through the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and in cooperation with the State of Minnesota, to formulate a plan for the protection and preservation of the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Recreation Area. Directs the Secretary to allocate $500,000 of Federal funds for such purpose. Authorizes the Secretary to grant financial assistance to the State of Minnesota for the acquisition of lands and interests necessary to the establishment of the recreation area and refuge. Limits the amount of such assistance to 70 percent of the total cost to preserve such lands."
