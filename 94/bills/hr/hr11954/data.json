Sets forth the powers of the Commission, and provides for the compensation of the appointed members. Directs the Commission to undertake a comprehensive study and evaluation of the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program established by title II of the Social Security Act in order to determine whether, and the extent to which, such program is presently serving the purpose and meeting the needs for which it was established. Stipulates that the Commission shall give particular emphasis to the various alternative structures for the present social security program which might better serve such purposes and meet such needs. Directs the Commission to report its findings to the President and to the Congress within two years of the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
