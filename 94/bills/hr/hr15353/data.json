Defines the term \"damage to the national defense. Specifies persons who may designate information as \"Defense Data.\" Permits the President to prescribe additional protection markings to regulate the internal distribution and degree of protection of information containing \"Defense Data.\" States that such designation shall not affect the availability of such items provided for by this Act. Requires that the \"Defense Data\" classification of information be removed as soon as such information is no longer within the meaning of that classification as defined by this Act. States that unless otherwise declassified, the \"Defense Data\" classification shall be deemed to have expired two years after such information was classified; if classified \"Confidential,\" \"Secret,\" or \"Top Secret\" within two years prior to the enactment of this Act, within two years after such enactment; and if given such classification or the classification of \"Restricted\" more than two years prior to such enactment, such classification shall be deemed expired six months after such enactment. Permits the deferment of the termination of \"Defense Data\" classifications for not more than two years. Requires that any such deferment be reported to the Comptroller General and Committees on Government Operations of the Senate and House of Representatives. Directs the Committees to jointly publish annually such reports deleting any \"Defense Data\" in such reports.
