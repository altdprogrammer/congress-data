    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 94-259) National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act - Authorizes appropriations to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for research and development, construction of facilities, and for research and program management. Permits research and development funds to be used for grants to nonprofit institutions of higher education, or to nonprofit organizations whose primary purpose is the conduct of scientific research, for purchase or construction of additional research facilities. Allows authorized amounts for construction of facilities to vary upward 10 percent, and to vary upward 25 percent following a report by the Administrator of NASA to specified congressional committees to meet unusual cost variations, but limits the total of such amounts to the total authorized for such purpose. Permits one-half of one percent of the funds appropriated for research and development to be transferred to the construction of facilities, together with $10,000,000 of the funds for construction of facilities, to be used to construct, expand, or modify laboratories and other installations when the Administrator determines that such action is necessary because of changes in the national program of aeronautical and space activities. Grants Congress the power to disapprove such action. Prohibits amounts appropriated pursuant to this Act from being used for any program deleted originally by the Congress or for any program which has not been presented to the appropriate committees, unless the Congress has had an opportunity to disapprove such action. Authorizes NASA, when provided in an appropriation Act, to enter into contracts for tracking and data relay satellite services. Authorizes appropriations for the transition period through September 1976. Adds title IV, \"Upper Atmospheric Research,\" to the National Aeronautics and Space Act. Directs NASA, under such new title, to develop and carry out a comprehensive program of research, technology, and monitoring of the phenomena of the upper atmosphere so as to provide for an understanding of, and to maintain the chemical and physical integrity of, the Earth's upper atmosphere."
