    "text": "States that the purpose of this Act is to improve the responsiveness of Federal agencies to citizens' complaints and inquiries. Requires the head of each Federal agency to submit within 90 days after the enactment of this Act a report to Congress giving a description of administrative procedures used to handle such citizens' complaints and inquiries and the resources employed in responding to such inquiries. Directs each agency head to take such steps, including publication in the Federal Register, as he determines will improve the uniformity, speed, and comprehensiveness of each agency's response to such inquiries. Requires each agency head to submit to Congress a report within 270 days after enactment of this Act summarizing the inquiries received, the responses made, and the time taken for such response. Requires such report to contain any recommendation such agency has with respect to legislation which Congress should enact to improve such agency's handling of such inquiries. Requires that in allocating funds in the annual congressional budget the appropriate committees must give due consideration to agency efforts to carry out the purpose of this Act."
