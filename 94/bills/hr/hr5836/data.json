States that such loans may be made in amounts exceeding actual losses, but that the interest on such excess shall increase from five percent to the prevailing market rate. Allows the Secretary of Agriculture to delegate such loan-making to the State directors of the Farmers' Home Administration. Allows such loans to be made on an annual basis for five additional years, at prevailing market rates."
