States that the taxable fuel consumption rate shall be the rate set forth in the Atuomobile Fuel Consumption Schedule specified in this Act. Imposes a floor stocks tax on new automobiles held by a dealer for sale. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to periodically study the fuel consumption rates of passenger automobiles and revise the Automobile Fuel Consumption Schedule. Requires that a label describing the fuel consumption rate and the amount of the fuel consumption tax must be affixed to all new cars sold."
