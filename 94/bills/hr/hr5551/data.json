Directs such determination to be upheld if substantial evidence on the record supports his disbelief in the merit of such complaints. Subjects any officer of a State or political subdivision who enforces any standard not submitted to the Attorney General to a civil penalty in an amount not less than $5,000 nor more than $10,000. Authorizes to be appropriated $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1976, $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1977, and such sums as are necessary to carry out the Act for each succeeding fiscal year. Authorizes the Court in any action or proceeding brought by an individual under the Act, to allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney's fee. Requires the Director of the Census to conduct a survey in any State or political subdivision, which shall include only a count of persons of voting age by race, color, and national origin, and a determination of the extent to which such persons are registered to vote. Declares that no person shall be compelled to disclose his race, color, national origin, his political party, or how he voted. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out such survey."
