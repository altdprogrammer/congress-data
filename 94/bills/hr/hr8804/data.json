Makes available to all handicapped children a free appropriate public education. Provides that during the period beginning October 1, 1976 and ending September 30, 1979, the Commissioner of Education shall make payments to State educational agencies for grants to assist States in providing full educational opportunity to all handicapped children. Sets forth limits upon the amount and guidelines for the allocation of such grants. Requires that each State, in order to be eligible for such grants, must follow a policy that assures all handicapped children the right to free education. States that each State must also develop a plan to carry out such policy. Directs that all handicapped children within the State must be identified, located, and evaluated in order for the State to be eligible. Authorizes the Commissioner to withhold payments, after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing, when there is a failure to comply substantially with the requirements of this Act. Directs the Commissioner to evaluate the effectiveness of State plans. Requires an annual report by the Commissioner, to the appropriate committee of Congress, with respect to the activities carried out under this Act. Specifies amounts to be spent for the implementation of each provision of this Act. Sets limits upon the total amount to be allocated to each State.
