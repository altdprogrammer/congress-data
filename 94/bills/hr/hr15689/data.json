Requires that notice of any Postal Rate Commission decision to increase first-class rates be transmitted to Congress. Stipulates that during a 90-day period following such notice Congress may pass a resolution disapproving such increase which shall prevent the increase from taking effect. Establishes House rules for proceeding on such resolution. Prohibits the Postal service from using revenues generated by one class of mail to pay costs assignable to another class. Abolishes all temporary rates and fees. (Adds 39 U.S.C. 3629)"
