    "text": "Construction Industry Coordination and Development Act - States the findings of Congress that: (1) the construction industry is a major sector of and contributor to the national economy, accounting for more than 11 percent of the gross national product; (2) the construction industry, through its position as a major user of the products of numerous other industries, exerts a multiplied impact on the health of the Nation's industry and on the general economy; and (3) there exists a need for a single Federal office in which to concentrate expertise and information concerning the construction industry and through which to coordinate the many construction contracting agencies of the Federal Government. Establishes the Federal Office of Construction as an executive agency. Provides for a Director and two Deputy Directors each of whom shall be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Declares that it shall be the purpose of the Federal Office of Construction to serve the consuming public by assuring more effective and efficient functioning of the various components of the construction industry. States that in carrying out such purpose, the Office shall analyze and develop strategies with respect to specific construction problems and issues, collect and review information concerning such problems and issues from all available sources, and promote the rapid dissemination of such information. Enumerates the powers of the Director and stipulates that he shall not issue regulations or standards, nor establish administrative requirements, nor assume direct responsibility with regard to the actual awarding of construction contracts. Outlines the organizational structure of the Office. Directs the Office to: (1) monitor, analyze, and where appropriate make recommendations as to the impact of Federal, State, and local legislative and administrative proposals effecting the construction industry; (2) collect and maintain information and data relative to research and development efforts in the construction field; (3) collect and maintain current statistical information on specified construction topics; (4) develop, maintain, and provide accurate information for the benefit of the consuming public as to the magnitude of the construction industry and its importance to the Nations's economy; and (5) coordinate and strengthen the effort to establish and preserve the involvement of minority businesses in the construction industry. Authorizes to be appropriated for the fiscal year 1976, and for each succeeding fiscal year, such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act."
