Defines terms used in the Act. Makes it unlawful for persons engaged in commerce or in activities affecting commerce in the refining of petroleum products, to acquire, operate, or control any wholesale or retail outlet for the marketing of petroleum products within time limits established by the Act. Makes it unlawful for persons so engaged to engage in petroleum or petrochemical marketing, either directly or indirectly, after three years from the effective date of this Act. Empowers the Small Business Administration to make loans of up to $350,000 to assist small businesses which have been adversely affected by a change in petroleum or petrochemical marketing effected to achieve compliance with this Act of refiners who supply petroleum or petrochemical products to such small businesses. Authorizes appropriations to the business loan and investment fund established by the Small Business Act for the purpose of making such loans."
