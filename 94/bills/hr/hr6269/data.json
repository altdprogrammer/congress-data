    "text": "Replaces the food stamp program established under the Food Stamp Act with a five-year federally financed nutritional program established by the States. States that the total amount available to be paid to each State by the Secretary of the Treasury shall be determined by appropriation Acts. Requires that each State shall be entitled to an amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount available to all the States as the population of that State bears to the total population of all the States. Sets forth conditions to be met by States receiving payments under this Act. Requires States to (1) provide administrative review procedures, (2) publish regulations prescribed by the State in connection with the expenditure of funds received under this Act, (3) prohibit discriminationary activities, (4) permit access by the Secretary of the Treasury to the records and files of the State's nutritional program which is funded by payments received under this Act, and (5) use payments received under this Act solely for the purpose of helping to meet the nutritional needs of residents of the State. Sets forth procedures governing judicial review of determinations by the Secretary that a State has violated the requirements of this Act. Establishes a Nutritional Program Trust Fund to be used by the Secretary for making payments to States under this Act. Authorizes appropriations to the fund of $4,500,000,000 for the first fiscal year for which payments are made under this Act, $3,500,000,000 for the second year, $3,000,000,000 for the third year, $2,000, 000,000 for the fourth year, and $1,000,000,000 for the fifth year."
