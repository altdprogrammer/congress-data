    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Education and Labor with amendment, H. Rept. 94-804) Emergency Employment Project Amendments - Amends Title VI (Emergency Job Programs) of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973. Authorizes appropriations under such title in the amount of $1,200,000,000 for fiscal year 1976, necessary sums through September 30, 1976, and necessary sums for fiscal year 1977. Designates specified portions of such appropriations to be used to continue the employment of persons currently employed in public services jobs, under titles II and VI of such Act, who would otherwise be laid off from such jobs. Requires that not less than 85 percent of appropriations under title VI be used for wages and employment benefits to persons employed in public service jobs under such title; and that in establishing and filling such jobs, preferred consideration shall be given to reestablishing jobs of essential public health and safety personnel, which shall be filled by persons laid off for bona fide budgetary reasons. Requires that 90 percent of appropriations (less exceptions) under such title be provided to prime sponsors and Indian tribes receiving grants under such Act. Provides that of such 90 percent, 25 percent shall be allocated on the basis of relative number of unemployed persons residing in the areas of the prime sponsors and Indian tribes. Provides that the remainder of the 90 percent shall be allocated on the basis of relative excess (above 6.5 percent of the area labor force) of unemployed persons residing in such areas. Requires prime sponsors and Indian tribes receiving allocations under such title to enter into arrangements with eligible applicants for financial assistance for projects within their areas which meet the requirements of such title. Sets forth application requirements for such applicants. Requires such applicants to give preferred consideration to unemployed persons who are substantially without alternative sources of income. Disallows an eligible applicant from hiring any person to fill a public service job supported with funds under such title unless such job has been listed at least seven days with the appropriate public employment office. Requires applicants to use not less than 85 percent of funds available to them under such title for wages and employment benefits to persons employed in public service jobs under such title. Provides that prime sponsors and Indian tribes shall consider, in approving projects of eligible applicants, the number of employees who will be given work, the number of man-months of work which will be performed, and the usefulness of the public service project. Prohibits prime sponsors and Indian tribes from providing assistance to projects which do not meet the required wage levels of persons employed, health and safety conditions for those employed, and the 60-day to one-year project duration limitation. Defines \"eligible applicant\" and \"public service\" for purposes of this Act. Requires that regulations and procedures developed to carry out such title be simple and concise and do not unduly burden eligible applicants."
