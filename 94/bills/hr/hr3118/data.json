    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Science and Technology with amendment, H. Rept. 94-575 (Part I)) Stratospheric Research and Protection Act - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a study of the cumulative effect of all substances, practices, processes, and activities which may affect the stratosphere, especially the ozone in the stratosphere, including an analysis of the effects on such ozone of halocarbons, other sources of chlorine, bromine compounds, and aircraft emissions. Requires such study to ascertain any effects upon public health of changes in the stratosphere. Makes the Administrator the chairman of a coordinating committee, which shall coordinate the efforts of other Federal agencies conducting related research. Requires a report to the Congress within two years on the results of such studies, and quarterly reports during such two years. States that such final study shall include recommendations for control of substances, practices, and processes, and activities which may reasonably be anticipated to affect the stratosphere. Directs the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to establish a continuing program of research and monitoring of the stratosphere for the purpose of early detection of potentially harmful changes in the stratosphere, and to report annually to the Congress on his findings. Requires the Administrator to propose regulations for the control of any substance, practice, process, or activity which may reasonably be anticipated to affect the stratosphere, if he finds that such effect may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Grants the Congress a right of disapproval of any such regulation before it becomes effective."
