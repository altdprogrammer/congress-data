Requires such control programs to include: (1) certification by a physician that such services were required to have been given on an inpatient basis; (2) assurance that services provided were furnished under a plan established and periodically reviewed and evaluated by a physician; (3) adherence to existing cost control procedures established under Title XIX; and (4) except in the case of care provided by hospitals, annual review and evaluation of the professional management of each case by independent professional review teams. Reduces the Federal share of Medicaid costs for each quarter during which one or more of such utilization control programs do not meet the requirements set forth in this Act."
