States that, pursuant to an application by a small business concern, the head of any executive agency may terminate, on the basis of specified findings and for the convenience of the Government, any fixed-price contract between that agency and such small business concern. Requires a small business concern requesting relief under this Act to support that request with specified documentation and certification. Makes this Act applicable only to contracts entered into between January 1, 1972, and Januray 1, 1976."
