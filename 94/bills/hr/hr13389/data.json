    "text": "Guaranteed Employment Opportunities Act - Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish and maintain a pilot program to provide a guaranteed employment opportunity to any eligible individual. Defines \"eligible individual\" as any individual who: (1) is 18 years of age or older; (2) is a resident of the designated county in which he is applying for employment; (3) has not engaged in full-time employment during the three-week period immediately before the date of his application for employment; and (4) is a member of a family whose total income did not exceed $700 in the previous month. Provides that any county in the United States having a population of 20,000 or less may apply to the Secretary for participation in the pilot program. Specifies the required information in such application. Provides that the Secretary shall reimburse any business concern an amount equal to 50 percent of the Federal minimum wage for each eligible individual employed in a county participating in the pilot program. Allows such reimbursement for a one-year period following the date of employment of an eligible employee. Stipulates that such reimbursement shall be made for a maximum of 32 hours during any workweek. Sets forth a schedule correlating the number of employees of a business concern with the maximum number of employees for which it shall be entitled to reimbursement. Empowers the Secretary to reimburse any State or local government in an amount equal to 50 percent of the Federal minimum wage for up to 32 hours for each eligible employee employed in an eligible county by such State or local government. Specifies that a State or local government shall be entitled to reimbursement for any eligible employee who is employed: (1) directly by such State or local government in a designated county; or (2) in any program or activity, in a designated county, which receives funding from such State or local government; and is designed to improve the physical condition or appearance of the community involved, or to provide recreational or cultural enrichment to such community. Stipulates that a State, local government, or business concern shall not be entitled to any reimbursements under this Act if the Secretary determines that such State, local government, or business concern: (1) has terminated the employment of any employee, or has suspended any employee, for the purpose of replacing such employee with an eligible employee; or (2) has terminated the employment of any eligible employee without sufficient cause during the 90-day period immediately after the one-year reimbursement period applicable with respect to such eligible employee. Directs each participating county to establish an advisory council to assist in the administration of this Act in such county. Requires the Secretary to transmit to each House of the Congress quarterly reports reviewing the administration of this Act in each participating county, with a view toward determining the effect of this Act upon economic conditions. Authorizes to be appropriated to carry out the purposes of this Act $45,500,000 for fiscal year 1976. Stipulates that no more than 20 percent of such sum may be used in the administration of this Act."
