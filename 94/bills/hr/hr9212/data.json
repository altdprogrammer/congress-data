Authorizes the Corporation to require, as a condition for making any loans or loan gurarantees or investments, that the Corporation be given a share in the equity or royalties of projects developed by the recipient which the Corporation helped finance. Directs the Board of Directors of the Corporation to establish a Scientific Advisory Panel. Stipulates that no loan or loan guarantee may be made without the approval of the Advisory Panel."
