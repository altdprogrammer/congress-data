    "text": "Energy Efficiency Labeling Act - Provides that no person may sell or offer for sale any energy intensive consumer good unless such good bears clearly discernable and understandable label describing the annual average energy costs for the operation of such good. Requires that goods which do not meet standards established by the Federal Trade Commission shall bear a second label clearly stating that such goods are inefficient. Requires that any advertisement of such goods shall include a statement of the annual average energy costs for the operator of such good. Directs that inefficient goods shall not be advertised without a warning as to their inefficiency. Delegates to the Federal Trade Commission the responsibility for checking required labels and for educating the public as to the functions of required labels. Specifies civil and criminal penalties for the violation of this Act. Provides for injunctive relief to restrain violations. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Provides that any person may commence a civil action against any manufacturer who violates this Act or against any Federal agency which fails to perform any non-discretionary duty under this Act. Gives the district court jurisdiction over such actions without regard to the amount of controversy or the citizenship of the parties."
