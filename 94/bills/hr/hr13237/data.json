Imposes penalties for sexual contact or penetration of any person who has not attained the age of 18, notwithstanding such person's consent. Sets forth penalties for such assault according to specified criteria, including the consideration of aggravating factors. Specifies procedures for medical examination of alleged victims of offenses under this Act. Prohibits the introduction of evidence of the victim's prior sexual activity unless the court determines after an in camera hearing that the evidence is relevant and material and does not constitute an unnecessary invasion of privacy.
