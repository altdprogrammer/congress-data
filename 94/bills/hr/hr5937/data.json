    "text": "Mexican-American Rural Community Anti-Poverty Act - Provides that rural poverty among the Nations' Mexican-American population should be eliminated through those means most suitable to encourage the development of Mexican-American community life and culture. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to the governing boards of community land grants to provide services for the communities and to eradicate poverty. Enumerates the criteria to be met by an application for such funding and authorizes appropriations for the grants. Establishes a temporary commission to be known as the Special Commission on Rural Poverty and Guadalupe- Hidalgo Land Rights. Directs the Commission to make a comprehensive study and analysis of the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo between the United States and Mexico and determine: (1) what property rights were vested by the treaty in private landholders and their heirs; (2) whether those rights have been properly protected by the United States since 1848; and (3) if the Commission finds that such rights have not been properly protected, the most equitable means of settling claims it deems meritorious. Sets forth the membership and administrative powers of the Commission. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress and to the President on the activities carried out pursuant to this Act not later than March 1, 1976. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act."
