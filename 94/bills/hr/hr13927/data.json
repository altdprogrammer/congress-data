Title II: Claims for Benefits Filed on or Before December 31, 1976 - Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to prescribe standards for determining whether or not a miner or his dependent is eligible to receive benefits under this Act. Establishes a rebuttable presumption that respiratory diseases of miners employed for ten years or more in fluorspar mines arose out of such employment. Establishes criteria to determine the amount of monthly benefits to eligible applicants. Stipulates that no claim for benefits shall be denied solely on the basis of a ches roentgenogram. Allows reimbursement for reasonable medical expenses incurred by claimants in establishing their claims. Title III: Claims for Benefits after December 31, 1976 - Requires that claims for benefits on or after January 1,1977, be filed pursuant to State workmen's compensation law. Directs the Secretary of Labor to determine whether State workmen's compensation laws provide adequate coverage for eligible applicants. Authorizes the imposition of Federal standards if State laws are deemed inadequate for such purposes. Requires that claims for benefits be filed within three years of the discovery of total disability or within three years of the date of death of such miner. Stipulates that fluorspar mine operators shall secure payment of all benefits payable for miners employed in such mine. Requires such operators to carry insurance for the payment of benefits under this Act. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to initiate research for the purpose of devising simple and effective tests for determining the extent of disability due to employment in fluorspar mines. Authorizes the Appropriation of $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1975, 1976, and 1977 for the contruction of clincal facilities for the examination and treatment of fluorspar miners. Prohibits operators from discriminating against, or discharging, miners who are suffering from respiratory disease.
