    "date": "1975-09-08", 
    "text": "States that the purposes of this Act are: (1) to deal with shortages and dislocations of natural gas in the national distribution system; and (2) to provide protection of natural gas service to high priority consumers during periods of curtailed deliveries by companies engaged in the transportation or sale of natural gas in interstate commerce. Declares that the provisions of the Natural Gas Act shall not apply to the use of the facilities of a natural gas distribution company for the transportation of natural gas produced by an independent producer from lands other than Federal domain areas and sold directly to a high priority consumer of natural gas, provided that the rates applicable to the use of such facilities for such transportation are subject to State regulation. Defines the term \"independent producer\" as a person not engaged in the interstate transportation of natural gas. Defines the term \"natural gas distribution company\" as a person involved in the distribution or transportation of natural gas for public consumption, but not in interstate commerce. Authorizes the Federal Power Commission, at its discretion, to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity to a company engaged in the interstate transportation or sale of natural gas to transport natural gas produced by independent producers from other than Federal domain lands and sold to \"high priority consumers of natural gas\". Directs the Commission to define the term \"high priority consumers of natural gas\"."
