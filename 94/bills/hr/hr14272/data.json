    "text": "Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require that when any imported article, the container of which is required to be marked under such Act, is removed from the container and offered for sale in a new package, such new package shall be marked to indicate the country of origin. Directs the seizure and forfeiture of articles offered for sale in violation of this Act. Makes such requirements inapplicable to cases in which the Secretary of the Treasury finds that compliance would necessitate substantial changes in customary trade practices."
