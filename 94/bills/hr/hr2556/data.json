    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to furnish, upon written request, authenticated copies of reports filed by, or on behalf of, an individual or organization to such individual or organization or to the heir or agent of such individual or organization. Allows the Secretary to furnish copies of tabulations and other statistical materials which do not disclose the information reported by any individual or organization to any private person or agency requesting such information upon payment of the cost of such work. Prohibits any officer or employee of the Federal Government from disclosing the names of individuals or the addresses of their residences as collected in the censuses without the written permission of such individuals or their heirs or authorized agents. Directs the Secretary, in the year 1975 and every ten years thereafter, to conduct a mid-decade sample survey of population. Stipulates that information obtained in such mid-decade sample survey shall not be used for apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress for its recommendations for acceptance or rejection the questions proposed to be included in the decennial census and the mid-decade sample survey of population. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct special censuses for the government of any State or any political subdivision within a State upon payment to the Secretary of the cost of such special census. Increases the penalty for wrongful disclosure of census information by census employees from a fine of $1,000 and two years imprisonment to a fine of $5,000 and five years imprisonment. Extends such penalties to any officer or employee of the Federal Government who wrongfully discloses census information. Repeals the provisions for imprisonment for refusal to answer questions and for making false answers to a census questionnaire. Provides that if a provision enacted by this Act is held invalid, all valid provisions that are severable from the invalid provision remain in effect."
