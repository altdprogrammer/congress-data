Provides that in the case of an individual who has obtained one or more Federal or State health care education loans, no amount shall be included in gross income by reason of: (1) the discharge in whole or in part of the indebtedness of the individual under such a loan; or (2) the payment in whole or in part of the principal or interest under such a loan if such discharge or payment is pursuant to an agreement under which the individual agreed to perform services in his profession or occupation for a certain period of time in a certain geographical area for certain classes of employers."
