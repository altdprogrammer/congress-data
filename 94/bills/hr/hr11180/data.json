    "text": "Establishes the Kalaupapa National Historical Park Advisory Commission composed of 15 members (at least six of whom must be native Hawaiians) to study the feasibility of establishing a national park at the Kalaupapa settlement in the State of Hawaii. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit a report concerning the establishment of such a park to the President and the Congress within one year after the enactment of this Act and terminates the Commission at that time. Prohibits any Department or agency of the United States and the chief of Engineers, Department of the Army, from implementing, licensing, or assisting any project which in the opinion of the Secretary would diminish the value of cultural, historical, educational, or senic resources relating to the proposed park or the natural resources relating to or within one-quarter mile of the proposed park without the Secretary's permission. Authorizes to be appropriated $150,000 to carry out the provisions of this Act."
