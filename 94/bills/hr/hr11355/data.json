Requires that in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, the felon be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for not less than two nor more than 25 years. Declares that: (1) the execution of imposition of any term of imprisonment imposed under this Act may not be suspended, and probationary sentences may not be granted; and (2) any such term of imprisonment may not be imposed to run concurrently with any term of imprisonment imposed for the commission of such felony. (Amends 18 U.S.C. 924(c))"
