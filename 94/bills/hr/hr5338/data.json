    "text": "Provides, under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, that specific grants under such Act shall not be made to any State, unit of general local government, or public agency, unless there is in effect a law enforcement officer's bill of rights. States that such bill of rights must substantially provide as a minimum the rights enumerated in this Act, including: (1) the right of a law enforcement officer to engage in political activity during off-duty hours or to refrain from such activity; and (2) observance of specified standards with respect to the investigation of a law enforcement officer who is under investigation for alleged malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance of official duty, with a view to possible disciplinary action, demotion, dismissal, or criminal charges. States that such standards shall include: (1) informing the law enforcement officer of the nature of the investigation, the names of any complainants, and the identity and authority of the person conducting such investigation; (2) full recordation of the investigation; and (3) allowing the law enforcement officer to have his counsel present at any interrogation in connection with the investigation. Grants a law enforcement officer the right to recover pecuniary and other damages from persons violating any of the rights established under the bill of rights. Provides that no law enforcement officer shall be required to disclose, for the purposes of promotion or assignment, any item of his property, income, assets, debts, or expenditures. Establishes a Law Enforcement Officers' Grievance Commission composed of representatives of the general public, law enforcement agencies, and other public agencies. Gives the Commission the authority to receive, investigate, and determine grievances of any law enforcement officer, and to require testimony under oath and the production of documents. Defines terms used in this Act."
