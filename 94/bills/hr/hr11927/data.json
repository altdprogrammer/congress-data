    "text": "Sets forth the findings of Congress that marine fires are a major hazard to port populations and property and have resulted in substantial economic harm. States that the purposes of this Act are to: (1) provide for the adequate training of United States merchant seamen in marine fire prevention and onboard firefighting; (2) provide for the establishment of marine firefighting units which utilize the manpower and resources of local fire departments and are specially trained in shipboard firefighting techniques for purposes of training local fire departments and ship crews and providing on-the-scene emergency assistance for fighting marine fires; and (3) utilize the United States Coast Guard to coordinate and control marine firefighting activity by firefighting units established pursuant to this Act. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, under the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, to establish within the United States such number of marine firefighting regions as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Provides for the selection and establishment of regional and satellite firefighting units from each region. States that each unit shall, upon order by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, provide firefighting services at any marine fire in any region, and provide education and training in marine firefighting techniques to local fire departments and the crews of merchant vessels. Directs the Secretary to establish marine fire protection and firefighting training programs for members of regional and satellite units and for United States marine seamen. Permits the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with concerned States and local governmental agencies which set forth the responsibilities and functions which each party agrees to undertake in carrying out the purposes of this Act. Sets forth additional duties of the Secretary, including the responsibility for developing plans for each region relating to the utilization and pooling of marine firefighting resources. Stipulates that all seagoing vessels operating in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States shall have on board a prefire plan for the vessel. States that such prefire plan must be prepared by, or prepared under the supervision of, a regional or satellite unit, or approved by the Secretary if prepared by an entity other than a regional or satellite unit. Authorizes appropriations of up to $500,000 as a contingency fund to meet the expenses incurred by regional units, satellite units, and other assisting firefighting organizations which have not been reimbursed by vessels owners or operators receiving their services. Authorizes appropriations of sums necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
