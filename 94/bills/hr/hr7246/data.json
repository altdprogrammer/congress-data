Directs the President to promulgate a regulation providing for the mandatory allocation of curde oil, residual fuel oil, and each refined petroleum product so that each State and territory or possession of the United States recives an equitable share of available resources. Directs the President to promulgate a regulation to equalize the ceiling price throughout the United States at which each refined petroleum product and residual fuel oil is sold or exchanged consistent with reasonable variations in such prices to reflect different transportation costs and types or grades of such products or oil."
