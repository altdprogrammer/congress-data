States that the repayment of any farm purchase loan by any person who was at the time of such loan a nonowner-operator of a farm or an owner-operator of a farm, but not reliant on such farm for his principal source of income, shall, upon the request of such person at the time the loan is made or insured, be made as follows: (1) during the first twelve-month period beginning on the first day of the first month after the loan is made and during each of the next fourteen twelve-month periods, one-eightieth of the total amount to be financed including interest; and (2) (A) during each of the next twenty-five twelve-month periods, one twenty-fifth of an amount equal to the total amount to be financed including interest minus the amount paid pursuant to paragraph (1); or (B) at the close of the fifteenth twelve-month period, the balance of the principal plus an amount of interest which would have been due and payable during the first fifteen twelve-month periods had the forty-year loan been paid in four hundred and eighty equal installments; except that the balance of the loan shall become due and payable if such farm or any interest therin is transferred without the approval of the Secretary to any person ineligible for a loan. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
