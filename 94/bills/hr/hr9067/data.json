Authorizes States to use funds apportioned to them under specified provisions of such Act for the purpose of paying not more than 75 percent of the cost of a hunter education program, or a public target range program, or both. Stipulates that the non-Federal share of the cost of any such program may be derived from license fees paid by hunters, but not from moneys derived by the State through any other Federal grant program. Title II: Tax on Sale of Component Parts of Firearm Ammunition - Imposes a tax of 11 percent, to be paid by the manufacturer, upon component parts of ammunition (including, but not limited to, cartridge cases, primers, bullets, shots, wads and powders) for firearms (including pistols and revolvers)."
