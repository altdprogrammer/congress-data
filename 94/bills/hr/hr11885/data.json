Authorizes access, as soon as practicable after deposit, to such records to persons using such material solely for medical research purposes. Allows access to such material to persons using such material solely for geneological or historical purposes seventy-five years after the date of the census. Directs the Archivist to insure that such persons are bona fide researchers engaged in legitimate scholarly, geneological or scientific pursuits. Forbids the use of any such information to the detriment of the persons to whom such information relates. Requires that any such record deposited be transferred only upon the condition that the use of such records be subject to limitations no less restrictive than the limitations required under the this Act."
