    "text": "Title I: Oil Pricing Act - Extends the authority of the President to promulgate regulations providing for the mandatory allocation of crude oil, residual fuel oil and refined petroleum products until January 31, 1979. Requires such regulations to provide for a primary ceiling price for controlled old crude oil not to exceed the ceiling price for controlled old crude oil pursuant to the regulation in effect on August 31, 1975, and for a secondary ceiling price for all crude oil other than controlled old crude oil. States that if the President finds at any time after November 1, 1975, that there is no shortage of a particular oil or product, and that exempting such product from regulation will not have an adverse effect on the supply of any other oil or refined petroleum products, he may exempt such item from regulations pertaining to either allocation of amounts or specifications of price. Title II: Oil Deregulation Tax Act - Imposes an excise tax under the Internal Revenue Code on the deregulation profits from taxable domestic crude oil removed from the premises during each taxable period, in an amount equal to 90 percent of the deregulation profit from each taxable barrel of crude oil removed. Allows a tax credit for persons subject to such tax in an amount equal to the lower of 50 percent of the amount of tax imposed for such taxable period or such person's plowback investment for such taxable period. Requires the purchaser of domestic crude oil to furnish to the person liable for such tax a monthly statement showing specified information, including: (1) the amount of domestic crude oil purchased from such person during such month, and (2) the amount of taxable domestic crude oil purchased from such person during such month. Establishes criminal penalties for willful failure to furnish required information regarding the deregulation profits tax on domestic crude oil."
