Establishes in the Department of Labor a National Youth Full Employment Board, to be composed of members appointed by the Secretary who shall include a majority of representatives from labor, civil rights, youth, and women's organizations, chosen from among nominees submitted by such organizations. Directs the Secretary to carry out his functions under this Act in such a way that: (1) within one year of the date of enactment of this Act, the rate of unemployment among youths between the ages of 16 and 24 inclusive, in any political subdivision of any State shall not exceed ten percent of the total labor force in such subdivision; (2) within two years of the date of enactment of this Act, the rate of unemployment among such youths in any political subdivision of any State shall not exceed three percent of the total labor force in such subdivision; and (3) within three years of the date of enactment of this Act, the rate of unemployment among such youths shall be effectively zero throughout the United States. Establishes in the Department of Labor a Youth Job Guarantee Office, to be headed by a Director to be appointed by the Board, through which the Secretary shall carry out the program under this Act, so that any eligible individual who applies for assistance under this Act shall be placed in useful and rewarding employment in a job on a project assisted under this Act or in other private or public employment. Directs the Secretary to establish a regional office of the Youth Job Guarantee Office in each State. Directs the Secretary to insure that among projects planned adequate consideration be given to such individuals and groups as may face special obstacles in finding and holding useful and rewarding employment and to provide or have provided through the coordination of existing programs special assistance including but not limited to counseling, training, and, where necessary, transportation and migration assistance. States that such individuals and groups shall include, among others: (1) those suffering from past or present discrimination or bias on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, or national origin; (2) the physically or mentally handicapped; and (3) potentially employable recipients of public assistance. Prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, political affiliation or belief in the employment of individuals under this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated for each of fiscal years 1976, 1977, and 1978, and for the period beginning July 1, 1976, and ending September 30, 1976, such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
