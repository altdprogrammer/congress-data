    "text": "National Act for School Construction - Requires the Commissioner of Education to develop and carry out a program under which he will make grants to local educational agencies to share in the construction costs of projects to replace deficient elementary and secondary schools. States that a school shall be deemed to be deficient if: (1) it is so situated that it is in particular danger from the effects of natural disasters, such as earthquakes and floods; (2) it is so constructed or is in such condition that students and teachers are in physical danger from fire or other threat; or (3) by reason of obsolescence, deterioration, or design is no longer suitable for providing high quality elementary or secondary education. Provides that a grant under this Act shall not exceed one-third of the cost of the project with the remainder of the cost borne equally by the State and the local educational agency. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for the fiscal year 1973 and each succeeding fiscal year."
