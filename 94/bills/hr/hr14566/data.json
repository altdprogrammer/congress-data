    "text": "Freestone Peach Research and Education Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to issue orders applicable to handlers of freestone peaches and authorizes the issuance of orders for the collection of assessments on freestone peaches. States that such funds may be used for research and education programs for freestone peaches. Directs the Secretary to issue plans, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, to effectuate the declared policy of this Act. Requires that such a plan provide for the establishment of a National Freestone Peach Research and Education Board comprised of producers and consumer representatives whose powers shall include: (1) the administration of plans; (2) investigating violations of such plans; (3) the development, review, consideration, and approval of research and education projects; and (4) making recommendations to the Secretary for fixing the assessment rate required to meet all obligations incurred in the administration of plans. Authorizes the Board to return up to 50 percent of the assessments collected to the States on a pro-rata basis for freestone peach projects. Allows peach producers to receive a refund of any assessment collected from him if such producer is not in favor of the programs provided under this Act. Makes it the responsibility of each handler, designated by the Board to collect assessments, to make payments to the Board. Sets forth administrative and judicial review procedures for persons objecting to plans issued under this Act. Establishes civil penalties for handlers who violate any provision of an order issued by the Secretary under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to investigate violations of plans issued pursuant to this Act. Directs the Secretary to conduct a referendum among producers to determine whether the issuance of any plan is approved by such producers. Requires the Secretary to terminate or suspend the operation of any plan which obstructs or does not effectuate the declared policy of this Act, or if producers, by referendum, favor such termination or suspension. Authorizes appropriations in such amounts as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
