    "text": "Student Freedom of Choice Act - States that no department employee of the United States empowered to extend Federal financial assistance to any program at any public school shall withhold, or threaten to withhold, such financial assistance: (1) on account of the racial composition of the student body at any public school or in any class where the school board maintains, in respect to such public school and class, a freedom of choice system: (2) to coerce or induce the school board to transport students to any other public school for the purpose of altering the racial composition of the student body; (3) to coerce or induce any school board to close any public school, and transfer the students from it to another public school for the purpose of altering the racial composition of the student body; and (4) to coerce or induce the school board to transfer any faculty member from the public school in which the member of the faculty contracts to serve to some other public school for the purpose of altering the racial composition of the faculty. Provides that whenever this Act is violated, the school board aggrieved, or the parent of any student affected, or any student affected, or any member of any faculty affected, may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States. Provides that no court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to make any decision, enter any judgment, or issue any order: (1) requiring any school board to make any change in the racial composition of the student body at any public school or in any class at any public school to which students are assigned in conformity with a freedom of choice system; or (2) requiring any school board to transport any students in order to effect a change in the racial composition of the student body; or (3) denying to any student the right or privilege of attending any public school or class at any public school chosen by the parent of such student in conformity with a freedom of choice system; or (4) requiring any school board to close any school and tranfer the students from the closed school to any other school for the purpose of altering the racial composition of the student body; or (5) precluding any school board from carrying into effect any provision of any contract between it and any member of the faculty of any public school it operates specifying the public school where the member of the faculty is to perform his or her duties under the contract."
