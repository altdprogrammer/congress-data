    "text": "Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act Amendments - Revises the definition of the term \"interstate transmission facilities\" to exclude any facility which transports gas from an interstate gas pipeline to a direct sales customer purchasing gas for its own consumption. Defines the term \"intrastate pipeline transportation\" to include such facilities. States that the provisions of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act shall not apply to intrastate pipeline transmission as defined in this Act when the safety standards applicable to such transmission are regulated by a State agency. Changes from March 17 to June 15 the date on which the Secretary of Transportation is required to present to the President an annual report on the administration of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act. Extends through fiscal year 1977 the authorization of appropriations for the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act."
