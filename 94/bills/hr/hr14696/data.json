    "text": "Omnibus Energy Conservation Act - Title I: Energy Conservation in Residential Housing, Commercial and Public Buildings, and Industrial Plants - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Federal Energy Administrator to establish a voluntary standard and certification program for products designed to conserve energy in buildings. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration to prescribe guidelines for the development and preparation of State energy conservation implementation programs. Requires that States be given an opportunity to participate in the drafting of such guidelines. Establishes eligibility criteria for State energy conservation implementation programs in order to receive Federal assistance under this Act. Imposes a preliminary requirement that the State establish a State energy conservation advisory committee to assist in the formulation of such program. Authorizes the Administrator to provide Federal financial assistance to States whose proposed energy conservation programs meet specified criteria. Lists factors to be considered in determining the amount of such assistance. Stipulates that no State shall receive more than ten percent of the national total in each category of financial assistance. Authorizes the appropriation of the following sums to assist eligible State programs: $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1977, and $50,000,000 per fiscal year for fiscal years 1978, 1979, and 1980. Authorizes the Administrator to guarantee loans and other obligations issued to finance energy conservation measures consistent with the purposes of this Act. Limits the aggregate amount of outstanding guarantees under this Act to $4,500,000,000. Limits the total amount of guarantees which may be issued to any one borrower to $2,000,000. Requires annual reports to the Congress on State energy conservation implementation programs. Amends the Energy Conservation and Insulation of Buildings Act of 1976 to authorize additional appropriations of $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1977, $50,000,000 per fiscal year for fiscal years 1978 and 1979; and $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1980 to assist low-income persons under the provisions of such Act. Amends the National Housing Act to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to assist in the financing of energy conservation measures. Authorizes appropriations for such assistance payments of $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1977, and $200,000,000 per fiscal year for fiscal years 1978 - 1980. Amends the Small Business Act to empower the Small Business Administration to make loans to small business concerns for implementation of energy conservation measures. Limits the total amount of such loans under the Act to $300,000,000. Stipulates that the total amount of such payments to lending institutions under the Act shall not exceed $60,000,000. Title II: Implementation of Energy Conservation, Programs; Energy Efficiency Research, Development and Demonstration - Establishes in the Energy Research and Development Administration the Energy Extension Service. Directs the Service to develop and implement a comprehensive program for the identification, development, and demonstration of energy conserving practices, techniques, materials, and equipment for: (1) agricultural, commercial, and small business operations; and (2) new and existing residential, commercial, or agricultural structures. Requires that such programs include technical assistance, instruction, and practical demonstrations in energy conservation. Establishes procedures for submission of State plans for the conduct of energy extension service activities within each State in accordance with Federal guidelines. Authorizes financial assistance to States which have plans approved by the Director of the Energy Extension Service. Directs the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to prepare a plan for Federal energy education, extension, and information programs. Establishes a National Energy Extension Service Advisory Board to carry on a continuing review of Federal energy extension programs. Authorizes the Administrator of Energy Research and Development to provide financial assistance for the development of State and regional energy conservation research and development institutes on a matching basis. Directs the Administrator to establish an energy use efficiency project designed to demonstrate the feasibility of energy efficiency enhancement in the residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors. Authorizes additional research, development, and demonstration programs to increase the commercial opportunities for utilization of energy efficient systems. Directs the Administrator to develop, within 180 days after the enactment of this Act, performance standards and criteria for energy efficiency equipment and processes. Requires use by Federal agencies of newly-developed energy efficiency technologies. Directs the Administrator to study various institutional factors which may tend to bias economic sectors against the use of energy efficient systems and to report the results to the Congress."
