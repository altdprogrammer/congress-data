    "text": "Amends the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to include in the Renewable Resource Program, national program recommendations which take into account specified policy objectives. Requires the Secretary to provide for public participation in the formulation and review of proposed land management plans for units of the National Forest System. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations that set out the process for the development and revision of such land management plans. Requires that such regulations specify procedures to insure that plans are prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act and guidelines set out in this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to appraise and sell so much of the trees and other forest products found upon National Park System lands as may further the policies set forth in the Multiple Use and Sustained Yield Act, and the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974. Repeals the requirement that such forest products be sold for use only in the United States or territory in which the timber reservation from which such products were taken is located. Increases to $10,000 in appraised value the maximum value of timber and cord wood which the Secretary may sell without advertisement."
