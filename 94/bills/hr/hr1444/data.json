    "text": "Provides that a Federal employee or Member of Congress, who at the time of retiring elects a reduced annuity and later marries, may irrevocably elect within one year after the marriage an annuity computed according to specified provisions of law. Defines \"spouse,\" for purposes of survivor annuities, as one who: (1) was married to the employee, Member, or annuitant for at least one year immediately before the death of the employee, Member, or annuitant; or (2) is the parent of issue by such marriage. States that when an annuitant, except an annuitant who did not elect an annuity as provided by law, dies and is survived by a spouse, the spouse is entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of an annuity computed according to law as may apply with respect to the annuitant. Makes provision for specified increases in annuity payments to survivors. States that the annuity of a retired employee or Member who, immediately before the date of enactment of this Act, was receiving a reduced annuity in order to provide an annuity for a surviving spouse, shall be recomputed and paid as if the annuity had not been so reduced. Provides for recomputing the annuities of surviving spouses and spouses of annuitants who retired or separated prior to the date of enactment of this Act. (Amends 5 U.S.C. 8339 (a); 8341; 8344(a))"
