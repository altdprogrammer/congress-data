    "text": "Federal Correctional Ombudsman Act - Establishes an office of the United States Correctional Ombudsman. Provides that the Chief Ombudsman shall have the authority to investigate in such manner as he sees fit, either upon complaint or upon his own initiative, any administrative act of the Bureau of Prisons or the Board of Parole, pertaining to the treatment of any Federal prisoner or parolee, or the conditions in any Federal penal or correctional institution. Provides that if, after any investigation, the chief ombudsman finds that any administrative act is: (1) contrary to law; (2) unreasonable, unfair, oppresive, or unnecessarily discriminatory; (3) based on mistaken ascertainment of fact; (4) based on improper or irrelevant grounds; (5) performed in an inefficient manner; (6) unclear or inadequately explained when reasons should have been revealed; or (7) otherwise objectionable; he shall consult with the appropriate official or employee in order to make a satisfactory disposition of the matter. States that if the Chief Ombudsman believes that an administrative act has been dictated by laws whose results are unfair or otherwise objectionable, he shall notify the appropriate committees of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. Provides that no information disclosed to any ombudsman or to any staff or employee of the Office in connection with an investigation under this Act shall be disclosed to any other person except to the extent the Chief Ombudsman determines necessary to carry out the purpose of this Act. Requires the Chief Ombudsman to report annually to the Congress on the operations of the Office."
