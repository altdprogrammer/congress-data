    "text": "Honey and Honey Products Inspection and Identification Act - Prohibits the importation of honey into the United States unless the Secretary of Agriculture has certified that such imports originate from supplies which are pure and wholesome and unless the foreign apiaries and plants in which such honey was produced, manufactured or processed comply with minimum standards of sanitation prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to this Act. States that such standards shall be comparable to those for domestic honey. Requires that the packaging and labeling of imported honey specify the country of origin. Directs the Secretary, to the extent necessary to carry out this Act, to cause imported honey to be inspected and to require such honey to be accompanied by a certificate of compliance. Requires that the package or container of any food product which is made in whole or in part of any imported honey be labeled as \"imported\" or \"imported in part\" as the case may be. Sets forth criminal penalties for violation of such requirement. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe such regulations as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Directs the Secretary to prescribe such assessments and fees on imported honey as he determines necessary to cover the cost of the inspections, labeling, and certifications required under this Act. Authorizes appropriations in such amounts as may be necessary to carry out the administration and supervision of the provisions of this Act."
