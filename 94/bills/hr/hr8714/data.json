Provides for enlargement of the extended benefit period for railroad employees leaving work involuntarily and with less than 10 years of service by up to 65 days otherwise compensable but for the fact that benefits have been exhausted for that benefit year. Sets forth a method for determining the beginning date of an extended benefit period. Increases the rate of employers' contributions to the railroad unemployment insurance account when the amount in such account drops below $300,000,000 on September 30 of any year. Decreases the qualifying period for first-year employees for railroad unemployment benefits from 7 to 5 months of railroad employment during such year. =Title II: Amendments to the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 and the Railroad Retirement Tax Act= - Authorizes to be appropriated from time to time such sums as may be necessary to provide for the expenses of the Board in administering the provisions of this Act."
