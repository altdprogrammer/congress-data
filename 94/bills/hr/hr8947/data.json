Authorizes the Administrator to take such action as may be necessary to insure the maximum utilization of coal so long as the present energy crisis exists. Sets forth the powers and authority of the Administrator under the provisions of this Act, including the following: (1) to set goals for the production and conversion of coal into energy; (2) to encourage, assist, and take such steps as shall provide for increased production, transportation, and conversion of coal into energy; (3) to issue orders which shall constitute a prior claim upon producers of materials and supplies essential to the increased production, transportation, and utilization of coal; (4) to afford necessary, reasonable, and proper financial assistance to persons, firms, or corporations converting to the use of coal as a source of energy; and (5) to enter into contracts with coal producers in order to increase the production of coal in the United States. Authorizes the Administrator to establish a program for underwriting such financial aid as he deems necessary to assure the continuance of a viable production, transportation, conversion, and utilization segment of the coal industry. Requires the Administrator to minimize the pollution of the air incident to the burning of coal by rendering all necessary and proper financial assistance to those producing, transporting, or using coal to enable them to obtain and use the best available methods and equipment for minimizing pollution and environmental damage. Permits the Administrator to seek a certificate of compliance from the Environmental Protection Agency with regard to any undertaking to increase the utilization of coal. Empowers the Administrator to engage in research and development projects which will increase the utilization of coal as an energy source. Grants the Administrator the power to prohibit the export of coal. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be ncesssary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
