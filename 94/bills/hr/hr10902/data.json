Rept. 94-1392) Revises the Internal Revenue Code to provide that the loss from the sale or exchange of any security shall be considered as a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset unless the taxpayer notified the Secretary of the Treasury within 30 days of the acquisition of such security that the security was not acquired as an investment. Provides that if the required notification was given, any gain on the sale or exchange of such security shall be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a security which is not a capital asset. Requires the withholding of Federal income taxes where paramutuel wagering winnings on horse races, dog races, and jai alai are $600 or more and the odds are at least 200 to one or more. Eliminates the reporting requirement for any winnings to which withholding applies."
