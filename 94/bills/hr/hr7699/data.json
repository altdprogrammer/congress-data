Requires a State which desires to carry out such functions to submit to the Secretary the program it proposes to establish and administer under State law. Directs the Secretary to approve such a State plan unless he determines that adequate authority does not exist: (1) to insure compliance with the applicable requirements of such functions, including but not limited to the establishment of necessary civil and criminal penalties and other means of enforcement; or (2) in the case of permits which may be issued by the State in carrying out such functions, to provide for their issuance, modification, and termination, including public notice of each such permit application and opportunities for public hearings. Authorizes the Secretary to withdraw approval of a State program if he determines that it fails to conform to Federal law."
