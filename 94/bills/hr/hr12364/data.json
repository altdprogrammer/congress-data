    "text": "Law Enforcement Assistance Amendments - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to prohibit any individual's exclusion, on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex, from programs funded under such Act. Directs the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to notify the State chief executive of any violation of this prohibition, and to suspend payments to the State government under such Act if compliance is not secured within 60 days of notification. Stipulates that payments shall be resumed only if: (1) the violating State or local government unit enters into a compliance agreement approved by the Administration and the Attorney General; (2) the violating government complies fully with the final order or judgment of a Federal court; or (3) after a hearing, the Administration fails to demonstrate noncompliance. Authorizes the United States Attorney General, State or local government officials, and individuals aggrieved by violations of this Act to institute a civil action for preventive relief in a United States court."
