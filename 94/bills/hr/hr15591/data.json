    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1976-09-16", 
    "text": "Commodity Supplemental Food Program Act - Revises the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to require the Secretary of Agriculture to pay to each State or local agency administering any commodity supplemental food program referred to as a supplemental feeding program under the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973, the administrative costs for such program in an amount not exceeding 20 percent of the total amount made available to such State or agency for such program in any fiscal year. States that, notwithstanding such limitation, the Secretary shall pay the total expenses necessary for successful operation of such program during the first 90 days after enactment of this Act or until the commodity supplemental food program reaches its projected caseload level, whichever is longer. Directs each State or local agency participating in such program to submit a report to the Secretary describing the manner in which nutrition education services are being provided to the recipients of food under such program. States that the payment of administrative expenses by the Secretary shall not be conditioned upon the submission of such report. Requires the maintenance in such programs of the types and varieties of commodities in the same proportional amounts which are currently available or which were available in the the 1974 fiscal year, whichever is greater. Directs the Secretary to require that specified foods be made available to recipients under such program. Allows such program to exist in the same area in which another food program is in operation if the State or local agency establishes safeguards to prevent households and individuals from participating in both programs. Prevents any State or local agency from prohibiting children under six years of age from receiving benefits under such programs if they are otherwise eligible to receive such benefits."
