    "date": "1976-10-04", 
    "text": "(Public law 94-455) Tax Reform Act - =Title I: Short Title and Amendment of 1954 Code= - Provides that this Act may be known as the Tax Reform Act of 1976. Requires in the case of an individual or an electing small business corporation that construction period interest and taxes are to be capitalized in the year in which they are paid or incurred and amortized over a ten year period. =Title II: Other Amendments Related to Tax Shelters= - Provides that when residential real estate is sold the gain is fully recaptured as ordinary income to the extent of post 1975 depreciation in excess of straight line depreciation. Provides that in the case of taxpayers (other than corporations) engaged in: (1) holding, producing, or distributing motion picture films or video tapes; (2) farming; (3) leasing specified (Sec. 1245) property; or (4) exploring for or exploiting oil and gas resources, the loss from such activities shall be allowed only to the extent of the aggregate amount with respect to which the taxpayer is at risk. Provides that amounts deducted for intangible drilling expenses on productive wells be recaptured upon disposition of such property by treating the amount realized as ordinary income to the extent such amounts exceed amounts allowable as intangible expenses capitalized over the useful life of the well. Prohibits the addition of any amount to the excess deductions account (EDA) for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975. Requires farming syndicates: (1) to deduct expenses for feed, seed, fertilizer, and other farm supplies only when used or consumed; (2) to capitalize costs of poultry; and (3) to capitalize the costs of planting, cultivating, maintaining and developing a grove, orchard or vineyard. Requires any corporation, other than a subchapter S corporation or a family corporation, and any partnership in which a corporation is a partner, to use the accrual method of accounting and to capitalize preproductive period expenses. Requires a cash method taxpayer to deduct prepaid interest over the period of the loan to the extent the interest represents the cost of using the borrowed funds during each period. Limits the deduction for interest on investment indebtedness to $10,000 per year plus the taxpayers net investment income. Limits deductions for amounts attributable to the production of a film, sound recording, book, or similar property to those taxable years ending during the period during which the taxpayer reasonably may be expected to receive substantially all of the income he will receive from any such property. States that if a sports franchise is sold, and in connection with such sale there is a transfer of a player contract, the basis on such contract to the transferee shall not exceed the sum of the adjusted basis of such contract to the transferor plus the gain recognized by the transferor on the transfer. Provides a presumption that not more than 50 percent of the consideration paid for a sports franchise is allocable to player contracts. Limits the amount of the additional first-year depreciation that a partnership can pass through to its partners in any taxable year to $2,000. Requires that fees paid in connection with the organization and syndication of a partnership be capitalized. Provides that partnership income or losses are to be allocable to a partner only for the portion of the year such partner is a member of a partnership. Disallows partnership special allocations if such allocation lacks \"substantial economic effect\". Restricts the amount of partnership liabilities which may be included in a limited partner's basis in his partnership interest to an amount equal to any further contributions which such limited partner is obligated to make pursuant to the partnership agreement. =Title III: Minimum Tax and Maximum Tax= - Imposes a minimum tax on individuals of 15 percent of the amount by which the sum of the items of tax preference exceeds the allowable exemption, which is the greater of $10,000 ($5,000 for married persons filing separately) or the tax liability. Sets forth provisions relating to the following preference items: excess itemized deductions, intangible drilling costs, and acceleration on all personal property subject to a lease. Sets a maximum tax rate of 50 percent where the taxpayer has personal service income. =Title IV: Extensions of Individual Income Tax Reductions= - Extends the individual income tax credits authorized by the Revenue Reduction Act of 1975. Sets the standard deduction low income allowance at $2,100 in the case of joint returns, $1,700 in the case of single persons; and sets the percentage standard deduction at 16 percent of the adjusted gross income, up to $2,800 in the case of joint returns and $2,400 in the case of single persons. Sets the earned income credit at ten percent of earned income up to $4,000. =Title V: Tax Simplification in the Individual Income Tax= - Imposes a tax on individuals with incomes under $20,000 according to tables to be prepared, which follow current tax rates. Requires individuals using such tables to subtract from their adjusted gross income the amount of their personal exemptions and itemized or standard deductions. Allows the alimony deduction to be taken as a deduction from gross income rather than as a deduction from adjusted gross income. Prescribes a tax credit for individuals over 65. Allows a tax credit of 20 percent of the employment-related expenses arising for household and dependent care services. Revises the sick pay exclusion to provide a maximum annual exclusion of $5200 for taxpayers under age 65 who are permanently and totally disabled. Reduces the exclusion on a dollar for dollar basis by the taxpayer's income in excess of $15,000. Provides that members of the armed services who enlist after September 24, 1975 will be allowed to exclude military disability payments from their gross income only if the payments are directly related to \"combat injuries\". Defines \"combat injuries\" for purposes of such exclusion. Increases the maximum deduction for premove househunting and temporary living expenses at the new job location from $1,000 to $1,500, and increases from $2,500 to $3,000 the maximum deduction for qualified expenses for the sale, purchase, or lease of a residence. Requires the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation to make a full study regarding simplification and indexing of the tax laws. =Title VI: Business Related Individual Income Tax Provisions= - Prohibits a taxpayer from deducting any expenses attributable to the use of his home for business purposes except with respect to such portion of the home that is used exclusively on a regular basis as: (1) the taxpayer's principal place of business; (2) a place of business which is used for patients, clients, or customers in meeting or dealing with the taxpayer in the normal course of business; or (3) the place of the taxpayer's trade or business, but which is a separate structure not attached to the dwelling unit. Allows deductions for expenses incurred in attending not more than two conventions, educational seminars, or similar meetings outside the United States, its possessions, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific. Provides that stock options for employees granted after May 20, 1976, whether or not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code, will be governed by the existing tax treatment of nonqualified stock options. Provides that the tax home of a State legislator for purposes of the deduction for trade or business expended in connection therewith, is the place of residence of the legislator within the district which he represents. Specifies a dollar limitation on amounts allowable as such a deduction. =Title VII: Accumulation Trusts= - Determines the tax attributable to the accumulation distribution from trusts by averaging the distribution over a number of years equal to the number of years over which the income was earned by the trust. Disallows any refunds or credits to trust beneficiaries or trusts as a result of any accumulation distributions. Provides that the \"throwback rule\" is not to apply to accumulation distributions while the beneficiary was a minor. Provides that a distribution made or required to be made by a trust to a beneficiary in a year which does not exceed the income of the trust for the year is not to be treated as an accumulation distribution for that year. Repeals the existing capital gain \"throwback rule\" (treats such gain as if the transferor had realized the gain and then transferred the net proceeds from the sale after tax to the trust corpus).
