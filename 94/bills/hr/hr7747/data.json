    "text": "Federal Municipal Credit Corporation Act - Declares it to be the finding of Congress that the financial health of the Nation's municipalities has suffered because of a decline in investor confidence in the municipal bond markets and that the Federal Government has a responsibility to attempt to remedy this situation. Declares it to be the purpose of this Act to establish the Federal Municipal Credit Corporation in order to restore public confidence in public markets for municipal bonds. Defines terms used in this Act. Establishes the Federal Municipal Bond Corporation, with its principal office in the District of Columbia. States that the President shall, with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint the incorporators of the Corporation. States that the incorporators shall arrange for an initial stock offering and shall serve as the initial board of directors. Authorizes the Corporation to issue common and preferred stock. States that each class of stock shall be eligible for dividends with only the common stock having voting rights. Authorizes the Corporation to sell its bonds, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness in any amount. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase any bonds issued under this Act to a limit of $2,000,000,000. Authorizes the Secretary to use the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act to purchase the Corporation's bonds.
