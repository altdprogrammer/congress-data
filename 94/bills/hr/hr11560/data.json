    "text": "Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to require proof of automobile property and personal liability insurance on automobiles imported for the personal use of nonresidents and foreign government personnel, in an amount equal to the minimum insurance requirements in those States in which the vehicle will be operated. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to forward identifying information on such vehicles to the Secretary of Transportation who shall forward such information to the appropriate State agency responsible for motor vehicle registration. Excludes from such requirements automobiles which will be in the United States for not more than 30 days. Requires importers of automobiles so excluded to forward the required information to the nearest customs officer in the event the vehicle remains in the country for 40 days. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to impose a fine of $5,000 upon violators of this Act who had no notice of such requirements. Sets forth penalties of $5,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, for knowingly failing to furnish information required under this Act."
