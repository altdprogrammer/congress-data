    "text": "Land Use and Resource Covservation Act - Title I: Findings, Policy, Definitions - Sets forth the findings of Congress that there is a national interest in effective land use decision making in order to promote the general welfare, to secure a wise and balanced allocation of resources, to provide for the protection and enhancement of the environment, and to conserve energy. States that it is the policy of the Federal Government, in cooperation with the States, to encourage and support the establishment of effective land use planning and management programs which will assure that the lands in the Nation are used in ways that create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony. Defines the terms used in this Act. Defines \"areas of critical State concern\" as meaning areas on non-Federal lands which the State determines to be of more than local concern in view of the significant damage to life, property, the quality of the environment, or the long-term public interest which could occur from uncontrolled or incompatible development. Title II: Federal Grants for State and Indian Land Use Programs - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to make annual grants to assist the States in the development and administration of a land use program. States that initial grants may be made as soon as the State has established a State land use planning agency and an advisory council which participates in the development of the State land use program and consults, reviews, and and comments on the State land use program. Authorizes the Secretary to make additional grants to the States for developing procedures to simplify the processing of permits, licenses and other governmental decisions which are prerequisites to proposed development activities. Provides appeal procedures for States which the Secretary has determined are ineligible for grants. States that in implementing its land use program, a State may utilize (1) direct State land use planning and regulation, (2) action by local governments under criteria and standards established and supervised by the State, or (3) a combination of the two techniques. Directs the Secretary to appoint a task force group to investigate and report to him concerning the need for and the form of grant program providing for land use planning by Indian tribes for Indian reservations and other tribal lands. Encourages the States to coordinate land use planning activities on an interstate basis. Title III: State Land Use Programs - Stipulates that the State land use program shall include a statement of policies defining the State's role in land use decisions which are of more than local concern, including decisions affecting key facilities, large scale subdivision or development projects, developments of regional impact, and areas of critical State concern. Requires that State programs include (1) a process to inventory the land and water resources within the State, and (2) a process for designating which of the areas inventoried are determined to be of critical State concern, and policies and methods for the regulation of development within areas of critical state concern. States that programs must include policies and procedures designed to (1) identify prime food and fiber producing lands, (2) consider the location of large scale subdivision or development projects, (3) guide the use of land in areas which may be impacted by key facilities and major improvement, (4) consider the environmental, social, and economic impact of developments of regional impact, and (5) encourage development and land use patterns designed to conserve energy. Title IV: Federal Actions and Federal Lands - States that Federal Activities significantly affecting land use on non-Federal land must be consistent with land use programs which conform to the provisions of this Act, except in cases of overriding national interest as determined by the President. Requires applicants for Federal licenses or permits to certify that any proposed activities affecting land use are in compliance with the States' land program. Provides that each public land management agency head shall develop, maintain, and revise where appropriate land use plans for public lands under his jurisdiction. Requires that provision be made for substantial and meaningful public involvement and participation of appropriate State and local government representatives in the development, revision, and implementation of land use plans, guidelines, rules, and regulations for public lands. Title V: Administration - Establishes in the Department of the Interior an Office of Land Use Administration. States that the Secretary shall, through the Office, administer the land use grant program and undertake specified programs and responsibilites to achieve the objectives of this Act. Requires the Secretary to coordinate his activities pursuant to this Act with all other interested Federal agencies. Directs the Executive Office of the President to issue guidelines to the Federal departments and agencies to assist them in carrying out the requirements of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to study and report to the Congress within 3 years the need for, and form of, national land use policies. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act. Limits the amount of grants to States to 75 percent of the costs of developing and administering the land use program within the State."
