Provides that the Secretary of the Treasury may exempt licensed importers, manufacturers, dealers, purchasers, or transporters of handguns from the above provision if their efforts are in behalf of the United States Government. Authorizes also the exemption of licensed pistol clubs from such restrictions. Provides for the voluntary delivery of handguns to any law enforcement agency for disposition, and states that the transferor shall be entitled to a payment of $25 or the fair market value of the handgun, whichever is greater. Authorizes the Secretary to license pistol clubs conforming to specified minimal standards, including the maintenance of possession and control of the handguns used by its members. Imposes criminal penalties on persons who violate any provision or knowingly make any false statement of representation with respect to the information required to be kept in the records of a licensed pistol club or in applying for any license. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe such rules and regulations as he deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
