Imposes penalties for such disclosure. Bars prosecution for such offense where the information disclosed was not lawfully classified and where there was no process by which the defendant could obtain review of the continuing necessity for the classification. Permits the Attorney General to apply to the appropriate court for an order enjoining commission of an offense under this Act whenever the Director judges that such an offense is about to be committed."
