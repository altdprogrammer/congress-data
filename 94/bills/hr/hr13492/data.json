    "text": "Directs the Federal courts to consider, in their determinations of the imposition of terms of imprisonment for criminal offenses, the following factors: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense and the providing of adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (3) whether other less restrictive sanctions have been applied to the defendant frequently or recently; and (4) any sentencing guidelines established by the Commission under this Act. Establishes a United States Commission on Sentencing as an independent commission within the judicial branch of the United States Government to consist of five members appointed by the United States Judicial Conference. Directs such Commission to promulgate and distribute to all Federal courts guidelines for sentencing consistent with this Act. Empowers the Commission to establish general policies and rules necessary to carry out this Act. Empowers the Commission to utilize the services and information of other Federal, State, local and private agencies with or without reimbursement therefor. Empowers the Commission to establish a research and development program for the purpose of: (1) serving as a clearinghouse and information center for the collection, preparation, and dissemination of information on Federal sentencing practices; and (2) assisting and serving in a consulting capacity to Federal courts, departments, and agencies in the development, maintenance, and coordination of sound sentencing practices. Empowers the Commission to devise and conduct a training program of short-term instruction in sentencing techniques for judicial and probation personnel and other persons connected with the sentencing process. Requires the Commission to report annually to the Congress, the Judicial Conference, and the President on its activities. (Adds 18 U.S.C. 3579, 3621, 3657, 3742, 3801-5)"
