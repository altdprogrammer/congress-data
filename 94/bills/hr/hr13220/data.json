Amends the Natural Gas Act to direct the Commission, within 120 days after the enactment of this Act, to take all action it determines necessary to facilitate the construction, maintenance, and operation of such pipeline, including the issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Stipulates that such action shall be consistent with the finding of the final environmental impact statement issued by the Commission. Stipulates that a certificate of public convenience and necessity shall be issued only to persons determined by the Commission to have adequate financial resources to complete the pipeline."
