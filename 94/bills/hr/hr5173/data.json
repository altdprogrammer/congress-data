Authorizes the development of the oil and gas in the national petroleum reserves in the contiguous 48 States established pursuant to this Act. Requires competitive bidding procedures with prior public notice for any contract, lease, or operating agreement for development and production of oil and gas from a national petroleum reserve. States that the terms and conditions for such development, which shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, shall be subject to disapproval by Congress. Provides that any oil or gas produced from such petroleum reserves shall, with exceptions, be subject to all the limitations and licensing requirements of the Export Administration Act. Authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to explore for oil and gas on Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 4 and to report annually to Congress on his plan for exploration of such reserve."
