Permits any State or any nonprofit institution or organization to enter into an agreement with the Commissioner for the purpose of entitling students who receive loans which are insured under a student loan insurance program of that State, institution, or organization to have made on their behalf the payments provided for by this Act if the Commissioner determines that the student loan insurance program meets the requirements of this Act. Authorizes the Commissioner to issue certificates of Federal loan insurance to eligible applicants.
