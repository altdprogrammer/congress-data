    "text": "Postal Reorganization Act Amendments - Authorizes to be appropriated to the Postal Service each fiscal year 20 percent of its operating expenses for the preceding fiscal year if authorized biennially by legislation hereafter enacted by Congress. Provides for a separate annual report of the expenses of the Postal Rate Commission. Makes changes in the organizational structure, procedures, and duties and powers of the Postal Rate Commission. Reduces the number of members of the Board of Governors of the Postal Service from 11 to 9, and provides for less participation in their appointment by the President and more such participation by the Congress. States that the educational, cultural, scientific, and informational value of mailed materials to the recipient shall be a factor on which a change in rates or fees with respect to a class of mail may be based. Fixes the indemnity to be paid by the Postal Service to the holder of any contract for mail transportation upon the termination of such contract by the Postal Service at 25 percent of the annual rate of compensation under the contract. Authorizes any State to collect a fee from the Postal Service for real property acquired by the Postal Service but not used within one year of acquisition in an amount equal to the average amount of real property during the immediately preceding 2-year period. States that each officer or employee in the postal career service of the Postal Service shall be eligible for: (1) promotion or transfer to any other position in the Postal Service for which he is qualified; or (2) transfer to any other position in the executive branch of the Government of the United States for which he is qualified, upon completion of at least one year of continuous employment in the postal career service immediately before the transfer and subject to such regulations governing the transfer as the United States Civil Service Commission shall prescribe."
