States that if any such card is issued to any individual who is an alien and who has not been admitted to the United States under conditions which allow him to engage in employment, such card shall indicate that such person may not be legally employed. Provides that before any person employs any individual who is issued a card under this Act, such person shall inspect such card to insure that the holder may be legally employed. States that any person who employs an alien in violation of this Act shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both, for the first such employment, and fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both, for each subsequent employment. Authorizes to be appropriated each year to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund such sums as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
