    "text": "Weather Modification Research, Development, and Control Act - Declares it to be the finding of Congress that it is important to develop weather modification in a safe, scientific, and orderly manner, and to protect and maintain the environment of the United States. States that it is the purpose of this Act to provide for research and development in weather modification; and to institute a comprehensive data-gathering system which will assist in the development, administration, and supervision of weather modification in a safe and scientific manner. Defines terms used in this Act. Title I: Research and Development in Weather Modification - Directs the Secretary of Commerce: (1) to identify and evaluate the specific needs for and uses of effective weather modification; (2) to determine the types of weather modification activities which are most likely to be successful in meeting those needs and achieving those uses, and the manner in which such activities may be most effectively carried out; (3) to identify the problems which may be created by the conduct of weather modification activities, and the ways in which such problems can best be avoided; and (4) to otherwise provide continuing scientific support for efforts to carry out weather modification activities in a safe and orderly manner which is consistent with the objectives of this Act. Title II: Weather Modification Information System - Directs the Secretary to establish, within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a weather modification information system. States that the purpose of such system shall be to monitor daily weather conditions, to record and evaluate weather modifications, to appraise the effect which any proposed weather modification activity would have on prevailing weather conditions, and to monitor such activity. Title III: Weather Modification Control; Reporting Requirements, and Penalties - Requires any State which establishes a system to regulate any weather modification activity to provide for the licensing of any person engaged in such activity within the State. Requires States to determine the qualifications and planned activities of licensees. Authorizes the Secretary to assist any State in the regulation of weather modification activities. Requires any person engaged in any such activity to obtain a permit from the Secretary. Enumerates the requirements an individual must meet to obtain such a permit. Provides for the revocation or suspension of such permit upon the determination by the Secretary that any activity under such permit poses an immediate or imminent danger to the public welfare, or to the environment, or ecology of the area involved. Authorizes the Secretary or his representative to have access to and copy any record maintained by a permit holder pursuant to this Act. Provides for civil penalties for violations of this Act. Title IV: International Weather Modification Control - Authorizes the President to enter into international agreements in order to encourage weather modification research and activities by other nations. Title V: General Provision - Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act."
