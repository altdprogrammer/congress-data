Removes the authority of the Consumer Product Safety Commission to regulate tobacco and firearms. Transfers the functions of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare under the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to the Commission. Provides under the functions of the Chairman that requests for supplemental appropriations for the Commission shall require the approval of the Commission prior to submission. Enables the Chairman, subject to the approval of the Commission and the Civil Service Commission to establish non career executive assignment positions upon a determination that there is a need for certain specified persons. Permits the Chairman to abolish any such position upon determination that there is no longer any need. Permits the chairman to establish twenty-five positions in GS-16, 17, and 18. Restricts the review of appointments made by the Chairman to the Civil Service Commission. Stipulates that in developing consumer product safety standards, invitations specify a time period which shall be 150 days after the acceptance of an offer to develop the proposed standard. Permits the Commission to develop any such standard or contract for the development of such standard where a recommended proposed standard is accepted. Provides that not more than 60 days after receiving the proposed standard from the offeror, the Commission shall publish in the Federal Register a notice withdrawing such notice of proceeding, or shall publish a proposed rule which declares a product a banned hazardous consumer product, or proposes a product safety standard for such consumer product. Makes it unlawful to manufacture, offer for sale, or import into the United States any consumer product which has been determined to present a substantial hazard. Makes it unlawful to fail to comply with any rule relating to prior notice and description of new consumer products or relating to provision of performance and technical data. Extends the jurisdiction of the United States district courts to restrain any violation or potential violation of the prohibited acts set forth in this Act or a rule or regulation issued under this Act. Removes the responsibility for litigation from the Attorney General. Permits the Commission to be represented before the Supreme Court by the Solicitor General. Extends the powers of the Commission to the promulgation of such rules or regulations as may be appropriate for the effective administration and enforcement of this Act. Permits the Commission to make available to a Federal, State, or local authority copies of any investigation report made under the Acts, with the restriction that the identity of any injured person not be made available to the public without the consent of such injured person. Empowers the Commission to regulate consumer products under this Act which present a risk of injury and which may be regulated by the Commission under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, or the Flammable Fabrics Act upon a determination that such action is in the public interest."
