    "text": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act - Authorizes the appropriation of designated sums to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for research and development programs, construction of facilities including land acquisition, and research and program management. Permits utilization of research and development appropriations for (1) items of a capital nature which may be required at locations other than installations of the Administration for the performance of research and development contracts, and (2) grants to nonprofit institutions of higher education, or to nonprofit organizations whose primary purpose is the conduct of scientific research for purchase or construction of additional research facilities. Sets forth guidelines regarding the use and availability of funds appropriated pursuant to this Act. Specifies procedures whereby amounts designated for specific programs may be varied upward and whereby up to one half of one percent of the funds appropriated for research and development may be combined with $10,000,000 of funds appropriated for facility construction to construct or modify laboratories or other installations deemed by the Administration to be immediately needed. Prohibits utilization of sums appropriated pursuant to this Act for (1) any research or management program in excess of the amount specifically authorized for that program (2) any program deleted by Congress from requests originally made, or (3) any program which has not been presented to either the House Committee on Science and Technology or the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences unless each such Committee has been given notice of any such proposed action and transmits written notice to the Administration that it has no objection. Directs the Administration to consider geographical distribution whenever feasible in allocating its research and development funds. Authorizes the Administration, when so provided in appropriation Acts, to enter into and to maintain a contract for tracking and data relay satellite services. Authorizes an additional Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology within the Administration. Revises the compensation of Members of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel."
