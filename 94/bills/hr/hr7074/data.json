    "text": "Establishes a procedure under the Internal Revenue Code by which an individual who is employed by more than one employer during a calendar year may file a certification with his employers at any time after the contribution and benefit base determined under the Social Security Act has been exceeded, in order to prevent the deduction of excess social security taxes from his wages. Sets forth the required contents of such certification. Authorizes employers who have received such certification not to deduct social security taxes from the wages of the certifying employee. Requires employers to make the necessary deductions from a certifying employee's wages when the employer determines that certification was filed before the requiredu contribution and benefit base was met. Establishes a penalty of up to 50 percent of the tax not withheld if an employee, by filing a certification, fails to pay a portion of the social security tax which he was required to pay for a given year."
