    "text": "Government in the Sunshine Act - Provides that all meetings and portions thereof of Government agencies at which official action is considered or discussed shall be open to public observation. Excludes from this requirement any portion of an agency meeting where the agency determines that the meeting: (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or the foreign relations of the United States; (2) will relate solely to individual agency personnel; (3) would tend to disclose information which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of any individual; (4) will disclose information pertaining to any investigation conducted for law enforcement purposes; or (5) will disclose information relating to trade secrets or financial or commercial information pertaining specifically to a given person. Requires each agency to make a public announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of each meeting, and whether such meeting is open or closed to the public, at least one week before each meeting. Requires that a transcript or electronic recording of each such meeting be made available to the public for inspection. Permits an agency to delete from the transcripts or recordings made available to the public specified materials. Requires that written minutes shall be made of any agency meeting open to the public. Directs each agency to promulgate regulations to implement this Act. Grants jurisdiction to the district courts of the United States to enforce the requirements of this Act. Sets forth requirements relating to ex parte communications. Defines \"ex parte communication\" as meaning a communication not on the public record with respect to which reasonable prior notice to all parties is not given."
