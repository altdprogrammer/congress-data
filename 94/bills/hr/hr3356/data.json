Requires the President to transmit to Congress annually a report on youth, setting forth: (1) the developments in the interaction between youth and our society; (2) a review of activities as they relate to youth by governmental and nongovernmental entities; and (3) recommendations for remedying problems through improved programs and legislation. Establishes, in the Executive Office of the President, a Council on Youth to be composed of 5 members appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. Specifies general qualifications for Council members. Imposes upon the Council the duties of gathering information on the interaction between youth and societal institutions, reviewing Federal programs in youth, making studies, recommending legislation, and making an annual report to the President and Congress. Directs the Council, in carrying out its duties, to consult with representatives of industry, education, the Government and various private institutions and to utilize facilities of agencies and institutions to avoid duplication of effort."
