Authorizes the Secretary to make annual grants for such purpose, provided they do not exceed 90 percent of the cost. Authorizes the Secretary to provide assistance to the coastal States to develop a capability for carrying out short-term research, studies, and training required in support of coastal zone management. Requires the Secretary to submit additional information each year to the President for transmittal to Congress including: (1) a general description and evaluation of interstate and regional planning mechanisms developed by the coastal States. Extends until 1980 the authority of the Secretary to make grants to the coastal States for the development of land and water resources management programs.
