Empowers the Council of the District of Columbia to reject any ensuing collective bargaining agreement, or to formulate recommendations with respect to changes where no agreement is reached. Sets forth alternative procedures to be followed implementing any such Council action. Directs the Board of Education of the District of Columbia to appoint a city personnel salary and benefits committee to conduct the annual study comparing the compensation of District educational personnel with that paid similar employees in other jurisdictions in the Washington area and in cities of comparable size.
