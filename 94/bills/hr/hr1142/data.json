Amends the Tax Refrom Act of 1976 to move forward the effective date of three administrative provisions (jeopardy and termination assessments, administrative summons, and the minimum exemption from levy) from December 31, 1976, to February 28, 1977. Provides that the amounts received by the Internal Revenue Service as reimbursement for costs incurred in making future private letter rulings and other determinations available for public inspection are to be treated as reimbursable to the Internal Revenue Service appropriation."
