Allows any State to regulate, or continue to regulate, such rates, terms, and conditions if standards for rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments in such State meet or exceed the minimum standards promulgated by the Commission for exemption from Federal regulation. Directs the Commission to promulgate regulations which assure reasonable rates for pole attachments and minimum standards which a State must meet in order to be eligible for exemption. Requires the Commission to establish an advisory board to assist the Commission in the promulgation of the regulations and minimum standards."
