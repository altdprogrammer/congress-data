    "text": "Authorizes, under the Internal Revenue Code, any individual who has attained the age of 65 or who is disabled to elect to take a tax credit for the amount of real property taxes paid or accrued by the taxpayer to a State or political subdivision on the taxpayer's principal residence, or for the amount of rent constituting such real property taxes. Limits such credit to $250 for any taxable year. Reduces such credit by ten percent of the amount of excess of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income over $5,500. Apportions such credit among two or more eligible taxpayers using the same principal residence based on such taxpayers' ratable share of the rent paid."
