Authorizes such grants to be used to train personnel to administer such tests. Directs the Secretary to establish a panel to advise him with respect to the standards to be prescribed by him under this Act for qualified vision tests. States that such panel shall be composed of four ophthalmologists and four optometrists who by virtue of their training and experience are especially qualified to advise the Secretary with respect to such standards. Requires the Secretary to make an annual report to the Congress respecting the grant program authorized under this Act and to include in such report his recommendations for such legislation as he deems appropriate."
