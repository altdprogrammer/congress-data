Defines the terms used in this Act. Title I: Indian Health Manpower - Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare acting through the Indian Health Service, to make grants to public or nonprofit private health or educational entities or Indian tribes or tribal organizations to assist such entities in meeting the costs of: (1) identifying Indians with a potential for education or training in the health professions and encouraging and assisting them; (2) publicizing existing sources of financial aid available to Indians enrolled in any medical or health-related school referred to in this Act or who are undertaking training necessary to qualify them to enroll in any such school; or (3) establishing other programs which the Secretary determines will enhance and facilitate the enrollment of Indians, and the subsequent pursuit and completion by them of courses of study, in any school referred to in this Act. Authorizes to be appropraited specified sums for each of the seven fiscal years commencing with that of 1977 for payment of such grants. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Service, to make scholarship grants for up to two years to Indians who: (1) have successfully completed their high school education or high school equivalency; and (2) have demonstrated the capability to successfully complete courses of study in schools of medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatry, pharmacy, public health, nursing, or allied health professions.

Authorizes appropriations for such grants of specified sums for the fiscal years 1977 through 1983, and of such sums as are necessary for the succeeding fiscal years, to continue to make scholarship grants under this Act to individuals who have received such grants prior to the end of the fifth fiscal year and who are eligible for such grants during each such succeeding fiscal year. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Service, to make grants to individuals, nonprofit entities, appropriate public or private agencies, educational institutions, or Indian tribes and tribal organizations to enable the recipients of such grants to establish and carry out programs to train individuals so as to enable them to provide their services to Indians. Authorizes to be appropriated specified sums to carry out such provisions for the fiscal years 1977 through 1983.
