    "text": "Motor Vehicle Fuel Economy Act - Requires the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate, within six months after the date of enactment of this Act, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, both interim and final standards of fuel economy applicable to all new models of motor vehicles sold or offered for sale in the United States. States that such standards shall set minimum levels of fuel economy for each class of motor vehicles and shall apply to any new motor vehicle sold in any State after September 1 of the year in which the regulations are to become effective. Directs the Secretary to promulgate, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, standards of performance which shall be designed to achieve a specific percentage of improvement in the fuel economy of new motor vehicles. Provides that, in setting standards under this Act, the Secretary shall consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to fuels, engines, emission characteristics, safety, state of the art in international automotive technology, initial maintenance costs to consumers, the effects on fuel economy of accessory equipment such as air-conditioning and radial tires, the amount of energy required to produce each fuel, and in the case of motor vehicles powered by electricity the amount of fuel required to generate such electricity. Provides that any person who may be adversely affected by any rule issued under this Act may at any time prior to sixty days after such rule is issued file a petition with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, or any circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business, for judicial review of such rule. Sets forth the powers of the Secretary for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this Act. States that the Secretary shall study and investigate the fuel economy of any motor vehicle which is subject to the standards of fuel economy issued under this Act. Provides that, upon the basis of such studies and investigations, the Secretary shall, not later than June 1, 1976, and each year thereafter, prepare and publish a schedule of the fuel economy of each such motor model with and without accessories which have a significant effect on fuel economy. States that, within one year after the date of enactment of this Act and from time to time thereafter, the Secretary shall issue regulations to establish test protocols for continuous testing of fuel economy in actual operation in new motor vehicles sold in the United States. States that each manufacturer and dealer shall cause to be affixed and maintained on each new motor vehicle in a prominent place and easily legible and readable form a sticker indicating the fuel economy which a prospective purchaser can expect from such vehicle and the amount of a fuel conservation fee. Authorizes the Secretary, in cooperation with the Director of the National Bureau of Standards and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to conduct such research as is necessary to promote the purposes of this Act. States that it shall be unlawful and a violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act for any person (including any partnership, corporation, or association) subject to the provisions of this Act to fail to comply with any requirement imposed on such person by or pursuant to this Act or to violate any prohibition contained in this Act. Prohibits any person from failing to comply with any provisions of this Act or any regulation or order issued by the Secretary pursuant to this Act, and from failing to provide information as required in accordance with this Act. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this Act such sums as may be necessary."
