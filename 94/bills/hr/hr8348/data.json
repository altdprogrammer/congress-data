    "text": "Temporary Help Employee Protection Act - Makes it the purpose of this Act to prohibit doing business as a temporary help agency except as licensed by the Secretary of Labor. Defines the terms of this Act. Exempts from the provisions of this Act those agencies solely engaged in supplying skilled laborers or professional employees. Makes it unlawful to operate a temporary help agency unless a license is obtained from the Secretary of Labor or his designee. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations and to enforce compliance with such for the conduct of agencies covered by this Act. Requires that no agency shall be licensed under this Act unless its employees are provided with coverage under: (1) the Social Security Act; (2) the Fair Labor Standards Act; (3) the Occupational Safety and Health Act; (4) the Civil Rights Act of 1964; and (5) the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. Prohibits any agency from engaging in any practice which operates to restrict the right of any employee to accept a permanent position with a client to whom he is referred for temporary work. Prohibits placement fees charged to employees. Prohibits specified employment for purposes of strikebreaking where a legitimate labor dispute is in progress. Provides for fines of up to $10,000, or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both, for those convicted of willful violations of the provisions of this Act. Provides that persons injured by violations of the provisions of this Act may bring actions for damages or such other relief as the court deems proper."
