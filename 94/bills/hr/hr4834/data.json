Sets the per diem travel allowance at $35 for travel within the continental United States, and authorizes the President to set the per diem allowance by locality for travel outside the continental United States. Raises the maximum reimbursement rate for travel to high rate geographical areas and for travel under unusual circumstances. Raises the mileage allowances for the use of privately owned motorcycles, automobiles and airplanes when such modes of transportation have been approved as most advantageous to the Government. Directs the Administrator of General Services to conduct periodic investigations of the cost of travel in privately owned vehicles, to report the results to Congress at least once a year, and to adjust the rates provided in this Act by regulation."
