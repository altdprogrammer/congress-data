    "date": "1976-03-02", 
    "text": "Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act Amendments - Revises the definition of the term \"interstate transmission facilities\" to exclude any facility which transports gas from an interstate gas pipeline to a direct sales customer purchasing gas for its own consumption. Defines the term \"intrastate pipeline transportation\" to include such facilities. Requires that State regulations for intrastate pipeline transportation be compatible with Federal standards. Stipulates that the authority of the Federal Power Commission to attach safety requirements as a condition to the issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity shall not extend beyond those standards already prescribed by the Secretary of Transportaiton. Changes from March 17 to June 15 the date on which the Secretary is required to present to the President an annual report on the administration of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act. Authorizes the appropriation of the following sums to carry out the purposes of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act: $500,000 for the period from July 1, 1976, through September 30, 1976, and $3,500,000 per year for fiscal years 1977 and 1978. Authorizes the appropriation of $2,500,000 annually for fiscal years 1977 and 1978 for grants to State safety programs."
