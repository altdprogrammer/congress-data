    "text": "Fisheries Management Act - Extends the contiguous fishery zone of the United States to include an area within a boundary line drawn so that every point on the line is two hundred miles from the nearest point on the United States coast. Prohibits vessels, other than United States vessels, from fishing within the coastal waters of the United States. Defines the term \"coastal waters\" as waters contiguous to the United States coast having a seaward boundary line of which every point is fifteen nautical miles from the nearest point on the United States coast. Authorizes the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to authorize foreign fishing within the two hundred mile fishery zone upon his determination that such fishing will not have an adverse effect on the United States fishing industry. Provides for licensing of foreign fishing vessels by the Administrator when such determination has been made. Enumerates certain actions prohibited by this Act, including: (1) the transportation and sale of fish taken in violation of this Act; and (2) the refusal to permit the inspection of a catch, fishing equipment, and other materials and records by a representative of the United States. Sets forth penalties for the violation of this Act."
