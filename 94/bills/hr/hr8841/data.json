    "as": "Conference report filed in House",

    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 94-668) Requires that in determining whether to issue any notices of intent with respect to cancellation of a registration or a change in its classification, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall include among those factors to be taken into account the impact of the action proposed in such notice on production and prices of agricultural commodities, retail food prices, and otherwise on the agricultural economy. Imposes new procedures requiring consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture prior to issuance of proposed and final form of regulations under such Act. Waives such consultation requirement where the Administrator determines that the suspension of a pesticide registrtation is necessary to prevent an imminent hazard. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of the Act for fiscal year 1976, in the amount of $47,868,000, and for the period beginning October 1, 1976, and ending March 31, 1977, the sum of $23,600,000. Provides that the certification standard for a private applicator shall under an approved plan be deemed fulfilled by his signing a self-certification form. Requires the Administrator to assure that the certification formm contains adequate information and affirmations to carry out the intent of such Act. States that any required training programs for private applicators shall not include the requirement that they take, pursuant to a requirement prescribed by the Administrator, any examination to establish competency. Requires that at such time as the Administrator is required to provide the Secretary of Agriculture with a copy of proposed regulations and copy of the final form of regulations, he shall also furnish a copy of such regulations to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry of the Senate. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to refuse entry to specified commodities or products until and unless the lot has been examined and it has been determined that no residues in excess of established United States pesticide tolerances are present. Directs the Administrator to submit to an advisory panel for comment as to the impact on health and the environment of the action proposed in notices of intent and of the proposed and final form of regulations. States that in order to assure the objectivity of the advisory panel, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations regarding conflicts of interest with respect to the members of the panel. Requires that in determining whether or not an emergency condition exists which would warrant exempting a Federal or State agency from any provision of the Act, the Administrator must consult with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Governor of any State concerned if they request such determination. Changes the definition of a pesticide to exclude any article that is a \"new animal drug\" within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that has been determined by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare not to be a new animal drug by a regulation establishing conditions of use for the article, or that is an animal feed within the meaning of such Act bearing or containing specified articles. Provides that where an applicant for registration under such Act must compensate another for use of such other's test data for submission to the Administrator, that such compensation requirement applies to test data submitted on or after January 1, 1970, and to all applications for registration submitted on or after such date."
