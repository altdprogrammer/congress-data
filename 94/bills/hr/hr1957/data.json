Establishes the California Desert Advisory Commission which shall consist of Federal and State representatives, representatives of the academic community, representatives of residents of the desert, and representatives of groups which make use of the desert and its resources for recreational, study, or business purposes. States that it shall be the function of the Commission to advise the Secretary of the Interior with respect to the program for the desert under this Act. Establishes the National Conservation Area of the California Desert to carry out the purposes of the Act. Gives the Secretary of the Interior responsibility for the preparation of a long-range program for the management, development, and use of the California Desert. Provides that such program shall include a plan, to be completed and reported to Congress within seven years from the date of enactment of this Act. Requires consultation with the Advisory Commission and with State organizations concerning such plan. Provides for an interim program to manage and protect the desert resources now in danger of destruction, and to provide for the public use of the desert. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire such lands or interests therein as he deems necessary to provide access to the facilities of the desert, and to facilitate efficient and beneficial management of the desert. Empowers the Secretary to issue such regulations as he deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Provides that all mining carried out within the conservation area shall be subject to such reasonable regulations as the Secretary may prescribe to carry out the purposes of this Act. States that such regulations shall provide for such measures as may be reasonable to protect the scenic, scientific, and environmental values of the California Desert against undue impairment."
