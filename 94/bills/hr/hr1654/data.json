    "text": "Provides that, beginning one year after enactment of this Act, no law enforcement grants under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 will be made to State and local covernments unless these units of government have instituted a law enforcement officer's grievance system and have enacted into law a \"Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights\" which will cover all law enforcement officers in the States. Declares that this Bill of Rights shall provide law enforcement officers statutory protection for certain rights enjoyed by other citizens. Requires the bill of rights to provide, at a minimum, the following: (1) law enforcement officers shall not be prohibited from engaging in political activity, except when on duty or acting in an official capacity; (2) when an officer is subject to an investigation that could lead to disciplinary action or criminal charges: (a) the investigation shall be conducted at a reasonable hour preferably while the officer is on duty, (b) the investigation shall occur at the office of the investigating officer or at the precinct where the incident occurred, (c) there shall be one interrogator asking all questions to the officer and the names of all investigating officers shall be known by him, (d) the officer shall know the nature of the investigation and the names of complainants, (e) all civilian complaints must be duly sworn to before an official authorized to adminster oaths, and (f) interrogating sessions shall be of reasonable length."
