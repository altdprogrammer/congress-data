    "text": "Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act - Expresses the intent of Congress that the selection of a natural-gas transportation system for delivery of Alaska natural gas to other States be made through the establishment of new administrative and judicial procedures. Directs the Federal Power Commission to establish special procedures for expedited review of applications and reasonable alternatives relating to the transportation of Alaska natural gas. Directs the Commission to complete its review and transmit its findings to the President by March 1, 1977. Requires that reports from other agencies which the President shall deem appropriate be submitted by April 1, 1977. Establishes criteria for information to be considered in such reports. Directs the President to make a final decision as to proposed systems for the transportation of Alaskan natural gas not later than July 1, 1977. Establishes procedures for Congressional review of such Presidential decision. Directs the Secretary of the Interior and other appropriate Federal officials to issue all necessary action to enforce all rights-of-ways, permits, and leases related to the construction and operation of such natural gas transportation system. Requires compliance with requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 relating to rights-of-way for pipelines through Federal lands. Exempts authorizations issued pursuant to this Act from requirements concerning: (1) compliance with National Environmental Policy Act provisions; (2) technical and financial capacity of applicants; (3) public hearings; and (4) furnishing of specified information and reports. Stipulates that an environmental impact statement on the proposed project shall be prepared at the earliest practicable time after the issuance of all necessary permits. Declares that the legal or factual sufficiency of such environmental statement shall not be subject to judicial review. Authorizes the Secretary and the Commission to develop procedural requirements of Federal law where desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Act. Declares that the actions of Federal officers and agencies under this Act shall not be subject to judicial review by the courts. Allows for claims that: (1) this Act is unconstitutional; (2) actions under this Act will deny Constitutional rights; and (3) actions taken are beyond the scope of authority conferred by this Act, provided that such claims are filed within 60 days following the date of the challenged action. Declares that exclusive jurisdiction shall be vested in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, with review of any final order limited to direct appeal to the United States Supreme Court. Declares that the district court shall not have the power to issue injunctive relief against the issuance of any certificate, except in cases where a final judgment is entered. Requires that any recommendation for the construction of such a transportation system require connection with pipeline facilities serving the State of Pennsylvania."
