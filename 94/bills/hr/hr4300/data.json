    "text": "Prohibits Federal agencies from commencing any preproduction exploration (except geophysical exploration) or production with respect to any offshore energy facility within any area of the Outer Continental Shelf before the affected coastal State: (1) develops, and the Secretary of Commerce approves, the coastal zone management program pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act concerning the impact on the coastal zone of such State of activities related to the development and operation of offshore energy facilities in such area; or (2) certifies to the Secretary that the prohibition on such Federal agency action set forth in this Act shall not apply with respect to the area of the Outer Continental Shelf adjacent to such State. Permits other coastal States to petition the Secretary to suspend Federal agency action in non-adjacent Continental Shelf areas if such State considers that such action may have an impact on its own coastal zone. Requires each appropriate Federal agency to inform, on a continuing basis, all affected coastal States of the nature, location, and magnitude of potential resources in or on the Outer Continental Shelf. Requires such agencies to coordinate and consult with affected coastal States likely to be impacted by exploration and development of such resources. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to coastal States for one or more of the following activities: (1) the collection and assement of the economic, environmental and social data which is necessary to enable such State to identify and designate those sites within or adjacent to its coastal zone which are suitable or unsuitable for the location of related on-shore facilities; (2) the development of a process for the selection and designation of such sites within, or adjacent to, its coastal zone; and (3) the construction of such public facilities and works, and the provision of such public services, as may be necessary and appropriate to provide for the integration of any related on-shore facility into the community where sited. Sets forth criteria to be met by States in order to be eligible for such grants. Establishes the Affected Coastal States Fund for the purposes of making grants under this Act. Authorizes appropriations to the Fund of $100,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1976 and 1977 and such sums as may be necessary for subsequent fiscal years."
