    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to designate an agency or person as an official inspection agency upon a showing that such agency or person has adequate personnel, facilities, and training programs, and meets other specified requirements, to assure that official inspection will be provided in accordance with the provisions of the United States Grain Standards Act. Provides that designations of official inspection agencies shall terminate triennially. Prescribes criteria and procedures for renewal of such designations. Requires each inspection agency to pay annually a designation fee based on the volume of grain inspected in the preceding year, or, if none inspected, the anticipated volume for the upcoming year. Authorizes the Secretary to revoke the designation of an official inspection upon determination that one or more criteria of performance is not met. Expands the authority of the Secretary to license grain inspectors. Increases the civil penalty for refusal of inspection to $50,000 for each violation. Increases the criminal penalties for improperly influencing or attempting to improperly influence, and physically interfering with a grain inspector in the performance of his official duties."
