    "text": "Clean Air Act Amendments - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate revised national primary and secondary standards for: (1) suspended particulate matter; (2) secondary air pollutants and their precursor pollutants; and (3) acid sulphate aerosols. Provides that if the Administrator finds promulgation of such standards impracticable with respect to any of the above pollutants, he may set emission charges on the pollutants. Requires that sources associated with more than minimal emissions of sulphur oxides, particulates, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, or hydrocarbons shall be monitored and that a person responsible for such monitoring shall be designated by the source. Enumerates procedural requirements for the construction of modification of sources to insure that emissions from such sources meet ambient air quality standards. Provides penalties for failure to pay applicable emission charges or penalties. Provides that the useful lives for light duty vehicle and engines shall be a 10-year use period or 100,000 miles, whichever occurs first. Includes violations of this Act among the causes of action on which a citizen may bring suit under the Clean Air Act. Prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee because such employee has assisted or participated, or is about to do so, in an action to effectuate the purposes of the Clean Air Act. Authorizes the Administrator to evaluate and investigate the possibility of loss of employment resulting from any requirement under such Act. Authorizes $100,000,000 to be appropriated to carry out such investigations."
