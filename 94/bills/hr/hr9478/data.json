    "text": "Dairy Producers Bill of Rights Act - Prohibits, under the Agricultural Adjustment Act as reenacted and amended by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, specific actions by any association of producers of milk which would tend to restrain the freedom of association members in the conduct of their business. States that such prohibitions shall be considered an antitrust law for specified purposes. Requires all associations of milk producers to provide their members with an annual financial statement prepared by an independent certified public accountant, and to provide a simplified monthly statement which provides an accounting of any sale by the association during the prior month involving any milk produced by its members. States that any association which fails to provide the annual financial statement shall be fined not less than $25,000 for each year in which it fails to provide such statement. Establishes a fine of not less than $10,000 for each month in which an association fails to provide a monthly accounting of milk sales."
