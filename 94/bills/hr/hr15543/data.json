    "text": "National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Programs Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act by establishing the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Programs. Specifies that the 12 members of the Commission shall be appointed by the President from individuals distinguished in specified fields including medicine, law, ethics, theology, philosophy, and the humanities with no more than five members being selected from individuals who are or have been engaged in biomedical or behavioral research involving human subjects. Provides that the Commission may undertake, or contract for the undertaking of, studies on the protection of human subjects of biomedical and behavioral programs and on research activities (such as research on recombinant DNA) which have or are likely to have significant implications for human health, as it deems appropriate. Requires the Commission's study to include the following: (1) identification of the basic ethic principles which should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects; (2) identification of the requirements for an individual who is a child, prisoner, member of the Armed Forces, institutionalized because of mental illness retardation, or his legal representative, to give informed consent to such individual's participation in biomedical and behavioral research conducted, supported or regulated by a Federal agency; (3) a study of past, present, and projected research in the modification of any living organism or virus by insertion of recombinant DNA molecules, the ethical, social, legal, and economic implications of such research; and the potential hazards posed by such research to the research personnel, the human subjects of such research, and the public at large; (4) a study of the scope and extent of personal injuries to, or death of, human subjects in the course of biomedical and behavioral research; (5) an identification of the basic ethical principles which should underlie the delivery of health services to patients in programs conducted or supported by a Federal agency; (6) a study to develop methods for the systematic assessment of the ethical, social, legal, and economic implications of the application in medical practice of significant advances in biomedical and behavioral research, technology, and diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. Directs the Commission to monitor the actions of, advise, and make recommendations to, Federal agencies with respect to the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research conducted, supported or regulated by such agencies and with respect to the implementation of such administrative actions as may be appropriate to apply the ethical principles, ethical guidelines, and informed consent requirements identified and developed in such studies to such research. Repeals provisions of the Public Health Service Act which create the National Advisory Council for the Protection of Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research."
