Rept. 94-713) Public Broadcasting Financing Act - Establishes the Public Broadcasting Fund, and authorizes appropriations to it for the fiscal years during the period from July 1, 1975, through September 30, 1980, based on a percentage of the amounts received by public broadcasting entities from non-Federal sources. Provides that the funds authorized by this Act shall be used solely for the expenses of the Public Broadcasting Corporation, and that the Corporation shall determine the amount of non-Federal financial support received by public broadcasting entities for the purpose of determining the amount of each authorization, and shall certify such amount to the Secretary of the Treasury. Directs a significant portion of the monies from the Fund to be used for development and dissemination of instructional programming, and solely for the expenses of the Public Broadcasting Corporation. Requires the Corporation to reserve for distribution among the licensees and permittees of noncommercial educational broadcast stations on the air an amount not less than 40 percent of funds disbursed to the Corporation from the Fund in fiscal year 1975, and up to a percentage of 50 percent or more in fiscal year 1980. Sets forth a formula for allocation of such funds among licensees and permittees on the basis of eligibility criteria that promote the public interest in noncommercial educational broadcasting. States that no distribution of such funds shall exceed in any fiscal year one-half of a licensee's or permittee's total non-Federal financial support during the fiscal year second preceding the fiscal year in which such distribution is made. Prescribes the uses of such funds by licensees and permittees. Makes officers and directors of the Corporation available to testify before appropriate committees of the Congress for specified purposes. Defines \"non-Federal financial support\" and \"public broadcasting entity,\" for purposes of this Act."
