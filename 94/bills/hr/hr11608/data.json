    "text": "Government in the Sunshine Act - States that this Act applies to the Federal Election Commission and to any agency where the collegial body comprising the agency consists of two or more individual members, at least a majority of whom are appointed to such position by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Provides that all meetings of such collegial body, or of a subdivision thereof authorized to take action on behalf of the agency, shall be open to the public. Requires such agency to make public announcement, at least one week before the meeting, of the date, place, and subject matter of the meeting, whether open or closed to the public, and the name and phone number of the official designated by the agency to respond to requests for information about the meeting. Exempts meetings when publicity would result in disclosure of matters: (1) necessary to keep secret in the interests of national defense or foreign policy; (2) not warranting an invasion of personal privacy; (3) constituting trade secrets; and (4) other matters the disclosure of which would not be in the public interest. States that the district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to enforce the requirements of this Act by declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, or other relief as may be appropriate. Prohibits the making of an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding by an interested person outside the agency to anyone involved in the decisional process of the proceedings."
