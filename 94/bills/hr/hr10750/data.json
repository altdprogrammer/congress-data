States that for the purposes of this Act, an individual shall be considered as a homemaker during any month in which that individual conducts or supervises the affairs of a household, not for a wage or salary, and: (1) is not less than 18 years of age (at the beginning of such month) nor more than 65 years of age (at the beginning of such month) nor more than 65 years of age (at the close of such month); (2) is not entitled to a monthly insurance benefit under this title; and (3) does not perform employment or engage in self-employment (other than service as a homemaker under this Act), or both for a total of more than 135 hours. Provides a method for determining the amount of the net earnings from self-employment which an individual is deemed to have derived from homemaker service. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to jointly prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out this Act, and to publish for each taxable year a schedule showing the amounts to be derived (for such year) under the Internal Revenue Code."
