Permits the Secretary of the Interior to suspend the migratory game bird hunting season if he finds, or has reasonable grounds to believe, that such provision of this Act is being violated. Provides for a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, for violation of such provision. Increases the fine penalty to $1,000 (previously $500) for taking any migratory bird with the intent to sell, offer for sale, barter, or offer to barter such bird. Provides that any person who violates specified provisions of this Act during any period of time in which the Secretary has suspended the migratory game bird hunting season pursuant to this Act, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both, and shall be prohibited from taking any migratory game bird for such a period of time as set by the court, but not to exceed five years."
