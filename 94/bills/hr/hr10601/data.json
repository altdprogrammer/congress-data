    "text": "Young Adult Conservation Corps Act - Declares it to be a finding of Congress that unemployment levels are excessively high among young adults, and that there are large inventories of conservation work and other work of a public nature on public lands, including the national park and forest systems, which require large amounts of labor and relatively small capital investments. States that it is the purpose of this Act to complement the Youth Conservation Corps Act and to provide employment to young adults. Declares the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to jointly extend the Youth Conservation Corps to make possible the year-round employment of young adults. States that individuals employed as Corps members under this Act shall be between the ages of 19 and 24; shall meet applicable physical standards; shall be given preference for employment if they reside in counties in which the unemployment rate was equal to or in excess of six percent for three consecutive months; and may be employed for a total of not more than 12 months. Sets forth criteria by which the Secretaries shall be guided in determining the location of projects and the type of work to be done. States that priority should be given to counties having a high rate of unemployment and that highly labor intensive projects should be sought. States that the rate of pay for Corps members should be set at the current Federal minimum wage. Extends the provisions of this Act to cover employment of young adults in State conservation programs in accordance with the provisions of the Youth Conservation Corps Act which make such an extension. Requires the Secretaries to prepare, within eight months of the enactment of this Act, a plan for the execution of the provisions of this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of funds for preparing the plan and for preparing the sites, facilities, and equipment selected in this plan. Authorizes the appropriation of funds as specified for the four fiscal years during which young adults are employed under this Act."
