States that the basic guideline for price adjustments shall be the maintenance of the dollars and cents profit margin per unit of output of any firm for any product or product category which prevailed for such firm during such fiscal years as the Board may designate. Provides that subsidiary standards and guidelines for price adjustments shall provide for modifying the basic guideline, as the Board may find necessary, to avoid undue hardship, inequity, or impedance of economic growth. Provides for the classification of business firms into three categories based on amount of sales controlled by such firm. States that the Board shall publish monthly a weighted index of the prices of products of concentrated industries. Provides that, when necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act, the Board shall issue orders and regulations in accordance with its standards and guidelines to require prenotification of price increases, to delay proposed price increases in whole or in part, to disapprove proposed price increases in whole or in part, and to rollback prices with respect to products of firms in concentrated industries. States that such regulations and orders shall not apply to firms controlling less than $250,000,000 worth of sales. Enumerates the duties of business firms with respect to notification of the Board of intent to adjust prices after the effective date of this Act."
