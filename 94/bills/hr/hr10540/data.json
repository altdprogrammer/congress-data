Provides that no such payment shall be made with respect to any real property of any of the following categories: (1) real property taxable by any State or local taxing authority under any provision of law, or with respect to which any payment in lieu of taxes is payable under any other provision of law; (2) real property owned by any private individual, association, or corporation would be exempt from real property tax under the constitution or laws of the State in which the property is situated; and (3) real property used or held primarily for the rendition of service to or on behalf of the local public, including (but not limited to) the following categories of real property, courthouses, post offices, and other property used for purposes incidental to postal operations, and federally owned airports maintained and operated by the Civil Aeronautics Administration."
