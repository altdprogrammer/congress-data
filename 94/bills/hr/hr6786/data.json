Permits the determination of such damages in the aggregate by use of statistical sampling or any other reasonable method, rather than requiring proof of amount of damage to each individual member of the injured class. Provides that, in any action with respect to any federally funded program affected by a violation of the antitrust laws, a State may recover treble damages plus actual damages sustained by the United States. Authorizes the Attorney General of the United States to bring the action to protect Federal interests or on behalf of a State if the State attorney general fails to do so within 180 days after the Attorney General has notified the State attorney general of the violation."
