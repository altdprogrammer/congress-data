Revises the definition of employee to include hostlers. Makes it unlawful for any common carrier, its officers or agents: (1) to require or permit an individual employed by the carrier who is engaged in installing, repairing or maintaining signal systems, in case such individual shall have been continuously on duty for 12 hours, to continue on duty or to go on duty until he has had at least ten consecutive hours off duty; or (2) to require or permit such an individual to continue on duty or to go on duty when he has not had at least eight consecutive hours off duty during the preceding 24 hours. Permits individuals engaged in installing, repairing, or maintaining signal systems to be or remain on duty for not to exceed four additional hours whenever an actual emergency exists. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue necessary regulations to require the rear car of passenger, commuter and freight trains to have highly visible markers which are lighted during periods of darkness or restricted visibility.
