Provides that in developing and updating quality grade standards, consideration shall be given to the nutritional quality and wholesomeness of food products, as well as the acceptability of the products. Requires that any food products sold more than nine months after the promulgation of applicable quality standards in accordance with this Act shall either be conspicuously labeled in accordance with such standards or shall be conspicuously labeled \"not quality graded by the United States Department of Agriculture\"."
