Defines the term \"qualified investment\" to mean investment in tangible property located in a development area certified by the Secretary of Commerce as development property which is outside any standard metropolitan statistical area, the population of which exceeds 300,000. Recaptures such tax credit if property which was certified development property placed in service during either of the two preceding taxable years is disposed of or ceases to be certified development property with respect to the taxpayer. Allows any portion of the credit which exceeds the limitations to be carried back to the three preceding taxable years and carried forward to the seven taxable years following the unused credit year. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to report annually to the Congress with respect to the amount of and the economic effects of such tax credit."
