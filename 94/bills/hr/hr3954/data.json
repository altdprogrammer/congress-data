Rept. 94-1264) Stipulates that a tort action against the United States shall be an individual's exclusive remedy to negligence or malpractice by medical personnel of the Armed Forces, the Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Coast Guard, and the National Guard (if the action arises out of a medical act or omission during specified National Guard training exercises). Directs the Attorney General to defend against such negligence or malpractice suits, in accordance with procedures set forth in this Act. Authorizes the head of the agency concerned or his designee to hold harmless or to provide liability insurance against such suits to medical personnel assigned to a foreign country or detailed for service with other than a Federal agency or institution, or if the circumstances are such as are likely to preclude the remedies of third persons against the United States."
