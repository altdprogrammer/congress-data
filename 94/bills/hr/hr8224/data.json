Specifies that no deduction shall be allowed for any expense or loss incurred as a result of the destruction of a certified historic structure. Limits deductions on structures erected upon a site which was occupied by a certified historic structure which was demolished or substantially altered. Allows the taxpayer to compute the depreciation deduction attributable to substantially rehabilitated property as through the original use of such property commenced with him. Permits deductions for transfer of the remainder or partial interests in property for conservation purposes."
