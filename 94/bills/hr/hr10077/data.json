    "text": "Rail Rehabilitation Act - Title I: Findings, Purpose, and Definitions - States that the purposes of this Act are to designate an Interstate Railroad System; to organize an Administration of the Department of Transportation to acquire, rehabilitate, maintain, modernize, and to restructure the rail lines included within such System; to transfer to the States responsibility for maintenance of rail lines not included within such System; to require minimum standards of maintenance for rail lines; to establish rights of access by rail carriers to rail lines they do not own; and to provide Federal funding to the Administration and to States for rehabilitation of rail lines. Defines terms used in the Act. Title II: Interstate Railroad System - Requires each rail carrier to provide the Secretary of Transportation with specified data describing the current condition of the railroad, and with a verified statement identifying all railroad lines of the carrier. Designates the Initial Interstate Railroad System, and rail lines which shall be excluded from such system. Directs the Rail Services Planning Office to hold hearings and recommend additions to and deletions from such system. Requires the Secretary, after giving full consideration to such recommendations, to prepare and release a concise descriptive study of an Intermediate Interstate Railroad System, including future maintenance standards of each rail line in the system. States that after hearings and recommendations by the Office, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to the Congress a final Interstate Railroad System Plan designed to promote and enhance the ability of rail carriers to provide modern, efficient, and economical interstate rail freight and passenger service responsive to present and future needs and demands. Requires the Secretary to determine and publish a rehabilitation, capital improvement, and maintenance program for the resporation of all rail lines in the system to the future maintenance standards set forth in the Final System. Stipulates that rail properties acquired by the National Railroad Passenger Corporation shall be part of the final system. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Rail Property Administration to revise the future maintenance standards so long as such revision reflects changes in the anticipated use of the individual lines. Title III: Federal Rail Property Administration - Establishes in the Department of Transportation the Federal Rail Property Administration. Grants the Administration power to acquire rail lines and property and to enter into leases with a railroad company which deeds rail lines to the Administration. Sets forth conditions governing such leases. Permits railroads to offer to transfer all facilities which are included in the System to the Administration, whereupon the Administration shall enter into a lease and accept title to the facilities so offered. Requires the Secretary to develop programs of rehabilitation and capital improvements for rail properties owned by the Administration. States that such programs shall be incorporated into and be made terms of the lease of such property. Directs the Administrator to report annually to the President and to Congress on the extent and condition of all properties owned by the Administration, and on the condition of all other rail properties in the Nation. Title IV: Funding - Authorizes appropriations for each year beginning with the year in which this Act is enacted and continuing for a period of ten years such sums as are necessary for (1) rehabilitation of lines as required under this Act, and (2) to provide the materials used in maintenance as required under this Act. Imposes a Rail User Charge on all railroads operating on facilities of the Administration. Authorizes additional sums of money for reports, expenses, and maintenance materials. Title V: State and Local Rail Service Discontinuance and Abandonment - Permits abandonment of rail service on properties not designated part of the final system. Sets forth conditions governing discontinuation of service. Title VI: Labor Contracts - States that all contracts between rail carries and labor organizations for maintenance of properties transferred to the Association shall remain in full force, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act. Title VII: Northeast Corridor - Directs the National Railroad Passenger Corporation to operate high speed rail passenger service in the Northeast Corridor. Authorizes appropriations for improvement of the Northeast Corridor."
