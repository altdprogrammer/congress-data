    "text": "Community Mental Health Centers Amendments - Sets forth the findings of Congress that until such time as legislation is enacted and becomes effective which insures all Americans financial access to the mental health services which are presently available through community mental health centers, Federal funds should continue to be made available for the purposes of initiating new community mental health centers responsive to community needs and national goals relating to community mental health care. Sets forth the services which should be provided through community mental health centers, including: (1) inpatient services, outpatient services, day care and other partial hospitalization services; (2) emergency services; (3) a program of specialized services for the mental health of children, including a full range of diagnostic, treatment, liaison, and followup services; and (4) consultation and education services. States that the provision of comprehensive mental health services through a center shall be coordinated with the provision of services by other health and social service agencies in the center's catchment area to insure that persons receiving services through the center have access to all such health and social services as they may require. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to public and nonprofit private entities to carry out projects to plan community mental health center programs. Provides that the amount of any such grant may not exceed $75,000. Authorizes appropriations for payments of planning grants of $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1975, and $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1976. Permits the Secretary to make grants to entities which have plans satisfactory to the Secretary to meet the costs of operation during the first eight years of establishment. Authorizes appropriations for payments of such grants of $85,000,000 for fiscal year 1975, and $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1976. States that the Secretary may provide grants for consultation and education services, and to cover operating deficits arising from the provision of the new services authorized by this Act. States that no grant may be made under this Act to any entity or community mental health center in any State unless a State plan for the provision of comprehensive mental health services within such State has been submitted to, and approved by, the Secretary. Sets forth procedures governing the approval of applications for grants. Directs the Secretary to pay, in accordance with this Act, the Federal share of projects for: (1) the acquisition or remodeling or both, of facilities for community mental health centers; (2) the leasing (for not more than twenty-five years) of facilities for such centers; (3) the construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities for community mental health centers if not less than 25 percent of the residents of the centers' catchment areas are members of low income groups; and (4) the initial equipment of a facility acquired, remodeled, leased, or constructed with financial assistance provided under payments under this Act. Authorizes for this purpose appropriations of $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 and $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1976. Directs the Secretary to establish in the National Institute of Mental Health the National Center for the Prevention and Control of Rape. Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Center, to directly or by grant carry out a continuing study and investigation of: (1) the effectiveness of existing Federal, State, and local laws dealing with rape; (2) the relationship, if any, between traditional legal and social attitudes toward sexual roles, the act of rape, and the formulation of laws dealing with rape; (3) the treatment of the victims of rape by law enforcement agencies, hospitals or other medical institutions, prosecutors, and the courts; (4) sexual assaults in correctional institutions; (5) the actual incidence of forcible rape as compared to the reported cases and the reasons therefor; and (6) the effectiveness of existing private and local and State government education and counseling programs designed to prevent and control rape. Directs the Secretary to appoint an advisory committee to advise, consult with, and make recommendations to him on the implementation of these provisions. Authorizes for these purposes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 and $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1976. Sets forth general provisions governing the regulation of community mental healh centers and the implementation of State plans."
