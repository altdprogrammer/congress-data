    "text": "Grants certain employment preference within a Federal agency to agency employees who have been affected by a closing, relocation, or reduction in services. Directs the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission to assist in finding substantially equivalent employment for Federal employees who are unemployed or earn less than 85 percent of former pay due to an agency closing, relocation, or reduction in services. Authorizes the Chairman to establish retraining and similar programs to the extent that existing programs are inadequate to meet such objective. Directs the Comptroller General to issue and submit to Congress opinions relative to any proposed closing, relocation, or reduction in services of any part of a Federal agency which will cause the transfer or termination of a majority of the employees of such section. Subjects such proposed changes to the same Congressional oversight as a reorganization plan submitted by the President."
