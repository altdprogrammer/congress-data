    "text": "National Science and Technology Policy and Organization Act - Title I: National Science Policy - Declares that the United States shall adhere to a national policy for science and technology which includes the following principles: (1) the continuing development and implementation of a national strategy for determining and achieving the appropriate scope, level, direction, and extent of scientific and technological efforts based upon a continuous appraisal of science and technology goals and policies of the United States; (2) the enlistment of science and technology to foster a healthy economy in which the directions of growth and innovation are compatible with the prudent and frugal use of resources and with the preservation of a benign environment; and (3) the development and maintenance of a solid base for science and technology in the United States. States the finding of Congress that there should be a central policy-planning element in the executive branch to guide executive agencies in mobilizing resources for essential science and technology programs, to present to the Congress the justification of such programs, to aid in securing appropriate funding for those programs, and to review systematically Federal science policy and programs and to recommend legislative amendments when needed. States that, in order to expedite and facilitate the implementation of the policy enunciated in this Act, the following coordinate procedures are of paramount importance: (1) Federal procurement policy should encourage the use of science and technology to foster frugal use of materials, energy, and appropriated funds; to assure quality environment; and to enhance product performance; (2) explicit criteria, including cost-effectiveness principles where feasible, should be developed to identify the kinds of science and technology programs that are appropriate for Federal funding support and to determine the extent of such support; (3) Federal promotion of science and technology should maximize quality of research, stability of scientific and technological institutions, and, for urgent tasks, timeliness of results; and (4) antitrust regulation to compel competitive economic pluralism should not preclude cooperation among competing firms in industrial research and development beneficial to an entire industry and to the public. Title II: Presidential Science and Technology Advisory Organization Act - Establishes in the Executive Office of the President the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Provides for the appointment of a Director and four Assistant Directors, and other personnel. Specifies the functions of the Office, including to: (1) advise the President of scientific and technological considerations involved in areas of national concern; (2) evaluate the scale, quality, and effectiveness of the Federal effort in science and technology and advise on appropriate actions; (3) advise the President on scientific and technological considerations with regard to Federal budgets; and (4) assist the President in providing general leadership and coordination of the research and development programs of the Federal Government. Title III: The Federal Science and Technology Survey Committee - Establishes within the Executive Office of the President, and in association with the Office of Science and Technology Policy, a Federal Science and Technology Survey Committee. States that the Committee shall consist of from five to twelve members appointed by the President. Specifies the qualifications of the members of the Committee. States that the functions of the Committee shall be to survey, examine, and analyze the total context of the Federal science and technology effort including missions, goals, personnel, funding, organization, facilities, and activities in general. Stipulates that the life of the Committee shall be fifteen months from the date of its first organizational meeting. Title IV: Miscellaneous - Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
