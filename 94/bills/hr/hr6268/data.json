    "text": "Alaska Hydroelectric Energy Development and Conversion Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to immediately undertake the necessary feasibility studies for the construction of specified hydroelectric projects in Alaska. Directs the Secretay to develop and submit to the Congress, not later than January 1, 1983, a comprehensive plan for the development of the hydroelectric potential of Alaska. Requires the Secretary to dispose of hydroelectric power and energy developed in Alaska in such manner as will: (1) encourage the most widespread use of such power and energy in the development of Alaska and its resources; (2) encourage and facilitate the most widespread use of such power and energy for the production of hydrogen from sea water or surplus fresh water, or both, at hydroelectric project sites in Alaska; and (3) transmit and displace, as transmission lines and related facilities are or may become available, the hydroelectric power and energy not required for use as specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) to the Pacific Northwest to supply such hydroelectric power and energy to the Bonneville Power Administration and to the utility systems, both private and public, interconnected with the transmission facilities of the Bonneville Power Administration. Requires the Secretary to sell the hydroelectric power and energy produced at projects in Alaska at the lowest possible rates consistent with sound business principles. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Alaska Power Administration and the Bonneville Power Administration, to develop and submit to the Congress, not later than January 1, 1985, a comprehensive plan for the construction of such direct current transmission lines and related facilities, as the Secretary deems necessary, for the transmission of hydroelectric power and energy produced in Alaska and not required in Alaska to the transmission system of the Bonneville Power Administration."
