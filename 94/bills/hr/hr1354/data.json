States that every individual who is entitled to supplementary medical insurance benefits shall be entitled to the benefits of the program established by this Act. States that the benefits provided to an individual by the program established by this Act shall consist of home health services, homemaker services, nutrition services, long-term institutional care services, day care and foster home services, and community mental health center outpatient services. Provides that, to the maximum extent possible, the benefits under this Act shall be provided by or through community long-term care centers certified, monitored, and assisted, where applicable, by the State agency which performs the functions of planning, developing, and overseeing such centers. Specifies the functions of community long-term care centers, including the evaluation, certification, and administration of the services to be provided to individuals eligible for such services under this Act. Defines the terms used in this Act. States that the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, after consultation with interested parties, shall develop and make available to community long-term care centers one or more methods of payment for the benefits provided and covered under this Act on a prospective basis. Authorizes the Secretary to make available the method certified by the Governor to community long-term care centers in such State if such method does not increase the cost of the program.
