Stipulates that in ratemaking and cognate proceedings, rulemaking, or determining applications for initial licenses, the procedure requiring a presiding employee to first recommend a decision may be omitted for a particular proceeding or a specified category of proceedings for which an agency finds, on the record, that an expedited decision is imperatively an dunavoidably required to prevent public injury or defeat of legislative policies. Authorizes the Administrative Conference of the United States to establish a Committee on Uniform Rules. Requires five members of the Committee (excluding the chairman for this purpose) to be employees of Federal regulatory agencies or executive departments; and five not to be so employed. Authorizes the committee to draft and submit to the Conference uniform procedural rules to be utilized by all agencies in conducting proceedinggs. Authorizes to be appropriated $50,000 for fiscal year 1976, $100,000 for fiscal year 1977, and $100,00 for fiscal year 1978, for the committee's activities. Stipulates that no agency, or any member, employee, or agent thereof, shall make any written or oral public statement or release, or make public any document, concerning or relating to an agency investigation or proceeding if the contents of the statement, release, or document (1) evidence prejudicial bias or prejudgment concerning facts concerning facts in issue in the investigation or proceeding, or (2) otherwise harm any person in his business, property, or reputation, unless the benefit to the public clearly exceeds the potential harm to the person adversely affected."
