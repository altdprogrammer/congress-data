    "text": "International Disaster, Food, and Development Assistance Act - Title I: Policy - States the declaration of Congress that the freedom, security, and prosperity of the people of the United States are best sustained by international peace and well-being. Declares that such goals cannot be achieved in the midst of the human suffering, deprivation, and despair that now afflict much of mankind. Title II: International Famine and Disaster Relief - Authorizes the President to provide famine or other disaster relief assistance to any foreign country on such terms and conditions as he may determine. Authorizes to be appropriated for such purpose $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1976 and 1977. Requires the President to submit quarterly reports to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on the programming and obligation of funds under this Act. States that assistance under this Act shall be provided to the maximum extent practicable as part of international assistance efforts coordinated and carried out by the United Nations and other agencies, countries, and private organizations. Title III: Agricultural Commodity Distribution Abroad - Directs the President, in furnishing agricultural commodity assistance abroad, to give priority consideration to those countries most seriously affected by food shortages and unable to meet immediate food requirements. Authorizes the President to seek international agreement for a system of national food reserves to meet food shortage emergencies and to provide insurance against unexpected short falls in food production. Provides that the President shall determine what part of the exportable supply of U.S, agricultural commodities may be used for distribution abroad on other than commercial terms. Requires the President to report to Congress at the time of his budget submission for each fiscal year on a global assessment of food needs for that fiscal year. States that, in negotiating agricultural commodity agreements with recipient countries, the United States shall emphasize the use of sales proceeds returned to such countries for purposes which directly improve the lives of the poorest of their people and their capacity to take part in the development of their countries. Provides that the Secretary of Agriculture, in exercising his authority to barter or exchange agricultural commodities under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act, shall coordinate his activities with any barters or exchanges for such materials undertaken pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Title IV: Development Assistance - Authorizes appropriations for specified programs under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for fiscal years 1976 and 1977, including food and nutrition, population planning and health, education and human resources development, and guarantees for housing in foreign countries."
