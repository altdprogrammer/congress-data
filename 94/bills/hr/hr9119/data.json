    "text": "Domestic Food Price Impact Statement Act - States that no agricultural commodity may be exported to any foreign country unless: (1) the person exporting has submitted a registration statement to the Secretary of Commerce; and (2) the Secretary has approved such statement. Provides that the Secretary may not approve an export registration statement for a quantity of a commodity which, when added to the quantity of such commodity already approved, exceeds 20 percent of the level of domestic production. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a limitation lower than 20 percent under specified circumstances. Stipulates that such limitations shall not apply to any commodity with respect to which the Secretary of Commerce causes to be published a domestic food price impact statement which contains the Secretary's certification that: (1) the domestic production of such commodity will be sufficient to insure against domestic scarcity; (2) exports in excess of the limitation will not have any direct or indirect impact on consumer prices in the United States; and (3) such exports will not result in increased unemployment in the United States. States that this Act applies to agricultural commodities planted for harvest in 1975 and subsequent years."
