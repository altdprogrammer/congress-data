Rept. 94-1527) Agricultural Census Amendments Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to determine the reporting burden on respondents of the agriculture, drainage, and irrigation censuses and to take steps to reduce such burdens by at least one-half. Requires the Secretary to transmit a report to Congress setting forth his determination of the reporting burden and the steps to be taken to reduce it. States that the statistical classification of farms which was in effect on June 30, 1976, shall remain in effect after the effective date of this Act. Requires that such classification in effect with respect to the 1979 and later censuses be prescribed so as not to exclude establishments which have sold or would normally sell more than a minimum value of agricultural products as defined in this Act. Directs the Department of Commerce, in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, to develop methods of improving the collection, analysis, and publication of data relating to the ownership structure of farms."
