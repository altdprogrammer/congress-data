    "text": "Energy Conservation Research and Development Act - Declares it the purpose of this Act to establish an energy conservation program through the development of new technologies designed to reduce consumption by small energy consumers and organizations that influence energy consumption. Title I: State Energy Conservation Research and Development Institutes - Authorizes the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to assist the States in establishing and operating energy research, development and demonstration institutes. Authorizes the expenditure of additional funds to the institutes for special projects which would not otherwise be undertaken, provided such funds are matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis by non-Federal sources. Lists requirements and qualifications for such institutes. Authorizes the Administrator to establish additional rules and regulations, and to encourage cooperation between the institutes and other organizations. Directs the Administrator to submit an annual progress report to Congress with regard to projects financed under this title. Title II: Cooperative Energy Conservation Extension Service - Directs the Administrator to submit to Congress a cooperative energy conservation plan, including the creation of a Cooperative Energy Conservation Service. Details requirements for such a plan, including a list of services to be offered by the Conservation Service. Requires congressional action before the plan becomes finalized. Title III: Authorizing Appropriations - Authorizes the appropriation of $100,000 to each State for the establishment of the institutes during fiscal year 1977. Authorizes $250,000 to each State for each of the fiscal years 1978 through 1980, inclusive, for such purposes. Authorizes the appropriation of the following sums for special energy conservation projects of such institutes: $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1977, $6,000,000 for fiscal year 1978, $7,000,000 for fiscal year 1979, and $7,500,000 for fiscal year 1980. Authorizes the appropriation of $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1977 and 1978, for the establishment of the Cooperative Energy Conservation Extension Service."
