Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to formulate and carry out a continuous program which classifies and inventories the nation's wetlands; measures the degradation and loss of wetlands; and evaluates the contribution of wetlands to fish and wildlife conservation and the quality of the human environment. Directs all departments and agencies of the Federal Government to furnish information concerning the extent of destruction, alteration and uses of wetlands under the programs of said departments and agencies. Authorizes the Secretary to contract with educational institutions and State fish and wildlife agencies and private organizations to collect and analyze data which he determines to be appropriated for the purposes of the Act. Directs the Secretary to submit a comprehensive report of his findings to the Congress. Authorizes to be appropriated not to exceed $750,000 for fiscal year 1976 and such sums for succeeding fiscal years as may be necessary to carry out the purpose of the Act."
