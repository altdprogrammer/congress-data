Establishes a schedule of incentive pay in amounts up to $8,500 for physicians, and $4,250 for dentists, annually. Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to report to Congress by August 31, 1976, on investigations and evaluations: (1) of the problems facing Federal departments and agencies, including the uniformed services, in recruiting and retaining qualified physicians and dentists; (2) of the extent to which a uniform system of pay, allowances, and benefits would alleviate or solve such problems; and (3) of other appropriate solutions. Directs the Comptroller General to develop alternative courses of action to solve such recruitment and retention problems. (Amends 38 U.S.C. 4107; 4114 (a) (2))"
