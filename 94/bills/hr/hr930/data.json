    "text": "Requires that in promulgating standards, under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Secretary of Labor shall take into consideration and give appropriate recognition to the differences between the light residential construction industry and the heavy construction industry. Requires that any such standards which are made applicable to the light residential construction industry shall be separate from those applicable to the heavy construction industry and shall reflect the less hazardous working conditions and smaller size of most employers in the light residential construction industry. Authorizes the Secretary to visit the workplace of any small employer which has fifty or fewer employees for the purpose of affording consultation and advice for such employer. States that such visit shall be conducted only upon a valid request of the employer and shall be limited to the matters specified in the request. Provides that no visit authorized by this Act shall be regarded as an inspection or investigation under the Occupational Health and Safety Act and no notices or citations shall be issued nor shall any civil penalties be proposed by the Secretary upon such visit. States that the Secretary shall provide for appropriate consultation with employees at the workplace concerning the matters covered by the consultation."
