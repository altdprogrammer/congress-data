Requires the President and the Governor of each State to assure that the National Advisory Council of Vocational Education and the State Advisory Councils, respectively: (1) have balanced representation by race, color, sex, and national origin; and (2) include persons familiar with sex stereotyping in education. Authorizes the appropriation of $5,000,000 for each fiscal year to establish an office for women within the vocational education program of each State. Requires each State, in order to be eligible for vocational education grants: (1) to assure equal access to such programs by men and women; and (2) to furnish specified statistical information. Directs the Commissioner of Vocational Education and State boards to give funding priority to programs designed to reduce such sex stereotyping. Authorizes the appropriation of $60,000,000 for the period from July 1, 1976, to September 30, 1977, and $75,000,000 for each fiscal year thereafter for consumer and homemaking education."
