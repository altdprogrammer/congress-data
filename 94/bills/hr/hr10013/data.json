    "text": "National Climate Program Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to help the Nation respond more effectively to climate-induced problems by enabling its Government to be aware of and anticipate climate fluctuations and their domestic and international impacts, particularly in the areas of management and planning of domestic and international food supplies, and land, natural resource, and energy allocation and utilization. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to coordinate the establishment and operation of a climate program to collect, analyze and disseminate data concerning past, present and future climatic states, their fluctuations, and the influence of man's activities on the process of climatic dynamics. States that the program shall include, but not be limited to: (1) development of a climate impact warning system to provide both timely warnings and assessments of the risks of future climate impacts; (2) improvement of current monthly and seasonal temperature and precipitation predictions, particularly with respect to their impact on food production, availability of water resources, and energy consumption; and (3) development of mathematical-computer systems for the modeling, simulation, and prediction of climate and man's effects on climate. Directs the Secretary to consult and coordinate with climatic experts and with Federal departments and agencies. Requires the Secretary to establish advisory committees in the field of climatology and related fields. Specifies that the Secretary must prepare and submit an annual report for the President and the Congress on the administration of this Act, including, but not limited to: (1) a summary of the achievements of the climate program during the previous year; (2) a list of publications produced as a result of research sponsored under this Act; and (3) a summary of the outstanding problems encountered in the administration of this Act during the year. Authorizes to be appropriated to the participating Federal departments and agencies such sums to carry out the provisions of this Act as may be necessary, not to exceed $10,000,000 for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 1976, and ending September 30, 1976, not to exceed $42,000,000 for fiscal year 1977, not to exceed $48,000,000 for fiscal year 1978, and not to exceed $56,000,000 for fiscal year 1979."
