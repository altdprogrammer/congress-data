    "text": "Foreign Crimes Act - Provides that any citizen of the United States who commits a crime outside the United States while serving with or working for the Armed Forces shall, if the crime was committed during the performance of official duties on Armed Forces property or against a U.S. citizen, be guilty of a like offense against the United States and be subject to a like punishment as that provided for offenses occurring within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. Provides that this provision will not deprive military courts of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to those offenders and offenses that may be tried in a military court. Allows the apprehension of a U.S. citizen accompanying the Armed Forces outside the country if there is probable cause to believe that he has committed an offense against the laws of the U.S. or of the country in which he is staying, or if the country requests that he be apprehended and delivered to them for trial. Allows the restraint of any person so apprehended. Allows the removal of any U.S. citizen from a foreign country to a place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States if, after hearing, it is found that there is probable cause to believe that he has committed an offense against the laws of this country. Provides that any U.S. citizen may be delivered to foreign authorities for trial for offenses against their laws. Authorizes military judges to issue search warrants for property stolen or embezzled in violation of U.S. law or which is designed or intended for use or which has been used by a U.S. citizen in committing an offense while accompanying the Armed Forces in a foreign country. Provides that only a military judge may issue warrants for the apprehension of persons and search warrants and issue orders for removal, delivery or confinement of any such person. Allows any provost marshal, military or air policeman, shore patrolman or other member of the armed services assigned to like duties to serve warrants for the apprehension of persons, apprehend persons without a warrant or execute a search warrant. Provides any U.S. citizen subject to these provisions with the right of counsel of choice or to have counsel appointed for him. Limits the time of confinement under arrest to 72 hours except in cases of removal in which case the limit will be ten days. Provides that the provisions of this act are subject to any treaty arrangements to which the United States is a party or to any accepted rule of customary international law. (Adds 18 U.S.C. 16, 17; 10 U.S.C. 981-990)"
