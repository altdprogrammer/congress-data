    "text": "(House agreed to Senate amendments with amendments) Wetlands Loan Extension Act - Extends for a period of seven years (from June 30, 1976, to September 30, 1983) the authorization, under the Wetlands Loan Act, that allows appropriations to be made to the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund in the form of interest free loans for the purpose of acquiring wetlands for migratory waterfowl. Extends from fiscal year 1977 to fiscal year 1983 the date when monies appropriated to the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund would be required to be repaid to the Treasury of the United States from duck stamp receipts. Changes, under the Hunting Stamp Tax Act, the name of the \"migratory bird hunting stamp\" to the \"migratory bird hunting and conservation stamp\". Authorizes the sale of duck stamps at places other than post offices; and provides that anyone can redeem unused stamps under prescribed conditions. Requires the Department of the Interior, as well as the Postal Service, to deposit the revenues it has collected from duck stamp sales into the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund account. Allows the Secretary of the Interior to purchase or rent interests in land, water, or land and water, which have been recommended for purchase or rental by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission. Revises, under the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act, the exchange authority of the Secretary of the Interior to allow him to dispose of interests in acquired or public lands within the System by land exchange."
