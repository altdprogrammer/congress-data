Limits such credit to $250 for any taxable year. Reduces such credit by five percent of the amount of excess of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income over $10,000, in the case of taxable years beginning in 1976; $15,000, in the case of taxable years beginning in 1977 and $20,000, in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1977. Apportions such credit among two or more eligible taxpayers using the same principal residence based on such taxpayers' shares of the property tax or of the rent paid."
