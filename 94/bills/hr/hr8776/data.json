Title II: Subpena Power - Requires each Federal agency to designate by rule the officers authorized to sign and issue subpenas. Provides that the employee who presides at the reception of evidence at an agency hearing may not: (1) consult a person or party on a fact in issue, unless on notice and opportunity for all parties to participate; or (2) be responsible to or subject to the supervision or direction of an employee or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for an agency. Title III: Payment of Expenses Incurred Before Agencies - Directs each Federal agency to pay to any interested person who participates in an agency preceeding the reasonable costs of such participation, including attorney fees, if the agency determines that such person is unable to pay such costs and that such person made a discernible contribution to promoting agency implementation of any law related to such proceeding. Title IV: Sovereign Immunity - Bars the Federal Government from invoking the defense of sovereign immunity in civil actions against Federal agencies in which the plaintiff seeks relief other than money damages. Title V: Enforcement of Standards for Grants - Directs each Federal agency which is authorized to make and administer Federal grants-in-aid to maintain a complaint procedure, as specified by this Act, for the receipt, consideration, and disposition of complaints from persons adversely affected by agency action on grant applications or grant distributions."
