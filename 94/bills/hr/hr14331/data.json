Stipulates that programs shall provide for technical assistance and practical demonstration in the agricultural, commercial, residential, and small business sectors. Stipulates that such program shall be implemented in a manner designed to minimize conflict with existing services in the private sector of the economy. Establishes procedures and criteria for the development of State plans for implementing the provisions of this Act. Allows for Federal development of plans for States in which an acceptable plan has not been submitted. Directs the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to develop a comprehensive program and plan for coordination of Federal energy education and information dissemination programs. Requires such plan to detail procedures for assessing the energy efficiency of various Federal programs. Establishes a National Energy Extension Service Advisory Board to conduct a continuing review of the programs. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for the purposes of this Act. Stipulates that the annual authorization for such programs may be included in the annual authorization for nonnuclear programs of the Energy Research and Development Administration. Prescribes a formula for allocation of such funds to the States."
