Declares that persons who are injured or about to be injured by such prohibited conduct may maintain a civil action in the United States district court without regard to the amount in controversy. Authorizes the court to direct that costs for such action be paid by the defendant unless such civil action is frivolous. Imposes criminal penalties for knowing violations of this Act of up to $1,000,000 in the case of a corporation and up to $100,000 in the case of any other person."
