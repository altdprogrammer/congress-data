    "text": "Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments - Provides, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, that included within the definition of aliens are those persons coming temporarily to the United States for a period of not more than a year to perform other than exceptional services or labor if the Secretary of Labor has determined that there are not sufficient workers available at the aliens' destination who are willing and able to perform such services or labor. Limits the number of aliens born in any foreign state or dependent area located in the Eastern Hemisphere who may be issued immigrant visas or who may otherwise acquire the status of lawfully admitted aliens for permanent residence to 45,000 in the first three quarters of any fiscal year and to 170,000 in any fiscal year. Limits such immigrant visas to aliens born in any foreign state of the Western Hemisphere or in the Canal Zone, or in a dependent area located in the Western Hemisphere, to 32,000 in the first three quarters of any fiscal year and to 120,000 in any fiscal year. Sets forth conditions for provisional entries. Provides that the Secretary of State shall terminate the registration of any alien who fails to apply for an immigrant visa within one year following notification to him of the availability of such a visa. Requires the Secretary of Labor to submit quarterly to the Congress a report containing complete and detailed statements of facts pertinent to labor certification procedures, including: (1) lists of occupations in short supply or oversupply; (2) regionally projected manpower needs; and (3) up-to-date statistics on the number of labor certifications approved or denied. Provides that the Secretary of State may, when such action is in the national interest, parole into the United States all or part of a group of aliens qualified for such parole under the Immigration and Nationality Act."
