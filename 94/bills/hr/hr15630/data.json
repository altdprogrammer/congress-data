    "text": "Disability Insurance Amendments - Amends Title II: (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Isurance) of the Social Security Act to provide separate and increased financing for the disability insurance program. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to establish a Disability Insurance tax on self-employment income, employees' wages, and wages paid by employers. Establishes lower rates for the Old Age and Survivors tax to reflect the removal of Disability tax from such tax. Limits, under such title as specified, funds made available for the rehabilitation program. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to prescribe criteria for determining when services performed or earnings derived from services demonstrate an individual's ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe by regulation the level of severity which shall be deemed to be sufficient to preclude an individual from engaging in substantial gainful work as required for a finding of disability. Provides that agreements between the Secretary and State agencies authorizing such agencies to make determinations as to an individual's disability or date of disability within such State may be expanded to include provisions for such agency to make such determinations with respect to all applicants in specified geographical areas within one or more neighboring States. Provides that each State which has such an agreement shall be entitled to receive payment, as determined by the Secretary (presently \"as mutually agreed\"), for the cost to the State of carrying out the agreement. Allows termination of such agreements by the State or by the Secretary upon finding by the Secretary that the State has failed to carry out the agreements. Eliminates the requirements that months in the Medicare waiting period be consecutive (presently the Act requires that individuals under age 65, in order to be eligible for Medicare, must have been entitled to benefits under Title II for 24 consecutive months). Limits, as specified, the months which shall be considered in determining whether the 24 months of eligibility have been attained."
