Authorizes the Secretary to require that grain loaded at an interior point in the United States for transportation from the United States be inspected in a similar manner. Allows the Secretary to enter into contracts with any State or person for such inspection functions if such State or person meets specified requirements. Forbids the Secretary from entering into such contracts with any person or business entity currently engaged in the storage or merchandising of grain. Directs the Secretary to charge and collect reasonable fees to cover the costs incident to the performance of official inspection and supervision of weighing functions. States that such fees and any proceeds from the sale of samples obtained for inspection purposes which become the property of the United States, shall be deposited in a fund for the expenses of the Department in providing official inspection services. States that official inspection contracts entered into terminate within five years and may be renewed in accordance with criteria specified in this Act. Allows the Secretary to revoke such contracts, after an opportunity for a hearing has been afforded, when the Secretary determines the contractor has not complied with any provision of this Act. Allows the suspension of such contract for 30 days without a hearing when the Secretary has reason to believe there is cause for revocation. Provides for the inspection of American grain in Canadian ports for overseas shipment. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) investigate the weighing of grain shipped in interstate or foreign commerce; (2) prescribe regulation standards for accurate weighing and certification procedures; and (3) require the maintenance of accurate records of the weighing of grain. Directs the Secretary to cause continuous supervision of weighing of all grain shipped in or out of grain elevators. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations regarding all weights and scales used in such weighing. Allows a State to supervise the weighing and inspection of grain and testing of weights and scales if such State meets specified criteria. Requires that representatives of the Secretary be afforded access to any elevator or warehouse from which grain is delivered or shipped in interstate or foreign commerce. Allows the Secretary to refuse any person official inspection if such person has violated specified provisions of this Act. Title III: Official Inspection Personnel - Authorizes the Secretary to issue licenses to qualified individuals to perform official grain inspection functions. Forbids any person from performing official grain inspection functions without a valid license or authorization from the Secretary. States that all such licenses shall expire triennially and any license shall be suspended automatically when the licensee ceases to be employed by an official grain inspection contract. Provides for the periodic rotation of supervisory personnel for grain inspection for the stated purpose of preserving the integrity of the inspection system. Allows the Secretary to automatically revoke any license issued under this Act if the licensee has been convicted of any offense specified in this Act. Title IV: Refusal of Inspection and Civil Penalties - Allows the Secretary to refuse to provide official inspection of grain or assess a civil penalty of $100,000 per violation or both for any individual violating the provisions of this Act. Allows the Secretary to refuse inspection for seven days without a hearing pending final determination of the proceedings when the Secretary has reason to believe there is sufficient cause. Title V: Records - Requires the maintenance of records of purchases, sales, transportation and handling by any person who receives official inspection and that such records be made available to authorized representatives of the Secretary. Title VI: Criminal Provisions - Amends specified Federal Acts to provide criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Title VII: Department of Agriculture Reporting Requirements and Studies - Directs the Secretary to report annually to specified Congressional committees regarding the effectiveness of the official grain inspection system together with recommendations for legislation. Directs the Secretary to notify such committees of complaints regarding faulty grain delivery made by a foreign purchaser. Requires an annual summary of all complaints made by foreign purchasers or prospective purchasers. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study regarding the adequacy of current grain standards and to make such changes as are determined to be necessary and appropriate. Title VIII: Miscellaneous Sets forth the authority granted the Secretary under this Act including the authority to prescribe such rules and regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Sets forth criminal penalties for any unauthorized person who makes public any information obtained under this Act with specified exceptions.
