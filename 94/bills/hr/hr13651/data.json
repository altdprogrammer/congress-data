    "text": "Alaska National Gas Transportation Route Act - Expresses the intent of Congress that natural gas on the North Slope of Alaska should be equitably shared, directly or indirectly, by all regions of the country. Establishes procedures for the determination by the Federal Power Commission and the Secretary of the Interior of an Alaska natural gas transportation route. Requires notification of appropriate Congressional committees upon receipt of applications for rights-of-way for construction of such pipeline. Stipulates that the initial route decision shall be made by the Commission no later than December 15, 1976, subject to a final decision by the Secretary no later than March 1, 1977. Directs the Secretary of the Interior and other appropriate Federal officials to issue all necessary permits and to take appropriate action to expedite the enforcement of all rights- of-way related to the construction and operation of such pipeline. Requires compliance with requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 relating to rights- of-way for pipelines through Federal lands. Exempts such pipeline from requirements concerning: (1) environmental protection; (2) public hearings; and (3) furnishing of specified information and reports. Declares that the initial and final route decisions and other actions of Federal officers and agencies under this Act shall not be subject to judicial review by the Courts. Allows for claims that: (1) this Act is unconstitutional; (2) actions under this Act will deny Constitutional rights; and (3) actions taken are beyond the scope of authority conferred by this Act, provided that such claims are filed within 60 days following the date of the challenged action. Declares that exclusive jurisdiction shall be vested in the United States district courts, and that review of any final order shall be had only upon direct appeal to the United States Supreme Court. Declares that the district court shall not have the power to issue injunctive relief against the issuance of any certificate, except in cases where a final judgment is entered."
