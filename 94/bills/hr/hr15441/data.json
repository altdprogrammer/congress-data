    "text": "Amends the Interstate Commerce Act to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission, after a full hearing, to establish through routes, joint classifications, and joint rates, fares, or charges applicable to the transportation of property by common carriers by motor vehicle and other such carriers or common carriers by rail, express or water. Directs the Commission to give preference in such decision to the carrier which originates the traffic. Specifies limitations on the Commission's authority to establish such through routes. Requires carriers which are a party to a through route and joint rate to promptly pay divisions or make interline settlements with the other carriers which are a party to such route or rate. Authorizes the Commission to suspend or cancel such through route or joint rate in the event of undue delinquency in the settlement of such divisions or interline settlements. Stipulates that if any tariff or schedule which cancels any through route, joint rate, fare, charge, or classification is suspended by the Commission for investigations, the burden of proof shall be upon the carrier or carriers proposing such cancellation to show that it is consistent with the public interest."
