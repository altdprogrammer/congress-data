    "text": "Victims of Crime Act - Establishes the Violent Crimes Compensation Commission to make grants to qualifying States, such grants to comprise 50 percent of the cost of a State's program to compensate victims of violent crimes. Entitles a State to a grant if the Commission finds such State has in effect a system of public compensation for the victims of violent crimes which: (1) is impartially administered; (2) compensates individuals or surviving dependents for personal injuries which were the proximate result of any act or omission punishable under Federal criminal law; (3) provides emergency assistance to claimants in immediate need because of severe financial hardship; and (4) affords individual claimants the right to a hearing with adequate administrative or judicial review for any aggrieved claimant. Excludes from computation of a State program's cost specified amounts, including administrative costs, compensation for pain and suffering, property loss or attorney's fees, and the amount by which any individual awards exceeds $50,000. Requires States receiving funding under this Act to annually submit to the Commission and to written records documents each submitted claim, the total monetary loss claimed by each claimant, the reason for the claim's approval or disapproval, and other pertinent data. Requires the Commission to undertake a study of the advisability of using individual means tests or a documentation of individual income and resources as a condition of eligibility for State compensation, and to report the results of this study to the Judiciary Committee of the House and Senate and to Congress at the end of the second fiscal year of funding State programs. Authorizes the appropriation of specified sums for fiscal year 1977-1979 to carry out the purposes of this Act."
