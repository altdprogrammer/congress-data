    "text": "Permits a Federal agency receiving a request for any document pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act to refer such request to the agency which originated the requested document. Provides that any agency conponent the principal purpose of which is criminal investigation must, with respect to requests for documents of 200 pages or less, comply with or deny such request within 60 days after the receipt of such request. States that an appeal from a denial of such request must be decided by such agency within 30 days of the receipt of such appeal. Allows the time limits set by this Act to be extended an additional 30 days for each 200 pages or portion thereof requested provided that the requester is informed as to the total number of pages within the scope of such request. Expands the Act to cover specified inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda (previously could not be obtained pursuant to the Act). Exempts from the provisions of such Act all records (as opposed to only medical records previously exempted by the Act) the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Provides that a document requested under the Act need not be provided if, after portions exempted from the coverage of the Act are excised, what remains is not substantial or does not contain significant information pertaining to the subject of the request. States that such document need not be released to the requester if the information it contains is already in the public domain."
