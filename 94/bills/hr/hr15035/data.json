Provides that any license granted may, upon its expiration, be renewed, if the Commission finds that the public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by the renewal of such license. Provides that the Commission may by rule prescribe the period or periods for which licenses shall be granted and renewed for particular classes of stations, but the Commission may not adopt or follow any rule which would preclude it from granting or renewing a license for a shorter period than that prescribed for stations of such class. Directs that the Commission shall not require any such applicant to file any information which previously has been furnished to the Commission."
