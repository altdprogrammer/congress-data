Increases the maximum Federal share of development grants, under such Act, from 66 2/3 percent to 80 percent. Authorizes annual grants to coastal States of up to 80 percent of the cost of implementing State management programs, if such programs are preliminarily approved.

Requires the States to expend such payments, in part, for the retirement of State and local bonds which were issued for projects or programs designed to provide revenues which are to be used to provide public services and facilities which are made necessary by Outer Continental Shelf energy activity. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1981 for such payments. States the intent of the Congress that the States should allocate all or a portion of such payments to local governments. Authorizes grants of up to 80 percent to coastal States whose coastal zone is being or is likely to be impacted by energy facilities, to enable such States to study and plan for such consequences. Requires that funds for such grants be deposited in the Coastal Energy Activity Impact Fund. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1981 for such Fund. States the intent of the Congress that the States should allocate all or a portion of such grant funds to local governments. Authorizes grants of up to 90 percent for the coordination of State coastal zone planning, policies, and programs in contiguous interstate areas, and for studying, planning, and implementing unified coastal zone policies in such areas. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a program of research and training to support the development and implementation of State coastal zone management programs, and a comprehensive review of all aspects of the shellfish industry, on which a report to the Congress shall be made. Authorizes grants to coastal States for acquisition of access to public beaches and other public coastal areas. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1980 to carry out the various provisions of this Act. Allows the Secretary to guarantee, through September 30, 1981, the payment of interest on and the principal balance of bonds issued by coastal States or local governments therein for the purpose of obtaining revenues to be used to provide public services and public facilities made necessary by Outer Continental Shelf energy activities. Permits guarantee for any one State or local government of amounts up to $20,000,000.
