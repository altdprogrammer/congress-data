Provides that the terms of the Postmaster General and the Deputy Postmaster General shall be fixed by the Governors of the Board of Governors. Sets forth the requirements governing the annual authorization of appropriations.

Provides that the Postal Rate Commission shall have the authority to initiate reviews and hearings with respect to the activities of the Board of Governors and the Postal Service under this chapter. Enumerates the procedures governing such reviews and hearings.

Requires that the Postal Rate Commission shall, on a regular basis, conduct regional hearings to afford interested parties with an opportunity to bring to the attention of the Commission problems, questions, and issues with respect to postal service and rates of postage."
