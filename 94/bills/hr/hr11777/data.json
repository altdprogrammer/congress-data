    "text": "Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act to provide that six members of the Federal Election Commission be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Makes the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives members without the right to vote. Establishes the Office of the Federal Election Counsel which is given the authority and responsibility to enforce such Act, the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 concerning the Presidential Campaign Fund, the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account, and the provisions of the Criminal Code concerning the raising and expenditure of campaign funds. Empowers the Counsel to conduct investigations, instruct the Federal Bureau of Investigation on matters within the jurisdiction of the Counsel, decide whether to prosecute any person, and to initiate civil actions to enforce this Act. States that any advisory opinion issued by the Commission which has general applicability shall within 60 days after it is rendered be proposed as a rule by the Commission. Rescinds the Commission's power to formulate general policy with respect to the Federal Election Campaign Act and those sections of the Criminal Code dealing with campaign contributions and expenditures. Defines \"contribution\" for purposes of the Criminal Code. Restricts specified existing campaign contribution reporting requirements. Permits campaign contribution solicitation by labor unions of union members or members' families, and by corporations of stockholders and their families. Broadens the applicability of existing law which requires identification of persons responsible for distributing or printing campaign material for announced candidates. Extends such identification to broadcast as well as all printed political advertisements. States that such advertisement shall indicate whether or not it has been authorized by a candidate or a candidate's authorized political committee. Prescribes penalties for failure to make identifications required by this Act. Makes technical and conforming amendments to existing law. (Amends 18 U.S.C. 608, 610, Adds 18 U.S.C. 612)"
