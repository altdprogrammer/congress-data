    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to designate five institutions of higher education at which comprehensive centers, short and long term training institutes, and undergraduate and postgraduate educational programs will be established and conducted to prepare persons to (1) conduct research, (2) operate laboratories, (3) plan, build, and operate mines, (4) plan, build, and operate liquefaction or gasification plants, or other fuel utilization or conversion facilities, (5) engage in ecological studies, and (6) enter other related professional or technical pursuits, dealing with coal as a major national energy resource. States that such centers shall be located in those States containing a major portion of the estimated coal reserves in the United States, but that not more than one comprehensive coal center established pursuant to this Act shall be located in a single State. Authorizes to be appropriated through the fiscal year ending June 30, 1979 up to $125,000,000, for the construction of facilities at comprehensive centers established pursuant to this Act, including initially installed fixed equipment. Authorizes to be appropriated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976, and each fiscal year thereafter, such sums as may be necessary for the operation of the center and the conduct of programs at each center. Establishes an Advisory Council on Coal Education, Training, and Research to advise the Secretary with respect to the administration of this Act, and specifies the composition of such Council. Authorizes the Secretary to award up to one thousand five hundred fellowships for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and each of the five succeeding fiscal years, for graduate study and research in those areas of applied science and engineering that are related to the production, conservation, and utilization of coal. Provides a stipend of $4,000 to each person awarded such a fellowship for each academic year of study, up to four years. Authorizes to be appropriated $11,000,000 for fiscal year 1976 and each of the five succeeding fiscal years for the awarding of such fellowships."
