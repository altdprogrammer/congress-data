Defines a \"displaced homemaker\" as an individual who: (1) has worked in the home, providing unpaid household services for family members; (2) is not gainfully employed; (3) has had, or would have, difficulty in securing employment; and (4) has been dependent on the income of another family member but is no longer supported by such income, or has been dependent on Federal assistance but is no longer eligible for such assistance. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study to determine the feasibility of and appropriate procedures for allowing displaced homemakers to participate in specified Federal programs. Requires the Secretary to submit a final report to each House of the Congress not later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations of sums necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
