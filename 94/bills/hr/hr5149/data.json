    "text": "Social Security Amendments- Title I: Establishment of Assured Annual Income Benefits Program for the Aged, the Blind, and the Disabled - Repeals title XVI (Supplemental Security Income Benefits) of the Social Security Act. Adds a new title to provide an assured minimum annual income for the aged, blind, and disabled. States that the amount of benefits payable shall be in an amount sufficient to assure an annual income of $3,850 in the case of single individuals and $5,200 in the case of married couples. Provides for the annual adjustment of the dollar amount of the minimum income benefit levels to account for changes in the cost of living. States that the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare may provide additional increases in the case of elderly couples and individuals living in large metropolitan areas where the cost of living exceeds the national average. Authorizes appropriations of sums necessary to carry out this title. Eliminates actuarial reductions in benefits. Title II: Old Age Survivors and Disability Insurance Benefits - Establishes a new formula for computing the payment of benefits to married couples on the basis of their combined earning record. Increases the amount of outside earnings an individual may earn and still be eligible for title II benefits. Provides a cutoff of sixty years of age for both men and women in computing insured status and average monthly wage. Reduces to sixty the age requirement for entitlement to old age insurance benefits. Reduces to fifty the age requirement for entitlement to widow's and widower's insurance benefits. Reduces to sixty the age requirement for entitlement to benefits of dependent and surviving parents. Entitles specified brothers and sisters to survivor's benefits under this title. Revises the requirements to obtain disability benefits in the case of blind persons. Repeals the provision which requires that disability insurance benefits be reduced if the beneficiary is receiving workmen's compensation. Provides that in any case in which an individual would have been entitled to a disability insurance benefit for any month had application been filed therefor before the end of the twelfth month immediately succeeding such month, but such application was not filed before the end of such twelfth month, an application for such benefit which is filed after the end of such twelfth month may be accepted as a valid application for such benefit if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare that there was good cause for the previous failure to file the application. Allows Federal officers and employees to elect coverage under the Old-Age, Survivors', and Disability Insurance System of the Social Security Act by filing a certificate with the Internal Revenue Service stating such intention. Prescribes time limits for filing such certificate, and the period of time for which it is effective. Requires an individual filing a certificate to give notice thereof to the head of the Federal agency or instrumentality in or by which he is employed, at or before the time of filing such certificate. Title III: Health Insurance Benefits - Reduces to sixty the age requirement for health insurance benefits. Revises health insurance coverage for disabled individuals by eliminating various age and time requirements. Makes retired Federal employees eligible for health insurance benefits. Establishes special rules for retired Federal employees with duplicate health benefits coverage. Provides for hospital insurance coverage for specified State and local employees. Provides for coverage of prescription drugs under the hospital insurance program. Establishes, within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, a Formulary Committee to compile and publish a Formulary listing the drugs deemed qualified for benefits under this Act, together with maximum allowable costs and additional information concerning such drugs. Makes provisions for selecting drugs for the Formulary. Exempts from the premium payment requirement under the Supplemental Medical Insurance Program individuals with a gross annual income of less than $4,800. Provides coverage for annual physical examinations, flu shots, breast prosthesis, hearing aids, optometrists services, eyeglasses, and dental services under the supplementary medical insurance program. Title IV: Miscellaneous and General Provisions - Authorizes the Secretary to formulate and administer a food allowance program under which qualified elderly persons whose annual income is less than $5,000 may obtain without charge food allowance coupons which can be used only to purchase food from retail food stores. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as are necessary for the stamp program. Authorizes to be appropriated for each fiscal year to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors' Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, and the Federal Supplementary Insurance Trust Fund, as may be appropriate, such sums as the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare deems necessary."
