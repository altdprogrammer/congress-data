    "text": "Medicare Long-Term Care Act - Establishes, under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare), a voluntary program to provide long-term care benefits for aged and disabled individuals who elect to enroll under such program, financed from premium payments by enrollees together with contributions from funds appropriated by the Federal Government and contributions by the States. Lists criteria for eligibility for long-term care service benefits. Provides that the benefits provided to an individual by this Act shall consist of (1) home health services, (2) homemaker services, (3) nutrition services, (4) long-term institutional care services, (5) day care and foster home services, and (6) community mental health center outpatient services. Enumerates the requirements for a State long-term care agency. Provides for the payment of premiums for benefits received under this Act. Establishes on the books of the Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as the Federal Long-Term Care Trust Fund. Creates a body to be known as the Board of Trustees, composed of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, all ex officio. States that the Secretary of the Treasury shall be the Managing Trustee of the Board of Trustees and that the Commissioner of Social Security shall serve as the Secretary of the Board of Trustees. Provides that the Board of Trustees shall meet not less frequently than once each calendar year. Enumerates the duties of the Board of Trustees. Declares that a community long-term care center shall: (1) provide the items and services listed in this Act to each individual (i) who is eligible for benefits under this part, (ii) who resides in the area served by such center and (iii) who is certified as requiring such services; (2) evaluate and certify the long-term care needs of an individual for whom such care may be required in order to maintain such individual in an independent living arrangement which is reasonable given such individual's state of health and other circumstances (but not including such individual's economic circumstances); (3) maintain a continuous relationship with (and periodically evaluate not less than annually) each individual who is receiving any of the items and services listed in this Act; (4) provide full opportunity for such individual and his family to participate in the determinations and functions under this Act; (5) provide an organized system for making its existence and location known to all individuals in its service area who are eligible for benefits under this part, and for making known to such individuals the method or methods by which they may most efficiently obtain and use the services which it makes available; and (6) performs such other functions as the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare may by regulation prescribe in order to have such center most effectively carry out the purposes of this Act. Provides a formula for payments to States for the reimbursement of community long-term care centers. Directs the Secretary, after consultation with organizations representing the chief executives of the various States, and other interested parties, to develop and make available to community long-term care centers one or more methods of obtaining payment for the benefits covered under this Act on a prospective basis. States that once a community long-term care center elects a particular prospective method, it may not alter its election without the prior approval of the Secretary. Provides that whenever the Secretary finds that the number of community long-term care centers electing a particular prospective payment method promulgated in accordance with this Act is not sufficient to provide an adequate basis for either the operation or evaluation of that method, the Secretary shall withdraw that method and allow the community long-term care centers which have elected such method to select another method withn 30 days of notice of such withdrawal. Permits a Governor of a State to certify to the Secretary a method of prospective payment other than those promulgated under this Act. States that the determination of whether an individual is entitled to benefits under this Act shall be made by the Secretary in accordance with regulations prescribed by him. Provides for increases in supplemental security income benefits."
