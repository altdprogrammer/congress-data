    "text": "Export Priorities Act - Title I: General Provisions - Makes technical amendments to the Export Administration Act of 1969. Title II: Agricultural Export Controls - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, within 30 days after the beginning of the crop year for any agricultural commodity, to determine the quantity or the crop of such commodity, if any, that will be available for export and inform the Secretary of Commerce who shall publicly announce such determination. States that no agricultural commodity may be exported to any foreign country unless the person exporting has been issued a license or unless the commodity has been exempted. States that the quantity of any commodity available for export shall be allocated among foreign countries by the Secretary. Specifies the basis for determining such allocation. Provides that the Secretary may reserve not more than 10 percent of a commodity for export in order to meet unexpected foreign demand resulting from natural disaster, crop failure, and changes in existing trading patterns in that commodity. Prescribes the procedures for: (1) issuance of export licenses; (2) administrative revision of quantities available for support; and (3) exports to developing countries. Confers authority on the Secretary to issue such rules or regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. States that fees collected by the Secretary on export licenses shall be deposited in a special account in the Treasury and shall be available to carry out the National School Lunch Act, the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, the Food Stamp Act and the commodity distribution program of the Agricultural Act of 1949, with specified exceptions."
