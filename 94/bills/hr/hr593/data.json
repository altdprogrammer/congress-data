    "text": "Age Discrimination in Employment Amendments - Redefines the term employer, for purposes of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as a person engaged in industry affecting commerce who has twenty or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the year. Includes in such definition any agent of such a person and a State and any agency or instrumentality of a State or political subdivision of a State but does not include the District of Columbia or a corporation wholly owned by the Government of the United States. Redefines the term employment agency to include the United States Employment Service and the system of State and local employment service receiving Federal assistance. Increases the appropriations under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to $5,000,000. Prohibits discrimination in age in specified branches of Federal service. Authorizes the Civil Service Commission to enforce the provisions of this Act and outlines those actions which may be taken. Directs all agencies and departments to comply with any action taken. Permits an aggrieved person to bring a civil action in the proper court. Requires prior notice of 30 days to the Commission of intent to bring suit before a suit may be brought in court."
