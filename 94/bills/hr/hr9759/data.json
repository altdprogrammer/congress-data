    "text": "Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments - Extends through fiscal year 1977 the authorization of appropriations for: (1) water treatment works pilot training programs; (2) the development of a system of forecasting the supply of and demand for water pollution control specialists; (3) grants for State pollution control programs; (4) scholarships, training grants and contracts in the field of water pollution control; (5) grants to designated agencies to assist in the development and operation of continuing areawide waste treatment management planning processes; (6) grants to the States for lake water improvement programs; and (7) the purposes of this Act other than those specified in (1) through (6) above. Authorizes the use of ad valorem taxes to satisfy the user charge system requirement for applicants for treatment works grants under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Extends the provisions for Federal reimbursement of construction costs of publicly owned water treatment works to include reimbursement for works on which construction was started not later than July 1, 1973. Increases the amount of the appropriation authorized to cover such reimbursement to $2,950,000,000. Provides for certification by the State water pollution control agency of treatment projects within such State where the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determines that such projects will be carried out in accordance with State laws and standards at least equivalent to those established by Federal law. Permits the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to extend from July 1, 1977, until July 1, 1982, the deadline for the achievement of effluent limitations of public treatment works required by the Federal Water Pollution Act. Directs the Administrator, when considering such extension, to consider the cost involved in achieving secondary and alternative treatment and the effects such secondary and alternative treatment will have on public health and water quality. Extends until April 1, 1975, the deadline for submission of State water quality inventory reports. Requires such reports to be revised and kept current biennially. Directs the Administrator to submit such reports to Congress on or before October 1, 1975; October 1, 1976, and biennially thereafter. Eliminates the requirement that public hearings on proposed effluent standards be held within thirty days following publication of the standard. Permits the Administrator to defer the effective date of proposed effluent standards for up to three years following promulgation of such standards if he determines that compliance within one year is technologically unfeasible for a particular category of sources. Establishes a civil penalty of not to exceed $50,000 for the owner or operator of any vessel, onshore or offshore facility from which any hazardous substance is discharged. Provides for the designation by the Administrator, as a hazardous substance, any element or compound which presents an imminent and substantical danger to public health or welfare, including fish, shellfish, wildlife, shorelines, and beaches. Provides for a civil penalty of unspecified limit when the United States can show that the discharge of a hazardous substance was the result of willful negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the responsible owner or operator."
