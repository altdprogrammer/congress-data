Allows the Federal Government to seek access to such information by obtaining prior, voluntary, written consent of the school, or by submitting to an appropriate U.S. court a petition accompanied by affidavits by or on behalf of students or parents of students alleging unlawful discrimination by the school. Requires that the school be given reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing."
