    "text": "Food for Peace Fund Act - Provides that every taxpayer may, for the taxable year, designate that an amount not to exceed $1 shall be paid over to the Food for Peace Fund established under this Act. Limits the application of the provisions of this Act to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1974. Establishes on the books of the Treasury a fund to be known as the Food for Peace Fund. Appropriates to the Fund for each fiscal year, out of amounts in the general fund of the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an amount equal to amounts designated during each fiscal year to be paid over to the Fund. Requires that amounts in the Fund shall be available, as provided by appropriation Acts, solely for carrying out the purposes of title II of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954. Makes it the sense of the Congress that amounts available from the Fund for such purposes should be in addition to (and not in lieu of) amount which (but for the enactment of this Act) would have been available for such purposes."
