Provides that this Act shall not affect the tax treatment of the receipt of the distribution by any shareholder, and the basis to a shareholder of his stock in the taxpayer shall not be increased by reason of amounts returned under this Act. Extends through September 1, 1976, the existing withholding tax rates. Amends the Social Security Act to provide that Supplemental Security Income recipients who leave their households because of a major disaster will not have their benefits reduced by one-third. Excludes from countable income under the Supplemental Security Income program assistance received under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 or other assistance under a major disaster declared by the President."
