States that such standards may not be more stringent than primary and secondary ambient air quality standards. Requires the Administrator to approve State implementation plans for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards if: (1) they include emission limitations, or operational techniques, schedules and time-tables for compliance with such measures as promulgated by the Administrator as such may be necessary to insure attainment of standards within the areas affected by various sources; and (2) they provide for the granting of a variance for an emission source beyond the dates provided an application is made therefor and specified criteria are met. States that a variance granted under an applicable implementation plan shall be deemed approved by the Administrator unless within 30 days after the grant of the variance by the State, the Administration finds that the requirements of this Act have not been met."
