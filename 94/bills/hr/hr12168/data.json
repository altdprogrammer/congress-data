Rept. 94-1660) Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act Amendments - Authorizes appropriations for carrying out the provisions of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act and for Federal grants-in-aid under such Act, through fiscal year 1978. Excludes from the definition of the term \"interstate transmission facilities\" as set forth in the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 any facility which transports gas from an interstate gas pipeline to a direct sales customer purchasing gas for its own consumption. Defines \"intrastate pipeline transportation,\" under such Act, to mean pipeline facilities and transportation of gas within a State which are not subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission under the Natural Gas Act, except that it shall include pipeline facilities within a State which trasport gas from an interstate gas pipeline to a direct sales customer within such State purchasing gas for its own consumption. Permits States to adopt additional or more stringent standards for intrastate pipeline transportation. Adds to existing certification requirements the requirement that a State agency encourage and promote programs designed to prevent damage to natural gas pipelines and other subsurface utility equipment. Provides for payment to the States by the Secretary of Transportation of the cost of not more than three full time natural gas pipeline safety inspectors for each State. Requires all persons engaged in the transportation of gas to conduct a program to educate the public on the possible hazards associated with gas leaks and on the importance of reporting gas odors and leaks to appropriate authorities. Permits any person to bring a civil action for mandatory or prohibitive injunctive relief against any person who is alleged to be in violation of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act or an order or regulation issued under the Act."
