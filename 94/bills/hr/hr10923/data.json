Provides that the Secretary of the Interior shall submit, through the President, a report on the study, together with such recommendations, including suggested legislation, that he deems appropriate, to the Congress no later than January 1, 1976. Authorizes to be appropriated the sum of $25,000 for fiscal year 1976, and for each of the three succeeding fiscal years, for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act."
