Abolishes Corps authority over the discharge of fill material into such waterways. Permits the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Engineers to waive jointly any requirements they may have for review and approval of any activities on waters of the United States if the Chief of Engineers determines that such activities will not have a substantial adverse impact on the affected waters for their use to transport interstate or foreign commerce and can be effectively regulated by the State concerned."
