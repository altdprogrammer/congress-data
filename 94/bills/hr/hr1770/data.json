    "date": "1975-01-20", 
    "text": "National Land Resources Act - Presents the finding of the Congress that topsoil is a valuable, unique and peculiar natural resource upon which future generations will be dependent. Declares that ownership of land carries with it a responsibility not to destroy the topsoil or so intermingle or bury it that it will not be easily and economically accessible for use at a later date. Establishes a National Land Resources Protection Commission to be composed of five members. Provides for the appointment of such Commission members by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Provides for the administrative powers of the Commission. Directs the Commission to establish standards for all projects subject to this Act which will assure that a minimum of 12 inches of topsoil or such lesser amount of topsoil as may exist shall be stockpiled from those areas of each such project where the shape or contour of the land is changed. Provides that such stockpiled topsoil shall be used to form a top layer of uniform depth and a minimum of twelve inches deep on all areas of the completed project where soil will be exposed to natural elements. Provides that where sufficient subsoil which is nontoxic to plantlife will not otherwise be available on the exposed areas of a completed project and to the extent available from the project, the Commission shall require the separate stockpiling and replacement in a sublayer of sufficient quantities of appropriate soil to provide such a nontoxic layer of subsoil as is necessary for the production of each plantlife as is normally considered environmentally, ecologically, esthetically, and economically acceptable to the area. Directs the Commission to establish minimum standards to assure that projects covered by this Act will not cause pollution of existing streams, land slides, flooding or substantially change the volume of water to be carried by natural waterways on land adjoining the immediate construction area except where such change is consistent with an approved State or Federal water resource policy or law. Provides that no dirt shall be moved on any project where the moving or convering of topsoil covers an area in excess of 100,000 square feet until a license or letter of approval to do so has been issued by the Commission or by a commission to whom authority has been delegated under this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of not more than $6,000,000 annually for the administration of this Act. Provides that this Act shall take effect May 1, 1974."
