States that whenever the maximum number of visas or conditional entries have been made under the Act to natives of any single foreign state or dependent area, in the next following fiscal year a number of visas and conditional entries up to 20,000 in the case of a foreign state or 600 in the case of a dependent area shall be made available pursuant to priorities set forth in this Act. States that aliens seeking to enter the United States to perform labor in the teaching profession, sciences, or the arts may enter if they are as qualified as Americans holding such jobs or if they have exceptional ability in the sciences or the arts (present law requires that such persons be better qualified for such jobs than those United States citizens seeking such jobs). Directs that when the status of a Cuban alien residing in the United States before the enactment of this Act is changed to permanent resident, such change will not be reflected in any immigration quota."
