Allows the owner of rental housing to amortize at an accelerated rate (over a 60-month period) the cost of rehabilitating or restoring such housing. Authorizes the taxpayer to switch from such accelerated amortization to the regular depreciation deduction allowable under the Internal Revenue Code for property used in a trade or business or held for the production of income."
