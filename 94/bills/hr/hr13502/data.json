    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Ways and Means with amendment, H. Rept. 94-1179) Changes the existing formulas, under the Social Security Act, for payments to the States under title IV (Grants to States for Aid and Services to Needy Families with Children and for Child-Welfare Services) of such Act to be an amount equal to the Federal percentage, specified in such Act, of the total amount expended during the quarter involved as aid to families with dependent children under the State plan. Changes the formulas similarly under titles I, X, XIV, and XVI of such Act as regards aid to the aged, blind and disabled. Defines such Federal percentage to be 100 percent less the State percentage, and the State percentage as that percentage which bears the same ratio to 45 percent as the square of per capita income of the State bears to the square of such income of the continental United States and Hawaii. Restricts the reduction in per recipient expenditure under title IV where the former formula is used in the quarter ending September 30, 1976. Provides for a transition period of five years during which the new formula would take effect. Provides that Federal financial participation in the title IV program under a State plan approved under such title, through March 1976, shall not be denied by reason of the failure of the State to meet specified requirements of such title or to carry out specified functions under such title, if the amount of such aid was correct and the payment of aid in such form did not result in assistance, or in amounts, not authorized under such title. Authorizes jointly drawn checks to a recipient and to the provider of a service under title IV of the Social Security Act."
