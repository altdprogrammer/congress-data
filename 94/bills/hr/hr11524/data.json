Amends the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 to limit the contribution of the United States to the United Nations to one-sixth of the total assessment of the United Nations for that year. Excludes the International Atomic Energy Agency and the joint financing program from limitation under this Act. Declares it the sense of Congress that the President direct the Ambassador of the United States to the United Nations to assure that, in apportioning its assessment to member states, the United Nations will consider the financial resources of the oil-producing nations."
