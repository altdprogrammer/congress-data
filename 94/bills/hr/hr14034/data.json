    "text": "Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments - Extends through Fiscal year 1978 the authorization of appropriations for: (1) water treatment works pilot training programs; (2) the development of a system of forecasting the supply of and demand for water pollution control specialists; (3) grants for State pollution control programs; (4) scholarships, training grants and contracts in the field of water pollution control; (5) grants to designated agencies to assist in the development and operation of continuing areawide waste treatment management planning processes; (6) grants to the States for lake water improvement programs; and (7) the purposes of this Act other than those specified in (1) through (6) above. Authorizes the use of Federal grants for construction of treatment works as grants for the Federal share of construction costs of sewage collection systems which are part of the same total waste treatment system. Stipulates that the total amount of all such grants shall exceed $2,800,000. Authorizes the use of a single grant for the combined Federal share of planning and design along with building and construction costs in the case of treatment works with an estimated total cost of $1,000,000 or less. Authorizes the use of ad valorem taxes to satisfy the user charge system requirement for applicants for treatment works grants under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Establishes procedures for allotment of construction grant funds to States in accordance with criteria established by the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation. Stipulates that allotments made subject to a limitation on obligation shall remain available until expended. Extends the provisions for Federal reimbursement of construction costs of publicly owned water treatment works to include reimbursement for works on which construction was started not later than July 1, 1973. Increases the amount of the appropriation authorized to cover such reimbursement to $2,950,000,000. Authorizes additional appropriations for waste treatment construction grants of $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1977 and $6,000,000 per fiscal year for fiscal years 1978 and 1979. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to accept certification of by State water pollution control agencies responsibility for treatment projects within such State. Requires a finding by the Administrator that such projects will be carried out in accordance with State laws and standards at least equivalent to those established by Federal law. Stipulates that the determination of priorities with respect to categories of projects for treatment works within each State shall be made solely by the State. Authorizes the Administrator to guarantee loans to assist in financing the non-Federal share of projects for the construction of publicly owned treatment works. Authorizes waiver of requirements that applicants pay the non-Federal share of construction costs if such applicant can demonstrate an inability to obtain private financing. Authorizes the Administrator to extend from July 1, 1977, until July 1, 1982, the deadline for the achievement of effluent limitations for public treatment works. Authorizes additional extensions of deadlines until July 1, 1983, in the case of treatment works based on innovative technology. Requires submission of enforceable compliance schedules by applicants for such extension. Extends until April 1, 1975, the deadline for submission of State water quality inventory reports. Requires that such reports be revised by April 1, 1976, and kept current biennially. Directs the Administrator to submit such reports to Congress on or before October 1, 1976, and biennially thereafter. Deletes the 30-day time requirement for public hearings as required by the Act for proposed toxic and pretreatment effluent standards. Authorizes the Administrator to defer the effective date of proposed effluent standards for up to three years following promulgation of such standards if he determines that compliance within one year is technologically unfeasible for a particular category of sources. Establishes a civil penalty of not in excess of $50,000 for the owner or operator of any vessel, or onshore or offshore facility from which any hazardous substance is discharged. Revises procedures for assessment of civil penalties for spills of hazardous substances. Requires that the following factors be considered in determining the amount of such penalty: (1) characteristics of the substance discharged; (2) extent of damage to public health or welfare, including damage to fish, wildlife, shorelines, and beaches; (3) whether such owner or operator has been found liable for a previous discharge within the last three years; (4) whether the discharge resulted from wilfull misconduct of the owner or operator; and (5) whether the owner or operator took steps to prevent such discharge and to remove the substance once discharged. Redefines the term \"navigable waters\" as it applies to permits for dredged or fill material as required by the Act. Allows the discharge of dredged or fill materials without a permit in waters other than navigable waters. Establishes an emergency contingency fund to provide assistance in cases of imminent and substantial threats to the public health and welfare. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to maintain such fund with a balance of $5,000,000. Authorizes judicial review of adminstrative acts connected with effluent guidelines or approval of State certification."
