Redefines the \"prime rate charged by banks,\" by which the Secretary adjusts rate of interest, to be the average predominant prime rate quoted by commercial banks to large business, as determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Requires the Secretary to establish such adjusted rate by the 15th day of the calendar month following enactment. Provides that the applicable rates shall become effective on the first day of the second month following enactment on all money then due."
