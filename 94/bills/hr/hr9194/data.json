Requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the results of such audit. Prohibits any increase in the rate charged for electric power unless appropriate public hearings have been held on such increase. Requires that local material men be used whenever possible to supply all articles, materials, supplies and services required by the Authority for any purpose not directly related to the production of electric power."
