    "text": "Victims of Crime Act - Establishes the Crime Victims Compensation Commission to make annual and supplemental grants to each qualifying State program covering 50 percent or 100 percent of the costs of paying compensation to the victims of specified qualifying crimes. Grants the Commission specified powers, including: (1) the establishment of general policies, guidelines, rules, and regulations which must be followed by State programs; and (2) denial, revision, or agreement to any request for an annual or supplemental grant under this Act. Stipulates that a State program qualifies for grants under this Act if it meets specified criteria, including: (1) compensation for personal injury to individuals who suffer such injuries as the result of qualifying crimes; (2) compensation to the surviving dependents of individuals whose death resulted from qualifying crimes; and (3) the right to a hearing with administrative or judicial review for any aggrieved claimant. Excludes from Federal grants the costs of administrative expenses and the costs of State compensation awards: (1) for pain and suffering; (2) for property loss; (3) to the extent to which the amount of any reward to a victim or a victim's dependents exceeds $50,000; (4) to any claimant who is entitled to receive compensation from any other source up to the amount of such compensation; (5) for lost earnings of more than $200 per week; (6) to a claimant who failed to file a claim within one year of the occurrence of the qualifying crimes; and (7) to any claimant failing to report such crime to law enforcement authorities within 72 hours of its occurrence. Requires the Commission to publish and submit to the House and Senate Judiciary committees an annual report containing specified information on the operation of State victims of crime compensation programs and on the Commission's activities. Authorizes the appropriation of specified sums in fiscal years 1977 through 1979 to carry out the purposes of this Act."
