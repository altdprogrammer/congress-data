    "text": "Lifeline Rate Act - Makes it the purpose of this Act to reform electric utility rate charges to residential customers by providing for a more equitable distribution of electric utility rate charges among classes of electric energy users. Stipulates that no rate schedule of an electric utility shall provide for a rate under which the charge per kilowatt-hour to a residential electric consumer for a subsistence quantity of electric energy in any month for such consumer's principal place of residence exceeds the lowest charge per kilowatt-hour to any other electric consumer to whom electric energy is sold by such utility. Stipulates that such rates shall not exceed the average residential rates in effect as of December 31, 1975. Stipulates that no electric utility may sell electric energy except in accordance with a rate schedule which has been fixed, approved, or allowed to go into effect by a regulatory authority. States that no regulatory authority may fix, approve, or allow to go into effect any rate schedule which violates provisions of this Act. Provides for civil suits to redress alleged violations of this Act."
