Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, within 18 months after enactment of this Act, to develop and promulgate proposed performance standards for new commercial buildings, and to promulgate standards within six months of the publication of the proposed standards. Requires the Secretary to promulgate such proposed standards for new residential buildings within three years of the enactment of this Act. Requires standards to be published within six months of the publication of the proposed standards. Directs the Secretary, assisted by the National Institute of Building Sciences: (1) to monitor the progress of the States in adopting and enforcing such standards; (2) to identify obstacles inhibiting implementation of such standards; (3) to evaluate the effectiveness of existing standards; and (4) to report to Congress on the progress of the States and to recommend additional measures to encourage the application of such standards. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to the States to assist them in implementing the standards approved by the Secretary. Authorizes the appropriation of $10,000,000 to make such grants. Directs the Secretary to consult with builders, public officials, and representatives of consumer groups in developing and promulgating performance standards under this Act. Directs the Secretary to conduct such research and demonstration activities as are necessary to assist in the development of performance standards under this Act."
