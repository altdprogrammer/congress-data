    "text": "Small Business Growth and Job Creation Act - Title I: Small Business Independence and Continuation - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish graduated corporate income tax rates. Changes the holding period for capital assets from six months to one year. Establishes a new alternative tax on capital gains. Increases the estate tax exemption from $60,000 to $180,000. Establishes a new rate schedule for the estate tax. Increases the gift tax exclusion from $3,000 to $9,000, and the gift tax exemption from $30,000 to $90,000. Replaces the present gift tax schedule with a flat rate of 75 percent of whatever the estate tax on such a sum would be. Provides that a distribution of property by a corporation in redemption of stock to pay death taxes shall be treated as a distribution in full payment in exchange for the stock if all of the stock of such corporation which is included in determining the value of the decedent's gross estate is either, (1) more than 20 percent (generally, 35 percent), of the value of the gross estate of such decedent, or (2) more than 40 percent (generally, 50 percent) of the taxable estate of such decedent. Provides that if stock in a corporation is sold by a shareholder owning stock representing more than 30 percent of the fair market value of all outstanding stock of the corporation whose stock is being sold, the gain from such sale shall be recognized only to the extent that the taxpayer's sale price exceeds the cost of replacement property purchased by the taxpayer within two years. Defines \"replacement property\" as property which is held for the production of income or which is held for investment. Allows the executor of an estate involving an interest in a closely held business to elect to include in the value of the gross estate the decedent's basis in such business rather than the fair market value of such interest. States that the basis of property acquired from a decedent as to which such an election was made shall be the decedent's basis in such property rather than the fair market value of such interest. Allows the marital deduction of the estate tax to exceed 50 percent of the value of the adjusted gross estate when an interest in a specially defined small business is included in the estate. Title II: Small Business Growth Incentives - Allows a taxpayer to choose the cash method of accounting in any case where inventory is an income determining factor and the ending inventory for the taxable year does not exceed $200,000. Provides a deferred tax credit against taxable income for unincorporated businesses. Establishes a graduated investment tax credit. Amends the definition of a small business corporation to allow domestic corporations with up to 20 shareholders (presently, ten) to qualify for subchapter S treatment. Allows a small business to make a subchapter S election at any time during the taxable year. Allows to a business a credit equal to 50 percent of the wages paid during the taxable year to new employees, up to two employees and $20,000 for the taxable year. Allows a similar credit for new disadvantaged employees up to a maximum of $60,000 per taxable year. Allows the practical cost recovery method to be used in computing depreciation. Title III: Small Business Tax Simplification - Allows a corporation to file an application for refund of overpayment of estimated income tax at any time during the taxable year. Provides a special rule for treatment of net operating loss adjustments in the case of new corporations. Increases the minimum credit on accumulated earnings from $150,000 to $500,000. Redefines \"section 1244 stock\" to mean common stock in a corporation if: (1) such corporation during its preceding taxable year derived more than 50 percent of its aggregate gross receipts from sources other than royalties, rents, dividends, interest, annuities, and sales or exchanges of stock or securities; and (2) the equity capital of such corporation does not exceed $1,000,000. Increases the losses on section 1244 stock which may be treated as ordinary losses (rather than capital losses) from $25,000 to $50,000."
