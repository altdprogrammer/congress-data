Authorizes the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration to exempt any issuer engaged in the energy industry from the prohibition of this Act if the Administrator finds that the granting of such exemption would not adversely affect the production or supply of energy within the United States. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to exempt any issuer engaged in the defense industry from the prohibition of this Act if the Secretary finds that the granting of such exemption would not adversely affect the national defense. States that any person who is in violation of the provisions of this Act on the date of enactment shall have two years from such date to bring himself into compliance."
