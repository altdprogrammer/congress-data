Authorizes to be appropriated to carry out the provisions of this title up to $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1976. Title II: Consideration Of Consumer Interests By The Federal Agencies - Establishes an Office of Consumer Representation within each executive department and independent regulatory commission and agency. States that such Office shall generally represent consumer interests to its agency, especially during administrative or judicial proceedings. Provides for consideration of the benefit to consumers relative to the cost of agency proceedings or of enforcement actions taken by agencies. States that the Administrator shall promptly notify producers, distributors, retailers, lenders, or suppliers of goods and services of all complaints of any significance concerning them received or developed under this Act unless the Administrator determines that to do so is likely to prejudice or impede an action, investigation, or prosecution concerning an alleged violation of law.
