    "date": "1976-05-17", 
    "text": "National Forest Management Act - Amends the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 to state congressional findings relating to management of renewable resources. Requires the Renewable Resource Assessment to include program recommendations which reflect specified policy objectives. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to provide for public participation in the development and revision of land management plans. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations that set forth the process for the development and revision of such plans and specify guidelines and standards designed to achieve enumerated goals. Instructs the Secretary to appoint a committee of scientists to provide scientific and technical advice and counsel on proposed guidelines and procedures so as to assure that an effective interdisciplinary approach is proposed and adopted. Revises provisions relating to the authorization of funds for National Forest Service activities. Requires the Secretary to report within five years after the removal of vegetative cover from any forest or rangeland in the National Forest System either the cost of revegetating such land or that such lands are not in need of revegetation. Stipulates that, unless the necessity for permanent roads is set forth in the forest development road system plan, roads constructed on land of the National Forest System in connection with a timber contract or other permit or lease shall be designed with the goal of reestablishing vegetative cover on the roadway and areas where the vegetative cover has been disturbed by the construction of the road. Prohibits the return to the public domain of land now or hereafter reserved or withdrawn from the public domain as national forests, other than by Act of Congress. Directs the Secretary to limit the sale of timber from each national forest to a quantity equal to or less than that amount of timber which can be removed from such forest annually on a sustained yield basis. Requires the Secretary to establish procedures to give the Federal, State, and local governments and the public an opportunity to comment upon the formulation of standards, criteria, and guidelines applicable to Forest Service programs. Directs the Secretary to establish and consult with such advisory boards as may be deemed necessary in providing for public participation in the planning for, and management of, the National Forest System. Instructs the Secretary to take affirmative action to perpetuate habitats and populations of the native species of plants and animals found in the national forests. Directs the Secretary to sell trees and forest products found upon National Forest System lands in accordance with the policies set forth in the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act and the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act. Limits, in lieu of specified findings, timber sales contracts to ten years. Increases to $10,000 in appraised value the maximum value of timber and cordwood which the Secretary may sell without advertisement. Requires that utilization standards and methods of measurement be established for the removal of trees and forest products in order to provide for the optimum practical use of wood material. Abolishes the National Forest Reservation Commission. Authorizes the Secretary to require any purchaser of national forest timber to make, in addition to timber payments, deposits of money for the protection and improvement of the future productivity of the renewable resources of the sale area involved. Eliminates the provision that where forest roads of a higher standard than that needed in the harvesting and removal of timber are to be constructed in a given area, a purchaser of the national forest timber shall not be required to bear that part of the costs necessary to meet such higher standard."
