    "text": "Establishes, under the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Metric Conversion Coordinating Commission consisting of 11 members representing business, labor, education, consumer protection, science, and technology. Charges the Commission with the responsibility of implementing, with the voluntary participation of every interested sector in the United States the recommendations issued by the United States metric study, including: (1) that the United States change to the metric system; (2) that such change be done through a coordinated program; (3) that detailed plans and timetables be worked out; (4) that priority be given to educational programs in elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher learning designed to enable Americans to think in metric terms; (5) that appropriate representatives of American enterprise participate in international standards activities; (6) that changeover costs shall lie where they fall; and (7) that the ultimate time for full conversion shall be January 1, 1986. Directs each agency of the Federal Government to convert to the international metric system and provides that such system shall be the sole and official system of weights in the United States by January 1, 1986. Authorizes the Commission to appoint an Executive Director and to employ experts and consultants. Authorizes the Commission to accept, hold, administer, and utilize gifts, donations, and bequests of property, both real and personal, and personal services, for the purpose of aiding or facilitating the work of the Commission. Directs the Commission to transmit to the President and to each House of Congress an interim report not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act and each year thereafter until January 1, 1986. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
