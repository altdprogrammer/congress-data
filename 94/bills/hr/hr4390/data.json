Authorizes the National Bureau of Standards of the Department of Commerce to make regulations for this Act, and to determine the performance life of products and components of products covered by this Act. Directs the Federal Trade Commission to prevent any person from violating the provisions of this Act in the same manner and with the same jurisdiction as though all applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act were incorporated into and made a part of this Act."
