Rept. 94-1135) Requires charitable organizations which solicit by any means the remittance of charitable contributions by mail to include with such solicitation the following information: (1) the name and principal business address of the organization; (2) the purpose of the solicitation and intended use of contributions; and (3) the portion of contributions which were directly applied to the charitable purpose during the 12-month period preceding the date of solicitation. Directs that all of the above information be transmitted, whether in writing or by radio or television, conspicuously in a non-technical, readily unstandable manner. States that such organization shall furnish, upon request, such audit reports, accounts, or other information as the Postal Service may require to establish or verify the information included in the solicitations. Requires such organizations to furnish within 30 days to anyone who has been solicited and so requests, pertinent financial information reasonably sufficient to verify any information included in the solicitation. Sets forth the method by which such organizations with outside income may distribute administrate costs. Exempts from this Act any bona fide membership organization's solicitation by mail or its own members. Defines \"charitable organization\" for purposes of this Act."
