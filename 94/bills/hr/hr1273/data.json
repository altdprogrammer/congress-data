States that if, in the opinion of the President, the immediate disclosure of such an agreement would be prejudicial to the security of the United States, the agreement shall be transmitted to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House under an appropriate written injunction of secrecy to be removed only upon due notice from the President. Provides that any such agreement shall come into force with respect to the United States at the end of the first period of 60 calendar days after the date on which the executive agreement is transmitted to the Congress of such committees, as the case may be, unless both Houses pass a concurrent resolution stating in substance that both Houses do not approve the executive agreement."
