Requires the Consolidated Rail Corporation to provide rail service over light density lines which are not designated for conveyance to the Corporation and have operated profitably in calendar years 1973 and 1974. Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct an audit and examination of the accounting procedures used whereby costs incurred beyond a particular light density line are assigned to such line in calculation of net operating gain and net operating loss of such line. Authorizes to be appropriated to carry out this Act up to $38,000,000."
