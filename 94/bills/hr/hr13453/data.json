    "text": "Earthquake Disaster Mitigation Act - Directs the Director of the Geological Survey to develop and carry out a program of research and implementation in the areas of tectonics, seismology, and geology, to include (1) development of a system for predicting earthquakes in the seismically active regions of the United States; (2) development and placement of instruments necessary to collect appropriate data; (3) seismicity studies throughout the United States; (4) evaluation of earthquake control methods; (5) zonation and microzonation for seismic risks of the entire United States; and (6) preparation of seismic risk analyses useful for emergency planning and community preparedness. Directs the Director of the National Science Foundation to develop and carry out a program of research and implementation in the areas of engineering, planning, and social sciences, to include (1) advancing basic earthquake engineering and earthquake mitigation research; (2) developing more accurate and reliable methods of earthquake engineering analysis for all types of structures and for a variety of ground conditions; (3) developing more reliable and economic methods of earthquake-resistant design and improved criteria for earthquake-resistant construction; (4) developing methods that enhance community preparedness for earthquakes; and (5) developing procedures for the rehabilitation of earthquake damaged areas. Requires the Director of the Geological Survey and the Director of the National Science Foundation to, jointly, (1) establish an advisory committee to review periodically the progress, implementation, and coordination of the earthquake mitigation program; (2) establish an information dissemination mechanism to make available information developed pursuant to this Act; (3) prepare an annual report to Congress describing the progress of the program; and (4) assist the States in carrying out their responsibilities under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 by making readily available the results of research conducted pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1976-1985 to the Geological Survey to carry out its duties under this Act. Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to authorize the appropriation to the National Science Foundation of $15,000,000 for Fiscal Year 1976 and $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1977-1985 to carry out its duties under this Act."
