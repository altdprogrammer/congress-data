Directs the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to initiate and provide for the conduct of research and development in areas related to electric vehicles. Directs the Administrator to enter into such contracts as may be necessary and appropriate for: (1) the production, within one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, of significant numbers of urban passenger and commercial vehicles which have electric propulsion systems on conventional chassis; and (2) for the production, within three years after such date, of significant numbers of urban passenger and commercial vehicles which are specifically designed for electric propulsion as the primary power source. Directs the United States Postal Service, the General Services Administration, the Secretary of Defense, and the heads of other Federal agencies to arrange for the introduction of electric vehicles into their fleets as soon as possible. Authorizes $40,000,000 to be appropriated to the Administrator for each of the fiscal years 1976, 1977, and 1978."
