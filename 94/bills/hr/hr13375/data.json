    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1976-04-28", 
    "text": "National Food Stamp Reform Act - Redefines the meaning of the term \"food\" as used in the Food Stamp Act of 1964 to include seeds and plants for garden use. Redefines the term \"household\" to delete the requirement that individuals sharing common living quarters be related in order to qualify as a household. Defines the term \"nutritionally adequate diet\" for purposes of this Act. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish uniform national standards of eligibility for participation by households in the food stamp program. States that no household shall be eligible if its income exceeds the income poverty guidelines for a household of its size as prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget. Sets forth standards by which the income of a household shall be determined. Excludes from gross income Federal, State, and local taxes, and necessary expenses incurred in self-employment. Establishes limits on the value of liquid and nonliquid assets owned or being purchased by a household for purposes of determining eligibility. Specifies types of holdings which are to be included in determining the value of the household's assets. Authorizes the Secretary to establish temporary emergency eligibility standards for households which are victims of a disaster. States that no household shall be eligible for participation in the food stamp program which includes an able-bodied adult between the ages of 18 and 65 who: (1) incurs a reduction of income as a result of voluntarily reducing his or her number of hours of employment without good cause; (2) fails to register for employment at a State or Federal employment office; (3) has refused to accept employment or public work within 30 miles of the person's principal residence; or (4) fails to actively seek employment. Excludes from this class of ineligible individuals mothers with dependent children, primary or secondary school students, postsecondary level students or trainees employed part-time, enrollees in a drug addiction or alcoholic treatment program, and persons working at least 30 hours per week. States that refusal to work at a plant site because of a strike or other labor dispute shall be deemed to be a refusal to accept employment. Declares that no person shall be eligible who is not a citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. States that no individual shall be considered a household member for food stamp program purposes who: (1) has reached his 18th birthday; (2) is enrolled in an institution of higher education; and (3) is properly claimed or could be claimed as a dependent by a taxpayer who is not a member of a dependent household. Declares that no household that knowingly transfers liquid or nonliquid assets for the purpose of qualifying or attempting to qualify for the food stamp program shall be eligible to participate in the program for a minimum of 90 days. States that no individual shall be eligible for participation in the food stamp Program who resides in a State in which the Supplemental Security Income benefits has been increased specifically to include the bonus value of food coupon allotments. Requires food coupons to be designed with spaces for the user to sign upon receipt and redemption. Requires coupon users to present suitable identification, including signature and photograph, when redeeming coupons at approved food stores. States that the value of the food coupon allotment to which eligible households will be entitled shall be an amount sufficient to allow a household to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet. Requires the semi-annual adjustment of the value of an allotment based on changes in the cost of living. Sets the charge for a household coupon allotment at 30 percent of the household's monthly income. Establishes procedures by which manufacturers or processors may have their products approved for purchase with food coupons by the Secretary. Provides for the placement of notice of such approval on food containers. Requires State agencies administering the food stamp program to conduct nutrition education programs for food coupon recipients. Establishes a plan whereby the States will pay two and one-half percent of the bonus value of the food coupon allotments made to State residents each month of fiscal year 1977, with an additional two and one-half percent added annually until the States pay ten percent of such bonus value each year."
