    "text": "Drug Pushers Punishment Act - Title I: Increased Penalties - Requires, in the case of any person convicted of specified violations of Federal narcotics laws, that he be sentenced, under the Controlled Substances Act, to a term of imprisonment of not less than five years and not more than 25 years and fined not more than $50,000. Requires such sentences to include a special parole term of not less than three years. Provides that a person who commits such a violation after one or more prior felony convictions relating to narcotics or while released pending trial on, or final disposition of, such charges be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years or for life and fined not more than $100,000. Excludes from such minimum imprisonment terms the cases of those whose primary purpose is to obtain narcotics for personal use because of addiction. Forbids the suspension of sentences provided for by this Act. Prohibits probation for individuals receiving such sentences. Declares that any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined by the Controlled Substances Act shall be punished as prescribed for the commission of the offense which was the object of such attempt or conspiracy. Title II: Conditions of Release - Requires that those convicted of violations of the Controlled Substances Act be detained while awaiting sentence or after filing an appeal or petition for writ of certiorari unless a judicial officer finds that: (1) such person, if released, will not flee or pose any danger to himself or society; and (2) if such person filed an appeal or petition for a writ of certiorari, that a substantial question of law or fact is raised which is likely to result in a reversal or an order for a new trial. Title III: Forfeitures - States that all moneys used, or intended for use, in manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, or acquiring any controlled substance in violation of specified Federal drug abuse prevention and control laws are subject to forfeiture."
