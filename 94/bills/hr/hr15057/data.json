    "text": "Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act - Amends the Mineral Lands Leasing Act to remove the 40-acre limitation on tracts of land which may be leased for coal mining by the Secretary of the Interior. Prohibits the lease of Federal lands for coal production where the prospective lessee has not produced coal for 15 or more years from other lands held under such a lease. Stipulates that lands containing coal deposits may only be offered for lease after inclusion in a comprehensive land use plan. Stipulates that each coal lease shall contain provisions requiring compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Clean Air Act. Requires that an exploration license be acquired from the Secretary prior to the conduct of coal exploration for commercial purposes on oil lands subject to the Mineral Lands Leasing Act. Stipulates that licensees may not cause substantial disturbance to the natural land surface. Authorizes the Secretary to consolidate coal leases into logical mining units. Stipulates that development and production of the unit shall be completed within a time period established by the Secretary, which shall not exceed 40 years. Stipulates that coal leases shall be for a period of 20 years and for so long thereafter as coal is produced annually in commercial quantities from that lease. Requires termination of any lease not producing coal in commercial quantities at the end of ten years. Imposes the requirement that mining operations be developed diligently and continuously. Requires that lessees submit for the Secretary's approval an operation and reclamation plan. Requires that the Secretary make annual reports to Congress on coal leasing activities, including recommendations for improved management, efficiency, and environmental safeguards. Authorizes disposition of royalties to the States for additional public purposes. Directs the Director of the Office of Technology Assessment to study all leasing activities pursuant to the Mineral Lands Leasing Act and report his findings and recommendations to Congress. Stipulates that no person or legal entity may control more than 46,080 acres of coal leases in any one State, nor more than 100,000 acres in the entire United States under the Mineral Lands Leasing Act."
