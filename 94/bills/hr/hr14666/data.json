    "text": "Privacy Protection for Rape Victims Act - Amends the Federal Rules of Evidence to prohibit, in cases of alleged rape or assault with intent to commit rape, the introduction of evidence of the victim's prior sexual behavior. Makes such prohibition inapplicable: (1) to evidence of the victim's prior sexual conduct with the alleged assailant; and (2) to evidence of the victim's sexual behavior with others if it is offered by the accused on the issue of whether the accused was the source of the victim's pregnacy, disease, semen, or injury. Requires the accused to make a written motion to offer such evidence accompanied by a written offer of proof. Requires the court to hold a hearing to determine the admissability of such evidence, declaring it admissable only if the court finds that the evidence is relevant and that its probative value outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice. Makes inadmissible reputation or opinion evidence with respect to the victim's past sexual behavior."
