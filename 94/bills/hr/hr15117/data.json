Permits handicapped individuals who believe they have been discriminated against in hiring or placement by Federal agencies to file a complaint with the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission and request a hearing by an Arbitration Panel convened by the Chairman. States that the Panel shall be composed of three individuals: one designated by the accused agency, one designated by the aggrieved handicapped individual, and one jointly designated by the other two members of the Panel. Provides that the decisions of the panel shall be matters of public record. Directs the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission to pay all reasonable costs of arbitration. Requires that before entering into any contract, the head of any Federal department or agency must be satisfied that the contractor has taken affirmative action to employ and promote qualified handicapped individuals. Permits handicapped individuals who believe a contractor has failed to comply with the provisions of his contract relating to handicapped persons to file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor and request a hearing by an Arbitration Panel convened by the Secretary. Authorizes handicapped individuals who believe they have been subjected to discrimination under any program receiving Federal financial assistance to file a complaint with the Secretary and request a hearing by an Arbitration Panel. Establishes within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare an office to assist handicapped individuals to obtain information about employment placement opportunities."
