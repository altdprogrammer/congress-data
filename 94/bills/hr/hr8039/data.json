Directs judges who refuse to dismiss such charges or refuse to accept a refusal to proceed to notify the chief judge of that circuit who will designate another district judge to appoint one or more special prosecutors. States that the appointing judge shall fix compensation within guidelines set forth by this Act. Gives the special prosecutors powers necessary to carry out their duties. Appropriates such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. (Adds 28 U.S.C. 551)"
