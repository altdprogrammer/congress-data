    "text": "Developmental Disabilities Amendments - Authorizes appropriations of $12,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 and $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1976, for the purpose of making grants to assist institutions of higher education to contribute more effectively to the solution of complex health, education and social problems of children and adults suffering from developmental disabilities. Provides that the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare may make grants to public or nonprofit private entities for: (1) demonstration projects for the provision of services to persons with developmental disabilities who are also disadvantaged because of their economic status or the location of their residences, (2) technical assistance relating to services and facilities for persons with developmental disabilities, including assistance in State and local planning or administration, (3) training of specialized personnel needed for the provision of services for persons with developmental disabilities, or for research directly related to such training, (4) developing or demonstrating new or improved techniques for the provision of services to persons with developmental disabilities, or (5) gathering and disseminating information relating to developmental disabilities. Authorizes payments of $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 and $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1976 for the purpose of making payments under these grants. Provides for the allotment of funds to States. States that not less than ten percent of that allotment shall be used by such State for the purpose of assisting it in developing and implementing plans designed to eliminate inappropriate placement in institutions of persons with developmental disabilities, and to improve the quality of care and the state of surroundings of persons for whom institutional care is appropriate; and of the amount allotted to any State for each succeeding fiscal year, not less than 30 percent of that allotment shall be used by such State for such purposes. Stipulates that, in order to be approved by the Secretary, a State plan must provide reasonable assurance that adequate financial support will be available to complete the construction of, and to maintain and operate when such construction is completed, any facility, the construction of which is assisted with sums allotted under the provisions of this Act. Provides that for purposes of any determination by the Secretary as to whether any urban or rural area is a poverty area, the Secretary may not determine that an area is an urban or rural poverty area unless: (1) such area contains one or more subareas which are characterized as subareas of poverty; (2) the population of such subarea or subareas constitutes a substantial portion of the population of such rural or urban area; and (3) the project, facility, or activity, in connection with which such determination is made, does, or (when completed or put into operation) will, serve the needs of the residents of such subarea or subareas."
