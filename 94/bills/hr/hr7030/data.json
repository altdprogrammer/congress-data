Provides that in administering such Act the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare shall not limit the potency, number, combination, amount, or variety of any synthetic or natural vitamin, mineral, or other nutritional substance, or ingredient of any food for special dietary uses, if the amount recommended to be consumed does not ordinarily render it injurious to health. Provides that no regulations issued pursuant to the requirements for branding of foods for special dietary uses shall exempt any food from the provisions of such Act."
