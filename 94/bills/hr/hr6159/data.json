Defines the term \"ground propulsion system\" to mean the engine, transmission, or other drive mechanism, and associated controls, necessary to power automobiles, trucks, trains, buses, and light land and marine recreational vehicles. Makes the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration responsible for providing effective management and coordination in connection with ground propulsion systems research, development, and demonstration, including programs for developing ground propulsion systems which are energy conserving, have clean emmission characteristics, and are capable of being mass produced at a reasonable per unit cost. Directs the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to assist the Administrator in ground propulsion system research and development. Authorizes appropriations for carrying out the provisions of the Act for fiscal years 1976 through 1979."
