Sets forth procedural and jurisdictional requirements for suits brought as result of violation of this Act. Prohibits a person who is a major market shareholder from commencing or expanding the operation of any distributorship or retail establishment whose personnel are under the control of such major market shareholder or entity controlled by such major market shareholder. Provides that any corporation which knowingly violates such prohibition on marketing expansion shall upon conviction be fined in an amount not to exceed $1,000,000."
