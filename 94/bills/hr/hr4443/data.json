    "text": "Armed Forces Drug Dependency Treatment and Rehabilitation Act - Directs the Secretary of Defense to require examination of each member of the armed forces to determine which members are drug dependent. Requires that treatment be provided such members. Provides that members of the armed forces charged with possession of a habit-forming drug shall be accepted for treatment. Provides that prosecution of such offense shall be waived on condition that such member complies with the requirements established for treatment. Requires that information given in seeking treatment shall be held in the strictest confidence. Specifies that neither a condition of drug dependency nor possession for personal use shall warrant disciplinary action. Requires the President to take action to seek agreement with foreign nations whereby members shall not be prosecuted for drug use or possession when such members volunteer for treatment under this Act."
