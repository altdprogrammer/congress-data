Title VI: Government Insured and Guaranteed Mortgage Loans - Provides that interest rates for mortgages and loans insured under the National Housing Act shall be as agreed to by the parties thereto, under the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines the rate to be excessive. Title VII: To Provide For the Uniform Application of the Tax Laws To All Financial Institutions And A Credit For Interest From Qualifying Real Property Loans - Uniform Tax Treatment of Financial Institutions Title - Redefines the term \"bank\" for purposes of the general rules applicable to banking institutions under the Internal Revenue Code. Changes the rules for determination of the reserve for losses for financial institutions for each taxable year. Provides for nonrecognition of gain or loss as a result of foreclosure on any property which was security for the payment of any indebtedness. Provides that the foreclosing party's basis in such property shall be the amount of the indebtedness for which the property was secured, plus costs of acquisition. Provides new rules for the treatment of distributions of stock to shareholders by domestic building and loan associations where such distribution does not qualify as a deduction for dividends paid on deposits. Authorizes a deduction for the repayment of loans made before September 1, 1951, by the United States or any mutual fund established pursuant to the laws of any State to financial institutions as defined in this Act. Provides for separate taxation under Subchapter L (relating to the taxation of insurance companies) of the life insurance business of a mutual savings bank where such life insurance business is conducted separately from the other business of a mutual savings bank. Allows a deduction for dividends paid on deposits to banking organizations qualifying as such for purposes of the term \"bank\" as expanded by the provisions of this Act. Redefines the terms \"domestic building and loan association\" and \"cooperative bank\" for the purposes of this Act.

States that in the case of estates and trusts, and in the case of small business corporations electing taxation directly to shareholders under Subchapter S, the interest from qualifying residential mortgage loans shall be allocated among the parties in the same proportion as the income received by such entities is distributable to the benficiaries or shareholders. Makes the necessary conforming and technical amendments to bring the related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code into consonance with the provisions of this Act."
