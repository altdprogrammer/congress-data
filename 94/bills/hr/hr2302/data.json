    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Government Operations with amendment, H. Rept. 94-5) Travel Expenses Amendments - Establishes the maximum per diem allowance rates for Federal employees. Sets a $35 per day maximum rate. Allows the President or his designee to set the rate for foreign travel. Provides for actual and necessary expenses up to $50 per day for travel inside the continental United States under unusual circumstances or for travel to high-cost areas where the basic per diem allowance would be inadequate. Increases the allowance in addition to the regular per diem rate for travel under unusual circumstances outside the continental United States from the present $18 to $21 per day. Establishes the mileage allowance for automobiles at 15 cents per mile and for airplanes at 18 cents per mile. Provides for separate reimbursement of parking and road fees. Requires that the General Services Administration make periodic studies of the costs of travel and of the operation of privately owned vehicles and requires that a report of the results of such studies be made to Congress at least once a year, and that within 30 days of such report, the Administrator shall adjust in mileage rates in accordance with the results of the study. Allows Senate personal staff to receive per diem expenses for official travel to the home State of the Senator, except that no reimbursement is to be made within 120 days of any primary or general election in which the Senator is a candidate."
