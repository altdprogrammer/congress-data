    "text": "Occupational Safety and Health Amendments - Defines \"employer,\" under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, to mean a person engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees, but does not include the United States, any States or political subdivision of a State, any nonagricultural employer who employed no more than 25 employees at any time during the preceding calendar year, or a small farmer. Requires the evaluation of specified existing standards in order to determine the applicability of each such standard to each class of business concern with each industry. Provides, in specified cases, that the Secretary of Labor give an employer reasonable advance notice that an inspection will be made. Requires that notices of alleged violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act be in writing and state allegations with particularity. Sets forth specified circumstances in which employers in violation of the provisions of such Act shall not receive notices, including: (1) if the employer can show that implementing a specified rule or standard would not materially affect the safety or health of his employees in the facility inspected; and (2) if he can show that he has employed alternative procedures to protect his employees from contemplated hazards. Sets forth procedures for enforcement of the provisions of such Act. Provides that no person shall discharge or discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint under such Act. Enumerates affirmative defenses to any proceedings brought under such Act. Allows the Secretary of Labor to enter into compliance agreements with employers believed to be in violation of standards. Directs the Secretary, upon request from an employer, to visit the workplaces of employers for the purpose of affording consultation and advice to such employer. Requires the Secretary to provide technical advice, assistance, and consultation to employers with less than 100 employees when it appears to the Secretary that such assistance is necessary."
