Provdies that each State shall mail the following by airmail to such citizen: (1) an absentee ballot, (2) instructions governing voting procedures, and (3) an airmail envelope for the mailing of such ballot. States that whoever deprives any person of any right secured by this Act shall be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. Sets forth additional penalties for falsifying registration materials.
