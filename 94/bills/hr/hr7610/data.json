    "text": "Jobs Creation Act - Title I: Individual Income Taxes - Allows a tax credit in the amount of 10 percent (up to $1,000) of the amount of qualified savings deposits and investments made by an individual during the taxable year. Defines qualified investments as amounts used to purchase stock in or debt instruments of a domestic corporation. Provides that the first $1,000 of capital gain shall be excluded from gross income during the taxable year. Provides, for purposes of the estate tax, that the lesser of: (1) $200,000; and (2) the value of the decedent's interest in a family farming operation continually owned by him for five years prior to his death and which passes to a related individual shall be excluded from the value of the taxable estate. Title II: Corporation Taxes - Reduces the normal tax rates imposed on corporations. Increases the investment credit to 15 percent (12 percent in the case of property constructed or acquired before an unspecified date in March, 1975). Increases the corporate surtax exemption from $25,000 to $100,000. Increases the class life variance for purposes of the depreciation deduction allowed for property used in a trade or business or held for the production of income."
