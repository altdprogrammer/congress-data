    "text": "Revises the provisions of Federal law providing for the continuance of civil government for the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands by authorizing to be appropriated $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1975; $80,000,000 for fiscal year 1976; $15,100,000 for fiscal year 1976; $80,000,000 for fiscal year 1977. Requires such amounts to be adjusted to offset changes in the purchasing power of the United States dollar. Provides an amount, not to exceed $10,000,000, for each such fiscal year to offset reductions in Federal grant-in-aid programs or other funds made available to the Trust Territory by other Federal agencies. Authorizes to be appropriated $1,500,000 to aid in the transition of the Mariana Islands District to commonwealth status."
