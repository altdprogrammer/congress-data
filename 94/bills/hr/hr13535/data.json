    "text": "Senior Citizens' Transportation Act - Prohibits common carriers in interstate commerce from charging elderly people more than half fare for their transportation during nonpeak periods of travel. Permits common carriers which can show an economic loss as a result of such prohibition to apply for financial assistance to the head of the Federal agency having jurisdiction over the filing and publishing of the tariffs of such carriers. Amends the Urban Mass Transportation Act to direct the Secretary of Transportation, when providing financial assistance under such Act, to give preference to States and local public bodies which will adopt specially reduced rates during nonrush hours for elderly persons."
