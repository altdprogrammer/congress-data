Requires the Director to destroy such file promptly, without divulging the contents of such file, whether or not such examination takes place or is requested.

Provides that the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall, in the case of each file so maintained, give notice not later than six months after the commencement of the maintenance of that file to the Speaker of the House of Representatives or the President pro tempore of the Senate of the fact that such file is being maintained. Provides that no file shall be subject to the examination of a Member of Congress or destruction if such file is maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a part of an investigation into the background of such Member of Congress to assist in the consideration of such Member for any appointive position in the executive or judicial branches of the Federal Government. Requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to, in the case of each file so maintained, give prompt notice to the Speaker of the House of Representatives or the President pro tempore of the Senate of the fact that such file is being maintained and of what appointive office is involved."
