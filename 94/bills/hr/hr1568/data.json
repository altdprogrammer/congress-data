    "text": "Defines, for purposes of Federal compensation for work injuries, the term \"widower\" as meaning the husband living with or dependent for support on the decedent at the time of her death, or living apart for reasonable cause or because of her desertion. Defines, for purposes of such compensation, the term \"dependent\" to include a husband, if (1) he is a member of the same household as the employee; (2) he is receiving regular contributions from the employee for his support; or (3) the employee has been ordered by a court to contribute to his support. Removes the limitation upon compensation for an employee's death which terminates such monthly compensation upon the widower becoming capable of self-support."
