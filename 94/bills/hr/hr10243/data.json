Provides for revocation of such exemption in the event that the successor transfers his interest or stops residing on the farm within five years of the death of his transferor. Provides, under the Internal Revenue Code, that farmland, woodland, or open land which comprises part of an estate may be valued, for estate tax purposes, as such rather than at its fair market value. Provides that real property which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places may be valued, for estate tax purposes, at its value for its existing use. Provides for the revocation of such lower evaluation and recapture of unpaid taxes with interest upon the conversion, rezoning, or removal of such land from the National Register of Historic Places."
