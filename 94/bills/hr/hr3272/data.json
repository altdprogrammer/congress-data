    "text": "Expresses the finding of Congress and makes it the policy of the United States to continue experimentation with satellite systems for the remote sensing of the Earth's resources, through January 1, 1980, unless a permanent operational system is established. Directs the President to: (1) take all practical steps to continue the availability of data on the satellite systems; (2) to foster improvements in them; and (3) to promote their widest possible use and understanding. Requires the President to transmit to Congress not later than April 15, 1975, a report containing recommendations for proposed actions to be taken to carry out the policy set forth in this Act and such revisions in the budget proposed by fiscal 1976 as the President deems necessary to do so. Requires the President to submit each year prior to 1980, as part of the Aeronautics and Space Report, a description of activities and evaluation of progress under this Act, and an evaluation of the desirability of establishing a permanent Earth resources satellite system."
