    "text": "Expresses the findings of Congress that international air transportation agreements are contrary to the public interest when foreign laws or requirements result in discrimination against American citizens on the basis of race, color or religion. Requires that all countries recognize the right of American citizens to travel without encountering such discrimination. Empowers the Civil Aeronautics Board to (1) examine the foreign laws and requirements, (2) receive written complaints, and 3) to hold hearings on such complaints. Provides that if the Board finds discriminatory practices against American citizens, the Board shall, absent overriding considerations, suspend the certificates issued to air carriers to serve the country and suspend the permit issued to the foreign air carrier until such discrimination is eliminated."
