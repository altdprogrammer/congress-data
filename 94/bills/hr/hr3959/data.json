    "text": "Eliminates the five month waiting period required pursuant to title II of the Social Security Act before an eligible individual may receive Social Security disability insurance benefits. Redefines the term \"period of disability\" by eliminating the requirement that such disability be of five months duration. Repeals the authority of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to deduct Federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits payable to beneficiaries under the Social Security Act on account of wages or other compensation received by such beneficiaries. Entitles otherwise eligible widowers, widows, and surviving divorced wives to Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits at age 50 without regard to disability, such benefits to be payable until such person remarries, dies, or becomes entitled to an old-age insurance benefit equal to or exceeding the primary insurance amount of such person's deceased spouse. Entitles the otherwise eligible adopted child of a deceased old-age or disability beneficiary to a child's insurance benefit without regard to whether such child was living with, and receiving at least one-half of his support from, such deceased beneficiary. Directs the Secretary to issue a duplicate benefit check to an individual entitled to Old-Age, Survivors, or Disability Insurance benefits within five days after receiving a certification from such individual that such individual's benefit check has been lost or stolen, and that such individual is faced with a financial emergency as a result thereof. Repeals the authority of the Secretary to reduce disability benefits to individuals receiving workmen's compensation. Repeals the requirement that disability beneficiaries under the age of 65 must have been entitled to disability insurance benefits for a least twenty-four consecutive months in order to qualify for hospital insurance benefits under the medicare program of the Social Security Act."
