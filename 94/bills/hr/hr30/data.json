Designates specified lands depicted as the Hells Canyon Wilderness as wilderness. Designates specified portions of the Rapid River in Idaho and the Snake River in Idaho and Oregon as wild or scenic river areas. Prohibits the licensing of construction by the Federal Power Commission of any dam within such recreation area. Prohibits any limiting, restricting, or conflicting of the present and future use of the waters of the Snake River and its tributaries upstream. Prohibits imposition of any flow requirements on such river below the Hells Canyon Dam. Sets forth standards for the administration of such recreation area by the Secretary of Agriculture, and requires him to submit a comprehensive management plan for such area to the Congress within five years. Lists areas on the Hells Canyon Recreation Areas map which shall be studied for suitability for designation as wilderness. Gives the views of the Nez Perce Tribe of Indians a hearing in such possible designation. Allows the continuation of timber harvesting by selective cutting, mining, and grazing during development of the comprehensive management plan. Provides that lands acquired, under this Act, owned by the State of Oregon may be acquired only by donation, and lands owned by the State of Idaho may be acquired only by donation or exchange. Permits the Secretary to acquire the mineral interests in lands within the recreation area, with or without the consent of the owner. Permits hunting and fishing within the recreation area. States that ranching, grazing, farming, timber harvesting, and the occupation of homes and lands associated with homes, as they exist on the date of enactment of this Act, are recognized as traditional and valid uses of the recreation area. Authorizes appropriations for the acquisition of lands, the development of recreation facilities, and the protection and development of historic and archeological sites within such recreation area."
