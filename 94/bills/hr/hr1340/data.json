States that if a miner was employed for 15 years or more in one or more underground coal mines, there shall be an irrebuttable presumption that he is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis or that at the time of his dealth he was totally disabled by pneumoconiosis. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to pay benefits to all previous claimants who have become eligible for benefits as a result of the enactment of this Act. Requires that at least 5 members of the Advisory Committee on Coal Mine Health Research be miners or retired miners."
