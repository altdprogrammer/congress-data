Stipulates that no loan or grant shall be made unless the Federal Prison Industries first determines that: (1) offenders shall receive wages at a rate not less than similar workers in the locality; (2) any products or services may be sold just as if non-offenders provided them; and (3) the offenders are likely by reason of their involvement in such projects to find employment following their release. Authorizes annual appropriations to the fund to make its income not less than $10,000,000 in any fiscal year. Title II: States Penal or Correctional Institution - Provides that the Attorney General may enter into agreements to financially assist any State in establishing training or employment programs for offenders in State penal or correctional institutions. Authorizes appropriations of $10,000,000 for each of the fiscal years (1974-1978) to carry out the provisions of this title."
