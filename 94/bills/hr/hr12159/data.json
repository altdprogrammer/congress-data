    "text": "Energy Research and Development Free Enterprise Act - Title I: Findings, Definitions, and General Provisions - Declares that it is the policy of the Congress that small business concerns and individual inventors should be provided greater opportunities by the Federal Government in the development of energy resources and technology, with special emphasis on solar energy technology and to expand competition and reduce concentration in the energy industries of the Nation. Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 and the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 to offer increased opportunities in Federal energy development programs to small business concerns and individual inventors. Title II: Energy Program Reorganization - Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to establish within the Energy Research and Development Administration five additional Assistant Administrators for: (1) small business concerns and individual inventors; (2) planning and analysis; (3) laboratory and field coordination; (4) administration; and (5) international affairs. Requires that no less than 50 percent of the total amount of funds for solar energy technology programs and no less than 20 percent of the total amount of funds for all areas of energy technology be made available to small business concerns and individual inventors. Limits the awarding of energy program contracts to situations where the financial capabilities of non-Federal entities are inadequate to develop such technology without Federal assistance. Authorizes appropriations of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1976 and each fiscal year thereafter to the Administrator of the Small Business Administration in order to provide consultation services for the preparation of contract proposals by small businesses and individual inventors. Title III: Encouragement of Competition in Energy Programs - Directs the Administrators of the Energy Research and Development and the Small Business Administrations to provide detailed information to potential participants in energy programs. Directs the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to refrain from awarding contracts which will have an adverse impact on industry or market competition. Directs the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to recommend criteria to the Administration upon which to make such a determination. Prohibits the entering into of any energy contract to any person who has an interest in delaying completion of the contract or altering any research findings in the performance of such contract. Requires the Administrator to transmit to the Attorney General a copy of the proposed contract if the profitmaking enterprise has gross assets exceeding $250,000,000. Prohibits the Administrator from awarding a contract to such an enterprise until the Attorney General's opinion is received. Establishes procedures and requirements for the disclosure of information relating to the awarding of contracts by the Administrator and by program participants. Imposes a fine of $20,000, or the amount of the contract, whichever is greater; and/or imprisonment of up to two years for participants who transmit false, fictitious, or fradulent information."
