States that no credit shall be allowed with respect to the employment of an individual if the taxpayer is allowed a credit for work incentive program expenses attributable to such individual for such year. Allows carrybacks and carryovers of unused credits. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to the Congress on the effectiveness of the employment incentive tax credit enacted by this Act in encouraging new employment together with such other information and recommendations as he considers necessary."
