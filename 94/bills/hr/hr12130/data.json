    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to appraise and sell so much of the trees and other forest products found upon National Forest System lands as may be compatible with the Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act of June 12, 1960 and the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974. Repeals the requirement that such forest products be sold for use only in the State or territory in which the timber reservation from which such products were taken is located. Increases to $10,000 in appraised value the maximum value of timber and cord wood which the Secretary may sell without advertisement. Amends the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 to require the Secretary to provide for public participation in the formulation and review of proposed land and resource management plans."
