Provides that the Director of the Geological Survey, in consultation with the National Science Foundation, shall develop and carry out a program of research and implementation in the areas of tectonics, seismology, geology, engineering, planning and social sciences necessary to achieve the purposes of this Act, specifying the nature of such program. States that the Director of the Geological Survey and the Director of the National Science Foundation, jointly, shall: (1) establish an advisory committee composed of representatives of the research community to review periodically the earhtquake mitigation program and the recommend to the Directors, through periodic written reports, appropriate modifications in the conduct or emphasis of the program; (2) establish an information dissemination mechanism to make available in a timely manner information developed pursuant to this Act; (3) prepare and submit annual reports to the Congress on the progress of the program and achievements in earthquake mitigation; (4) establish a joint program to evaluate, synthesize, and present, through appropriate educational programs, the knowledge developed pursuant to this Act; and (5) assist the States in carrying out their responsibilities under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 by making readily available the results of research conducted pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1976 and the same amount for each of the following nine fiscal years. Provides, under the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, for authorization of appropriations of $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1976 and $25,000,000 for each of the nine following fiscal years, for carrying out the duties of this Act."
