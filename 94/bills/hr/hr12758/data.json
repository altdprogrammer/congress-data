Requires the acquiring railroad to afford such employees, and its own employees adversely affected by such acquisition, the employee benefits and protection specified under such Act. States that the National Railroad Passenger Corporation shall be deemed an acquiring railroad with respect to \"protected employees\" under such Act."
