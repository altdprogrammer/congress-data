Directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to jointly extend the Youth Conservation Corps to make possible the year-round employment of young adults. States that individuals employed as Corps members under this Act shall be between the ages of 19 and 24; shall meet applicable physical standards; shall be given preference for employment if they reside in counties in which the unemployment rate was equal to or in excess of six percent for three consecutive months; and may be employed for a total of not more than 12 months. Sets forth criteria by which the Secretaries shall be guided in determining the location of projects and the type of work to be done. States that priority should be given to counties having a high rate of unemployment and that high labor intensive projects should be sought. States that the rate of pay for Corps members should be set at the current Federal minimum wage. Extends the provisions of this Act to cover employment of young adults in State conservation programs. Requires the Secretaries to prepare, within eight months of the enactment of this Act, a plan for the execution of the provisions of this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of funds for preparing the plan and for preparing the sites, facilities, and equipment selected in this plan. Authorizes the appropriation of funds as specified for the four fiscal years during which young adults are employed under this Act."
