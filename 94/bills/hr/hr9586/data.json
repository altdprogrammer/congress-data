    "text": "Directs the Rail Services Planning Office, under the Regional Rail Reorganization Act, to require the Consolidated Rail Corporation and any railroad subsidized under that Act to submit to the Office information sufficient to permit an accurate determination by the Office of the revenues, costs and operations of local rail lines as economic units. Increases from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 the appropriations authorized to the Interstate Commerce Commission for the use of the Rail Services Planning Office. Provides for the operation of rail service on light density lines not scheduled to be included in the final system plan established pursuant to the Regional Rail Reorganization Act. Stipulates that such light density lines as are profitable will be operated by the Consolidated Rail Corporation or a profitable railroad in the area. Authorizes the appropriation of up to $38,000,000 to subsidize the operation of such lines. Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct an audit to determine the soundness of the accounting procedures used by the Corporation in assessing the profitability of a light density line. Provides for the inclusion of additional local rail service lines within the final system plan. Sets forth a new schedule of Federal-State shares of the rail service continuation subsidy. States that the Federal share shall be 100 percent for the first two years of this Act and shall be reduced by ten percent each year thereafter until the Federal and State shares shall each be 50 percent. Revises the formula by which rail service continuation funds are allocated to the States to provide for distribution to the States on the basis of the discontinued rail mileage in each State. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to assist the States in developing and implementing the State plan for rail rehabilitation which is a prerequisite to the granting of rail service continuation subsidies. Provides for the granting of rail service continuation subsidies to rail freight services on those additional light density lines included in the final system plan under this Act. Deletes the provision of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act which limits any rail service continuation subsidy to two years. Revises the authorization of appropriations for the rail service continuation subsidies. Makes it possible for States to receive both rail service continuation subsidies and loans to purchase rail properties of a railroad which were originally scheduled for abandonment. Directs the Rail Services Planning Office to conduct a study of each railroad line which is not designated to be included in the final system plan and which is: (1) receiving rail service continuation subsidies; or (2) potentially eligible for such subsidies; or (3) a light density line operated by the Corporation or a profitable railroad. States that such study shall be conducted to determine the overall economic viability of such line including the prospects for such line becoming more economically viable at a reasonable cost and within a reasonable period of time. Directs the Office to designate those lines which such study has determined to be economically viable for transfer to the Corporation or to a profitable railroad operating in the region."
