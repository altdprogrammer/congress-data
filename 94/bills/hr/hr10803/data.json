    "text": "Community-Based Day Treatment and In-Home Services for Children and Families Act - Provides, under title IV of the Social Security Act, for the establishment of day treatment and in-home arrangements for services to children and families in trouble. Makes funds appropriated under the Social Security Act for child welfare services available to cooperating State agencies in the provision of day treatment and in-home services to children and families. Authorizes the appropriation of an additional $50,000,000 for each of the fiscal years following the enactment of this Act, for the purposes of this Act. Provides for the distribution of such funds to the appropriate State agencies. Defines the terms \"day treatment services\", and \"in-home services\". States that the term 'day treatment services' includes psychiatric, psychological, social casework, educational, vocational, recreational, health, and child care services, and any other services which are furnished a child or family in the home or through community-based services with the intent of preventing the child's institutionalization or other placement outside the family, except where such institutionalization or placement is in the child's best interest. States that the term 'in-home' specifically includes homemaking, housekeeping, and counseling services, and any other services which are furnished in the home and are aimed primarily at the family unit with the intent of keeping the family structure intact or reuniting a separated family. Requires States, as a condition to receiving Federal payments for child welfare services, to limit the placement of children outside or the home for treatment to those cases in which all feasible alternatives have been exhausted, or such placement has been ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. Requires State plans for aid and services to needy families with children to provide that the State agency supervising the administration of the plan will: (1) exhaust all feasible alternatives to placement of a child in a foster home, institution, or other residential facility before placing or approving the placement of such child in such a home, institution, or facility, and (2) submit to the Secretary periodic reports indicating the steps being taken to explore such alternatives (and the various types of alternative arrangements being considered) in connection with the placement of children in such homes, institutions, and facilities."
