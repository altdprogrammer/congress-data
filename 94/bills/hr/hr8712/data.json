    "text": "Conservation and Solar Energy - Federal Buildings Act - Declares it to be the finding of Congress that energy conservation practices adopted for the design, construction, and utilization of these facilities will have a beneficial effect on the Nation's overall supply of energy, and the procurement of solar heating and cooling units for use in Federal buildings in connection with demonstrations of solar energy applications on such buildings under this Act should help to create a market for such units generally. States that it is the policy of this Act to insure that energy conservation and solar energy technology be employed in the design and construction of certain Federal facilities as set forth in this Act, and, to the maximum extent feasible, in the design and construction of all other Federal and federally-assisted facilities. Defines terms used in this Act, including the terms \"energy use analysis,\" and \"life cycle energy costs\". Directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration and the Secretary of Defense to, in consultation with each other, develop, publish, and from time to time update guidelines designed to assure that the most effective and efficient measures for the conservation of energy and the use of solar energy systems are incorporated in: (1) the design, construction, and renovation of Federal and federally assisted buildings; and (2) the procurement of goods and services for such buildings and for other Federal purposes. States that the guidelines developed by the Secretary and the Administrator shall be consistent with each other. Requires the guidelines developed by the Secretary to be applied to all new and existing buildings under his control. Requires the guidelines developed by the Administrator to be applied to all other new and existing buildings, as defined in this Act. Directs all other Federal agencies to comply with the requirements of the applicable guidelines. Requires the Secretary and the Administrator: (1) to submit to Congress an energy use analysis with respect to the construction, acquisition, or leasing of any new building to which guidelines apply; and (2) with respect to existing buildings, to submit an inventory and energy use analysis of all such buildings, setting forth detailed plans for incorporating required improvements. Directs each Federal agency to submit to the Administrator or Secretary a detailed life cycle energy costs analysis of any building to be constructed, acquired, or leased by it for its use. Prohibits the purchase of any major energy using, generating, or conserving equipment by a Federal agency without prior submission of life cycle energy cost analysis. Provides for an increase in the allowable dollar amount of Federal assistance for building construction or major rehabilitation to cover the cost of solar energy equipment or other special energy equipment. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act."
