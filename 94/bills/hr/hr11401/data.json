    "text": "State Courts Improvement Act - Declares it the policy of Congress to assist the State court systems in improving the system of justice at every level. Sets forth the purposes of this Act. Authorizes the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, to make grants to States for: (1) development of a comprehensive plan for the improvement of the State court systems; (2) development of projects for the improvement of the court systems; and (3) other specified objectives designed to achieve a more responsive court system within each State. Requires each State to comply with enumerated requirements in order to become eligible for such grants, and in particular to develop a comprehensive multiyear plan for improvement of the court system. Stipulates that applications for grants should contain a comprehensive outline of priorities for the improvement and coordination of all aspects of courts and court programs, including descriptions of: (1) general needs and problems; (2) existing systems; (3) available resources; (4) organizational systems and administrative machinery for implementing the plan; (5) the direction, scope, and general types of improvements to be made in the future; and (6) to the maximum extent applicable, indicate the relationship of the plan to other relevant State or local law enforcement and criminal justice plans and systems. Sets forth procedures for the administration and allocation of funds. Authorizes $5,000,000 annually in support of the National Center for State Courts. Directs the National Center to: (1) maintain a continuing capability to render technical assistance, research, and coordination upon request to States developing or maintaining the court planning capability required by this Act; and (2) conduct a comprehensive nationwide study and report to the Congress and to the Administration within twenty-four months of the date of enactment of this Act. Requires that such report detail planning, resources, and actions recommended to reduce delay in State trial and appellate courts with respect to litigation and workloads in such courts."
