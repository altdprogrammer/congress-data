Directs that honeybee semen may be imported into the United States only from countries which the Secretary determines to be free of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees and which have in operation precautions to prevent the importation of such honeybees and their semen. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to cooperate with the Governments of Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, and Columbia, or the local authorities thereof, in carrying out necessary research, surveys, and control operations in those countries in connection with the eradication, suppression, control, and prevention, or retardation of the spread of undesirable species and subspecies of honeybees.
