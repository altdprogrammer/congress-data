States that it shall be the duty of the Administrator to establish a program for assistance to private industry in the development and commercial operation of facilities for the liquefaction and gasification of coal and production of shale oil. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) make loans, for such terms and at such rates of interest as he deems advisable, to any person for the purpose of engaging in research, development, and commercial operation of facilities designed for the liquefaction or gasification of coal, and the production of shale oil; (2) enter into purchase agreements and/or price support agreements, with appropriate terms and conditions, to assure a market for the output of such facilities on a reasonable profit basis; and (3) guarantee performance of contracts by persons receiving loans from the Administrator for the purchase, construction, or other acquisition of equipment and supplies necessary to develop, construct, and operate any such facility. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to lease Federal lands for the purpose of exploring for or extracting coal for use in a gasification or liquefaction facility, in such acreage and for such terms as he shall determine appropriate."
