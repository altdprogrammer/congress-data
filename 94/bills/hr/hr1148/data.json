Allows the Council to hold meetings, take testimony, and issue subpenas. Gives U.S. courts, upon application by the Council, power to order the appearance of any person who refuses to obey a subpena issued by the Council. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act."
