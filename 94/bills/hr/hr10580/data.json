    "text": "National Coal Production, Leasing, and Mine Reclamation Act - Title I: Amendments to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 - Revises the procedures followed by the Secretary of the Interior in leasing public lands for coal mining operations pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act. Prohibits the holding of any lease sale unless the land containing the coal deposits has been included in a comprehensive land-use plan prepared by the Secretary, the Secretary of Agriculture, or a State, and it has been determined that such sale is compatible with such plan. Sets forth requirements governing the preparation of land use plans pursuant to such Act. Directs the Secretary to evaluate and compare the effects of recovering coal by deep mining, by surface mining, or any other method, to determine what method achieves the maximum economic recovery of the coal within a proposed leasing tract. Establishes provisions for the issuance of coal exploration licenses to commercial interests by the Secretary. States that a licensee may not cause substantial disturbance to the natural land surface, and shall furnish to the Secretary copies of all data obtained during such exploration. Establishes a fine of up to $1,000 for each day of exploration conducted without a license. Authorizes the Secretary to approve the consolidation of coal leases into a mining unit. Defines a mining unit as an area of land in which the coal resources can be developed in an efficient, economical, and orderly manner. Directs the Secretary to evaluate the extent, location, and potential for developing the known recoverable coal resources within the coal lands subject to this Act. Decreases from 52 1/2 percent to 40 percent the portion of funds from the sale and rental of public lands which shall be reserved as part of the reclamation fund. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to lease coal or lignite under aquired lands set apart for military or naval purposes, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense. Limits such leases to governmental entities which produce electrical energy for sale to the public. Title II: Statement of Findings and Policy - Declares that most of the nation's coal reserve can only be mined by underground methods. States the purposes of this Act, including to establish a nationwide program to prevent the adverse effects to society and the environment from surface coal mining. Title III: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement - Establishes in the Interior Department the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement with a director appointed by the President.

States that the Office shall be considered in independent Federal regulatory body. Title IV: State Mining and Mineral Resources and Research Institutes - Authorizes appropriation to the Secretary of the Interior of sums adequate to provide for each participating State $200,000 for fiscal year 1975, $300,000 for fiscal year 1976., and $400,000 for each fiscal year thereafter for five years, to assist the States in carrying on the work of a competent and qualified mining and minineral resources reasearch institute or center at the school of mines of one public college or university of the State. Requires such monies to be matched dollar for dollar by the States. Authorizes appropriation of $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1975, such sum to be increased by $2,000,000 each fiscal year for six years thereafter, for specific projects in mining and mineral research in research institutes. Directs the Secretary to establish a center for cataloging current and projected scientific research in mining and mineral resources. Requires the Secretary to appoint an Advisory Committee on Mining and Mineral Research to advise him on all matters concerning mining and mineral resources research. Title V: Abandoned Mine Reclamation - Creates the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund in the Treasury. Requires operators of coal mines to pay into the fund quarterly fees of $.35 per ton of coal produced by surface mining and $.15 per ton of coal produced by underground mining, or 10 percent of the value of the coal in the mine, whichever is less. Authorizes use of money in the Fund for acquisition and reclamation of abandoned and unreclaimed mined lands and for acquisitions and fillings of voids and sealing of tunnels and entryways in abandoned mines. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into agreements with landowners, including owners of water rights, under which such landowners shall furnish a conservation and development plan and shall effect such plan in return for financial assistance from the Secretary of Agriculture of up to 80 percent of the cost of such a reclamation effort. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire, by purchase, donation, or otherwise, land which has been affected by surface mining and has not been reclaimed to its aapproximate original contour. Requires the Secretary, in determining the price paid for land under such authority, to take into account the unrestored condition of the land. Provides for the acquisition of lands by condemnation proceedings conducted by the Attorney General: (1) when the owner of such land refuses to negotiate with the Secretary; or (2) when such owner cannot be determined. Encourages States to acquire abandoned and unreclaimed lands, and to transfer such lands to the Secretary for reclamation, and authorizes matching grants for such purpose, up to 90 percent of land price. Allows resale of reclaimed land by public bidding, and allows local public participation in determining the use of reclaimed land. Title VI: Control of the Environmental Impacts of Surface Coal Mining - Directs publication within 180 days of enactment of this Act of regulations, covering surface coal mining and reclamation, setting standards for State programs. States that such regulations must meet approval of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator. Requires all surface coal mining operations commencing within six months of the date of enactment of this Act on State-regulated lands to comply with specified provisions of this Act. Requires all surface coal mining operations on State-regulated lands to be in compliance with specified provisions of this Act within one year of the date of enactment. Requires States which wish to assume exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations, to submit to the Secretary of the Interior, within 18 months of enactment, programs to include a State regulatory authority capable of regulating surface coal mining, State laws providing for sanctions for violations of regulations, and a permit system for surface coal mining regulation. Requires such State programs meet the approval of the EPA Administrator. Subjects State programs to approval of Secretary of Interior within 6 months. Requires implementation of a Federal program of surface coal mining regulation where States fail in such implementation. Permits State laws and regulations that are more stringent than those set forth pursuant to this Act. Prohibits the conduct of any surface coal mining operations by any person on or after six months from the promulgation of a State or Federal reclamation program unless the person has first obtained a permit, good for a maximum of five years, to conduct such operations. Provides for the renewal of such permit. Requires permit applications to describe the method of mining and equipment proposed to be used, to describe by maps the land to be affected, and to contain a statement of results of test borings or core samplings of the affected land. States that permits must be accompanied by a mining and reclamation plan which shall include a description of present uses of the land, steps to be taken to prevent environmental damage, and a description of the reclamation activities. Requires the posting of performance bonds and possession of liability insurance by applicants for permits. Requires operators to obtain a permit prior to conducting any coal exploration operations which substantially disturb the natural land surface. Sets general performance standards for environmental protection in surface coal mining which permittees under this Act must meet. Imposes additional standards for steep-slope surface mining. Directs the Secretary, within 135 days from the date of enactment, with the concurrence of the Chief of Engineers, to promulgate standards and criteria regulating the design, construction, maintenance and abandonment of new and existing coal mining coal mine waste piles.
