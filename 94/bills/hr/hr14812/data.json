Defines \"qualified land conservation expenditures\" as any amount paid or incurred by the taxpayer to establish a wind erosion control and wildlife habitat area on land which was previously used for the production of agricultural products or for the sustenance of livestock. Limits the amount of such credit to the tax due minus the amount of other specified credits."
