Prohibits approval of such forms unless such forms require only essential information, are easily understood, do not require professional help to complete of persons who are unable to obtain such help, and do not require excessive time or resources to complete. Requires the Comptroller General to inform Congress in the event of disapproval of such a form. Extends the Act to cover forms issued by the Internal Revenue Service. States that this Act shall apply to all forms first prescribed on or amended on or after the date of enactment of this Act. (Adds 44 U.S.C. 3513; Amends 44 U.S.C. 3507)"
