Determines the amount of such credit on the basis of the household's income and of such household's eligible property taxes and rent. Defines \"eligible property taxes and rent\" as the lesser of (1) the sum of property taxes plus rent constituting property taxes, or (2) $800. Allows an income tax deduction for property taxes for which such a credit is given. Allows appeals to the Tax Court of denials of such credit."
