    "text": "Equality Act - Prohibits discrimination under the Civil Rights Act on the basis of sex or marital status in: (1) public facilities; (2) public accomodations; (3) public education programs and schools; (4) federally assisted programs; (5) employment; and (6) housing sales, rentals, financing, and brokerage services. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to pay up to 60 percent of the cost of commissions, boards, and advisory panels established by the States to study: (1) the denial of equal protection under the law to women; (2) private discrimination practices against women; and (3) affirmative steps necessary to insure equality of opportunity to women. Authorizes appropriations of $2,000,000 to provide for such a program. Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress within two years his recommendations for legislation to equalize the status of women with that of men under specific provisions of the Social Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code. Requires the Commissioner of Education to survey educational institutions to determine the extent to which equality of educational opportunity is being denied to U.S. citizens and on the basis of sex, and to submit to Congress within 18 months his recommendations for remedial legislation. Authorizes appropriations of sums necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
