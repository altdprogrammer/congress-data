    "text": "Provides optional coverage for householders under title II (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act. Defines \"householder\" as meaning any individual who (1) maintains or participates in the maintenance of a household and conducts or supervises its affairs, not for a wage or salary, during a coverage quarter, (2) is not less than 18 years of age at the beginning of any coverage quarter, and (3) does not perform employment or engage in self-employment during any coverage quarter. Permits individuals qualifying as householders to elect to be covered, under the Internal Revenue Code, as a self-employed individual under the title II insurance system with respect to householder services performed by him or her during the taxable year. Makes the amount of weekly earnings from householder status equivalent to the minimum hourly wage multiplied times 40."
