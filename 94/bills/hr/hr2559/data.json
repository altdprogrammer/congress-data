Provides a method for the automatic adjustment of the rate of pay for the Vice President under a formula identical to the formula prescribed for the Executive Salary Schedule. Provides that the pay of Members of Congress, and congressional employees and officials would be adjusted at the same time and under the same formula used for the Executive Salary Schedule. Provides that salaries in the judicial branch would also be adjusted under a formula identical to that used for the Executive Salary Schedule.
