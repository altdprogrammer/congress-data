Requires that all government agencies cooperate to the fullest extent with the Office. Requires that the Office provide annual reports to Congress and the public on the progress of the study. Directs the Office to submit a final report to the Congress and the public five years after the enactment of this Act concerning the safety and environmental hazards of nuclear fission power plants and the nuclear fuel cycle. Authorizes appropriations of $2,000,000 for each of the first five fiscal years beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act to fund the investigation and study."
