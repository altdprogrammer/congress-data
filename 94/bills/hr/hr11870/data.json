Revises the requirements for the request of immunity orders, stipulating that a United States attorney may, with the Attorney General's approval, request such an order if: (1) the individual has refused to testify or provide other information on the basis of the right against self-incrimination; (2) such individual gives written consent to the request; (3) the individual's testimony or information is necessary to the public interest; and (4) in the case of a grand jury proceeding, 12 grand jurors vote to request the order. Applies all but the last requirement to requests for such orders issuing from Congressional proceedings. Requires the Attorney General to make annual reports to the Congress and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts containing specified data relating to immunity orders.
