    "text": "Coastal Zone Management Act Amendments - Establishes the Coastal States Fund. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to make grants from the fund to coastal States affected by anticipated or actual gas production and exploration. States that the purpose of such grants is to reduce adverse environmental effects and control secondary social and economic impacts associated with developing Federal energy resources on the Outer Continental Shelf adjacent to such States. Permits grants to be used for planning, construction of public facilities, provision of public services, and other activities prescribed by the Secretary. Encourages States receiving grants to undertake studies of onshore economic, environmental and social data for the purpose of designating onhore areas which are suitable for the location of facilities designed to support Outer Continental Shelf energy exploration and development. Directs Federal agencies to assist the States by providing them with information on Outer Continental Shelf resources. Requires Federal agencies to coordinate their exploration and development activities with affected coastal States. Sets forth criteria governing eligibility for grants. Authorizes deposits to the fund of an amount equal to 10 percent of the revenues collected under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Limits the total amount paid into the fund to $200,000,000 per year for fiscal years 1976 and 1977. Authorizes States to negotiate and enter into interstate compacts for the purpose of coordinating State coastal zone planning, policies, and programs in contiguous areas and to implement unified coastal zone policies in such areas. States that the Secretary may make grants to the States to assist them in such purposes."
