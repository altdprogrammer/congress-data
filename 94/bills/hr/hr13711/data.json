    "text": "Horse Protection Act Amendments - Amends the Horse Protection Act of 1970 to redefine \"sore\" when used to describe a horse. Disqualifies a sore horse from any horse show or exhibition. Prohibits the sale of a sore horse at a public sale or auction. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to prescribe regulations requiring: (1) appointment of persons to inspect horses for any horse show, exhibition, sale, or auction; and (2) recordkeeping by the management of any horse show, exhibition, sale, or auction. Authorizes the Secretary to make certain inspections for enforcement of this Act. Prohibits: (1) the transportation of a sore horse for show or sale; (2) the showing or selling of such a horse by its owner; (3) the failure to disqualify such a horse from a show or sale; (4) the failure to retain inspection personnel; (5) the failure to keep required records; and (6) interference with specified enforcement measures taken by the Secretary. Imposes a fine of not more than $3,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year or both for knowing violation of this Act. Increases the penalty to a fine of not more than $5,000 or imprisonment for not more than two years or both for subsequent convictions. Imposes a fine of not more than $5,000 or imprisonment for not more than three years or both for: (1) falsifying records; or (2) interference with official duties, under this Act. Imposes a fine of $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than ten years or both for use of a deadly weapon in such interference. Declares any person who violates such prohibitions liable for a civil penalty of not more than $2,000 for each violation. Sets forth procedures with respect to enforcement and adjudication under this Act. Requires annual, rather than biennial, reports from the Secretary to the Congress with respect to this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of up to $500,000 for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1976, to carry out this Act."
