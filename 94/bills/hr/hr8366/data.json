Extends such coverage to employees of State and local governments. Establishes Federal standards for eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits. Provides for the payment of benefits for 26 weeks based on an employment period of 20 weeks; for 39 weeks based on an employment period of 30 weeks; and for 52 weeks based on a 40-week employment period. States that the waiting period shall be not more than one week. Provides for retroactive payment to cover such period in the case of an individual who receives compensation for at least three weeks during a benefit year. Establishes Federal standards for amounts of unemployment insurance compensation. Declares that the State maximum weekly benefit amount must be no less than 100 percent of the statewide average weekly wage. Provides for partial payment of unemployment compensation to individuals employed on a part-time basis. Provides, under the Social Security Act, for Federal funding of a portion of the increased costs to States for the additional 26 weeks of unemployment insurance coverage provided by this Act. Increases the amount of wages subject to the Federal unemployment tax. Sets such taxable amount at $6,000 plus $2,000 annual increases for calendar years beginning after 1977, but with a ceiling of the contribution and benefit base as determined under the Social Security Act."
