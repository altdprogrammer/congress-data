    "text": "Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to provide feed grain to the owners of dairy cattle which are maintained for commercial purposes whenever the price of milk is below 90 percent of the parity price. Declares that the price at which feed grain is to be offered to such owners is the price at which these owners could purchase feed other than under this Act minus that percentage of the full parity price not being paid producers of milk. Makes it unlawful for any person to dispose of any feed grain obtained under this Act except in the manner specified in this Act. Stipulates that the authority of the Secretary to make feed grain available under this Act shall terminate one year after the date of the enactment of this Act."
