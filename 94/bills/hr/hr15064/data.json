    "text": "Reemployment Services Act - Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish, under the Wagner-Peyser Act, an outreach program which will provide technical and management assistance to public employment offices in the several States. Requires the Secretary to establish within the United States Employment Service a national clearinghouse for employment service information. Stipulates that public employment offices receiving assistance under this Act must develop a program for achieving the physical separation of the job placement and counseling services provided by such offices from the services provided in connection with unemployment insurance claims. Requires agencies designated by the Secretary to cooperate with the United States Employment Service to submit a management plan which includes provisions for the identification of employment opportunities for professional workers, craft workers, agricultural workers, veterans, and the handicapped. Specifies that such annual management plan shall include a program to encourage the active participation of employers in the public employment office system. Directs the Secretary to periodically evaluate State agency compliance with revelant statutes and regulations thereunder. Requires the Secretary, through the United States Employment Service, to carry out a program of financial assistance for job placement projects, which shall be reviewed and evaluated by the Secretary. States that the Secretary shall carry out an examination of the merits and cost-effectiveness of establishing a nationwide job bank system, and shall report to the Congress within one year of the date of enactment of this Act on the results, including any recommendations for legislation. Directs the Secretary to carry out a feasibility study on establishing a system of Federal public employment officers in lieu of the system established and assisted under the Wagner-Peyser Act, and to report the results of such study to the Congress within two years after the enactment of this Act."
