Defines the term \"shoreline erosion\" to mean erosion by: (1) the waters of any of the Great Lakes or Lake St. Clair if the waters of the lake were above the average monthly level for the period of record (as determined by the Secretary of Commerce) for six consecutive months during a 12 month period prior to the loss; or (2) the waters of any ocean, sea, gulf, sound, bay, or inlet adjacent thereto if the loss is directly attributable to erosion caused by a single storm or a series of storms during the taxable year."
