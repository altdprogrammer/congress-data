    "text": "National Family Health Protection Act - Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to establish and administer the national family health protection program. Requires such program to provide every individual with the means of obtaining a basic health protection policy from a qualified company of his choice, in order to provide comprehensive health protection for himself and his family. Requires the Secretary to issue to each head of a family a certificate each year enabling him to purchase such a policy. Makes provisions in the income tax return for applying for such certificate. Requires such a policy to cover the reasonable cost of: inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital services, extended care services, post-hospital extended care services, home health services, post-hospital home health services, medical care and other health services, and physician's services. Includes in the definition of such services the necessary drugs, supplies, x-ray and laboratory tests, and ambulance services. Sets forth stipulations for determining and adjusting the reasonable costs of such services. Prohibits payment under such a policy for items or services: which are not reasonable and necessary for diagnosis and treatment; which are paid for directly or indirectly by a governmental entity; which are not provided in the United States; which are for routine physical checkups; which are for custodial care; and which are for normal dental care. Limits full payment of hospital bed and board to 120 days, 80 percent during the next 120 days and 50 percent thereafter. Limits payments for home or office physician's visits to $5 per visit to the extent such visits exceed $50 per year. Defines a qualified insurance company. Provides that such companies may redeem an individual's health certificate by presenting them to the Secretary. Provides for the assignment of high risk families among such companies. Establishes the Health Protection Reserve Fund to make payments under this Act when an insurance company is unable to make such payments. Requires the insurance companies to make payments to the fund. Repeals the Medicare and Medicaid programs of the Social Security Act. Imposes a tax equal to 5 percent of a person's adjusted income tax in order to cover the costs of this program. Authorizes additional appropriations from time to time equal to such tax, as may be needed to cover the costs of such program.
