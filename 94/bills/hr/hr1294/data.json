    "text": "Travel Agents Registration Act - Requires, beginning January 1, 1975, all persons conducting travel agencies to obtain a registration certificate from the Bureau of Travel Agents Registration, created by this Act in the Department of Transportation. Establishes an eight-member Travel Agents Registration Board to advise the Director of the Bureau to pass on applications for registration certificates which present special problems, and approve regulations establishing qualifications for obtaining registration certificates and a code or ethics for travel agencies, both to be promulgated by the Director. Provides that when an application for a registration certificate shall have been examined by the Director and the Director, with the advice of the Board, has determined that the applicant has complied with the rules and regulations promulgated by the Director and the Director, with advice of the Board, shall have determined that the applicant, if issued a certificate of authorization, would provide a useful public service, the Director shall issue and deliver a registration certificate to the applicant. Provides that a registration certificate shall not be issued to any person who has been convicted in any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or possession of the United States, of a felony or a crime concerning activities prohibited by this Act. Requires the granting of a certificate by the Director if the applicant was conducting a travel agency on January 1, 1975 has been doing so for two or more years, and has been approved for two or more conferences of air or steamship carriers, unless the Director makes a specific determination that the applicant lacks good character or financial integrity. Prohibits the granting of a certificate to anyone convicted of a felony, or activities prohibited by this Act, and to a person enjoying a tax-exempt status or organized as a nonprofit organization. Provides for biennial expiration of certificates and renewal procedures. Sets up grounds for suspension or revocation of certificates, and authorizes the Director to impose a maximum fine of $1,000 for violations. Permits judicial review of the Director's orders by the U.S. Courts of Appeals. Provides a scale of fines and imprisonment for violations of any provision of this Act or orders issued under it."
