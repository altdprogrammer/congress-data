Empowers the Office to compel delivery of any information in the possession of the National Laboratories which the Office deems necessary for conducting its study. Specifies that all Government agencies shall cooperate to the fullest extent with the Office. Directs the Office of Technology Assessment to submit, within five years, a report to Congress and the public concerning safety and environmental hazards of nuclear fission powerplants and the nuclear fuel cycle. Requires the report to include recommendations as to whether a resumption of the licensing of nuclear fission power plants should be allowed, and if so, the conditions under which licenses should be granted. Authorizes appropriations for the study of $15,000,000 for each of the five fiscal years beginning after the date of enactment of this Act."
