States that any appointed member of the Commission shall not engage in any other business, vocation, or employment while a member of the Commission. Makes it the purpose of the Commission to seek to obtain compliance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 concerning the Presidential Campaign Fund and the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account. Grants the Commission exclusive and primary jurisdiction with respect to the civil enforcement of such provisions. States that the authority or function of Congress will not be limited or diminished by this Act. Requires that an affirmative vote of four members of the Commission be taken before any guidelines for complaince with election laws are established. Limits the duties of the ex officio members to non-voting functions. Provides that in any year in which a candidate is not on the ballot, such candidate and his authorized committee shall only be required to file a report with the Commission not later than the tenth day following the close of any calendar quarter in which aggregate contributions and expenditures were in excess of $10,000. Requires each treasurer of a political committee authorized by the candidate to raise contributions or make expenditures, other than the candidate's principal campaign committee, to file reports with the candidate's principal campaign committee. Requires a political committee, other than an authorized committee, with expenditures in excess of $100 to report the identification of each person to whom expenditures have been made, the amount, date, and purpose of each expenditure, and the name and address of, and office sought by, each candidate on whose behalf such expenditure was made. States that certification that such expenditure is made in cooperation with or at the suggestion of a candidate is made under penalty of law. Requires every person who makes expenditures or contributions expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate in an aggregate amount in excess of $100 within a calendar year to file a statement with the Commission. Requires the Commission to prepare indices of expenditures on a candidate-by-candidate basis. Includes the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Conference of each House of Congress among those eligible to submit written requests for advisory opinions of the Commission. States that advisory opinions shall apply only to the person requesting such advisory opinion and to any other person directly involved in the specific transaction or activity with respect to which such opinion is rendered. Requires the Commission to prescribe rules or regulations in any case where the Commission receives more than one request for advisory opinions relating to similar activities where the Commission determines that such activity is not subject to any existing rule or regulation prescribed by the Commission. Prohibits the Commission from investigating any complaint which is not in writing, signed and sworn to by the person filing the complaint, and notorized. Requires the Commission to afford a reasonable opportunity for any person notified of an apparent violation to demonstrate that no action should be taken against him. Allows the Commission: (1) upon determination that there is probable cause to believe that a knowing or willful violation of this Act has occurred or is about to occur, to refer such apparent violation to the Attorney General of the United States; and (2) upon determination that there is clear and convincing proof of a violation, to require that such person involved in a conciliation agreement pay a civil penalty. Empowers the Commission to institute a civil action for relief if it believes that there has been a violation of any of the terms of a conciliation agreement. Prescribes civil penalties of not more than the greater of $10,000 or an amount equal to 300 percent of the contribution or expenditure involved in such violation. Allows an aggrieved party by an order of the Commission dismissing a complaint filed by such a party or by a failure of the Commission to act on such complaint within 90 days to file a petition with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Sets time limits for the filing of such petitions. States that if the Commission determines after investigation that any person has violated an order of the court, it may petition the court for an order to adjudicate that person in civil contempt or criminal contempt if it believes the violation to be knowing and willful. Extends the duties of the Commission to include the compilation of a cumulative index of reports and statements filed with it by political committees supporting more than one candidate.

Sets the expenditure limitations for Presidential candidates of: (1) $10,000,000 for a candidate seeking nomination for election to the office of President; and (2) $20,000,000 for a candidate seeking election to the office of President.

Provides for an inflation increase to be added to the expenditures limitations on an annual basis. Restricts the spending of a national committee of a political party to: (1) two cents multiplied by the voting age population of the United States for a candidate for the Presidency; (2) two cents multiplied by the voting age population of the State or $20,000 for a candidate for the Senate or to the House of Representatives where that State is entitled to only one Representative; and (3) $10,000 for a candidate to the office of Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner in any other State. Makes these restrictions as to State and Congressional elections applicable to any State committee of a political party. Prohibits any candidate or political committee from knowingly accepting any contribution or making any expenditure in violation of the provisions of this Act.
