    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to assure that National Forest System resource management plans provide for multiple uses and sustained yield of forest products and services and limit the application of intensified management practices and silvicultural systems in accordance with specified criteria. Requires the Secretary to provide for public participation prior to the final adoption or any amendment of each such management plan. Restricts timber harvesting contracts pursuant to national forest management plans to ten years unless the Secretary informs appropriate Congressional committees that a longer period is required. Authorizes the Secretary to appraise and sell so much of the trees and other forest products found upon National Park System lands as may further the policies set forth in the Multiple Use and Sustained Yield Act, and the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974. Repeals the requirement that such forest products be sold for use only in the State or territory in which the timber reservation from which such products were taken is located. Increases to $10,000 in appraised value the maximum value of timber and cord wood which the Secretary may sell without advertisement."
