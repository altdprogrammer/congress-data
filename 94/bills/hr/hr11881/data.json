    "text": "Alaskan Natural Gas Pipeline Authorization Act - Expresses the intent of Congress that the Alaskan natural gas pipeline be constructed promptly, without further administrative or judicial delay or impediment. Declares that the most efficient and economical method available for the transportation of Alaskan natural gas is a pipeline system from northern Alaska, across Canada, to the lower forty-eight States. Directs the Federal Power Commission to issue all necessary permits and authorizations in order to expedite the construction and operation of such pipeline within 60 days of the date of enactment of this Act. Grants the holders of such permits the powers of eminent domain under the Natural Gas Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior and other appropriate Federal officials to issue all necessary permits and take appropriate action within 60 days to expedite the enforcement of all rights-of-way related to the construction and operation of such pipeline. Authorizes the Secretary to modify the pipeline route through the States to provide greater environmental protection during the construction period. Requires compliance with requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 relating to the rights-of-way for pipelines through Federal lands. Exempts such pipeline from requirements regarding (1) environmental protection, (2) technical and financial capacity of applicants, (3) public hearings, (4) licensing requirements for crude oil under the Export Administration Act of 1969, and (5) furnishing of specified information and reports. Authorizes the Secretary and the Commission to waive procedural requirements of Federal law where desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Act. Declares that (1) the actions of Federal officers and agencies under this Act and (2) the legal or factual sufficiency of any environmental statement relative to such pipeline under provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 shall not be subject to judicial review of the courts. Allows the claims that (1) this Act is unconstitutional, (2) actions under this Act will deny Constitutional rights, and (3) actions taken are beyond the scope of authority conferred by this Act, provided that such claims are filed within 60 days following the date of the challenged action. Declares that exclusive jurisdiction shall be vested in the United States District Courts, and that review of any final order shall be had only upon direct appeal to the United States Supreme Court. Declares that the power to issue injunctive relief against the issuance of any certificate, except in cases where a final judgment is entered. Declares that authorizations issued pursuant to this Act shall grant no immunity from Federal antitrust laws."
