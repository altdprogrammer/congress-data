Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Permits a local educational agency to receive a grant under this Act only upon the determination of the Commissioner of Education that the local agency has adopted and is implementing, or will implement with financial assistance received pursuant to these provisions, a plan to reduce crime and increase the safety and security of the students, employees, and facilities of the schools. Sets forth specified measures to be covered by such plans, including: (1) the acquisition of additional staff members; (2) planning and evaluation activities; and (3) minor alterations of school plants and facilities."
