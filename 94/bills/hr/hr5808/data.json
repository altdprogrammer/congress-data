Authorizes any regulatory agency of the Federal Government to require specified information to be maintained by intermediate carriers and handlers with respect to the transportation, receiving, handling and delivery of animals. Grants authority to the Secretary to promulgate regulations to assure the humane treatment of animals transported in commerce. Requires that a certificate be obtained from a veterinarian certifying the health of an animal prior to the transporting of any such animal in commerce. States that specified animals shall not be delivered for transportation if they are less than eight weeks of age. Provides that no intermediate handler or common carrier shall participate in any practice under which the cost of such animal or its transportation is to be paid and collected upon delivery of the animal to the consignee. Empowers the Secretary with the authority to suspend temporarily the license of any person who has violated or is violating the provisions of the Act. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties which may be imposed for violations of the Act. Makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly sponsor or exhibit an animal in any fighting venture. Prohibits use of the mails or interstate commerce to promote an animal fighting venture which is to occur inside the United States. Defines \"animal fighting venture,\" so as not to include the use of animals to hunt other animals. Limits appropriations for the enforcement of such provisions relating to animal fighting ventures to $400,000 in any fiscal year. Requires Federal departments and agencies having laboratory animal facilities or exhibiting animals to comply with standards and requirements governing the treatment of such animals, including the requirement that such facilities report annually as to their treatment practices. Authorizes appropriations not exceeding $600,000 each fiscal year to carry out the provisions of this Act, with the exception of those provisions relating to animal fighting ventures. Authorizes the Secretary to investigate, with or without the assistance of other Federal agencies, any person who may be violating the provisions of the Act."
