Directs all Federal officials to encourage the use of recycled oil, through procurement policies, contracts and education. Requires the General Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and all other Federal agencies to revise their procurement specifications to encourage the use of recycled oil. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to make a grant to any State which submits a waste oil management plan which includes specified provisions required by this Act. Limits the authorization to one grant for each State in an amount not to exceed $200,000 for fiscal years 1976 through 1980. Specifies the standards to be used by the Administrator in determining the amounts of such grants. Limits to $500,000 the grants to any State during fiscal years 1976 through 1980 for the implementation and operation of the waste oil management plan of such State. Permits States to provide for stricter control of recycled oil, used oil, or new oil than that provided for by Federal law. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations: (1) with respect to the labeling of recycled oil in order to carry out the purpose of this Act; and (2) requiring any container of automotive and industrial oil, to have affixed a label stating the proper disposal of such oil. Requires automotive oil packaged for sale to be sold in resealable containers. Directs the Administrator of Energy Research and Development to conduct a program of research to improve the performance and marketability of recycled oil. Requires the Administrator to conduct research into the environmental and public health impacts of various used oil disposal practices. Imposes a penalty of $50,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year for entering into any contract with the intent to discourage the recycling of used oil. Requires specified oil users, users of oil recycler, or used oil collectors to maintain complete records of the use or collection and the disposition of such oil. Specifies the reports which the Administrator of Energy Research and Development shall submit regarding the research conducted pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the Administrator, through the Attorney General and a district court of the United States, to order the licensing of a patent whenever necessary to effectuate this Act or to prevent a lessening of competition. Imposes a general penalty for violating any provision of this Act of $25,000 or six months in prison.
