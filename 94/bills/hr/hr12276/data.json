    "text": "Civil Rights of the Blind Act - Expresses Congressional findings that the denial to blind persons of equal access to places or facilities of public accommodation or transportation, to business establishments, or to housing, impairs the interstate commerce of the United States. Prohibits (1) common carriers from refusing to accept as passengers, (2) owners or operators of public accommodations, public buildings or facilities from refusing to admit or serve, and (3) owners or operators of specified housing accommodations to refuse to admit, as tenant or otherwise, any person because of blindness or the use of guidance dogs or instrumentalities. Prohibits charging such blind person additional fees for the admission of such guidance dog or instrumentality. Prohibits subterfuge, device, or covert strategy which achieves indirectly the discrimination prohibited under this Act. Imposes civil penalties for damages caused by such discrimination and $10,000 punitive damages in addition to attorney's fees and litigation costs. Declares such actions maintainable in the Federal courts. Specifies defenses for such claims."
