    "text": "Declares that greater emphasis must be placed on recovering and reusing resources now disposed of as waste in order to avoid shortages, price increases, and other burdens on commerce. States that such measures shall also save scarce virgin natural resources and reduce disposal costs. Sets forth the purposes of this Act which are the establishment of a national transportation rate policy for all recovered materials, and the elimination of discriminatory transportation rates charged by regulated carriers for the movement in commerce of recovered waste and recycled or recycable materials. Defines terms as used in this Act. Directs the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Maritime Commission to effect charges in the rate structure to promote the movement by common carriers of recovered materials at the lowest possible lawful rates compatible with the maintenance of adequate transportation service. Provides that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall take steps as necessary to insure that such action is carried out. Requires the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Maritime Commission to undertake studies of the feasibility of establishing a transportation rate policy for all recovered materials based upon type, size, kind of transportaiton equipment used, and the weight and/or volume of the shipment. Makes it unlawful for any railroad, common carrier by water, or motor carrier in interstate or foreign commerce to demand, charge, or collect any rate or charge for the transportation of recovered materials which are unjustly discriminatory when compared with the rate or charge demanded or collected by the carrier or railroad for the transportation of virgin natural resources. Authorizes the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Maritime Commission to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Makes any person, firm, corporation, association, or conference which violates this Act subject to a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each such violation."
