    "text": "Federal Medical Malpractice Act - States that it is the purpose of this Act to establish a system whereby a person who believes that he has been the victim of a wrongful or negligent act or omission on the part of a medical person or hospital can obtain swift economical adjudication of his claim, and under which the liability of medical persons and hospitals will be limited to an amount which is a fair approximation of the injury that may have been inflicted by the wrongful or negligent act or omission. Provides that after the one-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act any medical malpractice suit brought against: (1) any medical person who provides medical services the cost of which is paid for, in whole or in part, by money the source of which is, directly or indirectly, from Federal funds; or (2) any hospital or other health care facility that receives money the source of which is, directly or indirectly, from Federal funds, or that allows a medical person to provide medical care services to persons in the hospital or other health care facility; shall be brought only in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to establish medical zones and to establish a Federal Medical Malpractice Board in each zone. States that any medical malpractice suit to which this Act applies shall be filed with the Federal Medical Malpractice Board in the medical zone as in which the act may be filed only within the two-year period beginning on the date such act or omission occurred. Stipulates that, with respect to each medical malpractice suit filed with each Board, the Board shall determine and make a finding of fact and make an award for or against payment of recovery, according to a compensation schedule after a full and complete hearing and only upon the evidence adduced at that hearing. Directs the Secretary to establish a compensation schedule for each board which will indicate the amount of the award to be given in the case of death or injury resulting from a wrongful or negligent act or omission of a medical person or hospital. States that in the case of injury resulting in partial disability actual awards shall be computed on the percentage of the disability or injury multiplied times the amount shown on the compensation schedule for such injury or disability. Provides that in no case shall the actual award exceed the amount shown on the compensation schedule for such injury, disability, or death."
