    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Agriculture with amendment, H. Rept. 94-1611) Amends the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act to raise the statutory ceiling to $150 on the license fee assessed by the Secretary of Agriculture against commission merchants, dealers and brokers who are licensed under the Act. Includes frozen potato products within the Act's definition of \"perishable agricultural commodity.\" Defines canners or processors of potatoes as \"dealers\" under the Act. Raises, to $150,000, the minimum annual invoice value of the perishable agricultural commodities which a person must purchase for sale at retail to be considered a \"dealer\" under the Act, or which a person must sell for third parties before qualifying as a \"broker\" under the Act. Allows the Secretary to withhold identifying information about persons complaining of violations of the Act upon a determination that such disclosure would adversely affect the complaining party and is not required in the public interest. Authorizes the Secretary to inspect the accounts of persons found to have violated the Act and to require the violators to post a surety bond to insure the payment of reparations and future compliance with the Act."
