    "text": "Declares it to be the sense of Congress that all portions of the officially designated National System of Interstate and Defense Highways be free from tolls. Provides that each State having any portion of a free or toll highway, bridge or tunnel which is part of the Interstate System shall be entitled to receive additional funds from the Highway Trust Fund for the removal of such toll facilities and the completion of the Interstate System within such State . Directs the Secretary of Transportation to deliver to Congress an estimate of the September 30, 1977, depreciated value of toll and free facilities incorporated into the Interstate System. Specifies criteria for determining such depreciation value. Allows a reimbursement of 90 percent of such depreciated value for States which remove tolls or presently operate free highway facilities. Decreases Federal-aid highway apportionments for States not electing to eliminate tolls from facilities within the Interstate System. (Adds 23 U.S.C. 156)"
