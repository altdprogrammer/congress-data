Provides that such a zone shall be drawn following the two-hundred meter depth contour of the coasts, but shall be drawn so that each point on the outward boundary of the zone is at least 47 nautical miles from the outer limits of the territorial sea. Stipulates that the fishing rights presently exercised within the territorial sea shall extend to such zone, except that nothing shall prohibit the continuation of established foreign fisheries in said zone to the extent and in the manner in which such fisheries have been conducted within such zone during the ten calendar years preceding the enactment of this Act."
