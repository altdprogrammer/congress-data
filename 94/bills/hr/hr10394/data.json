Rept. 94-1164) Sets forth a payment schedule for the care and treatment of veterans in State veterans' homes with funds of the Veterans' Administration, in those cases where the veteran would be eligible for the type of care in a Veterans' Administration facility. Limits such payment in all cases to one-half of the cost of the State home care. Amends 38 U.S.C. 641 Revises the definition of the term \"State home\" to eliminate references to wartime service in such definition. Amend 38 U.S.C. 101 Provides that such payment schedule be effective from January 1, 1976, and requires that States receive the additional amount of entitlement in a lump sum payment."
