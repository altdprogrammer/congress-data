Establishes periods during which such officers and employees may certify their intention to be covered by the Social Security Act. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations requiring the heads of the various Federal agencies to know which of their employees qualify for elective coverage under this Act, or, in the alternative, to provide for the collection of the tax from a Federal employee electing such coverage, where it is not feasible for the head of the Federal agency or instrumentality involved to do so."
