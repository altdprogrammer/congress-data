    "text": "National Primary Act - Provides that the official candidates of political parties for President and Vice President shall be nominated at a primary election by direct popular vote. Stipulates that in such primary election each voter shall be eligible to vote only in the primary of the party of his registered affiliation. Declares that such primary election shall be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in August in the year preceding the expiration of the regular term of President and Vice President. Specifies that no person shall be a candidate for nomination for President or Vice President except in the primary of his registered affiliation. Provides that no person shall be a candidate for nomination for President or Vice President unless he shall have filed a petition with the President of the Senate not later than the First Tuesday after the first Monday in June of the year in which the next such primary is to be held. Requires such petition to have been signed on or after the first day of January of such year by a number of qualified voters, in any or all of the several States, equal in number to at least 1 per cent, but not more than two per cent, of the total number of popular votes cast throughout the United States for all candidates for President in the last presidential election. Allows the name of a candidate, except in the case of a runoff election, to be written on the ballot by voters. Provides that for the purposes of this Act a political party shall be recognized as such if at any time within the four years preceding a primary election such party has had more than 5 per cent of the total registered voters registered as members thereof. Declares that the person receiving a majority of the votes cast for presidential nominees by the voters of the party of his registered affiliation shall be the official candidate of such party for the President throughout the United States. Provides for a runoff election between the two persons who received the greatest number of popular votes, if no person receives a majority of the votes cast for presidential nominees by the voters of a political party. Establishes the same procedure for a vice presidential runoff. Provides that in the event of the death or resignation of the official candidate of any political party for President, the person nominated by such political party for Vice President shall be the official candidate for President of such party. Provides that in the event of the deaths or resignations of the official candidates of any political party for President and Vice President, a national committee of such party shall designate such candidates."
