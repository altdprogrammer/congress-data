Establishes in the Department of the Treasury the Coastal Impact Fund. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make 100 percent annual grants from the Fund to those coastal States which the Secretary determines are likely to be significantly or adversely impacted by the development or energy resources or by the siting of energy facilities. Directs the Secretary to establish requirements for grant eligibility and lists circumstances under which the regulations shall provide that a State is eligible. States that the authorization of Congress is given to two or more States to negotiate and enter into interstate agreements for the purpose of study, planning, and implementation of unified coastal zone policies and for the coordination of such policies. Authorizes the Secretary to make annual grants for such purposes, provided that they do not exceed 90 percent of the cost. Authorizes the Secretary to provide assistance to the coastal States to develop a capability for carrying out short-term research, studies, and training required in support of coastal zone management. Requires the Secretary to submit additional information each year to the President for transmittal to Congress including: (1) a general description of the economic, environmental, and social impacts of the development or production of energy resources or the siting of energy facilities affecting the coastal zone; and (2) a description and evaluation of interstate and regional planning mechanisms developed by the coastal States. Extends until 1980 the authority of the Secretary to make grants to the coastal States for the development of land and water resources management programs. Authorizes to be appropriated $200,000,000 for fiscal years 1976 and for each of the four succeeding fiscal years for grants made from the Coastal Impact Fund. Authorizes to be appropriated for fiscal years 1976-79 such sums, not to exceed $5,000,000, for interstate coordination grants to the coastal States. Authorizes to be appropriated for fiscal years 1976-79 such sums, not to exceed $5,000,000, for coastal research assistance grants to the coastal States. Includes \"islands\" and \"beach\" within the definition of coastal zone under the Coastal Zone Management Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make annual grants to any coastal State for the purpose of assisting in the development of a management program, including plans for the protection of access to public beaches and other coastal areas."
