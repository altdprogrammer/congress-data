Directs the Commissioner to establish a program to make medical services and medical supplies available to older persons determined to be in special need of such services and supplies because of their medical condition and inadequate income. Requires States receiving grants for such purposes to distribute such grants to local health or welfare agencies or private nonprofit agencies. Requires the Commissioner to insure that foods, services, and supplies provided under this Act will be delivered to homes of older persons otherwise unable to procure them. Requires the Commissioner to insure that there is an equitable distribution of such foods, services, and supplies to older persons residing in rural areas. Requires the Commissioner and the Comptroller General to submit to Congress an interim evaluation report and a final evaluation report, detailing the administration of any program established under this Act together with legislative and administrative recommendations. Authorizes the appropriation of specified sums in fiscal years 1977 through 1979 to carry out the purposes of this Act."
