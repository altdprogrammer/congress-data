    "text": "National Aquaculture Development Act - States that it is the purpose of this Act to provide for a national program for aquaculture development in order to increase sources of marine protein for the consumer; to increase the availability and quality level of consumer fishery products; to develop new resources; to improve or maintain recreational fisheries; and to initiate new business, industry, and employment. Requires the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with interested Federal agencies and other public and private organizations and with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior, to establish national objectives for aquaculture development. Requires the Secretary to act as the interagency coordinator for all Federal programs and activities in aquaculture. Sets forth activities regarding aquaculture development which the Secretary may, as he deems appropriate, carry out pursuant to this Act, including: (1) development of specified areas of aquaculture research and implementation; (2) investigation of legal and regulatory constraints on aquaculture; (3) preparation of an inventory of public and private aquaculture; and (4) provision for the training of individuals, including public and private organizations and educational institutions, in the principles and techniques of aquaculture. Permits the Secretary to make grants to individuals, State and local government agencies, private nonprofit organizations and educational institutions for the furtherance of aquaculture research and development. Prohibits the Secretary from granting money for the acquisition of real property in connection with aquacultural projects and limits grants to 75 percent of a project's cost. Directs the Secretary to research the nature and extent of pollution created by various types of aquaculture. Authorizes appropriations of $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980 as well as $2,500,000 for the period beginning July 1, 1976 and ending September 30, 1976."
