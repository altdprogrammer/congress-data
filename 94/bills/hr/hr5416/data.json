Directs that such payment shall be equal to the difference between: (1) an amount equal to $0.50 for each acre of national forest and national grassland in the county receiving the payment; and (2) the sum of the benefits received (or to be received) by the county with respect to the previous fiscal year or calendar year under specified provisions of law. Provides that if such sum as calculated exceeds $1,000,000 the Secretary of the Treasury shall calculate the payment to be made to the counties under a formula set forth in this Act. Requires the payments made under this act to be used by a county as follows: (1) 80 percent for the benefit of public roads and public schools; and (2) 20 percent to be expended as the county may determine. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
