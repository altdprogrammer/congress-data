    "text": "Government in the Sunshine Act - Declares that it is the policy of Congress that the public is entitled to the fullest practicable information regarding the decision-making process of the Federal Government and that providing such information is the purpose of this Act. Requires that Federal agency proceedings be open to the public unless in the agency's opinion an open meeting would likely disclose information that would be in violation of an individual's rights, would hamper enforcement of the law, or would lead to instability of a financial institution. Requires transcripts or electronic recordings to be prepared of any agency meeting closed to the public. States that such transcripts or recordings with the detrimental information deleted must be made available to the public. Directs that open meetings be recorded in written minutes. Requires that all agency meetings be announced at least one week before such meeting; such announcement must state the time, place, subject matter of such meeting and whether it will be open to the public. Gives jurisdiction to enforce this Act to the United States district courts and authorizes any person to bring a suit to enforce this Act. Sets procedures for the review of agency action by the Court. Allows attorney's fees to be awarded to the party winning a suit brought under this Act. Requires all agencies to report to Congress annually regarding compliance with this Act. States that nothing in this Act authorizes an agency to withhold information it is otherwise required to provide to an individual, the public, or Congress. (Adds 5 U.S.C. 552b) Prohibits ex parte communication with any individual who is or is reasonably expected to be involved in a decision-making proceeding by anyone interested in such proceeding. (Amends 5 U.S.C. 551, 556, and 557) Sets forth conforming amendments. Makes this Act effective 180 days after its enactment."
