    "text": "National Meals-on-Wheels Act - Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to allow States to distribute Federal funds for the establishment of: (1) projects to provide home-delivered meals to qualified homebound elderly persons; (2) an information and referral system for homebound individuals receiving such meals; and (3) an operation to seek volunteer personnel for the delivery of such meals and to compensate such personnel for related transportation expenses. Authorizes the appropriation of specified sums in fiscal years 1977 and 1978 for the purpose of providing home-delivered meals under this Act. Directs the Commissioner of the Administration on Aging to conduct a demonstration project involving at least three States to determine the feasibility of using the meals system designed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for the elderly as a component of, or substitute for, regular nutrition projects assisted under the Older Americans Act of 1965. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary in fiscal year 1977 to carry out this project."
