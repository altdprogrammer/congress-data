Requires that in areas in which the Director of the Census determines that more than 5 percent of the citizens of voting age are of Spanish origin and electoral procedures in the past have been conducted only in the English language, specified alterations in voting qualifications and procedures must take place. States that such procedures shall include the appointment of Federal voting examiners to enforce the guarantees of the fifteenth amendment, and the placement of otherwise qualified but non-English speaking persons on the official lists of eligible voters. Provides judicial procedures for enforcing the provisions of this Act."
