Directs the Administration to conduct a continuing study and evaluation of rape including the adequacy of existing Federal and State laws dealing with rape. Requires a study of the treatment of rape victims. Makes it the duty of the Center to: (1) develop and transmit to Congress annually specific recommendations for legislation dealing with the prevention, control, and treatment of rape; (2) develop guidelines for the operation of projects by private and public agencies dealing with the prevention, control, and treatment of rape; and (3) develop recommendations for legislation which can serve as a model to the States and localities in the reform of existing laws dealing with rape, with the goal of encouraging uniformity in the laws of such States and localities. Directs the Administrator, through the National Center for the Prevention and Control of Rape to make grants to private, nonprofit organizations and public agencies (determined by the Administration to be qualified) for the purpose of conducting model projects designed to prevent or control rape, or treat the victims of rape. Provides that such projects shall include, but not be limited to: (1) special rape investigation units established by State and local police departments; (2) special units for the treatment of rape victims in hospitals; (3) preventive programs, including public education on rape prevention and self-defense courses; and (4) rape crisis centers. Makes it a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment for up to one year, or both, to disclose records maintained under this Act without the consent of the individual to whom the record pertains. Defines the term \"rape\" as including any intentional, nonconsensual, criminal sexual assaults."
