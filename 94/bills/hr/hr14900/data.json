    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Transportation to determine and assign to each bridge located on any Federal-aid highway system a sufficiency rating based on its condition, essentiality for public use, age, inventory and operating ratings, appraisal ratings, and average daily traffic. Requires that the apportionment of funds to States out of the Highway Trust Fund for bridge rehabilitation and repair programs be made on the basis of such sufficiency ratings. Authorizes the Secretary to approve State bridge inspection programs. Limits the Federal share of any State bridge rehabilitation, replacement, or inspection program to 90 percent of its cost. Authorizes appropriations of $125,000,000 for fiscal year 1976; $265,000,000 for fiscal year 1978; and $445,000,000 annually for each of the fiscal years 1979 through 1982 for such projects."
