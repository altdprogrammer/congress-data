Extends such benefits to the dependent spouse and the dependent children of such eligible individuals. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to enter into arrangements with carriers and State agencies to carry out this Act. Stipulates that no health insurance benefits may be provided under this Act after June 30, 1976. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
