    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1976-06-11", 
    "text": "International Contribution, Payments, and Gifts Disclosure Act - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require any issuer of a registered security to submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission information on an annual basis regarding foreign political contributions, payments to employees of foreign governments, and payments to employees of foreign businesses. Requires such issuer to maintain records of such payments for five years. Sets forth penalties of $25,000 fine and imprisonment for not less than one month nor more than two years for knowing failure to file a required statement, filing a false statement, or failure to obtain complete information for such statement, unless prevented by foreign law. Requires that such information be made public unless the President determines that such disclosure will impair United States foreign policy. Requires the Secretary of State to submit an annual foreign policy analysis of the contributions, payments and gift information collected by the Securities and Exchange Commission under this Act, to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the International Relations Committee of the House of Representatives. Directs each company reporting under this Act to disclose aggregate contributions, payments, and gift information in its annual report to shareholders. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to make such contributions, payments, and gifts nondeductible for tax purposes when made by a foreign corporation or a domestic international sales corporation. Requires establishment of an audit committee on the Board of Directors of each company to investigate company operations arising from this Act. Requires such committee to report any investigation to the shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to grant a cause of action to a shareholder for actual damages arising from such contributions, payments, or gifts or failure to comply with this Act. Grants a cause of action to a competitor for actual business damages arising from such contributions, payments, or gifts, if the complaining party has not made such prohibited contributions in a relevant time period. Encourages the President to obtain international agreements for the establishment of standards for international government procurement and sales."
