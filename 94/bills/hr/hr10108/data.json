    "text": "Permanent Tax Reduction Act - Stipulates that no provision of this Act shall take effect unless Congress passes a concurrent resolution providing for a fiscal year budget limitation of $395,000,000,000. Title I: Permanent Reductions in Individual Income Taxes - Increases the personal income tax exemption to $1000 under the Internal Revenue Code. Authorizes a standard deduction of $2,500 for married couples filing a joint return, $1,800 for an unmarried individual, and $1,250 in the case of a married individual filing a separte return. Provides for a permanent reduction in the amount of income tax imposed on married individuals, heads of households, and unmarried individuals. Revises the optional tax tables to include increases in the low-income allowance and permanent reductions in individual income taxes. Title II: Permanent Reductions in Corporate Income Taxes - Provides for a reduction in the corporate tax rates, corporate surtax, and surtax exemption. Title III: Permanent Increase in Investment Credit - Makes permanent the increase in the investment credit under the Internal Revenue Code. Title IV: Incentives for the Expansion of Electric Power Facilities - Increases to 12 percent the investment credit for property used predominantly in the trade or business of furnishing electrical energy (other than property using petroleum or natural gas as its principal fuel.) Eliminates the phase-in of qualified progress expenditure credits for specified electric utility property. Extends until January 1, 1981, the period in which pollution control facilities may qualify for the five year amortization deduction. Authorizes a 5 year amortization deduction for certified fuel conversion electric power generating facilites. Permits taxpayers meeting specified requirements set forth in the Electric Power Facility Construction Incentive Act to depreciate qualified progress expenditures for electric utility property. Sets forth limitations governing such deduction. Exempts dividend reinvestments in the common stock of public electric utilities from taxation. Provides special tax rules for dispositions of utility stocks."
