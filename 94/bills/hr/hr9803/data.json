Rept. 94-885) Provides that State expenditures for day care services under title XX (Grants to States for Services) of the Social Security Act made prior to July 1, 1976, (now February 1, 1976) may be made without regard to staffing standards. Sets forth changes in the limitations, through September 30, 1976, on payments to the States under title XX of the Social Security Act. Requires that such additional funds as are made available by reason of such changes shall be employed, as much as possible, by the States to increase the employment of welfare recipients and other low-income persons in jobs related to the provision of child day care services. States that the percentage of funds provided to States under title XX for other than family planning services shall be increased to 100 percent of total expenditures, through September 30, 1976. Defines \"Federal welfare recipient employment expenses\" for purposes of this Act. Limits the total amount of Federal payments which may be made to any State under title XX. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to determine the additional Federal funds, if any, needed by the States to comply with the child care requirements of title XX, and if such needs equal specified amounts, to increase the amount of the limitation to provide for such additional needs, through fiscal year 1977. Allows an income tax credit, under the Internal Revenue Code, of up to $1,000 per employee who is a Federal welfare recipient hired to perform services for a child day care services provider. Permits, through September 30, 1976, a waiver of day care center staffing requirements in the case of a day care center in which not more than 20 percent of the children are children whose care is being paid for from funds under title XX, subject to specified conditions. Makes permanent the requirements of title XX relating to confidentiality and eligibility of medical and residential care under the program for alcoholics and drug addicts."
