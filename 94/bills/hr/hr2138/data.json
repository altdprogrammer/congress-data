Allows a rebate of any amount paid as a tax or fee on petroleum products which was imposed by the President after January 15, 1975, and before enactment of this Act. States that nothing in this Act shall be deemed to affect the validity of any proclamation or Executive order issued before January 16, 1975, by the President under a specified provision of the Trade Expansion Act. Declares that during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and ending on June 30, 1975, the public debt limit as set forth in the Second Liberty Bond Act shall be temporarily increased to $131,000,000,000."
