Directs him to provide notice and opportunity for a hearing to eligible individuals under such title who disagree with a decision of the Secretary as to eligibility. Authorizes Supplemental Security Income hearing examiners to serve as hearing examiners under titles II, XVI, and XVIII, until December 31, 1978, if the Secretary finds such action will promote the objectives of such titles. Allows 60 days for an individual to request review of a decision regarding his social security or medicare eligibility. Authorizes modification of an agreement with West Virginia to permit policemen and firemen of such State to be covered by title II (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Benefits). Combined Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance-Income Tax Reporting Amendments - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make available information returns filed by employers pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code (reporting wages paid subject to social security taxes) to the Secretary for the purposes of titles II and XI of the Social Security Act. Authorizes the two Secretaries to enter into an agreement for the processing by the Secretary of such information returns. Authorizes payments out of the Trust Fund under title II to the Secretary for such processing purposes. Authorizes appropriation out of the appropriate Trust Funds of such amounts as the Congress deems necessary to pay the costs of administration of titles II, XVI, and XVIII for which the Secretary is responsible and for carrying out his functions relating to the administration of the Internal Revenue Code. Provides that the determination of cost-of-living increases in annual income exempt from social security taxes and of the amount of annual income allowed a beneficiary (before deductions from benefits occur) shall be computed with reference to the average annual wages of all employees. Provides that periodic payments received pursuant to a State program established prior to July 1, 1973, shall not be considered income for purposes of Social Security Insurance or Old Age Assistance if such payments are made by the State of which the individual receiving such payments is a resident, and if eligibility of any individual for such payments is not based on need and is based solely on attainment of age 65 and duration of residence in such State by such individual. Authorizes the quarterly payment to the Government of the Virgin Islands of amounts equal to Internal Revenue collections made with respect to articles produced in the Virgin Islands and transported to the United States."
