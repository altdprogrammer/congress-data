Removes restrictions placed on the Civil Service Commission in defining individual local wage areas for prevailing rate employees who work for the Veterans' Canteen Service of the Veterans' Administration or for a nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the armed forces conducted for the contentment and pleasure of armed forces personnel. Requires that such prevailing rate employees who are working under the same conditions of employment as are prevailing rate employees in Federal agencies in the same local wage area be paid not less than such agency employees."
