States that any person who has been convicted in the United States or elsewhere of any crime of terrorism, or any person against whom there is produced convincing evidence that he has engaged in terroristic activities, shall not be issued a visa to the United States, and shall not be admitted to the United States, or granted citizenship in the United States. States that it shall be unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to send or receive funds, arms, explosives, or any other thing of value outside of the United States to or from any person or group of persons for the purpose of committing any crime of terrorism. Provides that the United States shall have a civil right of action to impose a constructive trust in favor of the United States on proceeds of a violation of any Federal criminal statute. States the circumstances for which such a trust may be imposed, the property to be subject to seizure and forfeiture, and the method or methods by which such property shall be disposed of. Establishes a fine of not more than $10,000, or imprisonment for not more than 10 years, or both, as the penalties for violations of this Act."
