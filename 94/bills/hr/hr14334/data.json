    "text": "Amends provisions of the District of Columbia Code relating to pretrial detention of criminal defendants presently on probation, parole, or mandatory release pending completion of sentence. Limits the application of such provisions to those defendants who are charged with (1) a dangerous crime, (2) a violent crime, or (3) an obstruction or attempted obstruction of justice by threatening or injuring a prospective witness or juror. Extends the maximum detention pending notification to appropriate state or Federal courts, probation, parole, or corrections officials to ten days. Empowers a judicial officer to order that such a defendant be detained until trial upon finding a substantial probability that the defendant committed the offense as charged. Permits institution of pretrial detention hearings in the District of Columbia by a judicial officer on such officer's own initiative."
