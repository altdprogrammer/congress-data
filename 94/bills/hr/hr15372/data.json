Rept. 94-1630) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Federal Communications Commission to promulagate regulations governing the rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments (defined as any attachments on a pole, duct, condit, or other right-of-way owned or controlled by a utility). Allows any State to apply to the Commission to exempt rates, terms and conditions of pole attachments from the authority of the Commission. Requires the Commission to approve such application if it finds that such State's regulations provide reasonable rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments. Increases the amounts of the fines which may be levied against a person who has been determined to have violated the terms of a broadcast license or permit."
