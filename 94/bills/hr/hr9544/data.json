Provides that funds apportioned for the urban transportation assistance program and allocated to an urbanized area having a population of 200,000 or may not be transferred without the approval of the responsible local officials of the urbanized area. Requires that, as soon as practicable after the apportionments for the Federal-aid programs have been made for any fiscal year, the State highway agency of any State and designated recipient of urban transportation assistance program funds shall each submit to the Secretary of Transportation for his approval a program or programs of proposed projects for the utilization of specified funds apportioned to it. Requires that unless otherwise approved by the Secretary of Transportation in the event fees are charged for use of any parking facility constructed with specified Federal funding, the rate thereof shall not be in excess of that required for maintenance and operation of the facility (including compensation to any person operating the facility). Makes specified amendments to title 23 (Highways) of the United States Code."
