Requires the Board to establish a Committee of Advisers on Veterinary Science to consult with the Board with respect to standards or accreditations proposed, established, or revised pursuant to this Act. Title II: Accreditation of Regulated Zoos - Provides that the Board shall establish classification categories and operating standards for zoological facilities subject to this Act. States that the operating standards prescribed pursuant to this Act for each category of facilities subject to this Act shall set forth: (1) the minimum space and accommodations necessary to effect acceptable natural or pseudonatural behavioral adaptation for each species exhibited; (2) the minimum staff of both professional and nonprofessional personnel required to provide for the proper maintenance of the animal inventory; (3) the minimum educational and training requirements for professional and paraprofessional staff personnel; and (4) the recordkeeping and data collection requirements with respect to the animal inventory. States that, if the Board determines on the record after opportunity for agency hearing by the Board that any regulated zoo which applies for accreditation meets the operating standards with respect to the category to which such establishment is classified, the Board shall accredit such establishment; or substantitally meets such operating standards, the Board may provisionally accredit such zoo. Provides that any provisional accreditation granted by the Board shall specify: (1) those operating standards with which the regulated zoo concerned is not in full compliance; (2) what actions such regulated zoo must take in order to achieve full compliance; and (3) those periods of time within which such action must be taken. States that the Board shall revoke the accreditation or provisional accreditation of any regulated zoo if the Board finds on the record after opportunity for agency hearing by the Board that the zoo: (1) will be unable for any reason to continue operation in substantial compliance with the operating standards applicable to it; or (2) has habitually violated operating standards which pertain to the well-being of the animals in its possession. Provides for a civil penalty of $1,000 per day for violation of operating standards by a regulated zoo. Provides criminal penalties for regulated zoos which operate without accreditation. Makes provision for citizen participation by allowing petitions for review of accreditation by interested persons or citizen suits for such review by any person. Title III: Zoo Assistance Programs - Authorizes the making of grants by the Board, within specified percentage limitations, for training of zoo personnel, research, and assistance in meeting operating standards. Authorizes the Board to guarantee loans up to an aggregate amount of $15,000,000 for the purpose of aiding any regulated zoo to construct or rehabilitate zoo structures and installations. Title IV: Funding - Authorizes appropriations for the administration, technical and project assistance, and loan guaranties to carry out the provisions of this Act."
