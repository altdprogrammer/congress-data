    "text": "Removes the exclusion of service performed in the employ of the United States from the definition of the term \"employment\" for purposes of eligibility under the Social Security Act. Permits officers and employees of the Federal Government to elect coverage under the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance of the Social Security Act. Requires a person electing such coverage to file a certificate indicating his election within two years of the enactment of this Act. States that such an election will be irrevocable. Provides an additional filing period of six months, to begin five years after the close of the initial filing period, for those who could have filed within the initial period but did not do so. Requires a person filing a certificate pursuant to this Act to give notice to his employer at or before the time of filing such certificate. States that a certificate filed pursuant to this Act will be effective for the entire calendar quarter and all subsequent calendar quarters. Specifies conditions under which the certificate may be effective up to four calendar quarters immediately preceding the calendar quarter in which it is filed. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations requiring the heads of the various Federal agencies to know which of their employees qualify for elective coverage under this Act, or, in the alternative, to provide for the collection of the tax from a Federal employee electing such coverage, where it is not feasible for the head of the Federal agency or instrumentality involved to do so."
