Provides that the Council shall meet at least semiannually and at such other sessions which the Chairman is hereby authorized to call. Asserts that the Chairman shall call such sessions of the Council as may be necessary or appropriate in order that all of the members of the Council may fully and effectively perform their duties and exercise their powers. Provides that a meeting may be called upon the request of any three members of the Council. Provides that the Council shall consider problems of treatment and correction of persons convicted of offenses against the United States and shall issue guidelines for the operation of the Bureau of Prisons, the Board of Parole, the Youth Division of the Board of Parole, and the Division of Probation of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to improve the administration of criminal justice and assure coordination and integration of policies respecting the disposition, treatment, and correction of all persons convicted of crime, and shall review, evaluate, and issue guidelines concerning correctional personnel standards and training. Title III: Federal Corrections Institute - Establishes a Federal Corrections Institute to provide a coordinating center for the collection and dissemination of useful data regarding the treatment and rehabilitation of criminal offenders and to provide training for representatives of Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers, judges and judicial personnel, probation and parole personnel, correctional personnel, welfare workers, and other persons, including lay personnel, connected with the treatment and rehabilitation of criminal offenders. Authorizes the Institute: (1) to serve as an information bank by collecting systematically the data obtained from studies and research by public and private agencies on criminal behavior and recidivism, including, but not limited to, programs for prevention of crime and recidivism, training of corrections personnel, and rehabilitation and treatment of criminal offenders; (2) to publish data in forms useful to individuals, agencies, and organizations concerned with the treatment and rehabilitation of criminal offenders; (3) to disseminate pertinent data and studies to individuals, agencies, and organizations concerned with prisoners, parolees, probationers, and other criminal offenders; (4) to devise and conduct, in various geographical locations, seminars and workshops providing continuing studes for persons engaged in working directly with prisoners, parolees, probationers, and other criminal offenders; (5) to devise and conduct a training program of short-term instruction in the latest proven-effective methods of treatment and rehabilitation of criminal offenders and prevention of recidivism for law enforcement officers, judges and judicial personnel, probation and parole personnel, correctional personnel, welfare workers, and other persons, including lay personnel, connected with the treatment and rehabilitation of criminal offenders; and (6) to develop technical training teams to aid in the development of training programs within the several States and with the State and local agencies which work directly with prisoners, parolees, probationers, and other offenders. Places the overall supervision with regard to the policy and operations of the Institute in an Advisory Commission. Title IV: Eligibility For Parole; Youth Corrections Act Amendments - Provides that a Federal prisoner, other than a juvenile delinquent or a commited youth offender, wherever confined and serving a definite term or terms of over one hundred and eighty days, whose record shows that he has observed the rules of the institution in which he is confined, may be released on parole at such time as the Board of Parole may determine, except as provided in section 4208 of title 18, United States Code. Provides that a youth offender shall be conditionally released under supervision on or before the expiration of two-thirds of the maximum term authorized by law for the offense or offenses of which he stands convicted and shall be unconditionally discharged on or before the expiration of that maximum term, but in any event the conditional release shall occur within four years from the date of his conviction and the unconditional discharge within six years from the date of his conviction. Title V: Commitment of Dangerous Persons Found Not Guilty By Reason of Insanity - Provides that, whenever any person is found not guilty by reason of insanity at the time of the commission of the offense, the United States attorney, if he has reasonable cause to believe that such person if released unconditionally would constitute a danger to himself or others because of his mental condition, shall move for a judicial determination of the dangerousness of such person in the court in which the criminal proceedings were conducted."
