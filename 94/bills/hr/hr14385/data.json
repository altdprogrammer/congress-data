    "text": "Coal Pipeline Act - Authorizes the exercise of the right of eminent domain by any carrier of coal by coal pipeline who holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Department of the Interior. Stipulates that, before issuance of such certificate, environmental considerations and the need for energy domestically shall be weighed before the Secretary of the Interior makes a finding. Requires that no carrier granted the power of eminent domain under this Act shall transport any coal in which it has any ownership interest. Establishes procedures for making application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity, for antitrust review, and for enforcement under this Act. Imposes a maximum fine of $10,000, six months imprisonment, or both, for the violation of any provision of, or regulation issued pursuant to, this Act."
