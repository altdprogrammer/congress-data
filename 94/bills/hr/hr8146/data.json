    "text": "National Food Stamp Reform Act - Defines the term \"income\" as used in the Food Stamp Act as the monthly gross income of all members of a household, including any in-kind payment, and the total value of any publicly funded assistance payments which supplement food and housing needs. Excludes specified individuals from the definition of \"household. Provides for the distribution of federally donated foods to households upon the request by a political subdivision that such distribution be made to all eligible households in lieu of food stamps. Excludes households from eligibility for food stamps: (1) if the monthly household income exceeds the poverty index level of income established by the Office of Management and Budget; or (2) if the market value of liquid and nonliquid resources of a household consisting of one individual exceeds $1,500 or the resources of a multiple member household exceed $2,250 exclusive of specified resources. Excludes from eligibility households which include an able-bodied adult between the ages of 18 and 65 who is enrolled in an institution of postsecondary education and such enrollment is a substitute for fulltime employment. Declares that a refusal to work at a plant or site because of a strike or other labor dispute shall be deemed a refusal to work which makes the household of the nonworking individual ineligible for food stamps. Rejects as an excuse for refusal to accept work a condition of employment which requires an individual to join, resign from, or refrain from joining any labor organization. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to require each household receiving benefits under this Act to report its income at least once each month. Requires food coupons to be designed with a space for the recipient to sign upon receipt and again at redemption. Requires one member of each eligible household to be issued a photo-identification card with a color photograph of the recipient. States that such card must be presented at redemption at a food store. Sets forth specific instructions to provide control and accountability over the distribution of food coupons to State agencies. Ties the value of the coupon allotment to the overall retail cost-of-living index. States that the \"nutritionally adequate diet\" as used to determine the amount of the coupon allotment shall mean the low-cost food plan developed by the Agricultural Research Service of the Department of Agriculture. Establishes as the charge a household shall pay for its coupon allotment the lesser of: (1) the percentage of its income which would be expended for food by an average household of its size and income range in the same region of the country; or (2) 30 percent. Provides, under the requirements for State plans for the administration of the food stamp program, for closer State supervision of eligibility by households. Requires the State agencies administering the program to conduct nutrition education programs for recipients. States that the United States Postal Service shall serve as a food stamp issuing agency upon the request of a State food stamp administration agency. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to pay the States 100 percent of the costs of providing food stamps to eligible aliens, and 75 percent of the costs of State investigations, prosecutions, collections of claims and other State activities related to retrieving food stamp losses. Provides for payment by the Federal Government to the States of a share of the difference between the face value of the coupon allotment and the amount charged eligible households for the allotment. Sets forth the method of determining and paying the Federal share. Directs the transfer of all functions of the Secretary of Agriculture under the Food Stamp Act to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare."
