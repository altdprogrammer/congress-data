Requires the filing of a Federal estate tax return where the value of the gross estate exceeds $200,000. Allows the executor of an estate which includes an interest in a qualified closely held business which exceeds either 35 percent of the value of the gross estate or 50 percent of the value of the taxable estate, but is less than $300,000 to elect: (1) to pay the estate tax in up to 20 equal annual installments (presently ten); and (2) to defer the payment of the first installment until five years after the filing of the return. Defines the terms used in this Act. Makes technical and conforming amendments."
