    "text": "Cosmetic Act - Provides that manufacturers of Cosmetics shall register with the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. Provides that, as a part of such registration, each manufacturer shall file a statement with the Secretary in such form and detail as the Secretary shall prescribe. Provides that such statement shall include: (1) the name and address of the maufacturer and of any other person whose name will appear on the label or labeling of any cosmetic manufactured by such manufacturer, and the address of each plant in which such cosmetic is manufactured; (2) the name of each cosmetic manufactured by such manufacturer, and the formula of each such cosmetic which shall include the name and quantity of each component of each such cosmetic; (3) a copy of the label and labeling of each cosmetic manufactured by such manufacturer; and (4) a list of the uses of each cosmetic manufactured by such manufacturer which are represented on the label or labeling of each such cosmetic and any other reasonably foreseeable uses of each such cosmetic. Provides that whenever the information contained in a statement filed by a manufacturer under this Act is not accurate and up to date, such manufacturer shall file with the Secretary, within thirty days after such statement is no longer accurate and up to date, such amendment or amendments as may be necessary to make the information contained in such statement accurate and up to date. Provides that no manufacturer of any cosmetic shall sell or offer for sale in the United States any cosmetic unless: (1) such manufacturer, either himself or by contract, tests such cosmetic as provided for in this Act; (2) such manufacturer submits to the Secretary an accurate and complete description of each test conducted concerning such cosmetic and the results of each such test; (3) such manufacturer submits to the Secretary an accurate and complete description of the process used to manufacture and package such cosmetic; and (4) such manufacturer submits to the Secretary a list of the health claims made on the label of such cosmetic or made in any advertising concerning such cosmetic. Requires the Secretary to receive from the manufacturers covered by this Act specified test information concerning their cosmetics. Authorizes the Secretary to require any type and number of tests for any of the above items, and for any other items, which he deems necessary in order to make a determination pursuant to this Act. Provides that each label of each cosmetic offered for sale in the United States shall include the following information: (1) an identification, including the address, of the manufacturer or distributor of such cosmetic; (2) the name of such cosmetic; (3) the name of each ingredient of such cosmetic, except that perfurmes and colorings, may be designated as perfumes and colorings and except that reasonable variations shall be permitted for small packages which shall be established by regulations prescribed by the Secretary; (4) the registration number assigned to the manufacturer of such cosmetic by the Secretary; (5) a list of the use or uses of such cosmetic, as the case may be, together with directions for each such use; and (6) the date after which such cosmetic should not be used because of the fact that any preservative or antibacterial agent which is an ingredient of such cosmetic is no longer effective. Requires cosmetics manufacturers to maintain complaint files and to report on these on a quarterly basis to the Secretary. Provides that each such report shall include the following information: (1) an identification of the person filing such report; and (2) the total number of consumer complaints received during the three-month period covered by such report with respect to each cosmetic manufactured by such person, the nature of each such complaint, the name and address of the person writing each such complaint, and any action taken by the person filing such report with respect to the complaint. Provides that manufacturers required to file such reports shall: (1) preserve any consumer complaint received with respect to any cosmetic manufactured by such person for a period of three years after the close of the three-month period covered by the report based on any such complaint; and (2) upon request of the Secretary, make such complaints available for inspection by the Secretary."
