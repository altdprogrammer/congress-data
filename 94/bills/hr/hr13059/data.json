States that when any Indian dies leaving any land interest not lawfully devised, it shall descend in equal shares to his or her children, and to the issue of any deceased child by right of representation. Specifies that the surviving spouse of any Indian who dies leaving any interest in trust or restricted land within the Umatilla Reservation shall be entitled to one-half of such land. Permits the spouse to elect such an interest whenever any Indian has devised an interest in land by an approved will."
