    "text": "Provides, under the Clean Air Act, that no air pollutant emission standard applicable to new motor vehicle engines which requires a greater reduction in emissions of air pollutants than is required under the regulations applicable to model year 1975 new light-duty motor vehicles or new light-duty motor vehicle engines shall take effect before model year 1982. Directs the appropriate agencies of the executive branch, as designated by the President, to conduct a study to determine: (1) the incremental public health and welfare effects that would result from new motor vehicle and new motor vehicle engine emission control standards for air pollutants which are more stringent than the standards applicable for the 1975 model year; and (2) the implications of implementing such standards. Directs that the findings of such study be reported to Congress not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency by June 30, 1976 and of each year thereafter to: (1) review the rate of development in motor vehicle emission control technology and fuel economy improvement; (2) report to Congress his findings with respect to both the rate of such technological development and the adequacy of developmental efforts by the automotive industry; and (3) recommend to Congress any amendments to the Clean Air Act which enable the achievement of substantially more stringent automotive emission control levels without the imposition of significant fuel economy or cost penalties."
