Increases the additional allowances payable to service-connected disabled veterans with spouses, children, and dependent parents when the veteran is rated 50 percent or more disabled. Increases to $175 (now $150) the clothing allowance payable to any veteran who because of his compensable disability wears or uses a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance, including a wheelchair, which tends to wear out or tear his clothing. =Title II: Survivors Dependency and Indemnity Compensation= - Increases by 12 percent the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) payable to the widows of veterans who died of service-connected causes. Increases the additional monthly allowance payable to a widow receiving DIC for each child under eighteen by 12 percent. Provides additional increases in DIC allowances in designated categories. Directs the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to make a detailed study of claims for dependency and indemnity compensation relating to veterans who at the time of death during the period September 1, 1975, to March 1, 1976, were receiving disability compensation from the Veterans' Administration based upon a rating total and permanent in nature. =Title III: Effective Dates= - Makes the provisions of this Act effective August 1, 1975."
