Requires the inclusion of home health services in a State's medicaid program under the Social Security Act and permits the payments of rent under such program for elderly persons who would otherwise require nursing home care. Provides expanded Federal funding for congregate housing for the displaced and the elderly by increasing the amount available for such housing under the low income housing program. Imposes on individuals receiving payment of expenses under the medicaid program a deduction, cost sharing, or similar charge equal to 5 percent of the taxable income of each adult child of the recipient."
