Rept. 94-1706) Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to refund the tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on distilled spirits, wines, rectified products, and beer previously withdrawn, lost, rendered unmarketable or condemned by a duly authorized official by reason of fire, flood, casualty, or other disaster, or breakage, destruction, or other damage (excluding theft) resulting from vandalism or malicious mischief while held for sale. Requires that claims under this Act be filed within six months of the loss suffered. Disallows, except in cases of major disasters, claims of less than $250. Allows claims to be filed within six months of a presidential declaration of a major disaster, where such disaster caused the losses upon which such claims are based."
