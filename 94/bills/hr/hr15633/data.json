    "text": "Makes funds available to any State which has submitted and received approval of a plan to provide benefits to the spouse or dependents of any eligible rescue squad worker who has died as the direct and proximate result of an injury sustained in the performance of duties. Stipulates that a State plan shall include, among others, the following provisions: (1) financial participation by the State; (2) establishment or designation of a single State agency to administer such plan; and (3) granting an opportunity for a fair hearing to any claimant who is denied benefits. Provides that the agency which administers the State plan may grant, before final action, interim benefit payments upon a determination that benefits will probably be paid (based on the need of the claimant). Directs the Secretary of Commerce to approve any State plan which fulfills the requirements of this Act and to pay each State which has such an approved plan an amount equal to 50 percent of the total amount expended by the State for benefits. Places a limitation upon the amount which the Secretary may pay to any State and provides for an installment payment system of such funds to the States."
