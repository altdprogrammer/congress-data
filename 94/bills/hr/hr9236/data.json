States that law enforcement grants to States may be used for the development, demonstration, evaluation, and purchase of methods and facilities designed to strengthen the court system. Authorizes the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to waive State liability and pursue necessary legal remedies in cases where a State does not have an adequate forum to enforce grant provisions imposing liability with regard to Indian tribes. Permits the Administration to increase the Federal share of grants to Indian tribes or other aboriginal groups where it is determined that sufficient funds are not available to meet the local share of costs. Authorizes the Attorney General to establish an Advisory Board to the Administration to review programs for grants in the areas of law enforcement and criminal justice. Authorizes appropriations of specified sums through fiscal year 1981 to meet the purposes of this Act and of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act."
