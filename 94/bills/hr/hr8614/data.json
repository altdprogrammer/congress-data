    "text": "Unemployment Compensation Amendments - Revises the definition of \"employer\" for purposes of the Federal unemployment compensation law, and provides for more extensive coverage of agricultural employment. Requires labor contractors to pay employment taxes as if they employed the individuals that they furnish to other employers. Extends coverage for unemployment compensation for (1) domestic servants (2) for service performed for non-profit organizations and State and local governments; and (3) citizens of the Virgin Islands. Revises the benefit amount standard of Federal unemployment compensation law to the lesser of one-half of an individual's average weekly pay or two-thirds of the statewide average weekly wage. Provides that, for purposes of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, national \"on\" indicators shall go into effect during the thirteenth consecutive week in which the rate of insured unemployment for all States equalled or exceeded 4.5 percent. Provides that an extended benefit period shall become effective in a State with the third week after a week for which there is, with respect to such State or area, a national, State (4 percent rate of insured unemployment for 13 consecutive weeks) or area \"on\" indicator, as the case may be, and shall last for a period of at least thirteen consecutive weeks. Increases the wage base for computing the Federal unemployment compensation entitlement from $4,200 to $6,000, effective January 1, 1977. Increases the employer's tax rate to 3.35 percent (3.15 percent when all advances to the Extended Unemployment Compensation Account have been repaid). Provides for the proration of costs of claims filed jointly under State and Federal law (by in individual whose base period wages included Federal wages) between a State and the United States. Establishes, and specifies the membership of, a National Commission on Unemployment Insurance to study and evaluate the present unemployment compensation program in order to assess the long-range needs of the program and to develop recommendations for changes in the programs. Directs the Commission to report to the President and the Congress no later than February 1, 1977."
