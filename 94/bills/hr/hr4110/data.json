    "text": "National Primary Election Act - Provides that each State holding a Presidential primary election shall hold such election on: (1) the first Tuesday after the first Monday in April; (2) the third Tuesday in May; or (3) the last Tuesday in June. Provides that each political party shall be eligible for a separate ballot in each State's primary if the elections for candidates for President and Vice President for such party received an aggregate number of votes equal to at least 10 percent of the total number of votes cast throughout the United States for all electors for candidates for President and Vice President in the last presidential election preceding such primary. Prescribes eligibility requirements for voters in such elections. Directs the Federal Election Commission to prepare a list including the name of each person who meets the constitutional qualifications for the President and has general recognition, in the judgment of the Commission, as a candidate for the Presidential nomination of the party of his affiliation. Establishes procedures by which such person may withdraw his name from such list. Provides that any person not designated for placement on primary ballots of such person's party may gain placement on such ballots if that person qualifies in all those States holding primaries on the same day by filing with the appropriate office in each such State. Defines the terms used in the Act and makes technical and conforming amendments."
