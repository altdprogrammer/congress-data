Authorizes any tribe, pursuant to an approved land consolidation plan, to exchange or sell any tribal land or interests in land not needed or suitable for use by the tribe or so situated and located that it would be to the economic or social advantage of the tribe to sell or exchange the property. Permits any Indian tribe, by appropriate action of its governing body, to provide that no undivided fractional interest in trust lands, of an appraised value of $100 or more shall descend by intestacy but shall escheat to the tribe. Authorizes the purchase or exchange of undivided fractional interests in trust lands under specified circumstances. Title II: Tribal Inventory - Directs the Secretary, within 180 days of the enactment of this Act, to submit to the Congress and each Indian tribe a plan for the conduct of resource inventories of land and other natural resources of Indian tribes, and a timetable for carrying out such plan. Specifies that the Secretary shall not conduct any such inventory if the governing body of the tribe has notified the Secretary, in writing, that it does not wish an inventory to be made."
