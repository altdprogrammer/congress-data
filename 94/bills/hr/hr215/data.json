Declares that any order of a State or United States court pertaining to a claim of privilege on the part of a newsman is subject to judicial review. Provides that appeals be heard at the earliest practicable date. States that this Act should not be construed to impair any State law which secures the minimum privileges established by this Act. Provides that the protection afforded by this Act not be available to a defendant in a defamation suit with respect to the source of any allegedly defamatory information which such defendant asserts a defense based on such source. Declares that if any provision of this Act is declared invalid, the remainder shall not be affected thereby."
