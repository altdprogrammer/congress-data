    "date": "1976-05-06", 
    "text": "Title I: Retirement Financing - Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for certain Employees to define terms for purposes of this Act. States that any statute which authorizes liberalized benefits payable from the fund created pursuant to such Act extension of coverage of such Act or increases in salaries, is deemed to authorize appropriations to fund the unfunded liability created by that Act. Authorizes appropriations for purposes of such Act. Title II: Retirement Act Amendments - Makes children for whom a petition for adoption was filed by a participant in such retirement program and who was later adopted by the surviving spouse after the participant's death eligible to receive benefits under such program. Makes the surviving spouse of participants who were married after retirement eligible for survivor's benefits under such Act. Requires a participant who at the time of retirement desires not to have his or her surviving spouse receive an annuity to so state in writing to the Director. States that a surviving spouse acquired after retirement is entitled to a survivor annuity only by electing such annuity instead of any other survivor benefit to which he or she may be entitled to under this or any other retirement system for Government employees. Allows participants in such system who retire unmarried and later marry to elect to receive a reduced annuity under such Act. Sets forth the minimum monthly rate of annuity for a surviving spouse or child. States that retirement for disability or incapacity may only be approved if the application for such retirement is submitted before the applicant is separated from the Agency or within one year thereafter. Extends the period in which a recovered disability annuitant may continue to receive such annuity. Stipulates that if a recovered annuitant has, before reaching age 62, again become totally disabled due to a recurrence of his or her original disability, the terminated disability annuity shall be reinstated. Grants a prior service credit to participants for time spent in service with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or the Public Health Service. Prohibits the recovery of payments made under this Act by the Government if the individual involved is without fault and recovery would be against equity. Authorizes the President, by executive order, to maintain the existing areas of conformity between the Civil Service and Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Systems. Increases the annuity payable from the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund to annuitants and surviving spouses of annuitants which is based on a separation occurring prior to October 20, 1969."
