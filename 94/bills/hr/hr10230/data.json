Rept. 94-1046) National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act - =Title I: National Science Engineering, and Technology Policy and Priorities= - Declares it to be the national policy that the Federal investment in science and technology must be addressed to the priority needs of the Nation, including: (1) promoting conservation and efficient utilization of natural and human resources; (2) protecting the oceans and coastal zones; (3) strengthening the economy and promoting full employment; (4) assuring adequate supplies of food, materials, and energy; (5) improving the quality of health care; and (6) improving the nation's housing, transportation, and communication systems. Declares that the United States shall adhere to a national policy for science and technology which includes the following principles: (1) the continuing development and implementation of a national strategy for determining and achieving the appropriate scope, level, direction, and extent of scientific and technological efforts based upon a continuous appraisal of the role of science and technology in achieving goals and formulating policies of the United States; (2) the enlistment of science and technology to foster a healthy economy in which the directions of growth and innovation are compatible with the prudent and frugal use of resources and with the preservation of a benign environment; and (3) the development and maintenance of a solid base for science and technology in the United States. States the declaration of Congress that the Federal Government should maintain central policy-planning elements in the executive branch in mobilizing resources for essential science and technology programs, in securing appropriate funding for those programs, and to review systematically Federal science policy and programs and to recommend legislative amendments when needed. States that, in order to expedite and facilitate the implementation of the policy enunciated in this Act, the following coordinate procedures are of paramount importance: (1) Federal procurement policy should encourage the use of science and technology to foster frugal use of materials, energy, and appropriated funds; to assure quality environment; and to enhance product performance; (2) explicit criteria, including cost-effectiveness principles where feasible, should be developed to identify the kinds of science and technology programs that are appropriate for Federal funding support and to determine the extent of such support; and (3) Federal promotion of science and technology should maximize quality of research, stability of scientific and technological institutions, and, for urgent tasks, timeliness of results. =Title II: Office of Science and Technology Policy= - Presidential Science and Technology Advisory Organization Act - Establishes in the Executive Office of the President the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Provides for the appointment of a Director, four Associate Directors, and other personnel.
