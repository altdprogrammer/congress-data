Declares all unemployed individuals who (1) are entitled to receive State or Federal unemployment benefits and (2) would, if their employment had not been discontinued, be covered under an employer-sponsored health insurance plan to be eligible for health insurance benefits of the type provided by their previous employer. Extends such benefits to the dependent spouse and the dependent children of such eligible individuals.
