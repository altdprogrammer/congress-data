    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1975-05-22", 
    "text": "Title I: Equal Rights for Women Act - Proposes to eliminate sex discrimination in public accomodations by requiring, under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, that all persons be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services and facilities of places of public accomodation without discrimination or segregation on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin, regardless of whether or not such discrimination is required by State laws, or ordinances. Extends the Attorney General's authority under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by authorizing him to institute suits for the elimination of discrimination on the basis of sex in public facilities and in public education. Provides, under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, that no person in the United States shall on the ground of sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program receiving Federal financial assistance. Forbids any Federal agency to adopt regulations or policies concerning employment rights, promotions, benefits or privileges as applicable to an employee of one sex without equal application to employees of the other sex. Remodels the enforcement provisions under which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission operates. Title II: Discrimination in Military and Veterans' Affairs - Provides that insofar as the members and veterans of the armed services are concerned, there may not be established any requirement with respect to dependency of a spouse of a female or member or veteran of an armed force or for purposes of entitlement to rights privileges or benefits, which is not provided for by law with respect to the spouse of a male member of veteran of an armed force. Title III: Social Security Act Amendments - Extends eligibility for husband's insurance benefits to husbands who are under 62 years of age. Removes the requirement that to receive such benefits a husband would have had to have received one half of his support from his wife. Lowers to 60, or 50 in the case of a disabled person, the age at which widower's insurance benefits under the Social Security Act may br received. Removes the requirement that in order to receive such widower's benefits the widower must have been receiving at least one half of his support from his deceased wife. Entitles fathers to the same benefits received under the \"mother's insurance benefits\" provisions of the Social Security Act by granting such benefits to the widower of an insured individual if he has in his care the child of a deceased insured individual. Provides for the payment of Old-Age, Survivors and Disability primary insurance benefits on the bases of the combined earnings record of a husband and wife. Title IV: Study and Review of Sex Discrimination - Authorizes Federal grants to State commissions created to study the denial of equal protection of the State laws to women, private discrimination against women or affirmative steps necessary to insure equality of opportunity to women. Authorizes to be appropriated $2,000,000 for the purpose of making such grants. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to submit to Congress recommendations for legislation: (1) to provide equitable retirement benefits to families with working wives under the Social Security Act and the Civil Service Retirement Act; (2) to improve child care services; and (3) to permit income tax deductions for expenses incurred for the care of children of disabled children. Requires the Commissioner of Education to conduct a survey of the educational institutions throughout the country in order to determine the extent to which equality of educational opportunity is being denied to citizens of the United States by reason of sex and to submit to Congress the results of his survey along with recommendations for legislation to guarantee equality of educational opportunity between the sexes."
