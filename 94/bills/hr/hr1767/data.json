Provides that the suspension of Presidential authority to adjust petroleum imports will cease if at any time during the 90-day period war is declared, a national emergency occurs, or situations involving the commitment of United States Armed Forces arise. Provides that this Act shall not affect the import license fee system on petroleum and petroleum products which was in effect on January 15, 1975. Provides for an increase of the present temporary public debt limitation by $131,000,000,000 through June 30, 1975."
