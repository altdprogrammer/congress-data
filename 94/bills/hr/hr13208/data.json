    "text": "Child Nutrition Reform Act - Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 1977 and subsequent fiscal years to enable the Secretary of Agriculture to provide grants to States pursuant to this Act. Stipulates that, in lieu of funds appropriated from the fund in the Treasury, the Secretary may use funds appropriated for the program of encouragement of exportation and domestic consumption of agricultural products. Directs the Secretary to allocate an amount for use in each State for each fiscal year equal to one-third the cost of the recommended dietary allowances of each needy child. States that for children aged five through 17, the allotment shall be for 225 days of each year. Specifies the dollar amount of the daily contribution for each child in fiscal year 1977. Authorizes the Secretary to make a distribution of surplus food in lieu of a cash payment, or as a supplement thereto. Directs the States to use the funds made available to them under this Act by: (1) disbursing them to schools, institutions, or other persons to enable such schools, institutions, or other persons to finance the cost of providing meals in accordance with this Act; (2) providing food and services to schools, institutions, or other persons to enable them to provide meals in accordance with this Act; or (3) providing meals directly to children. Stipulates that of the total funds made available to any State for the purposes of this Act for any fiscal year, the State may use up to one percent or $75,000, whichever is greater, for its administrative costs in the conduct of food service programs under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to make payments to private schools and institutions or other persons which may not receive such payments under State laws. Requires each State, in order to qualify for participation in the program, to prepare annually a plan of operation for the conduct of the program. Specifies information which must be included in such plan, including the relationship of the plan under this Act with other State plans for similar federally-assisted programs. Sets forth procedures to be followed by the States in preparing such plans of operation. Directs each participating State to establish procedures for the continuing determination, by a State agency independent of the agency administering the program, of the State's compliance with its plan of operation. Prohibits the payment of funds to any State which fails to comply with its plan. Requires each State receiving funds under this Act to provide for: (1) an annual audit of expenditures; (2) an annual evaluation of the implementation of the State's plan of operation and any amendment thereto; and (3) an annual report of that audit and evaluation, describing the activities of the State under that plan, and including such additional information as the Secretary may prescribe. Requires the States to provide access to any program-related State books and records to the Secretary, Comptroller General, or other Federal authority. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a committee known as the National Advisory Committee on Child Food Assistance for the purpose of studying the administration of programs carried out under this Act and advising the Secretary thereon. Defines the terms used in this Act. Repeals the National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966."
