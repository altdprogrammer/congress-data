    "text": "Prohibits a petroleum refiner or distributor from cancelling, failing to renew, or otherwise terminating a franchise unless notification in writing is furnished to each affected distributor or retailer by certified mail not less than 90 days prior to the date on which such franchise will be canceled, together with a statement of the reasons for such cancellation and the remedies available to the distributor or retailer. Stipulates that a petroleum refiner shall not cancel, fail to renew, or otherwise terminate a franchise unless the retailer or distributor whose franchise is terminated failed to comply substantially with any essential and reasonable requirement of such franchise or failed to act in good faith in carrying out the terms of such franchise. Stipulates that if a refiner or distributor engages in conduct prohibited under this Act, a retailer or distributor may maintain a suit against such refiner or distributor in the United States District Court. Authorizes the Court to grant equitable relief as is necessary to remedy the effects of conduct prohibited by this Act."
