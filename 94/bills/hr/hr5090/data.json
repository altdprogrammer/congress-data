Rept. 94-479) Establishes guidelines for the distribution of funds appropriated by the Act of July 1, 1973 to pay judgments in favor of the Cowlitz Tribe of Indians by the Indian Claims Commission. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to prepare a list of persons eligible for such funds. Provides that funds shall be distributed per capita to those eligible for enrollment. States that the distributions under this Act shall not be subject to Federal or State taxes nor considered as income so as to diminish the recipients' rights to benefits under the Social Security Act or any Federal or federally-assisted program. Authorizes the Secretary to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
