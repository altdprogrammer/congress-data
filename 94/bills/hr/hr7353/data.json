Establishes a United States Metric Board to implement the policy set out in this Act. Directs the Board to: (1) consult with and take suggestions from various groups regarding the conversion; (2) encourage activities of standardization organizations to develop or revise as rapidly as practicable engineering standards to a metric measurement basis; and (3) assist the public, through information and education programs, to become familiar with the meaning and applicability of metric terms and measure in daily life. Lists the powers of the Board, including the powers to accept gifts and to employ staff. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
