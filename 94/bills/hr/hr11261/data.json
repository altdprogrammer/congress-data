    "text": "Establishes a 25-member Virgin Islands Immigration Commission, one member to be the Attorney General or his designee, who shall serve as Chairman. Includes 19 members representing the United States Government, the Governor of the Virgin Islands or his designee, and five members from the general Virgin Islands public, to be balanced in terms of political party affiliation. Directs the Chairman to call an organizational meeting as soon as possible after a majority (constituting a quorum) of Commission members have been appointed. Provides that Commission members who are not officials or employees of the U.S. Government shall be paid $100 per diem and actual travel and reasonable subsistence expenses while engaged in Commission business. Authorizes the Commission to appoint and fix the compensation of whatever personnel are necessary to carry out this Act. Directs the Commission to call upon any Federal department or agency to furnish necessary information and assistance. Provides that, upon application, the Commission shall review on a case-by-case basis the status, circumstances, and character of aliens residing in the Virgin Islands who were admitted as non-immigrant aliens on or before May 12, 1970, under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Instructs the Commission to recommend to the Attorney General that the status of such aliens, their spouses, and their minor children be adjusted to that of aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Requires such recommendations within two years of the first organizational meeting and sets forth the following criteria to determine whether individuals qualify for an adjustment of their status: (1) the extent to which the alien has relatives abroad or relatives who are U.S. citizens; (2) the length of residence in the Virgin Islands; (3) economic and political conditions in the country of nationality; (4) the alien's business, occupational, financial, and marital status; (5) his age and health; (6) his employment record; (7) his contribution to and position in the community; and (8) the extent to which deportation would result in unusual hardship. Provides that aliens receiving favorable recommendations have their status adjusted except under specified circumstances. Terminates the Commission two years and three months after the first organizational meeting. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as are necessary to carry out this Act."
