    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Ways and Means with amendment, H. Rept. 94-368) Provides for a suspension of specified requirements for child-support payments to States under title IV (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of the Social Security Act until January 1, 1977, in the case of States making good faith efforts to comply with such requirements. Prevents decreases in grants to eligible families because of payment of support directly to the State. Requires implementation of procedures to safeguard information concerning applicants or recipients of aid under federally assisted State programs. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to provide for the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare the address of a parent not making child support payments (but receiving funds for such payments under the Social Security Act) from the master files of the Internal Revenue Service. Eliminates the present authority of the Internal Revenue Service to collect child support obligations. Provides that the requirement, under the Social Security Act, that an applicant or recipient of aid to families with dependent children cooperate with the State in establishing paternity and in obtaining support or other payments due with respect to a child will not apply where: (1) the applicant or recipient has good cause for refusing to cooperate, as determined by the State agency in accordance with standards which are to be prescribed by the Secretary and which must take into consideration the best interests of such child; and (2) the State agency administering the AFDC plan finds, in accordance with the standards prescribed by the Secretary, that it is against the child's best interests to do so. Expands the category of individuals who are not counted in computing the 10 percent limit on those receiving protective payments to include individuals to whom the State is required to provide aid in the form of protective payments because there has been a failure to cooperate in the establishment of paternity or the collection of child support. Changes provisions of the Social Security Act providing for Federal payments to States for expenses incurred in carrying out their child support programs to establish a procedure for making such payments in the form of quarterly advances."
