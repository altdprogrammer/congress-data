Requires the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to report to the Congress the control and target levels which should be prescribed. Permits the Administrator to waive the requirements and prohibitions of this Act if he determines that there is no significant risk to the public health. Permits the Administrator to establish target and control levels. Establishes a target level of 1 percent and a control level of fifty thousand tons per year in the absence of any set by the Administrator. Requires the Administrator to arrange for the issuance of licenses to regulate chlorofluoromethane. Prohibits the violation of the terms of any license, the manufacture, importation, the introduction into commerce of chlorofluoromethane, or the unreasonable stockpiling of chlorofluoromethane. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1975-1977 to carry out the purposes of this Act."
