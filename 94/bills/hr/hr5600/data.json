Exempts a regularly scheduled program with respect to which the content, format, and participants are determined by a licensee or a radio or television network, and which is devoted to exploring contrasting views on current issues of public importance in a manner not designed to benefit any candidate for public office from such requirements. Provides that whenever a broadcast license permits the President of the United States to use a broadcasting station for purposes of taking a partisan position on a controversial issue of public importance, the licensee shall afford equal opportunities in the use of such broadcasting station to a spokesman of the other political party."
