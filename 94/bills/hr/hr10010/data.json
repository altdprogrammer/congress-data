    "date": "1975-10-03", 
    "text": "Revises the eligibility requirements for participation in the food stamp program by requiring that such standards prescribe schedules specifying the amount to be paid by households of different sizes on the basis of the net income and assets of each such household. Requires that such income and assets be adjusted semiannually to reflect any changes in cost of living during the preceding six-month period. Authorizes a standard deduction of $120 in determining eligibility, plus an additional deduction of $60 in the case of any household with one or more persons sixty years of age or older. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to prescribe a single form for eligibility certification of participants in the food stamp program, the supplemental security income program, the aid to families with dependent children program, and the old age, survivors, and disability insurance program under the Social Security Act. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to cooperatively formulate a proposal for a cooperative nutritional status monitoring system, and submit recommendations for such legislation as may be necessary to carry out such proposal. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out experimental simplified eligibility certification procedures and to establish a realistic set of goals to improve quality control and administrative efficiency under this Act. Specifies that each State must develop and submit to the Secretary a State quality control plan which shall specify the actions such State proposes to take in order to meet the error tolerance goals established by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to withhold funds from States which fail to carry out the quality control plan approved for such State. Requires the Secretary to prepare and submit to the Congress annually an evaluation plan and a report on the food stamp program."
