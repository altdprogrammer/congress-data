    "text": "Speedy Trial Act - Title I: Speedy Trial in United States Courts - Sets forth the time limits and periods of necessary delay to be excluded in computing the time in which a trial must commence under such time limits for defendants charged with offences against the United States. Requires the dismissal of charges against a defendant who is not brought to trial as required under this title, on motion of the defendant or on the court's own motion. Sets forth time limits pertaining to specified pretrial motions which must be made within thirty days of arrest, summons, or charge of the defendant by the United States. States that where an extreme backlog and practical difficulty would prevent a particular district court from implementing the provisions of this Act without serious detriment to the ability of that court to bring charged defendants to trial, such court may apply to the Judicial Conference of the United States for postponement of the effective date for up to an additional six months. Authorizes the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to make emergency payments in exceptional cases to those district courts which require immediate funds to implement the provisions of this Act without reducing the quality of justice in the district. Title II: Speedy Trial in State Courts - Provides that no State shall receive any funds under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 if the Administrator of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration finds that such State has not adopted a rule of law that any trial arising out of any arrests, indictments, or information shall be commenced within sixty days of the defendant's arrest or summons, or charge by indictment or information, whichever is earlier, and that, if such trial is not so commenced, the charges against the defendant arising out of such arrest, indictment, or information shall be dismissed with prejudice. Provides that, in the case of a State's inability to meet such requirements, the Administrator may grant an extension of the applicable date of the eligibility requirement, not to exceed a total of two additional years, if he finds that the State or locality has been making a good faith effort to comply with such requirements. Provides that the Administrator is authorized to establish model timetables, provide technical assistance, disseminate information, and generally aid States in planning to comply with the eligibility requirements of this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated $10,000,000 annually for such purpose. Title III: Pretrial Services Officers - Provides that any court having original jurisdiction to try offenses against the United States may appoint one or more suitable persons to serve as pretrial services officers who shall also serve as probation officers and shall have the full range of duties of probation officers. Provides that the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall have general supervisory powers over such pretrial services officers, including the duty to annually report on their effectiveness and to recommend necessary modification of the program."
