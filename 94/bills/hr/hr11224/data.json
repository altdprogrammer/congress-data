Makes it the purpose of this Act to reduce the payments made by the United States to the United Nations. Directs the attention of the United Nations to the recently acquired wealth of the oil-producing nations in its determination of assessment shares. Limits to one-sixth of the total United Nations assessment for each year the amount paid by the United States. Exempts from such limitation the payments made to the International Atomic Energy Agency and the joint financing program of the International Civil Aviation Organization."
