Directs the Secretary to continue the statistical classification of farms which was in effect on January 1, 1975, until June 30, 1976. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to collect information on agriculture, irrigation, and drainage on a sample basis, which is comparable to the information previously collected every five years in the agriculutral census. Allows the Secretary, when sampling methods would be inappropriate, to use other statistical methods to collect information relating to the classification of farms. (Amends 13 U.S.C. 142)"
