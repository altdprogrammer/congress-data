Extends the coverage of such Act to include heritage. Prohibits voting tests or devices. Permits a Federal court to award the prevailing party in any action to enforce the voting guarantees of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment reasonable attorney's fees. Requires the Director of the Census to compile registration and voting statistics in every State and political subdivision: (1) subject to the enforcement provisions of such Act; and (2) designated by the United States Commission on Civil Rights."
