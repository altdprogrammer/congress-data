    "text": "Open Dating Perishable Food Act - Provides under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, that no person who manufactures or packages a perishable or semiperishable food in the form in which it is sold by retail distributors to consumers may distribute for purposes of sale a perishable or semiperishable food packaged by him in such form unless he has labeled such packages to show the pull date for such food and the optimum temperature and humidity conditions for its storage by the ultimate consumer. Provides, with certain exceptions, that no person engaged in business as a retail distributor may sell, offer to sell, or display for sale any such food whose pull date, as specified on its packages label, has expired. States that no person engaged in the business of manufacturing, processing, packaging, or distributing perishable or semiperishable foods may place packages on such foods in shipping containers or wrappings unless such containers or wrappings are labeled by him to show the pull date on the labels of such packages. Provides that no person may change, alter, deface or remove before the sale of a packaged perishable or semiperishable food to the ultimate consumer any pull date required by this Act to be placed on the label of such food's package or shipping container or wrapping. States that any person who violates any provision of this Act shall be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined not more than $5,000, or both. Provides that if any person commits such a violation after a conviction of him under this part has become final, or commits such a violation with the intent to defraud or mislead, such person shall be imprisoned for not more than three years or fined not more than $25,000, or both. Provides that the United States district courts shall have jurisdiction to restrain violations of this Act. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to submit an annual report to the Congress concerning the enforcement of this Act."
