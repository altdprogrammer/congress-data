Provides that a manufacturer's duty to notify buyers of defects in a boat or associated equipment shall be limited to defects or failures of compliance discovered within five years from the date of certification or, in the absence of a certification date, within five years of the date of manufacture. Authorizes the Secretary to establish procedures to be followed by dealers and distributors in assisting manufacturers in obtaining information on defects for failures of compliance by boats or associated equipment. Requires that fees charged by States in connection with vessel numbering shall apply equally to residents and nonresidents of a State. Provides that Federal funds allocated to a State in any fiscal year may not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of that State's boating safety program for that year."
