    "date": "1975-05-21", 
    "text": "Expresses the findings of Congress: (1) that various Federal programs have significant impact on the economic development of rural areas; (2) that the economic development of many areas is handicapped because local leaders are unaware of Federal and State resources available to them; (3) that demonstration projects known as Concerted Services in Training and Education have proved effective in coordinating development efforts for local governments; and (4) a high level Federal task force is required to coordinate Federal rural development efforts. Establishes under the Rural Development Act within the Department of Agriculture the Concerted Services in Training and Education Task Force. Designates as members of the task force the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Rural Development or his designee and one member each from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Department of Labor. Establishes a five-member advisory committee to consult with and advise the task force. Sets forth as the functions of the task force: (1) the assessment of the problems relative to rural economic development; (2) the assessment of resources and requirements of the Nation in this area and the impact of Federal programs thereon; and (3) the establishment of rural development goals. Directs the task force in carrying out such functions to develop new and continue existing demonstration programs to: (1) facilitate the concentration of efforts of all departments and agencies on the solution of rural occupational education; (2) identify employment for unemployed individuals and for those whose income cannot maintain a respectable standard of living; (3) develop ways through which rural communities can provide employment-related educational service; (4) demonstrate the effectiveness of education in increasing employment opportunities; (5) demonstrate the effectiveness of local involvement in occupational education in developing community leadership; and (6) evaluate the relationship of present community education programs to occupational patterns and recommend necessary adjustments. Sets forth as additional functions of the task force: (1) the evaluation and the approval of applications for demonstration projects for State and local agencies; (2) the evaluation of such projects; and (3) the coordination among the Federal agencies of efforts to find solutions to problems in local programs. Authorizes the appropriation of $4,500,000 to carry out the provisions of this Act for fiscal year 1976. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, in carrying out the provisions of this Act, to provide funds for the three permanent task force members for travel expenses and administrative costs."
