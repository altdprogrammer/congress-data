    "text": "Government Facilities and Open Housing Act - Declares it to be the purpose of this Act: (1) to require Federal agencies and Federal contractors to assure that an adequate supply of housing for middle and lower income employees will be available in any community in which a Government facility is to be located; and (2) to provide financial assistance to communities to assist them in meeting the requirements of this Act. Provides that, after January 1, 1976, no Government facility may be located in any community which has failed to develop an acceptable plan which provides, as determined by the Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an adequate supply of housing for middle and lower income employees of that facility. Directs each Government agency or Federal contractor, prior to initiating location procedures, to require written assurances in the form of a plan that the appropriate government body will meet the requirements of this Act. Provides that, if after the acceptance of the plan, by the Chairman, any community fails to comply with the provisions of the plan, the Chairman shall bring a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to secure an injunction to require such community to conform to its plan. Provides that, whenever a community does not file a plan or is found to be in noncompliance with an approved plan, and there are compelling reasons for the Government contractor facility to locate in that community, the Federal Government shall provide housing to meet the needs of current and potential middle and lower income employees. States that, upon application meeting such standards as the Chairman may establish, the Chairman shall grant to each community an amount not to exceed $150,000 to reimburse such community for the expense of developing a plan meeting the requirements of this Act. Directs the Commissioner of Education to pay to the local educational agency for each community in which moderate and lower income housing has been constructed pursuant to this Act, a sum to be computed by him in consultation with the State educational agency and the local educational agency. Authorizes to be appropriated for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1975, and the four fiscal years thereafter, sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
