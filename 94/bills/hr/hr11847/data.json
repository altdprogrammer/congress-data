    "text": "Humane Methods of Slaughter Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to appoint inspectors to examine the method by which cattle, sheep and other equines are slaughtered and handled in the slaughtering establishments inspected under the Federal Meat Inspection Act. Directs such inspectors to label as \"Inspected and Condemned\" all carcasses of animals which were not slaughtered by a humane method. Forbids the importation of meat into the United States unless the livestock from which it was produced was slaughtered by a humane method. Allows the Secretary to waive such requirement for a period not to exceed one year if such a waiver is necessary to avoid severe administrative, financial or other hardships."
