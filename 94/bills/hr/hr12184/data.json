    "text": "Requires trials of defendants charged with an offense involving the use of firearms to be commenced within 60 days of defendant's arrest or the filing of an information or indictment. Excludes specified periods of necessary delay from calculation of the time in which the trial must begin. Requires dismissal of the information or indictment if a defendant, through no fault of his own, is not brought to trial as required by this Act. Requires pretrial motions, with specified exceptions, to be made within 30 days of the defendant's arrest, summons, or charge, whichever occurs first. Allows the Judicial Conference of the United States to grant a six-month postponement of the effective date of these provisions to applying courts with extreme backlogs. (Adds 18 U.S.C. 3161-3)."
