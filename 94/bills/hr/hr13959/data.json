Requires that to the maximum extent feasible programs conducted under this Act be linked to work and training programs conducted pursuant to the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973. States that assistance shall be provided, to the maximum extent feasible, for a minimum period of three years. Requires the Director of the Office to conduct necessary studies to assess the effectiveness of the programs and to keep appropriate Congressional committees fully informed. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor, under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, to provide financial assistance in urban and rural areas with large concentrations of unemployed and low-income persons for comprehensive work and training programs and necessary supportive and followup services. Authorizes appropriations of sums necessary to carry out this Act."
