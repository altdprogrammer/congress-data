Prescribes remedies for such violations. Entitles a mortgagor of a second mortgage to retain funds obtained under the mortgage without obligation to repay on or after the date of any violation. Prohibits any real estate broker (other than the mortgagor) who has arranged a second mortgage which is secured by residential real property to acquire, directly or indirectly, such property (or proceeds resulting from its disposition) at a foreclosure sale or auction of such property. Imposes a fine of up to $10,000 for such violation."
