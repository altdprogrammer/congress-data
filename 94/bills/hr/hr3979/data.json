Rept. 94-360) Authorizes appropriations of $1,500,000 to carry out the provisions of the Indian Claims Commission Act during fiscal year 1976. Extends the life of the Indian Claims Commission for three additional years, until April 10, 1980. Provides that if the Commission is of the opinion that a pending case cannot be finally adjudicated or comprimised prior to April 10, 1980, it shall certify the case to the Court of Claims subject to the approval of such Court. Directs that any case still pending on April 10, 1980 be transfered to the Court of Claims. Provides that instead of annual reports to the Congress the Commission shall semi-annually submit a report on the progress and status of all remaining cases, along with a projected completion date for each case."
