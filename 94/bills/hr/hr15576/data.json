Requires sprinkler systems for such facilities in any program under the jurisdiction of the Veterans' Administration. Allows the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to waive this requirement only when the installation of complete sprinkler systems would constitute an unreasonable hardship. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans to such facilities to assist them in financing part or all of the cost of purchasing and installing automatic sprinkler systems. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants for such installation under specified circumstances."
