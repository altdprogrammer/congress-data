Requires that data most recently produced and published shall be used in the administration of any law of the United States in which population is used to determine the amount of benefit received by State and local units of general purpose government (other than laws relating to the apportionment of U.S. Representatives). Directs the Secretary and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to jointly initiate the development of uniform methods and procedures in producing statistical information used in effecting the delivery of Federal benefits to State and local governments and report progress toward the development of such procedures not later than one year after enactment of this Act. Specifies that this Act does not limit the present authority of the Office of Management and Budget to develop statistical standards. (Amends 13 U.S.C. 181; Adds 13 U.S.C. 182, 183, 184)"
