Defines evacuation as the removal to places of safety as expeditiously as possible, without the use of military force, if possible, but should it become necessary and essential, with the minimum use of necessary force, the following categories of persons: (1) American citizens; (2) dependents of American citizens and of permanent residents of the United States; (3) Vietnamese nationals eligible for immigration to the United States by reason of their relationships to American citizens; and (4) such other foreign nationals to whose lives a direct and imminent threat exists. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to abrogate any of the provisions of the War Powers Resolution."
