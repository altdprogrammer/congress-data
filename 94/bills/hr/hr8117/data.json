    "text": "Small Business Petroleum and Petrochemical Marketers Protection Act - Declares it to be the policy of this Act to eliminate in industries engaged in commerce or in the production, refining, processing, manufacturing, and distribution of petroleum and petroleum products those marketing conditions detrimental to the maintenance of a free and competitive environment. Defines terms used in the Act. Makes it unlawful for persons engaged in commerce or in activities affecting commerce in the refining of petroleum products, to acquire, operate, or control any wholesale or retail outlet for the marketing of petroleum products within time limits established by the Act. Makes it unlawful for persons so engaged to engage in petroleum or petrochemical marketing, either directly or indirectly, after three years from the effective date of this Act. Empowers the Small Business Administration to make loans of up to $350,000 to assist small businesses which have been adversely affected by a change in petroleum or petrochemical marketing effected to achieve compliance with this Act by a refiner who supplies petroleum or petrochemical products to such small businesses. Authorizes to be appropriated $1,000,000 to the business loan and investment fund established by the Small Business Act for the purpose of making such loans."
