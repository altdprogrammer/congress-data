Provides that the committee shall conduct public hearings at any place with power to subpena records to investigate discrimination against Asian Americans; examine for, resolve, and correct any injustices and discrimination against Asian Americans in their respective departments; and foster such surveys, studies, research, and demonstration and technical assistance projects, establish such relationship with State and local governments and the private sector, and promote such participation of State and local governments and the private sector as may be appropriate to identify and assist in solving the special problems of Asian Americans as a whole or as individual Asian American ethnic, cultural, or nationality groups. Gives the Advisory Council cease and desist powers to enforce its finding of discriminatory practices against Asian Americans.
