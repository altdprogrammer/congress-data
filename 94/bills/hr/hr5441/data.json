Authorizes to be appropriated $1,000,000 for the fiscal year 1975 for grants under this section. States that the Secretary may make grants to cities with populations exceeding ten thousand and park districts to pay 75 percent of the annual salaries of urban foresters. Authorizes to be appropriated $5,000,000 for the fiscal year 1975 for grants under this section. Directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance to cities and park districts to assist such cities in planning, developing, and administering forestry programs."
