Rept. 94-1176) National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act - Authorizes appropriations to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for research and development, construction of facilities, and research and program management. Permits appropriations for research and development to be used: (1) for any items of a capital nature (other than acquisition of land) which may be required at locations other than NASA installations for the performance of research and development contracts; and (2) for grants to nonprofit institutions of higher education, or to nonprofit organizations whose primary purpose is the conduct of scientific research, for purchase or construction of additional research facilities. Provides that when so specified in an appropriation Act any amount appropriated for \"Research and development\" or for \"Construction of facilities\" may remain available without fiscal year limitation. Permits the funds for construction of any of specified facilities: (1) in the discretion of the NASA Administrator or his designee, to be varied upward ten percent; or (2) following a report by the Administrator or his designee to the Committee on Science and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences of the Senate on the circumstances of such action, to be varied upward 25 percent to meet unusual cost variations, but the total cost of all construction work shall not exceed the total of the amounts specified. Permits one-half of one percent of the funds appropriated for research and development to be transferred to the \"Construction of facilities\" appropriation, and, when so transferred, together with $10,000,000 of the funds appropriated for construction of facilities, to be available for expenditure to construct, expand, or modify laboratories and other installations. Disallows any amount appropriated pursuant to this Act from being used for any program deleted by the Congress from requests as originally made to either the House Committee on Science and Technology or the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Disallows any amounts appropriated pursuant to this Act from being used for any program in excess of the amount actually authorized for that particular program for research and development or research and program management; and disallows any amount from being used for any program which has not been presented to or requested of such committees, unless: (1) a period of 30 days has passed after the receipt by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate and each such committee of notice given by the Administrator or his designee containing a full and complete statement of the action proposed to be taken and the facts and circumstances relied upon in support of such proposed action, or (2) each such committee before the expiration of such period has transmitted to the Administrator written notice to the effect that such committee has no obligation to the proposed action. Expresses the sense of the Congress that it is in the national interest that consideration be given to geographical distribution of Federal research funds whenever feasible, and that NASA should explore ways and means of distributing its research and development funds whenever feasible. Authorizes NASA, if authorized in an appropriation Act, to enter into a contract for tracking and data relay satellite services."
