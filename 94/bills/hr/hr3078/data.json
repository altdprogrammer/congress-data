    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs with amendment, H. Rept. 94-1568) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire the lands, waters and interests to the 48-mile segment of the Chattahoochee River in Georgia. Provides that such area be set aside to establish the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area. Directs the Secretary to allow owners of land, within the recreation area, used for noncommercial residential or agricultural purposes to retain such land for a definite term not to exceed 25 years. Directs the Secretary to administer, protest, and develop the recreation area in accordance with the Atlanta Regional Commission Chattahoochee Corridor Study. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with the State or its political subdivisions whereby he may assist in the planning for and interpretation of non-Federal publicly owned lands within or adjacent or related to the recreation area to assure that such lands are used in a manner consistent with the findings and purposes of this Act. Directs the Secretary, in administering the recreation area, to permit hunting and fishing on lands and waters under his jurisdiction in accordance with applicable State and Federal laws. Prohibits the Federal Power Commission from licensing the construction of any dam, water conduit, reservoir, powerhouse, transmission line, or other project works under the Federal Power Act, on or directly affecting the recreation area and prohibits any department or agency of the United States from assisting by loan, grant, license, or otherwise in the construction of any water resources project that would have a direct and adverse effect on the values for which such area is established. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Requires the Secretary, within three years from the effective date of this Act, to develop and transmit to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of the United States Congress a general management plan for the use and development of the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area."
