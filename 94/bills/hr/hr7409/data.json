States that a person who employs or refers for employment such an individual shall not be deemed to have violated this Act if he has: (1) obtained a form signed by the individual stating that he is a citizen or lawfully admitted alien; and (2) himself signed a form stating that he has read the individual's birth certificate or any other document which validates the individual's statement. Provides that any person who violates this Act shall be fined in an amount equal to the cost to the United States of deporting such alien if such alien is deported, or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both, for the first such employment or referral, and shall be fined the same amount, or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both, for each such subsequent employment or referral. Directs the Immigration and Naturalization Service to increase the personnel of the United States Border Patrol and Investigations Branch by 2,500 by the end of fiscal year 1975. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as necessary to carry out this provision. Provides that this Act shall take effect 90 days after enactment and shall only apply to aliens who become employed or are referred for employment on or after that date."
