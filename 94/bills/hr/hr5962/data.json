    "text": "Establishes the Commission on Tax Revision to study and investigate the laws of the United States relating to taxation and revenue, and their impact on furthering the goals enumerated in this Act. Delineates the scope of such study within each of four broader areas: (1) general policy problems; (2) specific items of the tax structure; (3) tax treatment of specific types of organizations; and (4) comprehensive areas of the tax structure. Fixes the composition of the Commission at 24 members, eight to be appointed by the President of the United States, and eight to be appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Stipulates that all members appointed to the Commission have experience and expertise in Federal tax law, tax policy or tax administration. Authorizes the Commission to appoint and fix compensation of such personnel deemed advisable, and to procure the services of consultants. Directs the Administrator of General Services to provide administrative support services. Empowers the Commission to hold hearings, to obtain directly from any department or agency of the Federal Government such information, suggestions, estimates, and statistics as it deems necessary, and to contract with private entities for such studies or reports as it requires."
