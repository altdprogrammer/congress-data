    "text": "Medicare Improvements - Amends Title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act by removing, under the program of Hospital Insurance Benefits for the Aged and Disabled, the 150-day limitation on the number of days of inpatient hospital services for which payments will be made under such program. Removes the 100-day limitation on the provision of post-hospital extended care services. Limits to $500, through 1977, the total amount of reductions which may be imposed, by means of the inpatient hospital deductible and the coinsurance amount, on the amount payable for inpatient hospital services, post-hospital extended care, and post-hospital home health services. Provides for annual increases in the total amount of such deductions starting in calendar year 1978. States that such annual increases shall be by the same percentage by which an individual's primary insurance amount in the year in question exceeds such amount for January, 1977. Limits the total amount of reductions which may be imposed by means of coinsurance charges on payments for specified types of service under the program of Supplementary Medical Insurance Benefits for the Aged and Disabled to one-half the amount of the reductions which may be imposed on payments under the program of Hospital Insurance Benefits to the Aged and Disabled. Increases to $77 the amount of the Medicare supplementary insurance deductible for 1977. Provides, starting in calendar year 1978, for annual increases in the total amount of such deductible by the same percentage by which an individual's primary insurance amount is increased over the individual's primary insurance amount for January, 1977. Limits the percentage by which providers of services to Medicare recipients may increase the charge for such services on an annual basis. Amends Title XI (General Provisions and Professional Standards Review) of the Social Security Act to eliminate the payment of funds from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to the States to cover the cost of State review of proposed capital expenditures for health care facilities."
