    "text": "Health Maintenance Organization Amendments - Expands the program of health maintenance organizations by: (1) including the service of professional personnel and allied health professions personnel for the effective and efficient delivery of the basic health services; (2) authorizing them to provide basic health services through medical groups, referral services and medical treatment for abuse of or addiction to alcohol or drugs, and supplemental health services; and (3) guaranteeing to non-Federal lenders payment of principal and interest on loans made to establish or expand health maintenance organizations or to serve medically underserved populations. Provides that in any fiscal year the amount disbursed to a health maintenance organization under this Act may not exceed $1,000,000. Requires employers of not less than 25 individuals to offer as a part of any health benefits plan the option of membership in qualified health maintenance organizations which are engaged in the provision of basic and supplemental health services in health maintenance organization service areas in which at least 25 of such employees reside. Provides criminal penalties for employers who violate this provision. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, in order to enforce compliance with assurances made by health maintenance organizations respecting the provision of basic and supplemental health services, to bring a civil action in Federal court. Makes appropriations to finance the activities of health maintenance organizations for fiscal years 1977 and 1978."
