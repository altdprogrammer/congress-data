    "text": "Provides that, except as provided in this Act, the decisions of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs on any question of law or fact concerning a claim for benefits or payments shall be final and conclusive. States that in the event of a disagreement with respect to any claim on account of disability or death (including peacetime veterans resulting from disease or injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty, within 12 months after discharge if he or she is disabled by disease then it is presumed that such disease was prevalent at time of discharge) an action may be brought against the United States and jurisdiction is conferred upon such courts to hear and determine all such controversies. Limits institution of any such claim to within two years from the date of notice by the Administrator of his determination with respect to such claim or within two years after the date of enactment of this Act, whichever date is the later. Provides that, notwithstanding the provisions of the Act to provide that the unexplained absence of any individual for seven years shall be deemed sufficient evidence of death for the purpose of laws administered by the Veterans' Administration, a finding of death made by the Administrator shall not be final and conclusive in an action brought under this Act."
