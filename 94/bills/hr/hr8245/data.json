Appropriates to the State and Local Government Fiscal Assistance Trust Funds: (1) $1,625,000,000 for fiscal year 1976, (2) $6,687,500,000 for fiscal year 1977, (3) $6,837,500,000 for fiscal year 1978, (4) $6,987,500,000 for fiscal year 1979, (5) $7,137,500,000 for fiscal year 1980, and (6) $7,287,500,000 fiscal year 1981. Appropriates to the Fund as noncontiguous States adjustments: (1) $1,195,000 for fiscal year 1976, and (2) $4,780,000 for each of the fiscal years 1976 through 1981. Exempts amounts appropriated to the Fund from the provisions of the Congressional Budget Act. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a report with appropriate recommendations to the Congress no later than September 30, 1980, concerning the extension of this title. Declares that if the entitlement of any Indian tribe or Alaskan native village is waived for any entitlement period, then the amount of such entitlement shall become part of the entitlement of the county government of the county in which such unit is located. Increases the maximum percentage points per entitlement period until it reaches 175 percent. Directs each State and local unit of government which receives funds under such Act to submit a report to the Secretary after the close of each entitlement period on the use of the funds received. Directs such unit of local government which expects to receive funds to submit a report to the Secretary on how it plans to use the funds it expects to receive. Empowers the Secretary whenever he determines that a unit of government has failed to comply with an applicable regulation to withhold all or a portion of the entitlement funds due such unit of government, to terminate the eligibility of such unit of government, and to require repayment of the entitlement funds expended. Requires units of government to provide an opportunity for citizens to give recommendations and views on the proposed expenditures of all funds within such units distributed under such Act."
