Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to adjust the parity price at the beginning of each quarter to reflect the changes in the prices paid by farmers for production items, interest, taxes and wages in the preceeding quarter. States that it is the sense of the Congress that the President shall take appropriate action to limit the quantity of meat imports to an amount equal to the adjusted quantity estimate for the current calendar year. States that it is further the sense of Congress that the President issue a proclamation stating that import quotas on butter, butter oil, cheddar cheese, and nonfat dry milk not be increased above the levels prevailing as of June 1, 1971."
