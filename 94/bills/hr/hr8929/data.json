    "text": "Public Safety Officers Benefits Act - Provides that in any case in which the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration determines that an eligible public safety officer has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the performance of duty, leaving a spouse or one or more eligible dependents, the Administration shall pay a gratuity of $50,000. States the order of precedence for the payment of the gratuity to dependents. Excludes the payment of benefits if death was caused intentionally or by intentional misconduct or by an individual who would otherwise be entitled to the death benefits or if voluntary intoxication was the proximate cause of death. Authorizes the Commissioner of Education to award a scholarship to a dependent child or spouse of a public safety officer who was killed in the performance of duty for fulltime undergraduate study at an institution of higher education. Stipulates that the maximum amount of an award for each academic year shall be $5,000. Sets forth procedures for making and administering such awards."
