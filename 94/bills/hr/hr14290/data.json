Directs the Administrator to develop a program for the development of improved energy conservation technologies for use in buildings. Authorizes the Administrator to cooperate with Federal agencies in order to improve the design and energy efficiency of Federal buildings. Authorizes the establishment of educational and training programs to incorporate the concept of life cycle cost analysis into the fields of engineering and building analysis. Authorizes the appropriation of $12,000,000 for fiscal year 1977 to carry out the provisions of this title. Title II: Demonstration and Standards - Directs the Administrator of General Services to promote energy efficiency in Federal buildings through the use of improved energy conservation technologies, solar heating and cooling, and total energy systems. Requires that all proposed construction and renovation of Federal office buildings include optional energy features. Requires that all such construction projects include a life cycle analysis in the design and planning stages . Directs the Administrator of General Services to develop standards for the use of energy-conserving technologies in Federal buildings. Directs the Administrator of General Services to conduct biennial design competitions for energy conservation features in commercial and industrial buildings. Requires semiannual reports to Congress on activities conducted under this title. Authorizes the appropriation of $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1977 to carry out the provisions of this title."
