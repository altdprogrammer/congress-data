States that specified animals shall not be delivered for transportation if they are less than eight weeks of age. Provides that no intermediate handler or common carrier shall participate in any practice under which the cost of such animal or its transportation is to be paid and collected upon delivery of the animal to the consignee. Imposes civil penalties for violations of this Act. Makes it unlawful to transport in interstate or foreign commerce any live dog or animal trained to participate in dog or animal fighting ventures."
