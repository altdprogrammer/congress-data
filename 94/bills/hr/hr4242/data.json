    "date": "1975-03-04", 
    "text": "Requires that each member of the Armed Forces shall be examined near the time of his scheduled release from active duty for the purpose of determining whether or not he is a narcotic addict. Requires that if any member is found to be a narcotic addict, such member shall not be released from active duty and shall be immediately placed in: (1) an Armed Forces hospital for treatment of his addiction; or (2) the custody of the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service for treatment in a hospital of the Service. Provides for release from active duty upon certification that a member is no longer a narcotic addict. Provides that any member of the Armed Forces found to be a narcotic addict before his release from active duty may be so released if he gives such assurances to the Secretary of the military department concerned that upon release he will undergo private treatment for his addiction and the Secretary concerned finds that such proposed private treatment is at least equivalent to that which could be provided to such member under this Act. Sets forth conditions to be met in any such release under this Act."
