    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendments to Senate amendment with amendment) Amends the Federal Aviation Act to direct the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to establish reasonable rules and regulations governing the installation and operation of emergency locator transmitters which locate aircraft that terminate flight as the result of an accident. Allows air carriers to offer reduced-rate transportation on a space-available basis to persons who are 60 years of age or older, to handicapped persons, and to an attendant of such a handicapped person. Directs the Civil Aeronautics Board to study and report to Congress on the feasibility and economic impact of air carriers and foreign air carriers providing reduced-rate transportation on a space-available basis to persons 21 years of age or younger. Allows intrastate carriers operating within California to offer through ticketing and baggage service in cooperation with interstate airlines. Provides that no change shall be made in any rate, fare, or charge specified in any effective tariff: (1) of any air carrier, or foreign air carrier directly engaged in the operation of aircraft if such rate, fare, or charge is for the carriage of persons or property in air transportation, except after 60 days' notice; (2) of any air carrier, or foreign air carrier, if such rate, fare, or charge is for the carriage of property in air transportation, except after 45 days' notice; and (3) of any air carrier or foreign air carrier directly engaged in the operation of aircraft if such rate, fare, or charge is for the carriage of persons or property in charter trips, except after 30 days' notice. Revises the length of notice that must be given air carriers by the Civil Aeronautics Board when it decides to suspend tariffs. Makes provision for the recomputation of mail payments for two local air service carriers. Permits the Civil Aeronautics Board to provide exemptions to allow unregulated all-cargo airlines to use large aircraft under specified conditions. Allows resident aliens to register aircraft in the United States if such aircraft is not registered under the laws of any foreign country."
