    "text": "Right to Financial Privacy Act - Prohibits any financial institution from disclosing to a Federal agency or officer any financial record of a customer unless such customer has so authorized or a valid warrant, subpena or summons has been obtained according to the terms of this Act. Provides that a court may grant a subpena with a temporary delay of delivery or of mailing to the customer for a period of not greater than 90 days following the date of issuance, if it finds, on the basis of an affadavit or sworn testimony, that it has been affirmatively demonstrated that such notification would jeopardize a continuing investigation of any crimes enumerated in this Act. Requires the judge who grants or denies such a delay to report to the Administrative Office of United States Courts the particulars of such request. States that the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall transmit to the Congress an annual report concerning the number of applications for extension of delay and the number of extensions granted or denied during the preceding calendar year. Provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act."
