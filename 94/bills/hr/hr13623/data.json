States that the programs of such centers shall include education classes and services in the areas of recruitment, counseling, vocational training, job development, job placement, outreach, followup services, on-the-job training, and other appropriate and related services. Prohibits use of funds authorized by this Act unless the Secretary has determined that adequate provisions are made to assure that: (1) residents of the area to be served are involved in the planning and operation of the center; and (2) the business community in the area to be served is consulted in its development and operation. Authorizes appropriations of $30,000,000 for fiscal year 1977 to carry out the purposes of this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish criteria designed to achieve an equitable distribution of assistance among the States under this Act. Requires the Secretary to include in the annual Department of Labor report a detailed report setting forth appropriate information with respect to the activities carried out under this Act."
