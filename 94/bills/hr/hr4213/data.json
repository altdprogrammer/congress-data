    "text": "Creates on the books of the Treasury of the United States the Abandoned Coal Mine Reclamation Fund to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior. Specifies that the fund shall be available for acquisition and reclamation of land and other specified similar purposes. Authorizes to be appropriated annually to the fund such amounts as are necessary to give the fund income of not less than $200,000,000. Requires to be credited to the fund any amounts necessary to maintain this level of income. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into agreements of not more than 10 years duration to provide for land stabilization, erosion and sediment control, and reclamation through conservation treatment. Makes it the duty of land owners to furnish to the Secretary a plan, to be agreed to by both parties, setting forth the land uses and conservation treatment to be effected on the lands described in the agreement. Allows the Secretary to furnish assistance to such landowners to carry out the treatment necessary, up to a maximum of 80 percent of the cost, and on not more than 30 acres of land. Requires the Secretary to utilize the services of the Soil Conservation Service, and the State and local committees provided for in the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, and Authorizes the Secretary to utilize the facilities of the Commodity Credit Corporation. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire land or any interest therein which has been affected by surface mining and has not been reclaimed to its approximate original condition. Requires the Secretary to specifically determine the cost and the benefits to the public of such acquisition and reclamation. Empowers the Secretary to take title to land in the name of the United States under the eminent domain power of the United States where no such agreement can be reached. Encourages the States to acquire abandoned and unreclaimed lands within their boundaries and to transfer such lands to the Secretary to be reclaimed under appropriate Federal regulations. Empowers the Secretary to make grants and matching basis to States up to 90 percent of the cost of acquisition. Requires the Secretary to prepare specifications for the reclamation of lands acquired under this section. Stipulates that each reclamation contract be approved by the Secretary, and be awarded to the lowest qualified bidder. Requires that the Secretary, in selecting lands to be acquired give priority to lands which meet the objectives of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to sell such lands under regulations that will ensure that such lands will be put to proper use. Permits the Secretary to use money in the fund to acquire, reclaim, develop, and transfer land to any State, or instrumentality of a State, if such is a necessary part of a project to provide State welfare services. Empowers the Secretary at the request of a Governor to fill such voids and seal abandoned tunnels, shafts, and entryways."
