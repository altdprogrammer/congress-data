States that the declination of credit on terms offered pursuant to: (1) any loan assistance program expressly authorized by law for an economically disavantaged class of persons; (2) any loan assistance program administered by a nonprofit organization for its members or an economically disadvantaged class of persons; or (3) any special purpose loan program offered by a profitmaking organization to meet special social needs which is specifically approved or meets standards prescribed in regulations, shall not constitute a violation of this Act. Stipulates that: (1) an inquiry by or on behalf of a creditor of the marital status of any applicant is not a violation if the inquiry is to ascertain the creditor's rights and remedies; and (2) a request by or on behalf of a creditor for the signature of both parties to a marriage to create a valid lien, pass clear title, waive inchoate rights to property, or to assign earnings; is not a violation of this Act. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act."
