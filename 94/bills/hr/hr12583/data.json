    "text": "Dairy and Meat Import Inspection and Identification Act - Title I: Dairy Products - Defines terms used in this title. Directs that no dairy products shall be imported into the United States unless the Secretary of Agriculture first certifies that such products are wholesome and pure. Requires the Secretary to establish standards comparable to standards imposed upon domestic dairy products. Provides that such imports must comply with United States packaging and labeling requirements. Requires that the package or container of any food products, made in whole or in part of imported products, be labeled \"imported\" or \"imported in part. Establishes criminal penalties for violation of the requirements of this Act. Title II: Meat and Meat Products - Imposes, under the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the same labeling requirements on imported meats as are imposed upon dairy products by Title I of this Act. Requires that such products meet the same health standards as imposed upon domestically produced meats. Requires that inspectors employed by the Department of Agriculture supervise the testing of imported meats. Directs that the periodic tests of imported meats shall be conducted in the United States by the Department of Agriculture."
