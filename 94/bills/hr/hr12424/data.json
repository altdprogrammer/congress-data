Increases the value of the estate tax exemption under the Internal Revenue Code from $60,000 to $200,000 of the value of the gross estate. Increases the limitation on the aggregate marital deduction to 50 percent of the adjusted gross value of the estate, plus $100,000. Allows an executor to value farmland, woodland, and scenic open land at its current use value rather than at its fair market value."
