    "text": "Establishes the National Center for the Prevention and Control of Rape. Directs the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, acting through the Center, to conduct a continuing study of rape, including: (1) the adequacy of existing Federal, State and local laws dealing with rape; (2) the relationship, if any, between traditional legal and social attitudes toward sexual roles and toward rape, and laws dealing with rape; (3) the treatment of rape victims by law enforcement agencies, hospitals and other medical institutions, prosecutors and the courts; (4) the causes of rape; (5) rape in correctional institutions; and (6) the actual incidence of rape as compared to the reported cases, and the reasons for any disparity in such numbers. States that it shall be the duty of the Center to: (1) develop and transmit to Congress annually recommendations for legislation dealing with the prevention, control and treatment of rape; (2) develop model legislation for the reform of existing rape laws, with the goal of encouraging uniformity in State and local laws; (3) maintain an information clearinghouse with regard to the prevention of rape, the counseling of victims, and the rehabilitation of offenders; and (4) publish training materials for those engaged in rape control and treatment programs. Provides that the Administration, acting through the Center, shall make grants to private nonprofit organizations and public agencies for model projects designed to prevent rape or treat its victims. Prohibits the disclosure of records containing personally identifiable information by a project funded under the Act without the consent of the individual to whom the record pertains. Defines \"rape\" as any intentional, nonconsensual, criminal sexual assault."
