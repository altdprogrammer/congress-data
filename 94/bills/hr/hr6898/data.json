Permits owners of improved properties to retain a right of use and occupancy for a definite term of up to 25 years. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs and to the Committees on Appropriations of the United States Congress a detailed program identifying the lands selected and the annual acquisition program which he recommends for the ensuing five fiscal years. Authorizes the Secretary to cooperate with local government in establishing zoning laws or ordinances which will assist of achieving the purposes of this Act. Establishes the Santa Monica Mountains and Seashores Urban National Park Advisory Commission, to be composed of 15 members appointed by the Secretary for terms of three years each.
