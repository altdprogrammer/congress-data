    "text": "Stipulates that no member of any armed force may be discharged or released from active duty until the certificate of service of the member, and the final pay of the member or a substantial part of that pay, are ready for delivery to the member or to the next of kin or legal representative. States that a discharge certificate may not set forth, with respect to the member concerned, any information other than: (1) the name, rank, and service number of the member; and (2) the period of active duty served by the Member. Prohibits any certificate of service from setting forth, or containing any notation of any kind which indicates or may indicate, the reason why, or the conditions under which, a member was discharged or released from active duty. Requires the Secretary of the appropriate military department to promptly issue to any living member (upon request therefor by the member) who was discharged or released from active duty before the date of the enactment of this Act a certificate of service provided for in this Act. Provides that after issuance of any certificate of service to any individual pursuant to this Act any discharge certificate or certificate of release which was issued to such individual before the date of the enactment of this Act shall not be deemed to have any legal force or effect. States that any individual who is issued, or is entitled to be issued, a certificate of service under this Act shall be deemed to be a veteran discharged under conditions other than dishonorable for the purposes of any law of the United States under which benefits of any kind are made available to such individual by reason of such individual's service in the Armed Forces of the United States."
