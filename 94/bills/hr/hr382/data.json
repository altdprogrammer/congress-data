Retains a minimum sentence of fifteen years for life terms. Gives authority for the Bureau of Prisons to prepare studies of inmates and make recommendations to the Board of Parole. Recodifies three present criteria for the Board of Parole to apply in exercising its jurisdiction. Adds a fourth condition, that the individual must have made positive efforts towards his own rehabilitation. Continues the present authority of a sentencing judge to impose a minimum term during which a prisoner may not be eligible for parole. Provides for the Bureau of Prisons to prepare a report and recommendation to the Board of Parole for all prisoners eligible for parole. Leaves unchanged existing mandatory minimum sentences for specified crimes. (Amends 18 U.S.C. 4202)"
