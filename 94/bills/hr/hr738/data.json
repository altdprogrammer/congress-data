    "text": "Directs the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop ground propulsion systems which are energy conserving, have clean emission characteristics, and are capable of being produced in large numbers at a reasonable mass production per unit cost. Requires that such ground propulsion systems must meet or better all air quality standards set by or under the National Emission Standards Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Air Quality Act of 1967, while substantially reducing per mile energy consumption. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act not to exceed $30,000,000 in the aggregate for the fiscal years 1975 through 1978."
