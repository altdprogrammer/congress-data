    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Crime Control Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require a State planning agency which is a recipient of Law Enforcement Assistance Administration planning grants to make at least ten percent of the funds received available to the State court of last resort for the purposes of participating in the development of a multiyear comprehensive plan for the expediting of the criminal justice process in such State. Entitles States to Federal grants for law enforcement purposes only if the required State comprehensive plans include: (1) programs for the expediting of the criminal justice process and for the reduction and prevention of juvenile crime; (2) specific procedures under which plans may be submitted annually by major cities and urban counties to use Federal funds to carry out local comprehensive plans for law enforcement and criminal justice; (3) specific standards and goals for the improvement of law enforcement and criminal justice within the State; and (4) provisions for the evaluation of State programs. Authorizes the Administration to make grants to States for the accelerated disposition of criminal cases, such grants to be used for specified purposes, including: (1) development of a multi-year comprehensive plan for the expediting of the criminal justice process from the time of arrest to acquittal, commencement of sentence, or other disposition; (2) the hiring and training of judges, prosecutors, defenders, and administrative and support personnel; and (3) programs and projects designed to expedite the criminal process. Requires a State desiring a grant to have on file with the Administration a multi-year comprehensive plan for the expediting of the criminal justice process and to incorporate in its application for such grant the comprehensive State plan. Requires a State desiring such grants to assure that at least 50 percent of the Federal assistance allocated to the State planning agency be made available to State and local courts. Requires that State applications for such assistance include specified provisions, including: (1) an appropriately balanced allocation of funds among courts, prsecutors, defenders, and supporting agencies; (2) adequate assistance for courts, prosecutors, defenders, and supporting agencies in areas of high crime incidence, large criminal case backlogs, heavy criminal case workleads, and lengthy delays in the processing and disposition of criminal cases; (3) specific, quantified goals on an annual basis in terms of reduced criminal case delay and backlogs, and expedited processing; and (4) means of evaluating programs and projects funded with Federal assistance. Establishes within the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration the Office of Speedy Trial Assistance to develop and maintain the capability to render technical assistance, research, and coordination to State planning agencies, courts, prosecutors, defenders, and supporting agencies in planning for and executing plans for the expediting of the criminal justice process. Requires the Administration to allocate the funds appropriated each fiscal year as follows: (1) 85 percent among the States according to their respective population for grants to State planning agencies; and (2) the remaining 15 percent to the Speedy Trial Office for the purpose of making grants to State planning agencies, courts, prosecutors, defenders, supporting agencies, or to private nonprofit organizations. Directs the National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice to: (1) make and authorize evaluations of programs and projects carried out with Federal training, research, demonstration, and special grants under such Act; and (2) identify programs and projects carried out with such grants which have demonstrated success or failure in improving law enforcement and criminal justice and disseminate such information to State planning agencies and, upon request, to units of general local government. Establishes within the Administration the Office of Corrections to: (1) develop and maintain a capability to render technical assistance, research, and coordination to State planning agencies in planning for and executing plans for the improvement of correctional institutions, facilities, programs, and practices; and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of projects and programs funded by Federal grants for correctional institutions and facilities. Directs the Administration to make grants to units of general local government or any combination of such units having a population of 250,000 or more which demonstrate to the Administration a high incidence of specified crimes. Requires the Administration to report to the President and to the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House of Representatives on federally funded State law enforcement projects and programs and on the Administration's activities. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as are necessary to carry out these provisions, within specified limits, for fiscal years 1976 through 1980. Allows funds authorized under Title I of such Act to be used for the purposes of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. Amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to direct the Institute to make and authorize evaluations of specified federally funded programs and projects to determine their impact on preventing juvenile delinquency and improving juvenile justice. Directs the Institute to disseminate the results of such evaluation to State planning agencies and, upon request, to units of general local government."
