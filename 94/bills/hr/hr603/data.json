    "text": "Allows a tax credit against Federal income taxes or a payment from the United States Treasury for State and local real property taxes or an equivalent portion of rent paid on their residences by individuals who have attained age 65. States that the total tax credit and payment from the Treasury under this Act for any taxable year shall not exceed $300 ($150 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return). Provides that the credit otherwise allowable under this Act shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year exceeds $6,500 ($3,250 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return). States that in the case of a husband and wife who file a single return jointly under this Act, the age requirement contained herein shall be treated as satisfied if either spouse has attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year. Provides that for the purposes of this Act a tenant-stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation shall be deemed to own his dwelling unit. States that the term \"rent constituting property taxes\" means an amount equal to 25 percent of the rent paid during a taxable year by a taxpayer for the right to occupy his dwelling during that year, excluding any charges for utilities, services, furnishings, or appliances furnished by the landlord as a part of the rental agreement."
