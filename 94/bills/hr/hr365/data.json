    "text": "Firefighters Benefits Act - Provides death benefits of $50,000 to survivors of specified firefighters who die in the performance of duty, such payment to be made by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. Sets forth the order of precedence according to which such benefits shall be paid to survivors. Allows the Administration to make an interim benefit payment not exceeding $3,000 to survivors upon a determination that the death of the firefighter is one with respect to which a benefit will probably be paid. States that where no final benefit is paid, the recipient of the interim benefit shall be liable for repayment. Permits the Administration to waive all or part of such repayment. Enumerates the circumstances of death in which no benefits shall be paid. Authorizes to be appropriated such funds as are necessary in each fiscal year to carry out the purposes of this Act. Provides that if any provisions of this Act are declared invalid, the remaining provisions shall not be affected."
