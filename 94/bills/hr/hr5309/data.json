Imposes, under the Internal Revenue Code, a tax on all passenger automobiles sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer, at a graduated rate determined by the fuel consumption rate, in miles per gallon, of each such automobile. States that the taxable fuel consumption rate shall be the rate set forth in the Atuomobile Fuel Consumption Schedule specified in this Act. Imposes a floor stocks tax on new automobiles held by a dealer for sale. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to periodically study the fuel consumption rates of passenger automobiles and revise the Automobile Fuel Consumption Schedule. Requires that a label describing the fuel consumption rate and the amount of the fuel consumption tax must be affixed to all new cars sold."
