Directs the Board to expedite resolution of the disputed issues. Authorizes the Board to make employers and employees whole, when such relief is appropriate, for the loss of economic benefits or business opportunities resulting from unfair labor practice violations, and to provide other remedial relief. Sets forth criteria to be taken into account by the Board when seeking an injunction to restrain an unfair labor practice."
