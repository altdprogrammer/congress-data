Provides that no classification of documents by the Executive shall be deemed conclusive in determining the outcome of any petition by the United States for a restraining order or a temporary or permanent injunction against any party. Stipulates that no provision in any agreement or contract between the United States and any individual shall be the basis for the issuing of any restraining order, or temporary or permanent injunction, against any party seeking to speak, print, or publish any matter relating to his employment by the United States."
