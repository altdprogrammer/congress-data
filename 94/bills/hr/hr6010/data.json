Provides that whenever an officer or employee of an agency violates this Act, an aggrieved individual may bring a civil action against the agency and the officer or employee. Stipulates that the taking of an adverse personnel action against any individual who discloses information under this Act, if brought within one year after such disclosure, shall establish a presumption that such action was brought against such employee on account of such disclosure. States that the burden is on the agency to rebut such presumption. (Adds 5 U.S.C. 552 (f))"
