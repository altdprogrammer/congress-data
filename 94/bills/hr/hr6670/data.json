Provides that the Secretary shall determine the area of land to be covered by a permit within guidelines provided by this Act. States that the permittee shall be deemed to be to the owner of any structure, fixture, or improvement which is not owned by the United States and which is covered by a permit. Requires that each permission shall keep such records as the Secretary may prescribe in the permit to enable the Secretary to determine that all the terms of the permit have been and are being faithfully performed. Provides that this Act shall be construed as supplemental to, and not in derogation of any other Act authorizing special use permits. Authorizes the Secretary to furnish, on a reimbursement of appropriation basis, all types of utility services to concessioners, contractors, permittees or other users of such services, within the National Forest System."
