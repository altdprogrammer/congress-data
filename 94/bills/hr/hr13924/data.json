    "text": "Commission on Human Resources Programs Act - Establishes the Commission on Human Resources Programs made up of 12 members, appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Directs the Commission to study human resources programs to identify areas of duplication, insufficiency, and difficulty States and local governments have in identifying such programs. Defines human resource programs as any Federal program relating to education, manpower training, social services, health, income security, and veterans' benefits and services but not including programs funded by revenue sharing payments. Requires that such study include an examination of the dollar costs and social benefits of such programs. Makes it the duty of the Commission to recommend any legislative or administrative action or both which it feels will improve such programs. Gives the Commission nation-wide service of process to compell witnesses to testify before it. Requires the Commission to submit a report to the President and Congress stating its findings and recommendations one year after the initial Commission members are appointed and again two years after such appointments. Terminates the Commission 90 days after submission of its final report."
