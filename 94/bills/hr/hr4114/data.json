Provides that the National Health Service Corps shall be composed of officers of the Regular and Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service and other designated personnel who shall improve the delivery of health services to medically underserved populations. Requires a program of recruiting for the Corps at health professions and allied health professions schools. Sets guidelines for the adjustment of pay of physician and dentist members of the Corps. Defines \"medically underserved population\" to mean the population of an urban or rural areas which is determined to have a critical health manpower shortage, or a population group determined to have such a shortage. Sets guidelines for such determinations. Permits the assignment of Corps personnel to such populations upon request by State or local public health agencies or other public or nonprofit health agencies serving such population if need thereof is certified by the local government and the State or district medical, osteopathic or dental society. Requires the entities submitting applications for Corps personnel to agree to be responsible for charging and collecting payments for Corps health services. Sets forth what payments shall be made to the United States, with possibility of waiver of such payments. Allows recipients of health services of the Corps to receive such services at reduced rates or without charge, under specified conditions. Allows the assignment of Corps personnel to be assigned to such populations for four years. Allows a new application for Corps assistance to be filed, and allows approval of such applicants where the population's health manpower needs persist, the population has attempted continually to acquire its own health personnel, and there has been sound fiscal management of the Corps services for the population. Directs Corps personnel to utilize the techniques, facilities, and organizational forms most appropriate for the area in which the population resides, including use of health facilities of the area to the extent feasible. Requires annual reports to the Congress on the conduct of the Corps program. Authorizes for fiscal year 1976, $30,000,000 to carry out the Corps program.
