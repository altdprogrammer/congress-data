    "text": "Defense Production Act Amendments - Extends the termination date of the Defense Production Act to June 30, 1977. Declares that no section of the Act shall be deemed to convey to any person any immunity from civil or criminal liability, or to create defenses to actions under the antitrust laws except as specifically provided. Authorizes the President to enter into voluntary agreements with representatives of industry, business financing, agriculture, labor and other interests to insure productive capacity in the event of an attack on the United States. Permits the President to provide for the establishment of such advisory committees as he determines are necessary. Directs the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to jointly promulgate standards and procedures by which such industry representatives may develop and implement voluntary agreements and programs to carry out the objectives of the Act. Permits the Federal Trade Commission to exempt types or classes of meetings, conferences, or communications from the requirements of keeping a full verbatim transcript. Directs the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to participate from the beginning in the development, implementation, and carrying out of voluntary agreements and programs as authorized by this Act. Requires the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General to monitor the carryout of such voluntary programs, and to promulgate joint resolutions concerning the maintenance of necessary and appropriate documents, minutes, transcripts, and other records. Permits the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Directs the Attorney General to request the Federal Trade Commission to make surveys for the purpose of determining any factors which may tend to eliminate competition, create or strengthen monopolies, injure small business or otherwise promote undue concentration of economic power during the implementation of this Act."
