    "text": "Home Mortgage Disclosure Act - Declares that it is the purpose of this Act to provide the citizens and public officials of the United States with sufficient information to enable them to determine which depository institutions are filling their obligations to serve the housing needs of the communities and neighborhoods in which they are located. Requires depository institutions to compile and make available for the public the following information: (1) the number and total dollar amount of mortgage loans which were originated or purchased by that institution during each fiscal year; (2) the number and dollar amount of mortgage loans insured under the National Housing Act or Housing Act of 1949; (3) the number and dollar amount of mortgage loans made to mortgagors who did not, at the time of execution of the mortgage, intend to reside in the property securing the mortgage loan; and (4) the number and dollar amount of home improvement loans. Provides for enforcement of the provisions of this Act by the agencies having jurisdiction over the particular depository institution. Directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to conduct feasibility studies with respect to (1) requiring depository institutions outside of standard metropolitan statistical areas to make disclosures comparable to those required by this Act; (2) disclosure by geographical location of the source of savings deposits; (3) disclosure of the average terms and downpayment ratios of mortgage loans by geographical location; and (4) disclosure of other types of lending data, such as small business loans."
