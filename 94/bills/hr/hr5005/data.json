Directs the President to determine, review quarterly, and impose quantitative restrictions on imported petroleum and petroleum products as may be necessary to achieve the purposes stated above. Imposes a duty of $1.20 per barrel of imported petroleum and petroleum products.

Title IV: Energy Conservation and Conversion Trust Fund - Creates within the Treasury of the United States an Energy Conservation and Converstion Trust Fund. Authorizes an appropriation to the Trust Fund of amounts equivalent to the amounts received through the automobile fuel mileage tax, the windfall profits tax on domestic crude oil and natural gas, the gasoline and special motor fuels conservation tax, and to the extent provided by law, proceeds to the United States from oil and gas properties in which the United States has an interest. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to manage the Trust Fund, and to invest such portion as is not required to meet current withdrawals in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, or by the United States. Provides that amounts in the Trust Fund shall be available for purposes of conserving energy resources and expanding energy supplies through: (1) basic and applied research programs related to new energy technologies; (2) development and demonstration of new energy technologies; (3) programs relating to the development of energy resources from properties in which the United States has an interest; and (4) local and regional transportation projects. Limits the unobligated amount in the Trust Fund to $10,000,000,000. Requires that any excess be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury. Establishes an Energy Conservation and Converstion Trust Fund Review Board to review and evaluate programs and projects supported from the Trust Fund.
