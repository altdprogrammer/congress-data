    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 94-1745) Unemployment Compensation Amendments - =Title I: Extension of Coverage Provisions= - Extends unemployment insurance coverage to specified agricultural workers, and domestic service workers, and workers performing previously excluded service for nonprofit organizations or for State and local governments. Provides that Federal unemployment compensation law shall apply in the Virgin Islands. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to reimburse States providing payment of compensation for any week of employment beginning on or after January 1, 1977, for previously uncovered services. Sets forth rules governing the orderly transition to unemployment coverage of previously non-covered nonprofit organizations. =Title II: Financing Provisions= - Increases, under the Internal Revenue Code, the Federal unemployment tax wage base from $4,200, to $6,000. Increases the rate of such tax for employers. States that advances to State unemployment funds shall be made for three-month periods, rather than monthly. Provides that States are entitled to be paid by the Federal Government for unemployment benefits paid to an individual on the basis of a public service job funded with assistance provided under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act. =Title III: Benefit Provisions= - Revises the percentages of State and national unemployment designed which trigger coverage provisions of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act. Stipulates that no person may be denied compensation under any State unemployment compensation law solely on the basis of pregnancy or termination of pregnancy. Prohibits the payment of unemployment compensation to any person who is a professional athlete, between sport seasons, or to an alien who unlawfully entered the United States. =Title IV: National Commission on Unemployment Compensation= - Establishes a National Commission on Unemployment Compensation to study and evaluate the present unemployment compensation programs in order to assess the long-range needs of the programs, to develop alternatives, and to recommend changes in the programs. States that the study shall include, but not be limited to, an examination of the adequacy of the changes made by this Act and an examination of the appropriate role of unemployment compensation in income maintenance and its relationship to other social insurance programs. Directs other Federal agencies to cooperate fully with the Commission in carrying out its functions. Authorizes appropriations of sums necessary to establish the Commission and fund its activities. =Title V: Miscellaneous Provisions= - Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind and Disabled) of the Social Security Act to provide for referral of individuals under the age of 16 years who receive such benefits, to the appropriate State agency administering the State plan for vocational rehabilitation. Provides that the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare shall by regulation prescribe criteria for approval of such State plans. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to provide that approval of any State plan under such title shall require the continuance of Medicaid eligiblity for individuals who cease to be eligible for supplemental security income benefits on account of cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits. Requires that upon request of a public agency administering or supervising the administration of a State plan approved under title IV (Grants to States for Aid and Services to Needy Families with Children) of the Social Security Act, shall furnish to such agency making the request, information with respect to unemployment compensation, and refusal by an individual to accept employment. =Title VI: Special Unemployment Assistance Amendments= - Amends the Emergency Jobs and Unemployment Assistance Act of 1974 to eliminate the special base period for payments of special unemployment assistance. Amends the Emergency Jobs and Unemployment Assistance Act of 1974 to provide that an individual who performs services for an educational institution or agency in a capacity (other than an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity) shall not be eligible to receive a payment of assistance or a waiting period credit with respect to any week commencing during a period between two successive academic years under specified circumstances. Amends the Emergency Jobs and Unemployment Assistance Act of 1974 to provide that States are entitled to be paid by the Federal Government for unemployment benefits paid to an individual on the basis of a public service job funded with assistance provided under such Act. Authorizes to be appropriated for such purposes such sums as may be necessary."
