    "text": "Provides that it shall be unlawful for any business enterprise or person acting on behalf or in the interest of a business enterprise to coerce, or attempt to coerce, by economic means another person, to fail to do business with, or to otherwise discriminate against any U.S. person, or any foreign person with respect to its activities in the United States, by reason of: (1) the religion, race, national origin, or sex of such U.S. or foreign person; or (2) direct or indirect support for any foreign government when such support is not in violation of U.S. laws. Prescribes a penalty of a fine of not more than $100,000, or imprisonment for not more than three years, or for violation of such provision. Prescribes a fine not to exceed $1,000,000 if the violator is any person other than an individual. Allows any person aggrieved by a violation of the prohibition against economic coercion to bring a suit in an appropriate U.S. district court without regard to the amount in controversy. States that such person may recover threefold actual damages, reasonable attorney's fees, and other litigation costs reasonably incurred. Permits the Attorney General to institute an action in an appropriate district court to collect a civil penalty against any person who practices prohibited economic coercion. States that the penalty shall not exceed $50,000 if imposed upon an individual, or not more than $500,000 if imposed upon any person other than an individual. Makes it unlawful for a person to violate this Act by exercising coercion through a foreign government or a business enterprise not subject to U.S. jurisdiction. States that whoever violates such provision shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $50,000 if an individual, or not to exceed $500,000 if any person other than an individual. Defines terms used in this Act, including \"persons\", and states that such term shall include a corporation, trust, company, association, firm, partnership, society, joint stock company, fund, or any organized group of persons whether incorporated or not."
