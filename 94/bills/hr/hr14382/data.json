    "text": "Broadcast License Revewal Act - Requires the Federal Communications Commission to establish procedures to be followed by licensees of broadcasting stations to ascertain the needs, views, and interests of their viewers. Sets the term of a broadcast station license, or renewal, at four years and for any other class of station at five years. Provides that any license granted may, upon its expiration, be renewed, if the Commission finds that the public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by the renewal of such license. Requires that in considering any application for renewal of a broadcast license, the Commission shall not consider: (1) the ownership interests or official connections of the applicant in other stations or other communications media or other businesses; or (2) the participation of ownership in the management of the station for which such application has been filed, unless the Commission has adopted rules prohibiting such ownership interests or activities or prescribing management structures, as the case may be, and given the renewal applicant a reasonable opportunity to conform with such rules. Provides that if the Commission has pending pending before it an application for renewal of a broadcast license and a mutally exclusive application for a construction permit for a broadcast station, the Commission shall hold a comparative hearing thereon."
