    "text": "Judicial Tenure Act - Establishes in the judicial branch of Government a Council on Judicial Tenure to further the honest, impartial, and efficient administration of justice in the courts of the United States in accordance with the duties imposed upon it by law. States that it shall be the duty of the Council to receive and investigate each written complaint by any person concerning a Justice or judge of the United States and to determine whether the grounds specified in this Act for removal of a Justice or judge from office or censure or for involuntary retirement of a Justice or judge exist. Stipulates that, if after a preliminary inquiry by the Chairman, any such complaint is found to be frivolous, unwarranted, or insufficient in law or fact, the Council may dismiss such complaint. Requires that whenever the Council orders an investigation or hearing with respect to the fitness of any Justice or judge to continue in office, it shall provide not less than thirty days notice to such Justice or judge of the date on which any hearing is to be conducted. Sets forth the duties of the Judicial Conference with reference to proceedings relating to removal, censure, and involuntary retirement of a Justice or judge of the United States. States that during the pendency of any proceeding under this Act, the conference or committee may order any judge of the United States who is the subject of such inquiry to cease the exercise of any judicial powers or prerogatives pending disposition of the inquiry. States that the Conference or committee shall have the power in all cases brought before it, by majority vote: (1) to order the censure of any Justice or judge whose conduct is found to be inconsistent with the good behavior required by the Constitution; (2) to order the removal of any such Justice or judge from office; (3) to order the involuntary retirement of any Justice or judge in accordance with this Act; and (4) to dismiss or remand (to the Council) any such case. Provides that a Justice or judge of the United States may be removed from office or censured in accordance with the procedures established under this Act upon a finding by the Judicial Conference of the United States that the conduct of such Justice or judge is or has been inconsistent with the good behavior required by article III section I of the Constitution. Provides for review of the order of the Judicial Conference that a Justice be censured, involuntarily retired, or removed from office by petition to the Supreme Court. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
