Permits such a plan to be effectuated during any 7 percent shortfall period to comply with obligations under the international energy program. Permits the President to put a contingency plan into effect 90 days after enactment of this Act for a period of 60 days if a severe energy supply interruption exists and if the Congress does not disapprove. Prohibits an energy conservation contingency plan from imposing gasoline rationing or any tax, tariff, user fee, a minimum price on any petroleum product, or from providing for a credit or deduction in any tax. Requires the President to establish a gasoline rationing contingency plan, which may only be effectuated if all other practicable and authorized methods will not attain the objectives of this Act. Directs the President to provide for the use of local boards to receive petitions from and make adjustments for classes of and users of gasoline when rationing is in effect. Sets forth procedures for implementation by the President for a period of 18 months of the obligations arising from the international energy program relating to international allocation.

The classification of a property as a \"high cost property\" shall be made pursuant to procedures which shall be incorporated in a rule promulgated by the President which takes effect in accordance with the congressional review provisions specified in the Energy Conservation and Oil Policy Act of 1975; (4) in the case of such sales from a property which the President, upon petition certifies on a property-by-property basis, (A) as having made bona fide application of tertiary recovery techniques, and (B) that such application has or will significantly enhance production from such property; such higher price as the President may, by rule, establish, but in no case may such higher price exceed an average of $10.00 per barrel, plus an inflation adjustment factor. States that if the President determines that the ceiling prime amount should be modified, he shall publish notice of such determination in the Federal Register and afford interested persons an opportunity to present written and oral data, views, and arguments with respect to such modification. Provides that the modification shall become effective if the President transmits to the Congress a proposal to modify such amount in accordance with the Energy Conservation and Oil Policy Act of 1975, accompanied by his findings with respect to the specified matters, and if neither House disapproves (or both Houses approve) such proposal in accordance with the congressional review procedures specified in such Act. Provides that specified oil and gas produced on the Outer Continental Shelf shall be subject to all of the limitations and licensing requirements of the Export Administration Act of 1969 and, in addition, before any oil or gas subject to these provisions may be exported under the limitations and licensing requirements and penalty and enforcement provisions of the Export-Administration Act of 1969 the President must make and publish an express finding, and submit it to the Congress, that such exports will not increase reliance on imported oil or gas and are in the national interest and are in accord with the provisions of the Export Administration Act. States that the President shall have no power to prescribe minimum prices for crude oil, residual fuel oil, or any refined petroleum product. Provides that the specification of (or manner for determining) prices of residual fuel oil and each refined petroleum product which is refined and sold, or distributed in commerce, by a refiner during any month, after the month during which the date of enactment of this title occurs, whose refinery facilities are located in the United States, shall reflect: (1) in the case of a refiner engaged in business during calendar year 1972, the proportionate distribution of costs to such oil and each such product as was customarily maintained by such refiner for comparable months in such year; or (2) in the case of a refiner which was not engaged in business in 1972, the direct proportionate distribution of costs to such oil and each such product, except that, the President may, by order, permit any refiner to deviate from such proportionate distribution of costs if the President finds that the methods of operation of such refiner justify such deviation. Permits the President to require crude oil or natural gas to be produced from fields designated by him at the maximum efficient rate of production or at the temporary emergency production rate. Requires agreements granting rights of development of crude oil, natural gas, or coal on Federal lands to include: (1) a requirement that the person granted such right have approved a timetable for the diligent exploration and development of such items; (2) a requirement that such person promptly report in writing the discovery of any new deposits of such items; and (3) a requirement that within 90 days after discovery, or 90 days after being granted a right of development, the person granted the right shall submit a production timetable. States that in the interests of promoting maximum recovery and eliminating waste, there is hereby created a category of domestic crude oil denominated \"marginal wells production\", and, for purposes of high cost well production and for purposes of this title, oil produced from those wells shall be treated as high cost property production under this title. Authorizes the President to restrict exports of supplies of materials or equipment necessary for exploration, production, refining or transportation of energy supplies or for the construction or maintenance of energy facilities. Authorizes the President to prevent the export of coal, natural gas, crude oil, residual fuel oil, any refined petroleum product, and any petrochemical feedstock. States that regulations under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act which require the purchase of entitlements or other payment of money to reduce disparities in the crude oil acquisition costs of domestic refiners, and which are based upon the number of barrels of crude oil input of any such refiner, shall not apply to the first 50,000 barrels per day of input of any refiner whose total refining capacity did not exceed 100,000 per barrels per day on January 1, 1975 or thereafter.

Prohibits such persons from accumulating inventories which are in excess of such person's reasonable needs. Provides that, in order to promote the free flow of oil in foreign and interstate commerce at lowest possible prices, the President may act as the exclusive agent of the United States in purchasing crude oil, residual fuel oil and refined petroleum products produced or refined for importation into the United States, and may purchase crude oil produced outside the United States for sale to refiners outside the United States.

Provides that the Administrator shall conduct continuing evaluations of potential loss or shifts of employment which may result from the Administrator's action under this title. =Title V: Improving Energy Efficiency of Consumer Products= - Sets forth mandatory miles per gallon rates for passenger automobiles manufactured by any manufactuer in any model year after 1977, as follows: model year 1978 - 18.5 miles per gallon; model year 1985 - 28 miles per gallon. Requires the Administrator to transmit to each House of Congress by January 15 each year a review of fuel economy standards which shall take effect in that year, together with an evaluation of the manufacturers' abilities to meet such standards. Allows the Secretary of Transportation, if he determines that in any model year there will be an emission standards penalty which exceeds .5 miles per gallon, to adjust the average fuel economy standard applicable under this title. Sets forth the method by which the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator shall determine average fuel economy for purposes of this title. Permits judicial review of rules promulgated under this title where a person claims an adverse effect. Requires manufacturers to submit annual reports to the Secretary on their plans to comply with the appropriate fuel economy standards. Permits the Secretary, in order to carry out such reporting requirements, to subpena testimony and records.
