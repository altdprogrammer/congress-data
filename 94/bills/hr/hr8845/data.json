Makes specified acts unlawful, including for any person to: (1) capture, breed, or train, for sale or movement in commerce, any animal for use in any show or other activity involving a fight between such animal and any other animal for the purpose of sport, wagering, or entertainment; (2) manufacture for sale or movement in commerce any device or equipment for use in any show or other activity involving a fight between two or more animals; or (3) promote or participate in, for purposes of sport, wagering, or entertainment, any show or other activity involving a fight between two or more animals, if any one or more of such animals, or any equipment or devices used in connection therewith, was moved in commerce. Provides that any person guilty of violating any provision of this Act or any regulation issued under this Act shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $25,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both."
