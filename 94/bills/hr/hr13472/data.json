    "text": "Aid to Families with Dependent Children Amendments - Amends the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program of Title IV of the Social Security Act to require that, in determining need for benefits under the program, $60, plus all child-care expenses attributable to an applicant's employment, and one-third of the applicant's remaining income be disregarded in making such determination. Requires the inclusion of the income and resources of a stepparent in such determination of need. Establishes a new formula for calculating the Federal percentage of the costs to a State of programs of aid to needy families with children and aged, blind, or disabled individuals. Requires unemployed fathers of needy children to apply for unemployment compensation and to accept such compensation when eligible."
