    "text": "Construction Industry Bargaining Stabilization Act - Creates, in the Department of Labor, a Construction Industry Bargaining Commission composed of four representatives of organized labor, four representatives of construction management, and four representatives of the public at large. Provides for the appointment of the members of the Commission by the President, and defines their terms of office. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor and the Commission, in carrying out their responsibilities under this Act, to use the services, facilities, and personnel of any Federal agency, and to employ experts and consultants. Directs the Secretary and the Commission, to the fullest extent possible, to endeavor to reduce the fragmented bargaining structure in the construction industry. Requires the Commission to direct and promote the establishment of National Craft Bargaining Boards for each craft in the construction industry. States that each Board shall consist of members of national employer organizations for each craft and of the national or international labor organization representing workers in such craft. Sets forth as the primary responsibility of each such Board the assistance of local employer and contractor organizations in establishing \"geographic bargaining areas,\" as defined in this Act. Directs the Commission to undertake a study to identify the \"trading areas\" of the construction industry throughout the nation as a basis for the new geographic bargaining areas established pursuant to this Act. Requires the Commission, upon designation of each such trading area, to conduct informal hearings with Craft Boards, and labor and contractor organizations to determine the feasibility of multicraft bargaining in such areas. Provides for the formation of a Craft Board Coordinating Committee in an area in which it has been determined that multicraft bargaining on an industry wide basis or among related crafts would be practical and feasible. Directs, upon the finding that multicraft bargaining would not be feasible, that the Craft Boards of the area assist local labor and contractor organizations in defining new single-craft geographic bargaining areas. Provides for further consultations and hearings on the matter of multicraft bargaining and the establishment of multicraft geographic bargaining areas. Directs the Commission to present its findings to the Secretary for review and for the publication of such areas by the Secretary when such areas have been designated. Provides for the review of such final areas by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Directs the Commission to establish regulations for the selection of bargaining committees to represent labor and contractor organizations in collective bargaining within geographic bargaining areas. Requires the labor and contractor organizations to select such bargaining committees. States that negotiations for each initial geographic areawide collective bargaining agreement shall begin immediately following the designation of the committees for collective bargaining. States that any unexpired agreement covered by this Act within the geographic area shall automatically terminate upon the effective date of the geographic areawide collective bargaining agreement. States that any negotiation not consistent with established geographic bargaining areas shall constitute an unfair labor practice in violation of the National Labor Relations Act. Requires the Commission to establish a common expiration date for all collective-bargaining agreements within each geographic bargaining area."
