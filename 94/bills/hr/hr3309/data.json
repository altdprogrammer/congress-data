States that such initial amount shall be: (1) $2,500 in the case of a single individual; (2) $2,500 in the case of a joint return where only one spouse is eligible for the credit; (3) $3,750 in the case of a joint return where both spouses are eligible for the credit; or (4) $1,875 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return. Reduces the initial amounts by the amount of any pension or annuity received during the taxable year which is excluded from gross income under the Internal Revenue Code."
