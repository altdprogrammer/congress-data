    "text": "Directs the Secretaries of the various Armed Forces to establish discharge review boards and panels and to geographically disburse such panels on the basis of population concentrations of discharge applicants. Provides for the traveling of such panels to areas where a reasonable number of applications for review have been filed. Directs the discharge review boards and panels to review any discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces granted under other than fully honorable conditions (including \"general\" discharges) upon their own motion or upon the request of the former member or his representatives. Directs the review board or panel to determine whether such discharge was fair and equitable, or in the interest of justice, by standards current at the time of review, taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case. Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish guidelines and directives to be followed by the review boards and panels including specified mitigating and extenuating circumstances. States that the presence of strong mitigating factors shall normally warrant the upgrading of an other than fully dishonorable discharge to an honorable discharge, unless offset by serious aggravating factors which have a direct relationship to the issuance of the other than fully honorable discharge. Authorizes a review board or panel to issue an honorable discharge (limited) to individuals who were discharged under less than honorable conditions if such individuals have rehabilitated themselves and their conduct, activities and habits since being granted original discharge have been exemplary. States that such new discharge certificate shall be the same as a fully honorable discharge for all records and information pertaining to the individual. States that no benefits under any laws shall automatically be afforded to any individual issued an honorable discharge (limited) unless he would have been entitled to such benefits under his original discharge or dismissal. Sets forth the procedures which review boards and panels must follow regarding review hearings. States that in clear cases of need, the Government shall provide such legal counsel or assistance as may be necessary to insure that an applicant is competent to present his claim for review. Directs the Secretary of Defense to carry out a public information program designed to inform former members of the armed services of the new discharge review program provided for by this Act. Requires the Secretary of the services concerned to prepare a semiannual report on the functions, problems, and accomplishments of the review boards and panels established under this Act. (Amends 10 U.S.C. 1553)"
