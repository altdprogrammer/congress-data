Requires the Secretaries of each military department and the Secretary of Defense to review each type of personnel position under his jurisdiction every four years (except deployable units having a combat or combat-support mission) and to determine whether each type of position: (1) must be filled by active-duty military personnel; (2) could be filled by active-duty military personnel or by civilian employees; or (3) should be filled by civilian employees. Prohibits the assignment of active-duty personnel to positions in which a civilian employee could be utilized unless such individual possesses minimum professional qualifications and no civilian employee with qualifications equal or superior to those of such person is available for such position. (Adds 10 U.S.C. 1601, 1602)"
