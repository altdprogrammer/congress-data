Empowers the Secretary to develop a program to qualify individuals to train and retrain older workers in skills needed in the economy. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a special unit to be made available upon request, to localities where a substantial number of people are unemployed as a result of a mass layoff, such unit to provide recruitment, placement, and counseling services.

Directs the Secretary of Labor to study the advisability of establishing a program of transitional allowances for unemployed workers between age 55 and 65 who have inadequate financial resources. Title V: General - Authorizes the Secretary to employ experts and consultants as necessary and to appoint, without regard to civil service laws, advisory committees composed of private citizens and Federal, State, and local government officials to advise him with respect to his functions under this Act. Authorizes the appropriation, for fiscal year 1976 and each of the five succeeding years, of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.
