    "text": "Requires, when a defendant is convicted of an offense punishable by death, that a sentencing hearing be held in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Requires that the judge determine the existence or non-existence of specified mitigating and aggravating factors. Imposes the death penalty on persons guilty of rape, murder, any offense for which the death penalty is available because death resulted, and gathering or delivering defense information to aid a foreign government, provided that none of certain mitigating factors are present and that a jury makes certain findings by special verdict. Requires review by the appropriate court of appeals of any case in which the death sentence is imposed. Establishes standards under which the court of appeals must affirm the sentence or remand the case to the lower court for resentencing."
