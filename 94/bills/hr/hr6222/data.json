    "text": "Comprehensive Health Care Insurance Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to establish a national health care insurance program that will provide comprehensive benefits, including institutional, medical, dental, and other health care, protecting against ordinary and catastrophic expenses of illnesses for all individuals. Requires every employer to offer each of his employees and their families qualified health care insurance. States that such coverage shall be optional with the employee. Provides that when an employee elects to obtain such coverage, the employer shall contribute to the cost of such coverage for the benefit of the employee and his family at least 65 percent of the premium; the employee shall contribute the balance. Permits the Attorney General to bring suit to compel an employer to comply with the provisions of this Act. Stipulates that employers experiencing substantial increases in payroll costs due to the provisions of this Act will be entitled to a cash payment by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare or a credit against income tax. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as are necessary for the Secretary to make such payments. Provides that premiums for employee groups of one to 100 persons and self-employed persons shall not exceed 125 percent of the estimated average in the State of annual premium for employee groups of more than 100 persons. Establishes a program of Federal participation, through a system of certificates of entitlement issued by the Secretary and credits against income tax, in the premium for qualified health care insurance providing comprehensive hospital, medical, dental, and other health care services for non-employed and self-employed individuals and families. States that the amount of Federal participation shall be related to income of the individual or family, the Government to pay the full premium for those whose annual incomes are insufficient to create income tax liability, and to pay a gradually smaller proportion of the premium for others in relation to increasing amounts of income tax liability. Provides that if an individual or family incurs no income tax liability for a base year, such individual or family shall be eligible for a certificate of entitlement or a credit against income tax for 100 percent of the premium for qualified health care insurance. Stipulates that the premium rate to be charged for a qualified health care insurance policy offered under this part for any year shall in no case exceed 125 percent of the estimated average of premiums paid in the State for qualified health care insurance for groups of employees with more than 100 members. Excludes from qualified health care insurance coverage payment for stipulated items, including: (1) personal comfort items; (2) eyeglasses, hearing aids, or orthopedic shoes; and (3) private room inpatient hospital accomodations. Limits the aggregate amount of expenditures for castastrophic illness expenses. Sets forth requirements which must be met by qualified health care insurance plans. Defines terms used in this Act. Establishes the Federal Health Insurance Redemption Fund. Authorizes appropriations to the fund of amounts equal to the aggregate amount of premiums paid under this Act. Requires carriers offering qualified health care insurance policies to participate in an assigned-risk pool which may be established in such State by the State insurance department or by such agency as may be authorized by the State. Establishes a Health Insurance Advisory Board to: (1) prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes and provisions of this Act; (2) establish minimum Federal standards for the use of State insurance departments in determining whether an insurance company and plan are qualified under this Act; (3) in consultation with carriers, providers of services, and consumers, plan, review, and develop, where necessary programs whose purposes are to provide for maintaining the quality of medical care; and (4) review the effectiveness of the program established in this Act. Stipulates that individuals collecting unemployment compensation are eligible for coverage under this Act, unless covered through an employed member of his family. Permits an income tax credit for premiums paid for qualified insurance plans under this Act."
