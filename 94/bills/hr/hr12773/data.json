Authorizes the Administrator to construct and alter, and to acquire sites for, medical facilities. States that no appropriation shall be made to construct, alter, or otherwise acquire any medical facility which involves a total expenditure of more than $500,000 unless such construction, alteration, or acquisition is first approved by resolution adopted by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate, respectively. Stipulates that no appropriation shall be made to lease any space at an average annual rental of more than $200,000 for use for a medical facility unless such lease is first approved by resolutions adopted by such committees. States that the Administrator may not enter into any construction, acquisition, or alteration involving a total expenditure of $500,000 or less before the expiration of 60 days after the date on which he submits a report of the facts concerning such proposed expenditure to such committees. Enumerates structural requirements for any medical facilities pursuant to this Act. Directs the Administrator to submit to Congress an annual report regarding the construction, alteration, and leasing of medical facilities. Authorizes the Administrator to make contributions to local authorities for the construction of traffic controls, and road improvements necessitated by medical facilities. Authorizes the Administrator to construct and operate, on reservations of medical facilities, garages and parking facilities. Directs the Administrator to establish and operate not less than 125,000 hospital beds in medical facilities over which the Administrator has direct and exclusive jurisdiction for the care and treatment of eligible veterans who are tuberculous, neuropsychiatric, medical, and surgical cases. Requires the Administrator to maintain the bed and treatment capacities of all Veterans' Administration medical facilities so as to insure the accessibility and availability of such beds and treatment capacities to eligible veterans and to minimize delays in admissions and in the provision of such care and of services. Directs the Administrator to establish and operate not less than 8,000 beds in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976, and in each fiscal year thereafter, for the furnishing of nursing home care to eligible veterans in facilities over which the Administrator has direct and exclusive jurisdiction. Authorizes the Administrator and the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the Secretary of the Navy to enter into agreements and contracts for the mutual use or exchange of use of hospitals and domiciliary facilities."
