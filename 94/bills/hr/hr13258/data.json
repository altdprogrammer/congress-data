    "text": "Amends the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to include in the Renewable Resource Program, national program recommendations which take into account specified policy objectives. Requires the Secretary to provide for public participation in the formulation and review of proposed land management plans for units of the National Forest System. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations that set out the process for the development and revision of such land management plans. Requires that such regulations specify procedures to insure that plans are prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act and guidelines set out in this Act. Extends to 90 days after transmission the period during which either House of Congress may disapprove the Presidential Statement of Policy relating to formulation of budget requests for National Forest Service activities. Authorizes the Secretary to appraise and sell so much of the trees and other forest products found upon National Park System lands as may further the policies set forth in the Multiple Use and Sustained Yield Act, and the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974. Limits timber harvesting contracts to ten years. Increases to $10,000 in appraised value the maximum value of timber and cord wood which the Secretary may sell without advertisement. Directs the establishment of utilization standards and methods of measurement for the removal of trees and forest products to provide for the optimum practical use of wood materials. Makes available a portion of the revenues received from timber sales in a given area for the protection and improvement of future productivity of the renewable resources of the forest land on such sale area. Makes available a portion of the revenues received from grazing fees for rangeland improvement operations, maintenance, and construction, including revegetation and habitat management."
