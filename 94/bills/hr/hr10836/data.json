    "text": "Regulatory Agency Appointment Reform Act - Sets forth the purposes of the Act which include, the establishment of a bipartisan nominating board to submit to the President lists of individuals qualified to be appointed as commissioners of specified regulatory agencies, to provide a selection process which will insure a reduction of political influence in such selections, to provide methods to insure that official actions taken by commissioners shall not be influenced by considerations of reappointment, and to prohibit commissioners of a regulatory agency from accepting employment in an organization regulated by such agency during the 24-month period immediately after the termination of the commissioner's service on such agency. Defines terms used in this Act. Establishes as an independent agency of the Federal Government, the Federal Regulatory Agency Nominating Board to carry out the provisions of this Act. Requires each member of the Board to file an annual financial disclosure report with the Comptroller General. Provides that commissioners of regulatory agencies may only be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, from among the individuals nominated pursuant to this Act. Prohibits an individual who has been appointed as a commissioner of a regulatory agency from being appointed at any time thereafter as commissioner of such regulatory agency and, within one year after the termination of his service as a commissioner of such regulatory agency, from being appointed as commissioner of any other regulatory agency. Provides that an individual who has served as a commissioner of a regulatory agency may not represent any person before such agency in a professional capacity, or accept any employment with or compensation from any industry or for-profit organization directly affected by the activities of such agency. Directs that such prohibitions shall be enforced for the 24-month period beginning on the date on which services as a commissioner were terminated."
