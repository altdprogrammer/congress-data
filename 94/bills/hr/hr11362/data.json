    "text": "Allows an income tax credit under the Internal Revenue Code in an amount equal to 50 percent of the depressed urban area employment expenses for the taxable year. Specifies that such credit shall not exceed the amount of tax imposed reduced by the sum of other available credits. Allows a seven year carryover for the amount of the depressed urban area employment credit which exceeds such limitation. Directs the Secretary of Labor to designate any central city as a depressed urban area if it meets the criteria necessary for such determination with regard to the unemployment rate and the number of residents receiving benefits under the aid to families with dependent children program."
