Rept. 94-1581) Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require the Civil Aeronautics Board, in determining the compensation for any local service air carrier for mail for the year 1966, to apply a specified subsidy rate. Exempts from such determination any decrease in the Federal income tax liability of such carrier in such year resulting from any net operating carry back pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. Directs the Board, if any such decrease in tax liability was taken into account, to redetermine the compensation to be paid to such air carrier and to make payment of any amount owed to such carrier as provided in such redetermination."
