    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1975-10-08", 
    "text": "Local Rail Services Amendments - Requires, within 90 days of the effective date of the final system plan developed pursuant to the Railroad Reorganization Act, the collection and publication of information sufficient to permit an accurate determination of the revenues, costs, and operation of local rail lines as operating and economic units. Increases to $10,000,000 the amount authorized to be appropriated to the Interstate Commerce Commission for the use of the Rail Service Planning Office. Provides for the inclusion within the final system plan of local service railways previously excluded from the plan. Promulgates a five-year schedule of the Federal and State portions of the rail service continuation subsidies. Increases the Federal share to 100 percent for the first two years after the effective date of the final system plan. Provides for the allocation to States of rail service continuation subsidies in proportion to State rail mileage to be excluded under the final system plan. Authorizes States to use subsidy funds for the acquisition and rehabilitation of rail lines, for the preservation of rail lines for future use, and for providing alternatives to the termination of rail service which are less costly than the continuation of such service. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to provide funds to States to meet the cost of establishing and implementing the State rail plan required by the Railroad Reorganization Act. Authorizes the appropriation of funds to carry out the purposes of this Act through fiscal year 1980. Directs the Rail Services Planning Office to analyze those lines of a railroad in reorganization which are designated to be excluded from the final system plan in order to determine the economic feasibility of continuing such lines in service. Requires such determinations to be made within 630 days after the effective date of the final system plan."
