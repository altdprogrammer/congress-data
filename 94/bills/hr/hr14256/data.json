    "text": "Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Amendments - Title I: Food - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to eliminate the requirement that food labels bear the common names of optional ingredients present in such food. Repeals the Filled Milk Act, regulatory taxes under the Internal Revenue Code on adulterated butter, the definitions of nonfat dry milk and butter, and the exemption of butter, cheese, and ice cream from the requirement that labeling disclose the use of artificial coloring. Title II: Drugs - Requires that labels on consumer packages of prescription drugs must state the quantity of the contents and the drug name. Stipulates that the labels on nonprescription drugs must set forth the quantity of the drugs' active ingredients. Requires that drugs imported into the United States be accompanied by a certificate. Prohibits the exportation of a misbranded drug which does not meet the standards prescribed by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in the interests of public health and safety. Eliminates the exception to the definition of \"new drug\" granted to human and animal drugs which were subject to the Food and Drug Act of 1966. Title III: Administrative and Penalty Provisions - Authorizes detention for up to 20 days of a prohibited food, drug, device, or cosmetic, or one that is suspected to be adulterated. Increases the criminal penalties for violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Requires that every person who owns any establishment in which food, drugs, devices, or cosmetics are manufactured or held for introduction into interstate commerce must maintain such records and make such reports as the Secretary shall require."
