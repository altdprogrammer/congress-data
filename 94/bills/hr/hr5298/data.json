Establishes in the Treasury of the United States the \"Energy Research and Development Trust Fund.\" Provides that there shall be appropriated to the Trust Fund any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated which is equal to the amount attributable to revenues received under this Act. Sets forth regulations for investment of the Trust Fund and provides that amounts in the Trust Fund shall be available for: (1) research and development to increase supplies of, and efficient use of, fossil fuels, and (2) exploration, research, and development to obtain and utilize new sources of energy."
