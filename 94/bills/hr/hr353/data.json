    "date": "1975-01-14", 
    "text": "War Resisters Exoneration Act - Grants general amnesty, notwithstanding any other provision of law, to any person for violation of laws involving the following prohibited acts during the period between August 4, 1964, and the date of enactment: draft evasion, draft evasion abetting, and draft card destruction; advising another to desert the Armed Forces; deserting from the Armed Forces; missing the movement of a ship, aircraft, or unit with which it is required in the course of duty to move; using contemptuous words against various executive and State officials where present as a commissioned officer in the Armed Forces; concealing or assising any person who has deserted from the Armed Forces; and attempting to cause insubordination by any member of the military or naval forces of the United States, with the intent to interfere with the loyalty or discipline of the military or naval forces of the United States. Makes the effect of such general amnesty to restore to the grantee all civil, political, citizenship and property rights which have been or might be lost, suspended, or otherwise limited as a consequence of such violation. Includes within this general amnesty the granting of an honorable discharge to any person who received a less than honorable discharge because of such violations. Establishes an Amnesty Commission composed of five members to grant general amnesty to individuals whose violation of the above laws was in substantial part motivated by the individual's opposition to, or protest against, the involvement of the United States in Indochina; and who was not personally responsible for any significant property damage or substantial personal injury to others in the course of his violation of such law. Gives the Commission jurisdiction to hear and determine applications from individuals entitled to automatic amnesty by this Act and aggrieved by the refusal of the military board to grant an honorable discharge to him. Makes provisions for applications for amnesty, and for judicial review of a decision by the Commission. Provides that, upon petition to any U.S. district court, the United States citizenship of any former citizen solely or partly because of disapproval of the involvement of the United States in Indochina shall be fully and unconditionally restored. Gives the district courts of the United States jurisdiction without regard to the amount in controversy to hear actions brought to redress the deprivation of rights that are restored by this act, and to grant such legal and equitable relief as may be appropriate. Authorizes such appropriations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Provides that if any provision or application of this Act is held invalid, the remainder of the Act shall not be affected thereby. Makes this Act effective upon enactment."
