    "text": "Amends Titles II and XVIII (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance, and Medicare, respectively) of the Social Security Act to specify the types of treatment and amount of coverage which will be provided for individuals disabled by end stage renal disease. Defines the time at which coverage begins for programs of renal dialysis, and for kidney transplant operations. States that coverage for home dialysis programs shall begin with the month in which such program begins. Extends coverage for a regular course of renal dialysis to individuals who received a kidney transplant in the case of the failure of such transplant. Extends coverage under the Medicare program to kidney donors. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to conduct a survey and evaluation of all home dialysis training facilities in the United States and to establish or enlarge such facilities in areas in which they are not adequate to meet the needs of every person suffering from end stage renal disease who desires to undertake home dialysis. Directs the Secretary to establish pilot projects under which assistance is provided to individuals in the purchase of home dialysis equipment. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress annually on the end stage renal disease program."
