Requires vendors to deposit such funds weekly in accordance with Department of Agriculture regulations. Requires more frequent deposit of balances of $1,000 or more. States that vendors act as fiduciaries of the Federal Government when receiving food coupon funds. Prohibits the use of such funds by vendors for the benefit of anyone other than the Federal Government. Requires vendors to report periodically to State and Federal Government agencies the amount of funds deposited. Establishes criminal penalties for the violation of the regulations established in accordance with this Act."
