    "text": "Supplemental Security Income Amendments - Extends to blind persons the provisions for the payment of supplemental security income to a presumptively disabled individual prior to the determination of disability. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to initiate hearings on the eligibility of individuals for supplemental security income payments. Sets forth qualifications which must be met by persons appointed by the Secretary as hearing examiners in matters concerning the administration of Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Benefits; Supplemental Security Income; and Medicare programs of the Social Security Act. Revises the provisions of the regulations governing supplemental security income earned by certain children. Directs the Secretary to carry out a program designed specifically to assure that all individuals who are or may become eligible for supplemental security income benefits under this Act will be fully informed of the availability and nature of such benefits and of the steps to be taken in obtaining them. Prohibits the States from reducing the supplementary payments under the supplemental security income program as a result of any cost-of-living increase in benefits under such program which become effective in or after 1975. Extends supplemental security income benefits to Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. Increases the amount of the cash advance against benefits which may be made to a person who is presumptively eligible for such benefits from $100 to an amount not to exceed the aggregate amount of benefits for which such person is eligible. Provides for payment by the States to individuals of emergency supplemental security income benefits either because the regular payment was in an incorrect amount or was not paid at all because of nondeliverance of the check. Establishes a system whereby the Secretary shall reimburse any State for the amount of such emergency payment. Sets forth the dates and conditions under which the supplementary payments of the States to specified individuals will be terminated. Provides for monthly, rather than quarterly, determination of supplemental security income benefits. Revises the rules for determining the eligibility for supplemental security income payments of specified hospitalized individuals. Revises the definition of the term \"income\" with respect to eligibility to exclude specified assistance payments based on need, and to exclude specified housing assistance payments."
