    "text": "Amends the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 by adding the following new title: Title III - Port Safety Grants and Study. Provides that any port authority administering the operations of any public port in the United States may apply to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating for a grant to enable such authority to establish and maintain adequate means for the protection of such port, any vessel, structure, or waters within such port, and any land structure or shore area immediately adjacent to such port from damage caused by any fire, explosion, natural disaster, or other serious accident or casualty occurring in connection with navigation within such port. Authorizes the Secretary to award to such authority all or any part of the funds requested, except that not more than $3,000,000 may be awarded to such authority in any fiscal year. Specifies that such funds shall be granted to supplement and increase the level of State and local government funds expended and shall not be used to supplant such State and local government funds. Requires the Secretary to undertake a study of the means by which port authorities provide protection against damage caused by fires, explosions, natural disasters, or other serious accidents or casualties occurring in connection with navigation within ports administered by such authorities."
