    "text": "Provides, under the Clean Air Act, that no motor vehicle emission standard regulation applicable to new motor vehicles and engines which requires a greater reduction in emissions of air pollutants than is required under the regulations applicable to model year 1975 new motor vehicles or engines shall take effect before model year 1982. States that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall not promulgate any certfication or testing procedure applicable to new motor vehicles and engines manufactured before model year 1982 other than the certification and testing procedures applicable to model year 1975 new motor vehicles and engines. Requires the appropriate agencies of the executive branch, as designated by the President, to conduct a study to determine: (1) the incremental public health and welfare effects that would result from new motor vehicle and engine emission control standards for specified emissions which are more stringent than the standards applicable under the Clean Air Act for the 1975 model year; and (2) the implications of implementing such standards including technological feasibility and energy consumption. Requires that the findings of the study be submitted to Congress. Requires the Administrator, by June 30, 1976, and each year thereafter, to review the rate of development in motor vehicle emission control technology and fuel economy improvement by the automotive industry and the industrial and scientific community."
