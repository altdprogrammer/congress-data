    "text": "Title I: Foreign Boycotts - Foreign Boycotts Act - Makes it the policy of the United States to oppose, under the provisions of the Export Administration Act, restrictive trade practices or boycotts imposed by foreign countries against any domestic concern of the United States. Provides for the promulgation of rules by the Secretary of Commerce to require that any domestic concern which receives a request for the furnishing of information on the signing of agreements which have the effect of furthering or supporting restrictive trade practices or boycotts by foreign countries to transmit to the Secretary a report stating specified information. Authorizes the Secretary to impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for violations of the requirements of this Act. Title II: Disclosure - Domestic and Foreign Investment Improved Disclosure Act - Requires notification, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, by any investor of a proposed acquisition of more than five percent of the equity securities of any United States companys, within ten days after such acquisition, to the issuer of the security, the exchange where it is traded, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sets forth requirements for the statement to be filed with the Commission including: (1) the background, identity, residence, and nationality of such owner and any other person on whose behalf the purchases are to be effected; (2) the source and amount of the funds or other consideration used in making the purchase; (3) the purpose of the acquisition; and (4) the number of shares which are beneficially owned. Grants the Commission authority to seek injunctive relief as it deems necessary and appropriate to secure compliance with this Act."
