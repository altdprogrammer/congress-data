    "text": "Debt Collection Practices Act - Prohibits debt collectors from harassing or intimidating consumers in connection with the collection or attempted collection of any alleged debt arising from a consumer credit transation. Sets forth conduct violating this Act, including the use or threatened use of violence by a debt collector, or threatening a consumer with imprisonment for failure to pay a debt. Prohibits any debt collector, not a licensed attorney, from engaging in the practice of law in connection with the collection or attempted collection of any debt. Prohibits false or misleading representation, or impersonation, in connection with the collection of an alleged debt. States that no debt collector may engage in unfair practices, such as obtaining information form any source about a consumer under false pretenses or through false representation. Requires a debt collector to keep at each office he maintains specified information regarding his accounts. Provides that each debt collector must disclose, clearly and accurately, to each consumer a list of information which includes the date the alleged debt was incurred and the original creditor. Requires debt collectors to permit inspection of records by consumers. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act. Requires the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General to report periodically to Congress concerning their administration of functions delegated to them under this Act."
