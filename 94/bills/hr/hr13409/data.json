    "text": "National Commitment to Energy Independence using Solar and Geothermal Energy Act - Title I: Findings, Policy, Purpose, and Definitions - Declares it the policy of the United States and the purpose of this Act to eliminate reliance on imports of crude oil as an energy source through the implementation of energy conservation programs coupled with construction of solar and geothermal energy generation facilities. Title II: Assistant Administrator for Solar and Geothermal Energy and Conservation - Creates, within the Energy Research and Development Administration, the position of Assistant Administrator for Solar and Geothermal Energy and Conservation. Directs the Assistant Administrator to oversee projects and programs under the Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Act of 1974 and the Solar Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1974. Authorizes the Administrator to undertake energy conservation duties in the areas involving reduction of heat use, heat loss, electric energy use, and the reuse of solid wastes. Title III: Test and Evaluation Facilities - Directs the Assistant Administrator to implement various current systems concepts related to solar and geothermal energy. Lists specific number of test facilities as a required part of such program. Directs the Assistant Administrator to establish programs to standardize photovoltaic component costs below specified levels within five years. Requires the establishment of a residential and commercial solar heating and cooling program to expand the use of such technologies within the next five years. Requires that a major portion of the research and development costs for such programs be borne by private industry. Limits the Federal funds expended for such purposes to $100,000,000 or 25 percent of the total funds appropriated under the authority of this Act, whichever is less. Title IV: Commercial Implementation - Establishes the following goals for which additional Federal assistance to private industry shall be available: (1) the production of ten percent of all the energy consumed within the United States through the use of solar and geothermal energy within ten years of the enactment of this Act; and (2) an increase in the percentage of such consumption from solar and geothermal sources to 20 percent by the year 2000. Title V: Report - Directs the Assistant Administrator to submit a detailed plan of implementation within 90 days of the enactment of this Act. Requires annual progress reports listing the amount of Federal funds expended on each program. Directs the Congressional Budget Office to report on direct and indirect costs associated with Federal nuclear and fossil fuels subsidization programs. Directs the Budget Office to submit similar reports on cost incentive programs recommended by the Assistant Administrator to encourage the development of solar and geothermal structures for businesses and residencies. Title VI: Conservation - Directs the Assistant Administrator to implement various energy conservation programs designed to offer tax incentives for energy conservation and to assist in the development of improved energy-saving technologies. Establishes as the ultimate objective of such program a ten percent reduction in national energy consumption by 1985. Title VII: Regulation-Information to Congress - Authorizes the Assistant Administrator to prescribe appropriate rules and regulations to carry out the purposes of this Act. Requires that appropriate committees of Congress be fully and currently informed with respect to activities under this Act. Title VIII: Authorization of Appropriations - Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1985 for: (1) solar-thermal and ocean-thermal electric generation facilities; (2) wind-electric generation facilities; (3) biconversion-methane gas generation facilities; (4) geothermal-electric generation facilities; (5) photovoltaic-electric generation facilities and related activities; (6) the residential and commercial structure solar heating and cooling program and related activities; and (7) the energy conservation program outlined in this Act."
