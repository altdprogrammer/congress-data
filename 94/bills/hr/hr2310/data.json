    "text": "Powerplant Siting Act - States that Congress, in furtherance of the national environmental policy and the national electric energy policy, finds it to be in the national interest to provide that bulk power supply facilities be constructed in a manner consonant with the preservation of environmental values. Defines terms used in this Act, including \"electric entity\" and \"bulk power supply facilities. Requires each electric entity to submit its long-range plans to the appropriate regional councils established by this Act in the power regions designated by the Federal Power Commission. States that each council shall consider such plans, and prepare annually its long-range plans for bulk power supply facilities. Provides that such long-range plans shall: (1) describe the general location, size, and type of all power supply facilities to be owned or operated by each entity and whose construction is projected to commence during the ensuing 15 years; (2) identify the local of tentative sites for the construction of future bulk power supply facilities; (3) reflect and describe the regional council's efforts to identify and promote new power generation technologies which will reduce the environmental damage associated with bulk power generation; and (4) identify the general location, size, and type of alternative bulk power supply facilities considered in the course of development of regional plans and rejected as not then suitable or appropriate. Provides that each State shall establish at the State or regional level a decision-making body to certify sites and related bulk power supply facilities of any electric entity. Requires that the State include in such body representatives of: (1) appropriate State agencies; (2) electric entities; and (3) citizens' environmental protection and resources planning groups. Declares that should a State not designate a certifying body, the Federal certifying agency as provided for in this Act shall make certification decisions after consultation with the appropriate regional council. Allows a State to appeal to the appropriate U.S. court of appeals a Federal action denying or revoking a certificate of qualification for bulk power supply facilities. Provides that, within 12 months from the date of enactment of this Act, no electric entity shall commence to construct or begin operation of bulk power supply facilities unless it has obtained a certificate of site and facilities from the appropriate certifying agency. States that in the consideration of applications for certificates of site and facility, the appropriate certifying agency shall insure full public review and adequate consideration of all environmental values. Requires the certifying body to monitor the operation of each certified bulk power supply facility to determine whether the certified facility is operating in compliance with the issued certificate. States that the Federal certifying agency shall consist of one representative each from the Federal Power Commission, the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Council on Environmental Quality, and, in addition, four representatives from electric entities, one representative from the Federal electric entity, and five representatives from citizens' environmental protection and resource planning groups to be appointed by the President from a list of nominees supplied by such groups. Grants the consent of Congress to two or more States to enter into agreements or compacts for cooperative effort and mutual assistance in certificating sites and related bulk power supply facilities of electric entities. Authorizes each qualified State or regional certifying body to assess and collect fees from every electric entity and Federal electric entity operating within the jurisdiction of the legal authorities and procedures of such body. Provides that whoever: (1) commences to build a bulk power supply facility after 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act without a certificate; (2) fails to comply with a certificate; or (3) causes either of such acts to occur shall be liable to a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation or each day of continuing violation."
