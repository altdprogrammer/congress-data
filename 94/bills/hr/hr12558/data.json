    "text": "National Educational Opportunities Act - Title I: Definition and Guarantee of a Unitary School System and Equal Educational Opportunity - Provides that each State and its local educational agencies shall establish and maintain desegregated, unitary school systems which offer equal educational opportunities to all students, regardless of race, color, or national origin. States that a desegregrated unitary school system shall be presumed to exist unless a State or local educational agency denies equal educational opportunities to an individual on account of race, color, or national origin by specified acts which have the natural, probable, foreseeable, or actual effect of segregating students on the basis of race, color or national origin. Prohibits local educational agencies from denying equal educational opportunity to an individual on account of race, color, or national origin by maintenance of practices or provision of resources in schools in which minority students are concentrated that are less favorable for educational success and advancement than in schools attended primarily by students of any other race, color, or national origin. Gives examples of such denials of equal educational opportunity. Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action in Federal court for equitable relief in any case where he has reasonable cause to believe that the provisions of this Act are being violated. Title II: State Equal Educational Opportunities Plans - Requires each State to prepare and submit to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare for his approval a plan to carry out the purpose of this Act. Requires that such plan shall provide for the establishment of State and local advisory bodies to advise State and local educational agencies on development and participation in such plans. Requires such plans to provide a viable mechanism for States and local educational systems to implement a policy of equal educational opportunities that delineates the fundamental prerequisites for a desegregated, unitary school system. Provides that such State plans shall include specific means for implementing some or all of the following components: (1) a majority transfer plan on both an intradistrict and interdistrict basis; (2) a school district reorganization plan; and (3) an approved, concentrated compensatory education program for basic instructional programs, supportive services, and vocational guidance and for programs having potential for improving the achievement performance of educationally deprived students. Authorizes to be appropriated for carrying out this title not in excess of $200,000,000 for fiscal year 1977, $500,000,000 for fiscal year 1978, and $500,000,000 for each fiscal year for the next three fiscal years. Provides a formula for allotment of such funds to the States and for allocation among various programs and agencies. States that whenever the Secretary, after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing: (1) disapproves such a plan; or (2) finds that no plan has been submitted by a State, that a State plan approved under this Act has been so changed that it no longer complies with the requirements of this Act, that plan administration fails to comply substantially with any such provisions, or that a grantee is in violation of title II of this Act, the Secretary shall notify the grantee that further payments will not be made to the grantee under this title or any other educational assistance program until he is satisfied that there will no longer be any failure to comply. Provides that, until he is so satisfied, the Secretary shall make no further payments under such titles. Provides for review of the Secretary's action in such cases by the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the claimant State is located. Title III: General Provisions and Definitions - Defines the terms used in this Act."
