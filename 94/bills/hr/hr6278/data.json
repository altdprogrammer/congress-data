Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, within six months after the enactment of this Act, and after consultation with the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration and the Secretary of Commerce, to develop and publish for public comment proposed prescriptive energy conservation standards for new residential buildings. Directs the Secretary to develop and publish proposed performance energy conservation standards for new commercial buildings Provides that no Federal officer or agency shall approve any financial assistance for the construction of any building in any area of a State unless the State has certified that the unit of general local government having jurisdiction over such area has adopted and is implementing a building code or similar requirement which provides for the enforcement of any effective energy conservation standards or standards promulgated pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to the States to assist them in meeting the costs of developing State building codes or State certification procedures to carry out the provisions of this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated not more than $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1976 for such grants. Directs the Secretary to undertake research to assist in the development of standards under this Act."
