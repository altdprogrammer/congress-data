    "text": "Suspends emissions controls on motor vehicles and engines in the continental United States except vehicles registered to residents of designated air quality regions until June 30, 1977, or sixty days after the President determines there is no significant shortage of petroleum fuels, whichever is later. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to designate, subject to the limitations of the Act, geographic areas of the United States in which there is significant auto emissions related to air pollution. Provides that each State shall, not later than sixty days following enactment of this Act, submit to the Administrator a plan for implementing the Act. Provides that if a State fails to submit a plan under the Act or if the Administrator determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that such State is not adequately enforcing such a plan, then such State shall lose its entitlement to, and may not thereafter receive, any Federal grant or loan assistance under this Act or under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Declares that willful and deliberate violation of any provision of this Act shall be punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, or imprisonment for up to one year, or both."
