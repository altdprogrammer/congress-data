Directs the Commission to: (1) study existing statutes and regulations relating to the environmental impact and environmental effects of Federal policies, regulations, and laws as they apply to projects on the Federal-aid highway system; (2) review policies and practices of the Federal and State agencies having jurisdiction over such highway projects insofar as such policies and practices relate to environmental impact and environmental effects; (3) compile data necessary to understand and determine the requirements for environmental control relating to highway programs; and (4) recommend such modifications or additions to existing law, regulations, policies, and practices, as will achieve workable and effective highway programs as well as serve the public interest in protecting environment. Requires the Commission, not later than two years after the date of enactment of this Act, to submit to the President and the Congress its final report. States that the Commission shall cease to exist ninety days after submission of such report."
