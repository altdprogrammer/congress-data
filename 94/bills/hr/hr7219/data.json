States that such rule or regulation shall take effect within 60 days or at such later time as may be provided in such rule or regulation unless either House of Congress adopts a resolution in substance disapproving such rule, regulation, or change because it contains provisions which are contrary to law or inconsistent with the intent of Congress, or because it goes beyond the mandate of the legislation which it is designed to implement or in the administration of which it is designed to be used."
