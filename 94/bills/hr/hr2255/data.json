    "text": "Bilingual Courts Act - Provides that the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall prescribe, determine, and certify, for each judicial district, the qualifications of persons to serve as interpreters in bilingual proceedings in that district who have a capacity: (1) for accurate speech and comprehension of speech in the English language and in the non-English language, and (2) for the simultaneous translation from either such language to the other. Directs the Administrator to prescribe a schedule of reasonable fee for services rendered by interpreters and to provide in each judicial district equipment and facilities for recording the proceedings and simultaneous translation of such proceedings. Provides that the equipment and facilities authorized by this Act shall be used whenever a judge determines, upon motion made by a party, that (1) a party to such proceeding does not speak and understand the English language adequately; or (2) testimony may be presented by any person who does not so speak and understand the English language. States that after any such determination has been made, each party to the proceeding may utilize the services of the interpreter. Directs that the party utilizing the interpreter's services shall pay for the cost of such services, except that where more than one party uses such services, the cost shall be apportioned. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Administrative Office of the United States courts such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act. (Amends 28 U.S.C. 604(a), 1827)"
