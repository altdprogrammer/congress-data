Directs such Council to develop a comprehensive plan and program of necessary Federal research on earthquakes and related natural occurrences. Lists specific projects which must be included within the comprehensive plan and program. Designates the Geological Survey and National Science Foundation to conduct the research required under this title unless otherwise indicated in this Act. Title II: National Earthquake Prediction, Preparedness, and Coordination Program - Establishes a National Earthquake Prediction, Preparedness, and Coordination Council. Directs such Council to develop a comprehensive plan and program for earthquake prediction, preparedness, and coordination. Requires that such plan and program include specified projects, including an earthquake prediction system for areas of high seismic risk."
