Authorizes appropriations for necessary expenses for construction and equipment of rifle ranges; instruction of citizens in marksmanship, promotion of rifle practice, and the travel of rifle teams. =Title IV: Procurement= - Appropriates funds for weapons, ships, aircraft, missiles, ammunition, and other equipment and supplies required by the armed forces and defense agencies. Limits the amount which may be spent on the Navy's Condor missile program until the Secretary of Defense determines and advises the Congress that the Condor missile system has successfully completed testing and can be released for production. Prohibits any of the funds appropriated in this Act from being used for any activities involving Angola other than intelligence gathering. =Title V: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation= - Makes appropriations of funds for programs of research, development, test, and evaluation by the Army, Navy, Air Force, and defense agencies. =Title VI: Special Foreign Currency Program= - Appropriates funds for payment in foreign currencies which the Treasury Department determines to be excess to the normal requirements of the United States for expenses of carrying out programs of the Department of Defense. =Title VII: General Provisions= - Sets forth regulations and restrictions governing the administration of funds appropriated pursuant to this Act. Prohibits the use of funds appropriated under this Act for payment of a price differential on contracts hereafter made for the purpose of relieving economic dislocation, except where the Secretary of Defense has specifically determined that sufficient price competition exists to insure a reasonable price to the Government.

Disallows use of funds under this Act by the Army for design, procurement of plant equipment, or construction of new ammunition plant facilities except in areas in which existing ammunition plant facilities are being closed, placed in layaway, or at which production has been curtailed.
