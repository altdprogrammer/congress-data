    "text": "Adds Part E to title IX - \"Regional Medical Academic Summer Enrichment Programs\" of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Directs the Commissioner of Education to make annual grants to schools of medicine, dentistry, and osteopathy for the purpose of offering regional medical academic summer enrichment programs for undergraduate students from deprived educational or economic backgrounds. Requires such a program to be for a period of at least six but no more than 12 weeks in duration and to offer courses in biomedical sciences, cognitive skills, and test-taking techniques. Stipulates that grants made under this Act may cover 100 percent of the costs of: (1) recruiting and selecting students for such programs; (2) providing counseling and similar services to such students; and (3) a $100 a week stipend for each student enrolled in such a program. States that such grants may cover up to 75 percent of the cost of: (1) transporting students to and from such program; (2) room, board, and other necessary living expenses for students; and (3) reasonable administrative and other costs necessary to carry out such program. Authorizes appropriations in such amounts as are necessary for each of the fiscal years 1978, 1979, and 1980 to carry out the provisions of this Act."
