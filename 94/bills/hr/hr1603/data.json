    "text": "Declares the finding of Congress that widespread wiretapping and electronic surveillance, both by private persons and Government agents under color of law and without pretense of legal excuse or justification, has seriously undermined personal security and often violated fundamental constitutional rights. Declares that no person in any branch of the Federal Government or in any other governmental or private position should be authorized either explicitly or implicitly to violate the constitutional rights of persons by eavesdropping on private conversations through wiretapping and electronic surveillance. Removes the authority granted by Federal law to specified persons to legally intercept wire or oral communications and provides that no willful interception may be made without the consent of all the parties to such communications. Prohibits specified persons, including the U. S. Attorney General, to seek court authorizations for interception of specified communications."
