Limits such credit to 100 percent of the first $300 of such educational expenses, 50 percent of the next $300, and 10 percent of the next $400 of such expenses. Reduces such credit by 2 percent of the amount by which the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer exceeds $20,000. Reduces the amount of educational expenses otherwise recognized by this Act by the amounts received as scholarships, fellowships, and veterans benefits."
