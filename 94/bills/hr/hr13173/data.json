Establishes a special advisory committee to consult with and advise such task force. States that the functions of such task force are: (1) to assess the economic development problems of rural America; (2) to assess the present and anticipated resources and requirements of the Nation including the impact of Federal activities and their relationship with other sectors of the economy; and (3) to participate in the establishment of rural development goals. Directs the task force in carrying out these functions to develop new, and continue existing, demonstration projects to: (1) identify existing and potential employment opportunities and occupational education programs available to individuals who are unemployed or who are living in poverty; and (2) develop ways through which rural communities can provide education, vocational guidance, training, and other services needed to help the residents of such communities become employable. Directs the task force to evaluate the effectiveness of such projects and to serve as a clearinghouse for local problems. Authorizes appropriations of $4,500,000 for fiscal year 1977 to carry out the provisions of this Act."
