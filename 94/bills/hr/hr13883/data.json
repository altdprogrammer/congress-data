    "date": "1976-05-19", 
    "text": "Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to permit the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations before January 1, 1977. Requires that the taking of marine mammals after that date be permitted when the population of the concerned mammal is at the optimum sustainable level or, if the population is below the optimum sustainable level, such taking shall conform to enumerated regulations. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to ban the importation of commercial fish or fish products which have been caught with technology which results in the incidental killing or serious injury of ocean mammals in excess of United States standards. Directs (1) the Secretary of the department in which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is operating, with respect to members of the order Cetacea or the order Pinnipedia (other than walruses), or (2) the Secretary of the Interior , with respect to other Marine Mammals, to undertake research to reduce the incidental taking of marine mammals in commercial fishing operations. Authorizes the appropriation $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1978 and each fiscal year thereafter for such research. Sets forth criteria under which marine mammals may be taken in the course of commercial fishing. Authorizes the applicable Secretary to issue permits for such taking and to regulate such permits. Authorizes the applicable Secretary to carry out a program to obtain biological date on affected populations and incidental mortality and serious injury. Directs the applicable Secretary and the Secretary of State to negotiate with the Inter-America Tropical Tuna Commission to insure compliance with such regulations."
