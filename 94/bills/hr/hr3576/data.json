    "text": "Recreational Vehicle National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act - Declares that it is the purpose of this Act to confirm that the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 provides authority for the Secretary of Transportation to issue Federal motor vehicle safety regulations and standards, and take other actions, dealing with the safety aspects of electrical, plumbing, and heating installations in recreational vehicles. Provides that such regulations under such Act shall provide for protection from the hazards of fire, explosions, electrical shock, contaminated water, or noxious fumes or gases in the living quarters of recreational vehicles. Defines recreational vehicle as meaning a motor vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment primarily designed for highway travel and constructed to provide temporary living quarters for recreation, camping, travel, or office use; and which has its own motive power or is mounted on or drawn by a motor vehicle; which is of such a size and weight as not to require special highway movement permits; including a motor home, a travel trailer, a camping trailer, a fifth-wheel travel trailer, a slide-in-camper (truck camper), and a pickup cover; but not including a minibike, a snowmobile, a dunebuggy, a motorcycle, or other form of off-road or all-terrain vehicle."
