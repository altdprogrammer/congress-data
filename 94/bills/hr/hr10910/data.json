    "text": "Establishes, under the Congressional Budget Act, a zero-base budgeting process. States that such process shall consist of requiring each Congressional committee responsible for reporting legislation authorizing appropriations for any Federal program to conduct a comprehensive review and study of such program at least once every six years as though it were being proposed to be enacted for the first time. Provides that such comprehensive reviews shall include consideration of (1) alternative funding levels, (2) probable costs and benefits, (3) whether the original program objectives are still relevant, (4) the impact of the program on the functions and freedom of the private sector of the economy, and (5) the feasibility of alternative programs. Authorizes the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate to establish guidelines and standards for the conduct by the various committees of the House and Senate of their zero-based budgeting functions. Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Congressional Budgeting Act."
