    "text": "Juvenile and Adult Correctional Facilities Improvement Act - Asserts that it is the purpose of this Act to provide financial assistance to the States and localities for the construction of new correctional facilities and for the modernization of correctional institutions. Authorizes the Attorney General in accordance with this Act to make payments to State agencies for the period beginning July 1, 1975 and ending June 30, 1979. Authorizes to be appropriated the sum of $100,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975; $100,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976; $200,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1977; $300,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1978; and $300,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1979. Provides that from the sums appropriated under this Act the Attorney General shall allot not more than 5 percent thereof among Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Provides that the Attorney General shall allot to each State an amount which bears the same ratio to the remainder of such funds as the number of persons in correctional institutions in such State bears to the number of such persons in all States. Provides for the reallotment of any State's funds if the Attorney General determines that such funds will not be required. Provides that each State which desires to receive its allotment under this Act shall submit a State plan consistent with such criteria as the Attorney General may establish. States that such criteria shall include the general manner in which such State agency shall determine project priority and general standards of construction and equipment for correctional facilities of different classes and in different types of locations. States that payments under this Act from a State's allotment shall equal 50 percent of the cost of construction projects and 75 percent of the cost of modernization projects for any fiscal year. Directs that no payments will be made until the Attorney General has determined that such State will expend for correctional purposes not less than the total amount expended for such purposes during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969 plus the amount needed for the non-Federal share of projects under this Act. Provides for judicial review of the Attorney General's actions with respect to any State plan. States that the Attorney General shall administer the provisions of this Act through the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration."
