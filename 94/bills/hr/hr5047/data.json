    "text": "Natural Gas Act Amendments - Declares it the purpose of this Act to assure that adequate supplies of natural gas are available to all regions of the United States by extending the Federal Power Commission's authority under the Natural Gas Act with respect to the sale of intrastate natural gas, and by authorizing the Commission to equitably allocate both intrastate and interstate natural gas in times of natural gas shortages. Makes the provisions of the Natural Gas Act applicable to the flow of natural gas in intrastate as well as interstate commerce. Defines \"curtailment plan\" for purposes of the Natural Gas Act to mean any plan for the curtailment of natural gas promulgated or permitted to take effect by the Commission pursuant to its authority under this Act. Requires any curtailment plan to provide for: (1) protection of public health, safety, and welfare, and the national defense; (2) maintenance of all public services; (3) maintenance of agricultural operations; and (4) minimization of economic distortion, and protection against the loss of jobs and closing of factories and businesses which may result from an inability to acquire sufficient supplies of natural gas or alternative fuels. Directs the Commission to modify existing curtailment plans in such manner and to such extent as the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration determines to be necessary to provide for the coordination of attainment of the objectives of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 with the attainment of the objectives stated above. Directs the Commission to direct the interchange, delivery, or transportation of natural gas among natural-gas companies determines that such action is necessary to attain the objectives stated above."
