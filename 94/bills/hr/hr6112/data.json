    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1975-04-17", 
    "text": "Airport Noise Control Act - Sets forth the findings of Congress that Federal rather than State action to control airport noise is essential because of the importance of airports to interstate commerce, the interstate nature of many of the areas directly impacted by airports, and the need for national uniformity in, and consistency with, Federal regulation in the field of civil aviation. Declares it to be the policy of the United States to provide a means whereby citizens residing within an area directly affected by an airport should be able to exercise some measure of control over those aspects of airport operation which have a direct adverse effect on the local environment. Requires each corporation, organization, or governmental authority responsible for airport operations and management of an airport at which more than ten thousand aircraft operations occurred during the calendar year 1975 to complete before June 30, 1976, a Noise Exposure Forecast Study. Delineates an impact area based on exposure to noise levels in the area immediately surrounding the airport, as determined by the NEF study. Permits such impact areas to be modified upon application to the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. States that an airport shall be subject to regulation by a Community Airport Noise Impact Board if more than fifty percent of the population residing within the impact area or revised impact area of such airport are not residents of the governmental unit having ownership of, or control over, such airport. Exempts airports owned and operated by the Federal Government for purposes of national defense from such regulation. Provides that the membership of the Noise Impact Board shall include representatives from the airport authority and from the local community. Sets forth procedures to be followed for certification of each Board by the Administrator. States that each Noise Impact Board shall promulgate rules and regulations governing aircraft and airport operation procedures with reference to: (1) the times during which takeoffs and landings may be made; (2) takeoff and landing procedures, including approach, ascent, and power use; (3) and propeller engine use not necessary to flight; (4) allocation of runaway use; and (5) designation of types and numbers of aircraft permitted to use the airport, with or without conditions. Specifies additional powers of the Noise Impact Board. Permits any interested person to challenge regulations promulgated by the Board by filing a complaint with either the Federal Aviation Administration or the Civil Aeronautics Board, according to which agency has jurisdiction over the matter complained of. Sets forth procedures governing judicial review of such complaints. States that up to $75,000 per year of each Noise Impact Board administrative and operating expenses may be paid by the Secretary of the Treasury from revenues deposited in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Authorizes appropriations of sums necessary to carry out this Act. Provides civil penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act."
