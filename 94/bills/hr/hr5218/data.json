Requires that State implementation plans for national air quality standards must include measures such as land use and transportation controls which have been demonstrated as necessary to insure attainment of air quality standards. Provides that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, before approving such measures, must take reasonable steps to minimize any burden some or adverse economic impact, as will as assuring that the measure will be used only to the extent necessary to insure the attainment and maintenance of primary air quality standards in the immediate vicinity of the direct source. Authorizes the Administrator to extend the 3 years period of time within which ambient air quality plans relating to indirect source emissions must be implemented if he determines that all reasonably available (1) emissions limitations, (2) schedules and timetables for compliance with such limitations, and (3) other measures not applicable to indirect sources, will be applied during such three year period."
