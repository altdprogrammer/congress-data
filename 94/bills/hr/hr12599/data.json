    "text": "Amends the Consumer Credit Protection Act to prohibit certain practices in the case of second mortages which secure residential property including: (1) prepayment of mortgage penalization; (2) foreclosure or seizure of real property under a judgment entered upon warrant of attorney to confess judgment without an opportunity for a judicial hearing; (3) extension of credit to a mortgagor who the creditor knows does not have projected income sufficient to meet the payment schedule; and (4) harassment of the mortgagor in connection with the collection of mortgage payments. Prescribes remedies for such violations. Entitles a mortgagor of a second mortgage to retain funds obtained under the mortgage without obligation to repay on or after the date of violation. Prohibits any real estate broker who has arranged a second mortgage which is secured by residential real property to acquire, directly or indirectly, such property (or proceeds resulting from its disposition) at a foreclosure sale or auction of such property. Imposes a fine of up to $10,000 for such violation."
