Directs the Secretary to make quarterly reports to Congress on the administration of such activities. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of the scope and extent of liability for personal injuries arising out of immunization programs and of alternative approaches to providing protection against such liability and compensation for such injuries. Requires the Secretary to report the results of such study, along with legislative recommendations, to Congress within one year of enactment of these provisions. Makes the United States liable with respect to claims for personal injury or death resulting from the administration of vaccine under the immunization program. Establishes procedures under which all such claims will be asserted directly against the United States and makes such procedures the exclusive legal remedy."
