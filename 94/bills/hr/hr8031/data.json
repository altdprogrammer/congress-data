    "text": "Federal Employee Labor Relations Act - Declares it to be the policy of this Act that employees of the Federal Government shall have, and shall be protected in the exercise of the right, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, to form, join, and assist any labor organization, including presentation of its views to officials of the executive branch of the Government, the Congress, or other appropriate authority and to bargain collectively. Requires that the head of each Government department or agency take such action as required to carry out the purpose of this Act and assure that no improper interference, restraint, coercion, or discrimination is practiced to discourage membership in any labor organization. Defines the terms used in this Act. Creates the Federal Employees Labor Relations Board, to be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Empowers the Board to issue rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this Act, and to prevent any person from engaging in conduct in violation of this Act. Enumerates the rights of employees and employee organizations with respect to labor organizations. Provides that the labor organization designated by the majority of employees shall be the exclusive representative of all the employees. Provides for the recognition as exclusive representative of labor organizations upon application procedures set forth in this Act. Prescribes the procedures for petitions asking for investigation of the question of whether employees have selected an exclusive representative and for review and decision of such petitions by the Board. States that in each case where the appropriateness of the claimed unit is in issue, the Board shall decide whether the unit to be established will insure a clear and identifiable community of employees and will promote effective dealings and efficiency of agency operation. States that an exclusive representative decision by the Board shall not be subject to judicial review or other collateral attack. Prescribes procedures to be followed when: (1) an impasse occurs in collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment; (2) disputes over the interpretation or application of agreements occur; and (3) a strike occurs. Makes it unlawful for an employer to engage in specified actions, including to: (1) interfere with, restrain or coerce any employee for the exercise of rights guaranteed by this Act; (2) interfere with or assist in the formation or administration of any employee organization; (3) encourage or discourage employee organization membership; and (4) refuse to bargain in good faith. Provides that it shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization: (1) to restrain or coerce any employee in the exercise of the rights assured by this Act; (2) to restrain or coerce an employer in the selection of its representative for grievance and bargaining purposes; (3) to discriminate against any employee with regard to membership; and (4) in the case of an exclusive representative, to fail to bargain in good faith. Empowers the Board to prevent any person from engaging in any unlawful act covered by this Act. Prescribes the procedures for the issuing of complaints, holding of hearings, filing of exceptions and petitioning of any court of appeals. States that for the purpose of all hearings and investigations, the Board shall have access to any evidence of any person being investigated or proceeded against that relates to any matter under investigation or in question. Imposes criminal penalties on any person who willfully resists, prevents, impedes, or interferes with any member of the Commission or an agent in the performance of duties pursuant to this Act."
