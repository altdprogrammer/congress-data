    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Rules and Administration with amendment, S. Rept. 94-309) Authorizes the Senate Committee on Government Operations and the Senate Committee on Commerce to conduct a cooperative study of instrumentalities in the Federal and State government with substantial economic, health or safety regulatory authority, activities of which affect the growth or efficiency of the economy, or quality or safety of goods or services, or the health or safety of the general public. States that the study shall contain findings, conclusions, and recommendations concerning activities within the Federal regulatory agencies with respect to: (1) deficiencies within the regulatory process which tend to contribute to inflation, or lessen competition; (2) the extent to which areas of the national economy are over-regulated; or under regulated; (3) the economic costs and benefits of regulation; (4) the continued appropriateness of original regulatory purposes and objectives; (5) the consequences to the Nation of selective deregulation in specified area; (6) the need for more stringent antitrust enforcement as a higher order national priority, including proposals for any new legislation which may be needed; (7) specific recommendations for legislative actions to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and responsiveness of Federal regulatory agencies; (8) evaluation of other proposals for improving the effectiveness, efficiency, and responsiveness of the regulatory agencies; (9) recommendations for assuring an on-going review and assessment of the economic costs and benefits, and the deficiencies of Federal regulatory activities; and (10) detailed assessments of the costs or savings, of Commission proposals and recommendations for regulatory reform. Directs that the study shall also consist of findings, conclusions, and recommendations concerning activities within State, regional, and local regulatory agencies which tend to contribute to inflation. Directs that the Committees shall prepare and submit not later than February 29, 1976, to the Senate a joint report on the findings of the study authorized by this resolution. Directs the Committee to report findings and any recommendations for legislation to the Senate no later than February 29, 1976. Limits the expenses of the Committee on Government Operations under this resolution to $250,000, and those of the Committee on Commerce to $216,700."
