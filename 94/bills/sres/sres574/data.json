Stipulates that such alternative arrangement will be in order if announced on the Senate floor when the Senate is in session and printed in the Congressional Record in the form of a letter addressed to the President of the Senate, and subscribed to by a majority of the representatives of each party appointed to the conference announcing agreement on such an arrangement. Provides that if a conference report is ordered reported other than in conformity with procedures set forth in this resolution, a point of order may be made against the report and if sustained, the report shall be recommitted to the committee of conference."
