Provides that the Senate may, by resolution, express its sense that any international agreement hereafter entered into which has not been submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent constitutes a treaty. States that it shall not be in order to consider any bill or joint resolution or any amendment thereto, or any report of a committee of conference, which authorizes or provides budget authority to implement any international agreement which the Senate has found to constitute a treaty unless the Senate has given its advice and consent to ratification of such agreement."
