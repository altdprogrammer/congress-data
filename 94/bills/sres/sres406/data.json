    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #168 (86-7)) Expresses the sense of the Senate that United States relations with the Soviet Union are a central aspect of United States foreign policy, and thus it is critically important that we should sort out the difficulties that exist in the Soviet-American relationship, and define the national interest in that relationship. States that the basic premise of the United States approach to this relationship is that the United States must remain unchallengeably strong militarily, both to insure United States security and to contribute to the security of our friends and allies abroad; and that this military strength must include a strategic capability which is fully sufficient to deter any Soviet attack on the United States or its allies, and which leaves no room for misperception by the Soviet Union of our readiness and determination to defend our vital interests and allies. States the belief of the Senate that an integral part of our national security policy should be to seek through negotiations to reduce, moderate and stabilize the military competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. Expresses support for: (1) efforts to conclude, as soon as practicable, negotiations on a timely basis to implement the principles of the November 1974 Vladivostok accords and, in addition, to continue to negotiate to reduce mutually the strategic military forces permitted each country under those accords; (2) initiatives on the part of both the United States and the Soviet Union demonstrating a commitment to the achievement of peaceful solutions in present and potential areas of conflict; (3) other diplomatic, economic, commercial, and cultural initiatives which are undertaken with a careful regard for the balance of risks and advantages; (4) the principle that any future treaty or agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union shall not limit the United States to levels of intercontinental strategic forces inferior to the limits provided for the Soviet Union; and (5) a joint effort on the part of the United States and the Soviet Union to bring about the immediate withdrawal by Cuba of all of her armed forces from Africa. States that the American objective is to achieve individual freedom and peace in the world; and the Senate recognizes that the possibilities for constructive cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union may be limited but that it declares it to be the American purpose to carry on a process whose ultimate aim is to enlarge the sphere of cooperation as much as may prove possible. States that, notwithstanding any interpretation which the Soviet Union or any other country may attempt to give to the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, signed in Helsinki, it is the sense of the Congress that it will continue to be the policy of the United States not to recognize in any way the annexation of the Baltic nations by the Soviet Union."
