Creates a Senate task force composed of 10 members of the Senate appointed by the President of the Senate. States that the function of the task force shall be to make a comprehensive study of all legislative proposals involving primarily energy matters. Provides that the task force shall recommend to the Senate a procedure for the consideration of such proposals in such a manner as to avoid uncoordinated action. Directs the task force to make a final report to the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate on October 10, 1975 setting forth the results of the study. Authorizes the expenditure of an amount not to exceed $100,000 to be paid from the contingent fund of the Senate to meet the expenses of the task force."
