    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #1 (82-4)) Establishes a select committee of the Senate to conduct an investigation of Government intelligence activities, including the extent to which any illegal or improper activities were engaged in. Designates such committee as the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities. Prescribes that such committee shall consist of 11 members. Specifies topics to be studied by such committee, including: (1) whether the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has conducted an illegal domestic intelligence operation; (2) the conduct of domestic intelligence and counterintelligence operations against United States citizens by the Federal Bureau of Investigation or any other Federal agency; (3) the origin and disposition of the so-called Houston plan; and (4) the need for legislative authority to govern the operations of any intelligence agencies. Grants subpena and other powers to such committee. Requires a final report from such committee by September 1, 1975. Limits the expenses of such committee, under this resolution, to $750,000. Restricts disclosure of information gathered by the committee, which would adversely affect intelligence activities of the CIA. Prohibits, as a condition of employment, acceptance of payments for speaking or writing by committee staff concerning the committees' investigation."
