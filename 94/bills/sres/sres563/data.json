Explains that such waiver is necessary because the inflationary impact upon the existing authorized funding level for Presidential transition periods was only recently highlighted, and because the Federal Elections Commission issued regulations prohibiting campaign funds for use in such periods, thus cancelling a previously authorized source of funding."
