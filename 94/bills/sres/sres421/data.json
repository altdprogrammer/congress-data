Provides that each registration shall be available for public inspection. Prohibits any such Member from mailing any mass mailing as franked mail less than 60 days immediately before the date of the primary election or political convention in which he is a candidate for nomination or the election in which he is a candidate for election. Limits the total number of pieces which may be included in mass mailings mailed as franked mail by such a Member to 1,000,000 or a total number equal to twice the number of individuals of voting age in the State which the Senator represents or which the candidate seeks to represent. Requires that when a Member of the House of Representatives becomes a candidate for nomination or election to the Senate, he shall certify to the select committee the number of pieces included in mass mailings mailed as franked mail by him during the period beginning on January 1 of the year in which he becomes a candidate and ending on the date on which such certification is made to the select committee. Provides that if a Senator uses any computer material which is prepared by an employee of the Senate or the cost of which was paid out of appropriated funds, or uses any copy made from or made with the use of any such material, for a purpose which is not in the course of the conduct of his official duties and functions as a Senator, he shall reimburse the Senate for the value of the use of the computer material used. Directs the select committee to prepare a proposed Code of Ethics and Conduct for Members, officers, and employees of the Senate, to be submitted to the Senate on or before January 31, 1977."
