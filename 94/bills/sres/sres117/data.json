Directs that such negotiations shall be convened as soon as possible in a bilateral multilateral forum. States that these negotiations should consider, among other things, agreed limitations by the two powers on the establishment or use of naval and other military facilities in the Indian Ocean and littoral states, number of warships deployed, and the size and characteristics of warships and other military forces deployed there. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should not make any agreement for the use by the United States of military facilities in the Sultanate of Oman, until he has used his best efforts to convene such negotiations."
