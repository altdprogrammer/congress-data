States that as a result of this year's social security increases, 1,327, 136 veterans and survivors will sustain pension reductions and another 41,840 will lose entitlement to pension altogether unless amendments increasing rates pursuant to S. 2635 become law effective January 1, 1976. States that the waiver is also necessary to allow the Congress to complete work regarding veterans and survivors pension reform which the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has carried on throughout the preceding two years in good faith and without any intent to circumvent the congressional budget process."
