    "text": "Calls upon the President to continue negotiations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for the purpose of resolving remaining issues within the framework of the Vladivostok agreement and to seek an agreement to reduce the number of strategic delivery vehicles permitted each country under the Vladivostok aide-memoire. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should seek agreement with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to ban flight testing and deployment by each country of specified air- launched cruise missiles, to ban the construction of such missiles other than for deployment on heavy bombers, and to ban the flight testing or deployment by either country of specified land-launched and sea-launched cruise missiles. Urges the President to offer the Soviet Union an immediate, mutual moratorium on flight testing of all strategic-range cruise missiles. Calls upon the President, following Senate advice and consent, to ratify the agreements outlined above and to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union for the purpose of securing a comprehensive nuclear test ban. Urges the President to secure: (1) further reductions in the numerical limits contained in the Vladivostok agreement; and (2) restraints on testing and deployment of major improvements in the strategic nuclear forces on both sides."
