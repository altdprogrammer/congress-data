Requires that, upon the motion to close debate signed by sixteen members, the Presiding Officer, upon the ascertainment that a quorum is present, shall at once state the motion to the Senate. Reduces the time allowed a Senator to speak on a measure after the vote to close debate has been taken. Sets forth additional procedures after the motion is stated to the Senate."
