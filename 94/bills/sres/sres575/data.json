Directs that no Senate member who is not an appointed member of a committee of conference may participate in or vote at any meeting of a committee of conference unless he is first appointed to the committee of conference in place of a previously appointed member; in which event the member he replaces shall not be permitted to participate in or vote at any subsequent meeting of the committee of conference. States that the appointment of a new Senate member to a committee of conference in place of a member previously appointed must be announced on the Senate floor when the Senate is in session and appropriately entered upon and printed in the Senate Calendar of Business before such newly appointed members shall be permitted to participate in or vote on any matter before the committee of conference. Provides that if a conference report is ordered reported and any newly appointed Senate member of the committee of conference participates in the committee of conference, other than in conformity with the procedures provided in this resolution, a point of order may be made against the conference report and if the point of order is sustained, the report shall be recommended to the committee of conference."
