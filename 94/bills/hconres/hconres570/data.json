Rept. 94-1051) Declares that the Congress of the United States, noting the positive steps embodied in the Vladivostok accord of November 24, 1974, urges their prompt embodiment in a treaty or in an agreement approved by law. Urges immediate negotiations to achieve agreements, which would be mutual and verifiable, on: (1) a substantial initial reduction in the number of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles and the number of strategic missile launchers equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles; and (2) the achievement of approximate equality in total strategic nuclear destructive capability. Urges a comprehensive agreement ending underground nuclear explosions under adequate verification. Urges a halt on further transfers of nuclear fuel, technology, and equipment to countries not meeting specified conditions."
