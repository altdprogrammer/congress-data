I)) Declares it the sense of the Congress that every person has the right to a nutritionally adequate diet. Stresses the need to combat hunger and makes it a basic reference point of United States policy in all areas relating to nutrition. Asserts that the goal of the United States should be to substantially increase its food assistance abroad, especially to those countries needing increased food production and more efficient distribution patterns. Expresses the view that assistance ought to be more effective through use of coordinated efforts between international organizations, donor nations, and recipient countries. Requests the President to provide to the Congress not later than April 1, 1977, a five-year projection of United States international assistance levels consistent with the objectives of this resolution."
