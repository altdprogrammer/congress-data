Suggests the study should include the effect such property has on local revenues and local goods and services. Exempts certain types of public lands from the study, including real property located within the National Park System, the National Wilderness System, or the National Forest System, lands administered by the Secretary of the Interior through the Bureau of Land Management, and lands dedicated to the use of water resource development projects of the United States."
