States that the President should negotiate with representatives of foreign governments in an effort to obtain agreements limiting the export from such countries and the importation into the United States of mushrooms. Provides that if such negotiations fail the International Trade Commission should make an investigation to determine whether mushrooms are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic mushroom industry."
