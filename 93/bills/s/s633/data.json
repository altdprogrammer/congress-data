    "text": "Older Americans Home Repair Assistance Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to enter into contracts with public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations for the conduct of home repair projects, in order to promote work opportunities for unemployed or underemployed persons who are at least fifty-five years of age and who have poor employment prospects and to assist eligible homeowners to repair their homes. Sets forth criteria that such projects must meet before the Secretary shall enter into any contract under this Act. Provides that the Secretary shall establish criteria designed to achieve an equitable distribution of assistance among the States and between urban and rural areas under this Act. States that Federal financial assistance to any program carried out pursuant to this Act shall not exceed 90 percent of the cost of such program, including costs of administration. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe such rules and regulations as he deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Requires the Secretary to transmit, as part of the annual report required of the Department of Labor, a detailed report setting forth the activities conducted under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1973 and 1974 to carry out the purposes of this Act."
