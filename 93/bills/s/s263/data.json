    "text": "Mining and Minerals Resources Research Act - Authorizes to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior for the fiscal year 1974 and each subsequent year thereafter sums adequate to provide $100,000 to each of the States in the first year, $150,000 in the second year, $200,000 in the third year, and $250,000 each year thereafter to assist each participating State in establishing and carrying on the work of a competent and qualified mining, minerals, and related environmental research institute, center, or equivalent agency at one college or university in that State. Requires that Federal funds used to support such institutes must be matched by non-Federal funds. Makes it the duty of each such institute to arrange for studies or experiments in relation to mining, mineral, metallurgical, ceramic, fuel, scrap recycling, mined land reclamation, underground reservoir utilization, mineral economics, and related environmental research, and to provide for the training of scientists, engineers, and technicians in these fields. Requires an annual report to the Congress by the Secretary of the receipts and expenditures and work of the institutes in all States under the provisions of this Act. Stipulates that nothing in this Act shall modify college-State relations, or authorize Federal control of education at any college or university. Authorizes the Secretary to appoint an Advisory Committee on Mining and Minerals Resources Research to consult with, and make recommendations to, the Secretary on all matters relating to mining and mineral resources research. Requires the Secretary to annually report to Congress on the receipts and expenditures and work of the institutes in all States under the provisions of this Act."
