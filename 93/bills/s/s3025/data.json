Directs the Administrator of the Federal Energy Office, upon being notified by the Secretary of Labor that the unemployment rate of any State has increased by 0.5 percent or more over the rate in 1972, shall, if such increase was attributable to the energy shortage, take such action as may be necessary to increase that State's petroleum allotment to return the unemployment rate in such State to that rate which existed for the period immediately preceding the period during which such rate so increased."
