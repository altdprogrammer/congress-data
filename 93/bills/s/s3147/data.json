Provides that no visit authorized by this Act shall be regarded as an inspection or investigation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act and no citations shall be issued nor shall any civil penalties be proposed by the Administrator upon such visit, except that nothing in this subsection shall affect in any manner any provision of this Act the purpose of which is to eliminate imminent dangers. States that in the event of a subsequent inspection, the Secretary shall take into consideration any information obtained during the consultation visit of that workplace in determining the nature of an alleged violation and the amount of the penalties to be proposed, if any. Provides that the failure of the Administrator to give consultation and advice regarding any specific matter during the consultation visit shall not preclude the issuance of appropriate citations and proposed penalties with respect to that matter."
