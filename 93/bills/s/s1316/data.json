    "text": "Provides that no Federal agency shall permit the construction or operation of a deepwater development until the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall have certified that such development will not cause or contribute to environmental degradation or otherwise result in failure to comply with or cause a violation of effluent limitations or other standards or requirements imposed by this Act, the Clean Air Act, or any other Act which the Administrator is assigned responsibility to administer. States that any person desiring to construct or operate a deepwater development shall at the time of application for any permit, license, or other approval from any Federal agency submit, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Administrator, detailed plans of such development; and such submission to the Administrator shall be at least two years prior to the expected date of the beginning of construction. Provides that the Administrator may certify a deepwater development only after he has (1) received the concurrence of the Governor of the adjacent State or States, (2) held a public hearing in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, and (3) determined that the location, construction, and operation of the proposed deepwater port facility will not cause or contribute to environmental degradation. Provides that whoever begins to construct, constructs, or operates a deepwater development after the effective date of this Act without a prior certification by the Administrator shall be fined not less than $50,000 for each day after that date on which notice of violation is given and construction or other operations continue without a certification obtained in accordnace with this Act. States that the requirement for concurrence of the Governor of an adjacent State shall be waived two years after the date of enactment of this Act, unless such State shall have adopted and the Administrator shall have approved an environmental protection permit program applicable to areas potentially impacted by deepwater development which assures compliance with the specified environmental protection criteria."
