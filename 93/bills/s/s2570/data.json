Provides that the Labor Court shall, at least biennally, designate a judge of such court to act as chief judge. Sets forth the term of office and salaries of the judges of such court. States that the court may appoint not more than 90 commissioners who shall be subject to removal by the court and shall devote all of their time to the duties of the office. Provides that each commissioner shall be an attorney at law. Authorizes the chief judge to assign commissioners as the business of the court may require. Provides that the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction to review an appeal from final orders of the Labor Court in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury. Sets forth the jurisdiction of the Labor Court and the procedural rules of such court. Provides that all the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, shall remain in full force and effect, except that, wherever that Act refers to the National Labor Relations Board or the General Counsel of the Board, it shall be deemed to refer to the United States Labor Court or the Administrator of the National Labor Relations Act. Provides that there shall be an Administrator of the National Labor Relations Act who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice of the Senate. States that the Administrator shall have authority to investigate charges and institute unfair labor practice proceedings before the Labor Court. Provides that proceedings pending before the National Labor Relations Board shall be transferred to the Labor Court for hearing and decision de novo and that proceedings pending before the General Counsel in which no formal action has been taken shall be transferred to the Administrator who shall dispose of them in the manner set forth in this Act."
