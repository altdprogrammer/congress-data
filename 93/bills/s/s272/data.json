    "text": "Provides that in considering an application for renewal of a station license where a competing application for the facility has been filed there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the public interest will best be served by granting such application for renewal, if the Federal Commission finds that: (1) a licensee has during the immediately preceding license period reasonably fulfilled the representations which enabled the Commission to determine that the grant of the application for such license in that instance would serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity (including a finding that the operation of the station during that period has not otherwise been characterized by serious deficiencies); and (2) such application contains evidence of a positive and continuing effort by the applicant to ascertain and meet community needs and interests. Requires that, in attempting to rebut such a presumption, a competing applicant or applicants shall have the burden of proof in order to set aside such findings by the Commission. (Amends 47 U.S.C. 309(e))"
