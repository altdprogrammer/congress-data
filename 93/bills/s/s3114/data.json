    "text": "Economic Stabilization Act Amendments - States that it is the policy of the United States to provide for an orderly return to a free market as rapidly as possible. Provides that any exemption from or termination of economic controls shall be conditioned on such commitments from the affected parties as may be necessary and appropriate to insure: (1) adequate expansion in the production of commodities or productive capacity in short supply and (2) price and wage restraint sufficient to prevent serious inflation in the economy as a whole; except where the President determines such commitment would be unnecessary or ineffective. Authorizes the President to reinstate economic stabilization controls upon breach of any commitment entered into pursuant to this Act. Requires any department or agency of the United States to provide the President with economic information upon request, except for: (1) information, the disclosure of which to another Federal agency is expressly prohibited by law, or (2) trade secrets, commercial, financial, or demographic information which is privileged or confidential and obtained by an agency from a person for statistical or law enforcement purposes, the disclosure of which to another Federal agency would frustrate development of accurate statistics or proper law enforcement."
