    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1973-01-18", 
    "text": "Defines the term \"Inclusive tour charter trip\" to mean a charter trip which combines air transportation, pursuant to a contract between an air carrier or foreign air carrier and a person authorized by the Civil Aeronautics Board to sell inclusive tours, and land arrangements at one or more points of destination, sold to members of the public at a price which is not less than the just and reasonable fare for charter air transportation plus a compensatory charge for land arrangements, and subject to such other requirements not inconsistent herewith as the Board shall by regulation prescribe. Provides that whenever the Board finds that the government or aeronautical authorities of any foreign country have refused to permit, or have imposed arbitrary or unreasonable restrictions upon, the performance of foreign air transportation, or have discriminated between classes of air carriers, the Board may with or without prior notice and without hearing suspend or modify any permit issued to a foreign air carrier."
