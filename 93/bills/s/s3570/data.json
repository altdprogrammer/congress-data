Establishes the National Youth Political Participation Advisory Commission to be composed of Congressional leaders, chairmen of the Republican and Democratic national committees, and the Director of the National Youth Participation Agency. States that the Advisory Commission shall develop and recommend, for the establishment of a national political participation program, criteria which shall provide for competition among eligible young people in political action activities on the local, State, and national levels; in political history and heritage research; and in analyses of the relationship between political activities, political history, and heritage research. Provides for a parallel State youth political participation program to encourage and recognize political participation by youth at specific levels of performance. Authorizes to be appropriated for fiscal years 1975 through 1979 the sums necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
