    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Amtrak Improvement Act - Directs the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, under the Rail Passenger Service Act, to establish an auto-ferry service, characterized by the carriage of automobiles and their occupants. Provides that the Corporation shall insure that no elderly or handicapped person is denied intercity transportation by: (1) acquiring special equipment; (2) eliminating architectural barriers; and (3) providing special assistance while boarding and alighting in terminal areas. Authorizes the Corporation to acquire property which is required for construction of facilities for intercity rail passenger service. Sets forth the procedure for exercising such eminent domain proceedings. Authorizes the Corporation to: (1) establish improved reservations systems and advertising; (2) service railroad passenger equipment; (3) conduct research in rail passenger services; (4) develop improved rolling stock; (5) establish essential fixed facilities; (6) purchase or lease railroad rolling stock; and (7) operate international intercity rail passenger service between points within the United States, Canada (including Montreal and Vancouver) and Mexico (including Neuvo Laredo). Provides that the Corporation is not subject to any State or local law interfering with its efficient provisions of mail, express, or auto-ferry service. Stipulates that if the Corporation and a railroad or agency are unable to agree on the terms for sale of property to the Corporation, the Corporation may apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for an order establishing the Corporation's need for such property and directing its conveyance, with just compensation. Directs the Corporation to initiate not less than one experimental route each year, to be operated for not less than two years. Authorizes appropriations for payment to the Corporation. Empowers the Commission to promulgate such regulations as necessary to provide adequate intercity rail passenger service. Provides penalties for violation of any such regulations."
