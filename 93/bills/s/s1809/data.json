Provides that the Secretary shall not approve any application for assistance under the Urban Mass Transportation Act with respect to the design, acquisition, construction, reconstruction or improvement of mass transportation facilities and equipment unless such conform to all applicable standards of accessibility prescribed by the Secretary or he determines that such standards should be waived to avoid undue hardship. States that within five years of the date of issuance of standards under this Act, the Secretary shall review those standards."
