    "text": "Outer Continental Shelf Safety Act - Declares that it is the purpose of this Act to enact procedures to lease only the least environmentally dangerous areas in the Outer Continental Shelf, to enact new and comprehensive safety regulations for operations in the Outer Continental Shelf, and to provide for strict enforcement of such regulations. Sets forth the definitions of terms used in this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to prepare a leasing schedule, including an assessment of environmental hazards, of all areas in the Outer Continental Shelf planned to be leased in the ensuing five years. Prescribes safety regulations for oil and gas operations, including requirements that: (1) new permits for drilling or other operations should be based on use of the best available equipment and technology, and previously existing operations should be upgraded; (2) safety equipment, designed to prevent or ameliorate blowouts, loss of well control, or spillages, should be made as reliable as possible; (3) mandatory minimum training standards should be developed and enforced for all personnel in supervisory and control duties involving hazardous drilling and production operations; and (4) development of subsea production technology should be accelerated for safety and environmental reasons. Requires the Secretary to develop safety regulations for operations in the Outer Continental Shelf. States that any aggrieved party may seek judicial review of safety regulations promulgated pursuant to this Act in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Provides that the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall have responsibility for rigorous inspection of all operations and enforcement of safety regulations promulgated pursuant to this Act. Requires the Administrator to make an investigation and public report on all fires and major oil spillages occurring as a result of operations pursuant to this Act. Directs the Administrator to establish an Office of Marine Technology, and through such Office: (1) maintain a continuing assessment of the adequacy of equipment, technology, and techniques of operations in the Outer Continental Shelf; and (2) conduct experiments or studies for the development of advanced desirable equipment, techniques, or technology for Outer Continental Shelf operations. Imposes criminal and civil penalties for violation of this Act. Requires any person in charge of any operations in the Outer Continental Shelf, as soon as he has knowledge of a discharge or spillage of oil from an operation which is not allowed by a permit issued pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, to immediately notify the appropriate agency of the United States Government of such discharge. States that any person who fails to notify such agency of discharge or spillage shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both."
