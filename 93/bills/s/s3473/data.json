    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Department of State and United States Information Agency Appropriations Authorization Act - Authorizes appropriations for the State Department and the United States Information Agency for fiscal year 1975. States that the Secretary of State may provide for payment of a gratuity to the surviving dependents of any Foreign Service employee who dies as a result of injuries sustained in the performance of duties outside the United States in an amount equal to one year's salary at the time of death. Requires the Secretary of State to submit to the Congress annual reports of expenditures made and activities carried on under authority of this Act. Repeals the Formosa Resolution, which authorizes the President to employ the Armed Forces of the United States for protecting the security of Formosa, the Pescadores, and related territories. Prohibits the use of any funds appropriated under this Act for any payment to the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund to meet any unfunded liability of such fund created by the inclusion of officers and employees of the Agency of International Development in the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System. Authorizes the appropriation of funds for payment prior to January 1, 1975 of United States expenses of membership in the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, and the World Health Organization. Provides that the United States Ambassador to a foreign country shall have full responsibility for the direction, coordination, and supervision of all United States Government officers and employees in that country, except for personnel under the command of a United States area military commander. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Secretary of State should prepare a detailed plan for future United States economic and military assistance to the Government of South Vietnam, including a specific timetable for the phased reduction of such assistance to the point when the United States will cease to be the principal source of funds and material for South Vietnam's self-defense and economic viability; (2) the total number of personnel of the executive branch of the United States Government (other than personnel of the Department of State, the United States Information Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Department of Defense, and volunteers carrying out the Peace Corps Act) who were present in foreign countries on January 1, 1974, and who were citizens or nationals of the United States, should be substantially reduced; and (3) the total number of personnel of the Department of Defense assigned or detailed to military attache activities or to military assistance advisory groups or military aid missions, who were present in foreign countries on January 1, 1974, and who were citizens or nationals of the United States, should be substantially reduced."
