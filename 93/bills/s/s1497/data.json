Extends the functions of the National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice to include: (1) providing assistance to recipients of funds in evaluating the success of programs under this Act; (2) developing a standard form by which the success or failure of programs can be evaluated; and (3) developing procedures for review of ongoing programs.
