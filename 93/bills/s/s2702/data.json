    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Emergency Daylight Saving Time Energy Conservation Act - Sets forth the findings of Congress. Provides, under the Uniform Time Act, that daylight saving time shall be observed on a year-round basis. Sets forth provisions for States which lie within one or more time zones. Provides that if a State, by proclamation of its Governor, makes a finding prior to the commencement of a period of advanced time under this Act that an exemption or a realinement of time zone limits is necessary to avoid undue hardship or to conserve fuel in such State or part thereof, the President may grant such exemption or realinement. Directs the Secretary of Interior to: (1) make a study to determine the amount of energy which is conserved as a result of the extension of daylight saving time pursuant to this Act, and (2) in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation, review the appropriateness of the limits of each standard time zone, and (3) report the results of such study, together with his recommendations, with regard to the present limits of time zones, to the President and the Congress not later than June 30, 1975. Provides that during the period which commences at 2 o'clock antemeridian on the fourth Sunday after the date of enactment of this subsection and which ends at 2 o'clock antemeridian on the last Sunday of April 1974, and during the period which commences at 2 o'clock antemeridian on the last Sunday of October 1974 and which ends at 2 o'clock antemeridian on the last Sunday of April 1975, the standard time of each time zone shall be advanced by one hour. Requires the Secretary of Interior, in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation, to investigate the effect of this Act upon traffic safety, including the safety of children traveling to and from school and to investigate the effect on the hour for opening of schools and to make an interim report, including the estimated savings of energy and the total effect of this Act, to the President and Congress not later than June 30, 1974. Directs the Federal Communications Commission to, consistent with any existing treaty or other agreement, make such adjustment by general rules, or by interim action pending such general rules, with respect to hours of operation of daytime standard amplitude modulation broadcast stations, as may be consistent with the public interest."
