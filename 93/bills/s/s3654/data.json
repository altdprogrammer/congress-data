States that, except where the Secretary finds it frivolous and submitted for the purpose of delay, such application shall result in the suspension of all further proceedings with respect to such citation pending final action by the Secretary on such application. Stipulates that, in order to carry out his responsibilities under the Act, the Secretary shall, upon request, visit the workplaces of employers having 100 or fewer employees for the purpose of affording consultation and advice to such employers. Directs the Secretary to make recommendations regarding the elimination of any hazards disclosed within the scope of the onsite consultation."
