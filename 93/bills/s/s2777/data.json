Provides, under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, that all votes cast, and all abstentions from voting, concerning enrollment in a thirteenth region for Natives who are nonresidents of Alaska are declared to be null and void. Revises the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act by establishing a thirteenth region for Natives who are not residents of Alaska and who elect to be enrolled in that region. Prescribes the procedure for determining membership in the thirteenth region. Provides a temporary three-year exemption from the Investment Company Act of 1940 for any corporation organized under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Provides that the exemption shall expire automatically on December 31, 1976."
