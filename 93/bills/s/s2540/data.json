Sets forth the definitions of terms used in this Act. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to prescribe an energy saving code requiring that any federally assisted construction of a building shall be carried out so that the heat transmission through the ceiling floors, and exterior walls does not exceed specified British thermal units per hour per square foot per degree differential. Describes the circumstances under which exceptions to such requirements will be permitted. Authorizes the Secretary to cooperate with other agencies and organizations to review and revise model building codes and minimum property and occupancy standards in order to carry out the purposes of this Act."
