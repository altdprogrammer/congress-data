(Amends 42 U.S.C. 4013) Provides that no Federal office or agency shall approve any financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes on and after July 1, 1973, for use in any area that has been identified by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as an area having special flood hazards and in which the sale of flood insurance is authorized under this Act, unless the building or mobile home and any personal property to which such financial assistance relates is, during the anticipated economic or useful life of the project, covered by flood insurance in an amount at least equal to its development or project cost or to the maximum limit of coverage authorized for the particular type of property under the Act, whichever is less.
