    "text": "United States Science and Technology Board Act - Establishes as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government, the United States Science and Technology Board. States that the purpose of the Board is to consolidate in one governmental unit responsibility for: (1) determining the most critical long-range problems facing the Nation, including but not limited to, the social, economic, environmental and resources areas; (2) evaluating the potential contributions of science and technology to the solution of such long-range problems; (3) measuring the probable scope, intensity, and duration of such problems and establishing time scales and priorities for coping with them; (4) establishing optimum levels of funding of all federally financed nondefense research and development programs in the context of the time scales and priorities established; (5) reviewing and authorizing all federally financed nondefense research and development programs; and (6) insuring the coordination of scientific and technological efforts in the United States and with the scientific and technological efforts of other nations. Sets forth the functions of the Board, including the following: (1) to determine by measurement and analysis the major problems likely to confront the United States, including, but not limited to, the social, economic, environmental, and resources areas, in the year of enactment of this Act and the twenty-five years thereafter, and to establish priorities for the solution of such problems; (2) to review and update annually the analysis of each such problem; (3) based on the analysis of such problems, to determine whether, and to what degree, such problems are susceptible to solution or amelioration through the application of science and technology; and (4) to ascertain which federally funded programs already in existence contribute to the solution of such problems. Stipulates that, within six months after the designation of long-term problems facing the United States and the establishment of priorities for dealing with such problems by the Board under this Act, the head of each department, agency, and independent instrumentality of the United States having authority to support research and development activities shall submit to the Board for its review and approval all federally financed nondefense research and development programs. States that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, no such program shall be included by any such authority in its allocation of funds or its budget requests after such date unless the Board has reviewed each program and made a determination thereon. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
