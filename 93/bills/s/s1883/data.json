States that the Office shall be under the supervision and control of a Director, and that there shall be in the Office an Assistant Director. Provides that the Director and the Assistant Director shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a term of fifteen years. States that the Office shall at the close of each fiscal year report to the Congress and to the President concerning the action it has taken; the names, salaries, and duties of all individuals in its employ and the money it has disbursed; and shall make such further reports on the matters within its jurisdiction and such recommendations for further legislation as may appear desirable. Sets forth the functions of the Director, including: (1) to require, by special or general orders, any person to submit in writing such reports and answers to questions relating to campaigns for Federal offices regulated by this Act as the Director may prescribe; and (2) to investigate the violation of any law of the United States occurring in connection with any campaign for nomination for election, or for election, to Federal office or occurring in connection with any attempt to influence the outcome of any such election, and to initiate (whether by way of civil proceedings for injunctive relief or by presentations to Federal grand juries), prosecute, defend, or appeal any court action in the name of the Office for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of such laws. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Office of Federal Elections such sums as may be necessary to carry out its functions."
