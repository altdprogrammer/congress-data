Establishes in the Treasury a revolving Federal Child Support Fund which shall be available to the Attorney General without fiscal year limitation to enable him to carry out his responsibilities. Makes appropriations to the fund. Directs the Attorney General to establish and conduct, within the Department of Justice, a Parent Locator Service which shall be used to obtain and transmit to any authorized person information as to the whereabouts of any absent parent when such information is to be used to locate such parent for the purpose of enforcing support obligations against such parent. Declares that the support rights assigned to the United States shall constitute an obligation owed to the United States by the individual providing such support. Creates regional laboratories to establish paternity through analysis and classification of blood. Authorizes to be appropriated necessary funds to accomplish this purpose. Provides that any individual who is the parent of any child or children and who is under a legal duty to provide for the support and maintenance of such child or children but fails to perform such duty and has left, deserted, or abandoned such child or children and such child or children receive assistance payments to provide for their support and maintenance which are funded in whole or in part from funds appropriated therefor by the Federal Government shall, upon conviction, be penalized in an amount equal to 50 percent of the support obligation owed to the United States, or fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned for not more than one year, or any combination of these three penalties."
