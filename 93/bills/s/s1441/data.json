    "text": "States that the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force shall jointly establish and implement a uniform merit promotion program for technicians in the National Guard which shall apply in all States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Provides that a technician may not be required to wear a military uniform while performing duties within the scope of his employment as a technician. Requires any technician who is required to fulfill annual training requirements in order to qualify for his technician's position to, during any calendar year, be granted appropriate military leave for the purpose of meeting such qualifications, and such military leave shall be in addition to any other annual military leave authorized by law or regulation in the case of such technician. States that a person performing service as a National Guard Technician who is separated from such service after becoming fifty years of age and completing twenty years of service in the performance of such duty is entitled to an annuity if the Secretary of the military department concerned recommends his retirement and the Civil Service Commission approves the recommendation."
