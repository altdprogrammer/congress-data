States that postal rates shall be established to apportion the costs of all postal operations to all users of mail on a fair and equitable basis that takes into consideration all aspects of postal policy. Provides that the rates of postage established for matter mailed at reduced rates may not include a per piece charge that is added to the basic rate of postage established for such mail matter. Provides that each rate of reduced postage for specified types of matter shall be at the rate that existed for such matter on June 1, 1972, for the first 250,000 copies of each issue mailed. Provides that any further increases after July 6, 1972, in second-class mail rates shall be subsidized by a 50 percent Federal payment."
