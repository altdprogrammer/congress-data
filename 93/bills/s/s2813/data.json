Authorizes the Federal Government to guarantee the principal and interest of loans made for the following purposes: (1) installation of energy-saving production equipment; (2) conversion from industrial usage of petroleum and natural gas to more abundant forms of energy; and (3) conversion to other lines of products and services less dependent on high energy usage. Grants borrowers a priority under the Federal energy allocation programs to insure that plants are able to continue production during the conversions. Provides for loan guarantees of up to one and a half billion dollars over the next 18 months."
