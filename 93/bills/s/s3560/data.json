    "text": "Solid Waste Utilization Act - Requires the Administrator of the Enviornmental Protection Agency to promulgate, within 180 days, solid waste disposal standards, which shall include prohibitions on all open burning and dumping and compliance with effluent requirements under the Clean Air and Federal Water Pollution Control Acts. Authorizes technical assistance to State and local governments for planning and implementation of resource recovery systems and the implementation and operation of conventional solid waste management systems. Requires the Administrator to publish guidelines for identifying solid waste management areas that are appropriate planning units for the establishment of regional solid waste management systems and resource recovery systems. Directs each State Governor, after such action by the Administrator, to identify each solid waste management area within each State that complies with such guidelines and to designate a planning organization for such area. Requires such organizations to have waste management and recovery systems in operation within a year. Requires the Governors to designate management agencies for such areas. Authorizes apporpriations through fiscal year 1977 for purposes of this Act. Authorizes loans to municipalities and agencies for financing projects related to resource or energy recovery systems. Authorizes loan guarantees to private borrowers for such projects. Requires Federal agencies to give preference in the purchase of materials or energy to such items manufactured from recovered resources. Requires manufacturers of materials from which containers are manufactured and container manufacturers to guarantee the purchase of all recovered resources from containers recovered from resource recovery systems constructed as a result of this Act, if requested by the Administrator to do so. Prohibits the adoption by entities receiving assistance under this Act of restrictions, fees, taxes, or deposits on the manufacture or sale of containers based on the disposal characteristics of such containers when such action would place an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce or substantially after the distribution system for containers or their contents. Limits the application of the preceding provision to jurisdictions where repurchase by manufacturers of recovered resources is enforced and where facilities exist for recovery of resources from containers. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act."
