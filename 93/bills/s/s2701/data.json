    "text": "Directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to establish consumer product safety standards for the performance, design, and construction of snowmobiles. States that such standards shall include requirements that snowmobiles be equipped with specified instruments and controls, including: (1) not less than two hundred and fifty square inches of reflective material applied to each side of the snowmobile; (2) a throttle control which automatically returns to idle after release of the operator's hand; and (3) a windshield of transparent material which extends above the head of a seated operator and which is of sufficient strength to withstand impact and deflect objects encountered at cruising speeds. Requires operators and passengers in a snowmobile operated on public lands to wear, whenever the snowmobile is in operation, a helment. Makes it unlawful for any individual: (1) to operate a snowmobile in excess of ten miles per hour while within one hundred feet of any pedestrian, building, or any hiking or ski trail; (2) to use any snowmobile to chase or in any other manner disturb wildlife; (3) to operate a snowmobile within any area which has been designated a wilderness area, or cultural or historical site; and (4) to carry any firearm in, on or attached to a snowmobile."
