Directs the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the heads of Federal departments and agencies, to review proposed expenditures authorized by Federal law to identify programs having the potential to stimulate job creation in eligible areas. Defines an \"eligible area\" as one of 6.5 percent unemployment prior to the month the designation is made, and specifies the items to be given priority consideration by the Secretary in making the allocations authorized by this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated $1,000,000,000 for fiscal years 1975 and 1976 to carry out the provisions of this Act."
