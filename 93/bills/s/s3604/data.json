Specifies that nothing in this or any Act shall be constructed as authorizing the Central Intelligence Agency to: (1) carry out directly or indirectly, within the United States, any police or police-type operation, any law enforcement operation, or any internal security operation; or (2) provide assistance to any other department or agency of the Federal Government, of any State or local government, or to any officer or employee of any such instrumentality engaged in police or police-type operations, law enforcement operations, or internal security operations, within the United States unless such assistance is provided with the prior, specific written approval of the Central Intelligence Agency oversight subcommittees of the Committees on Appropriations and the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Stipulates that the President may not reestablish any office or agency abolished by this Act. Transfers the disaster loan functions of the Small Business Administration to the Secretary of Commerce."
