Transfers to the Department of Education all the officers, employees, assets, liabilities, contracts, property, and records of the following agencies and organizations: the Office of Education, the Office of Child Development, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare for Education, and any advisory committee in HEW concerning education.
