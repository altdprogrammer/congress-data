    "text": "Full Opportunity and National Goals and Priorities Act - Makes it the policy of the Federal Government to promote and encourage such conditions as will give every American the opportunity to live in decency and dignity, and to provide a clear and precise picture of whether such conditions are promoted and encouraged in areas such as health, education and training, rehabilitation, housing, vocational opportunities, the arts and humanities, and special assistance for the mentally ill and retarded, the deprived, the abandoned, and the criminal, and by measuring progress in meeting such needs. Directs the President to transmit to the Congress not later than February 15 of each year a report to be known as the social report, setting forth: (1) the overall progress and effectiveness of Federal efforts designed to carry out the above policy with particular emphasis upon the manner in which such efforts serve to meet national social needs in such areas as health, education and opprotunities, the arts and humanities, and special assistance for the mentally ill and retarded, the deprived, the abandoned, and the criminal; (2) a review of State, local, and private efforts designed to create the the conditions above; (3) current and foreseeable needs in the areas served by such efforts and the progress of development of plans to meet such needs; and (4) programs and policies for carrying out the above policy, together with such recommendations for legislation as he may deem necessary or desireable. Creates a Council of Social Advisers to the President to aid him in the preparation of his report, to gather and analyze data concerning programs designed to carry out the Act's policy, to develop priorities for the programs, and to appraise other government programs. Establishes an Office of Goals and Priorities Analysis within Congress which shall conduct a continuing analysis of national goals and priorities and provide Congress with information, data, and analysis necessary for enlightened priority decisions. Requires the Joint Economic Committee to hold hearings on the national goals and priorities as it deems advisable."
