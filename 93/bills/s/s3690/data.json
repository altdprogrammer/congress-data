    "text": "Revises the provisions of the Truth in Lending Act to make any creditor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed under title I (relating to consumer credit cost disclosure) of such Act liable for the actual damages sustained by the person borrowing from such creditor. Provides that any obligor or bona fide consumer protection organization may, under specified circumstances, bring a civil action for a declaration that a creditor has engaged in a course of conduct in violation of title I of such Act. States that an organization established solely or primarily for the purpose of bringing the particular action is not a bona fide consumer protection organization. States that a creditor shall be liable for not less than $15,000 nor more than $200,000 in civil penalties, of which amount not less than $5,000 nor more than $10,000 shall be awarded to the person who prevailed and the balance shall be awarded to the United States. Prescribes the factors to be considered in the awarding of reasonable attorney's fees, plus costs, in a successful action brought under this Act. States that the remedies provided by this Act may not be enforced in a class action."
