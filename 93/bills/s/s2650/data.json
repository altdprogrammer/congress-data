Sets forth the definitions of terms used in this Act Establishes a National Solar Energy Coordinating Council to advise the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development on the implementation of this Act. Outlines the composition of Council membership. Delegates to the Council the responsibility for developing practices designed to maximize effort and eliminate duplication among the operations of the various departments of the Federal Government responsible for research and demonstration of solar energy technology. Directs the Secretary to initiate a program for the development and demonstration of solar heating systems for use in residential dwellings. Requires the Secretary, in carrying out such program, to: (1) prescribe performance criteria for solar heating equipment and systems to be used in residential dwellings; (2) approve, on the basis of open competitions, at least three designs for residential dwellings suitable for the installation of solar heating systems meeting such criteria; and (3) enter into contracts for the development and manufacture of solar heating systems meeting the performance criteria. Directs the Secretary to carry out a program for the development and demonstration of combined solar heating and cooling systems for use in residential dwellings. Requires that the residential dwellings of such program shall be located in at least five climatic regions in the United States to assure a realistic demonstration of the combined solar heating and cooling systems involved under climatic conditions that vary as much as possible. Provides for the development of solar heating and combined solar heating and cooling systems for public buildings and commercial use. Authorizes the Director of the National Science Foundation, jointly with the Secretary in consultation with the Council, and upon recommendation of appropriate scientific peer review panels, to initiate, support, and fund basic and applied research activities related to solar energy. Establishes on the books of the Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as the \"Solar Energy Trust Fund\" for obligation and expenditure by the Secretary for purposes of carrying out the provisions of this Act. Directs the Secretary to make available to the public full information with respect to activities conducted under this Act. Requires the Secretary to, directly or by grant or contract: (1) study and investigate the effect of existing building codes, zoning ordinances, and other laws, upon the practical use of solar energy to heat and cool buildings; and (2) determine the extent to which such laws should be changed to facilitate such use. Directs the Secretary to submit annual reports to the President and the Congress summarizing activities under this Act. Provides that the Secretary shall maintain continuing liaison with the building industry and related industries and interests to assure that the projected benefits of such programs are and will continue to be effectively realized. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Solar Energy Trust Fund, out of any amounts in the general fund of the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for fiscal year 1974, $50,000,000, which shall remain available without fiscal year limitation through 1980."
