Authorizes additional appropriations of such sums as are necessary, but not to exceed $10,000,000 for each of such fiscal years, to offset reductions in, or termination of, Federal grant-in-aid programs or other funds made available to the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands by other Federal agencies. Extends the authority of the Federal Comptroller for Guam to the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Prescribes the duties and responsibilities of the Federal Comptroller. States that the salary and expenses of the Comptroller's Office shall be apportioned equitably by the Secretary of the Interior between Guam and the Trust Territory."
