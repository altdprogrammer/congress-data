Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to public general hospitals to assist such hospitals in meeting the costs of: (1) modernization of patient care facilities in urban areas, and (2) construction or modernization of outpatient facilities of such hospitals located apart from the hospital so that ambulatory care service may be decentralized.

Authorizes to be appropriated to carry out such grant provisions $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1975, $150,000,000 for fiscal year 1976, and $250,000,000 for fiscal year 1977. Empowers the Secretary to make grants to public and private nonprofit hospitals for special projects to demonstrate innovations in health care delivery construction which implement quality control or improve efficiency in the provision of health services by meeting identified needs, and reducing documented inefficiencies. Authorizes appropriation for fiscal years 1975 through 1977 for such grants. Provides that each public general hospital shall be entitled for each fiscal year to a grant equal to 75 percent of the annual net cost incurred by the hospital for patient care. Sets forth additional grant requirements. Authorizes appropriations for such grants. Provides, under the Public Health Service Act, that each hospital having adopted uniform cost accounting and utilization and reporting systems procedures shall be entitled for each fiscal year to a grant to assist such hospital in meeting the costs of training residents, interns, except noncitizen graduates of foreign medical schools, and individuals preparing for careers in nursing or the allied health professions in programs approved by him after consultation with the appropriate professional accrediting agency or specialty board. Authorizes appropriations for such grants. Defines the terms used in this Act, including \"annual net cost of patients care,\" \"low-income person,\" and \"urban\". Requires that each recipient of Federal assistance under this Act shall keep such records as the Secretary shall prescribe, including records which fully disclose the amount and disposition by such recipient of the proceeds of such assistance, the total cost of the project or undertaking in connection with which assistance is given or used, the amount of that portion of the cost of the project or undertaking supplied by other sources, and such other records as will facilitate an effective audit.
