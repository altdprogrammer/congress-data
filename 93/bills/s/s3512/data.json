Provides that each State shall be entitled to receive Federal financing of one-half the costs attributable to the extension of benefits so required. Directs the Secretary of Labor to appoint, within three years after the date of enactment of this Act, a Special Advisory Commission on Unemployment Compensation for the purpose of reviewing the Federal-State program of unemployment compensation and making recommendations for improvement of the system, and making recommendations with respect to the relationship between unemployment compensation and other social insurance programs, and any other matters bearing on the Federal-State unemployment compensation program. Establishes minimum standards of eligibility for unemployment compensation, limits the use of waiting periods for the receipt of such compensation, and otherwise extends and improves the Federal-State unemployment insurance system. Revises the definition of wages under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act by excluding from the meaning of such term all remuneration paid in any medium other than cash for agricultural labor; and includes within the definition of employment under such Act qualified domestic service wherein the employer paid cash remuneration of $225 or more in any calendar quarter."
