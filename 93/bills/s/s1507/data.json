Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out his functions under this Act, including such rules of procedure as he determines to be necessary to insure the equitable allocation of export authority within the limits set forth in the Act. Provides that whoever knowingly and willfully exports any softwood in violation of this title, or in violation of any rule or regulation hereunder, or knowingly and fraudently files a false report, or fails to permit the Secretary access to his books, records, and accounts, and softwood storage areas, as provided for in this Act, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year or both for each such violation and shall not thereafter be permitted to export softwood for a period of not to exceed five years. Authorizes the Secretary to charge reasonable fees to those engaged in the export of softwood or seeking to export softwood, to defray the cost of processing and approving applications and carrying out his functions under this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
