    "text": "Energy and Resources Recovery Act - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish within the Agency an Office of Energy and Resources Recovery to achieve the purposes and administer the provisions of this Act. Directs the Administrator, within one year of the date of enactment of this Act, after consultation with appropriate Federal, State interstate, regional, and local agencies and after opportunity for public hearings, to promulgate standards for collection, handling, disposal, and recovery of all hazardous and other solid waste which may, if improperly disposed of, cause air or water pollution or other environmental damage. States that the Administrator, in carrying out the provisions of this Act, may require the operator of any disposal system for hazardous or other solid waste to: (1) establish and maintain such records; (2) make such reports; and (3) install, use, and maintain such monitoring equipment or methods as he may require. Establishes a $25,000 per day fine for violations of this Act. Requires the Administrator, within one year following enactment of this section and each year thereafter, to publish guidelines specifying the percentages of energy and resources that can be recovered from solid waste by use of the best recovery management practices and technology that are reasonably available. Provides that as a part of such guidelines, the Administrator shall publish thorough descriptions of existing technology and practices which can be implemented by agricultural producers, industries, municipalities, consumers, and others to achieve the percentages of energy or resource recovery from each category of solid waste that the Administrator finds reasonable. Requires the Administrator, within one year following enactment of this section to make a complete assessment of the use of natural resources and recycled materials in product packaging; and establish guidelines for the packaging of products to encourage efficient use of such resources and materials with a consequential reduction in solid waste. Directs the Administrator to grant to each State 80 percent of the cost of a comprehensive solid waste management and energy and resource recovery program. Authorizes appropriations of $35,000,000 to carry out this Act for fiscal years 1975-1977. Authorizes grants to States to establish an energy and resources recovery research institute at one college in each State. Authorizes appropriations of $40,000,000 for fiscal years 1975-1977 for additional purposes of this Act. Empowers the Administration to make loans (either directly or in cooperation with banks or other lenders) to assist any small business concern in affecting additions to or alterations in the equipment, facilities, or methods of operation of such concern to recover energy and resources from solid waste."
