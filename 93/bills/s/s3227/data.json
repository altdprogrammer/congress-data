    "text": "Model Criminal Justice Reform Act - States that the ever-increasing number of serious crimes committed in the United States, the blacklog of criminal cases in the courts, and the overcrowded and inadequate conditions of correctional institutions require that only comprehensive reform can achieve a truly adequate system of criminal justice in the United States. Authorizes the Administrator of the Law Enforcement Administration to make grants and provide technical assistance to States and localities for demonstration projects in accordance with the provisions of this Act, beginning July 1, 1974, and ending June 30, 1981. Provides that a State or locality is eligible for assistance under this Act only if the Administrator determines, pursuant to regulations established by him, that a plan for comprehensive criminal justice system reform submitted to him pursuant to this Act establishes the reasonable likelihood of substantial and fundamental change in the criminal justice system of such State or locality within four years after the enactment of this Act. Requires each and any locality within such State having jurisdiction over the trial of criminal offenses to implement such necessary reforms as will insure that: (1) the trial of all such offenses (excluding juvenile offenses) will be commenced no later than sixty days from the date on which the defendant was arrested or from the date on which the defendant was charged by the authorities with such offense, whichever occurs first, and (2) the charges will be dismissed with prejudice for failure to comply with the requirements of this paragraph, except that the Administrator shall, by regulation, provide for the exclusion from such sixty-day period of any periods of delay that he designates as may reasonably be necessitated in the interest of justice. Directs each State and, where appropriate, each such locality within such State eligible to receive assistance under this Act: (1) to establish a system for classifying persons charged with, or convicted of, criminal offenses so as to permit individualized treatment and security standards appropriate to the individual; and (2) to establish a range of correctional facilities that are adequately equipped and staffed to treat the particular classifications of inmates assigned there, including small-unit, community-based correctional institutions. Requires each State to study, through an appropriate and responsible group, the consolidation of law enforcement agencies within such State, as best suited to the particular needs of that State; and to report to the Administrator on its findings not later than two years following the approval of its State plan under this Act. Provides that any State desiring to receive assistance under this Act shall submit a State plan consistent with such regulations as the Administrator may establish under this Act. States that a grant under this Act pursuant to an approved State plan for criminal justice reform may be made to the appropriate State at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Administrator deems necessary. Authorizes the Administrator to issue regulations to implement the provisions of this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to, and contract with, States and localities to pay 50 percent of the cost of planning and developing State plans and project applications under this Act. Directs the Administrator to pay in any fiscal year to each State which has a plan approved pursuant to this Act for that fiscal year that Federal share of the cost of such plan as determined by him. Sets forth the conditions under which the Administrator may withhold such payments. States that the Administrator and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access, for the purpose of audit and examination, to any books, documents, papers, and records of a grant recipient that are pertinent to the grant received. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
