    "text": "Child Abuse and Protective Services Amendments - Provides that where the State agency (which administers the plan for aid to needy families with children) has reason to believe that the home in which a relative and child receiving aid reside is unsuitable for the child because of the neglect, abuse, or exploitation of such child it shall bring such condition to the attention of the appropriate court or other agency, including law enforcement agencies, in the State providing such data with respect to the situation it may have, and that the State agency will provide such multidisciplinary services (including, but not limited to medical, legal, social, and other services) as necessary to aid the prevention, identification, and treatment of child abuse and neglect. Provides for payments to State child welfare plans if such plans provide for the establishment and implementation of effective procedures for the prevention, identification, and treatment of cases of child abuse or neglect including, but not limited to: (1) procedures for the discovery and reporting of instances of neglect or abuse of children; (2) use of the full resources of local communities including public and nonprofit agencies and organizations which provide services and activities that would be beneficial to a child and his parents or guardians; (3) a systematic method for receiving reports of suspected or known instances of child abuse or neglect on a twenty-four-hour a day basis; and (4) a central collection point for all data and information on child abuse and neglect. Exempts expenditures for multidisciplinary services (including, but not limited to, medical, legal, social, and other services) as necessary to aid the prevention, identification, and treatment of child abuse and neglect, from the requirement that not more than 10 percent are to be paid in providing services to individuals who are not recipients of certain aid or assistance."
