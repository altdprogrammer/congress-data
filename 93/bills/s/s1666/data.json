States that any administrative or managerial official of the Postal Service who knowingly and willfully engages in specific actions to violate any of these service standards, or to prevent or impede the efficient and effective application of and adherence to such standards, shall be discharged from the Postal Service. Provides that public service costs, as determined by postal service, for providing a maximum degree of effective and regular postal service nationwide, in communities where postal office may not be deemed self-sustaining, as elsewhere, and in complying with this Act at reasonable and equitable rates and fees shall be paid out of the general fund of the Treasury and shall not constitute direct charges in the form of rates and fees upon any user or class of users of such public services, or of the mails generally."
