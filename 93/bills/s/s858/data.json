Provides that the committee shall decide if the assertion of executive privilege is well taken and if not, the employee shall be ordered to provide the testimony or document sought. Provides that information under the custody or control of any agency of the Government is to be made available to Congress under the procedures outlined in this Act. Provides that the General Accounting Office shall halt the funding of any agency or department which does not comply with the provisions of this Act."
