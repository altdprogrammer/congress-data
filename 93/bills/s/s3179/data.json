States that the anti-trust provisions governing atomic energy licenses shall not apply to an application for a license to construct and/or operate a utilization or production facility under specified circumstances. (Formerly provision limited to \"construct or operate.\") (Amends 42 U.S.C. 2135(2)). Expands the powers of the Commission with respect to the requiring of reports and the keeping of records. (Amends 42 U.S.C. 2201o). Limits the review authority of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards to cases specifically requested by the Commission. (Amends 42 U.S.C. 2232 (b)). Enumerates the procedures for the issuing of licenses to construct or modify production or utilization facilities and for revocation of licenses. Makes a technical and conforming amendment to procedures for modification of Licenses. (Amends 42 U.S.C. 2235-37). Authorizes the Commission to establish one or more atomic safety and licensing boards. Outlines the scope of their duties. Provides that any person may file with the Commission an application for approval of a site for one or more utilization or production facilities notwithstanding the fact that no application for a construction permit or a combined construction permit and operating license has been filed with the Commission.
