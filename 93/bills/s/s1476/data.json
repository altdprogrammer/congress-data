    "text": "Unfair Competition Act - States that any person shall be deemed to have engaged in unlawful and unfair competition under the Federal Trade Commission Act if he engages in any act, practice, or course of conduct, in or affecting commerce, which: (1) results, or is likely to result, in passing off goods or services which he offers as or for those of any other person, by reason of his copying or otherwise imitating or utilizing the product configuration, packaging, trade name, or other merchandising practice of such other person in specified circumstances; (2) materially and falsely disparages another person's goods or services to actual or prospective purchasers thereof; or (3) by a materially false or misleading statement, or by the omission of material information, misrepresents his or another person's goods or services, to actual or prospective purchasers therof. Provides that any person injured in his business by unlawful and unfair competition of this section, or likely to be injured by unlawful and unfair competition may bring a civil action for relief in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the person who has committed such unlawful and unfair competition. Provides that such person who establishes that he has been injured or is likely to be injured, may be granted an injunction, in accordance with the principles of equity, upon his establishing that such injunction is necessary to prevent actual and continuing damage."
