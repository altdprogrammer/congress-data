    "text": "Market Efficiency Study Act - Establishes a Commission on Economic Efficiency. States that it shall be the duty of the Commission to conduct a study and investigation to determine the extent of, and to formulate recommendations for removing, all public and private barriers to an efficient market economy. Requires that in carrying out its duty with respect to public barriers, the Commission shall examine and consider the elimination, retention, or modification of: (1) direct subsidies; (2) indirect subsidies, including tax subsidies; (3) production and marketing quotas; (4) price-support programs; (5) stockpiling programs; (6) prevailing wage determination programs; (7) excessive or counterproductive regulation of transportation, communication, or fuels and resources; (8) import quotas and voluntary import curtailment agreements; (9) retail price maintenance programs; and (10) such other barriers as the Commission shall determine interfere substantially with the operation of an efficient market economy. Stipulates that in examining private barriers to free market economy the Commission should take into account the need for: (1) divestiture in or reorganization of noncompetitive industries; (2) improved enforcement and administration of antitrust laws, including the transfer of all enforcement responsibilities to an independent Federal agency; (3) the removal of artificial barriers to employment; and (4) such other barriers as the Commission shall determine interfere substantially with the operation of an efficient market economy. States that the Commission shall also make such recommendations as may be appropriate for the provision of adjustment assistance for employees who suffer economic injury as a result of the implementation of the Commission's recommendations. Authorizes appropriations of up to $3,000,000 to carry out the provisions of this Act."
