    "text": "Cargo Security Act - Expresses the findings of Congress and declares the purposes of this Act. Title I: Amendments to Interstate Commerce Act and Federal Aviation Act of 1958 - Provides that the Interstate Commerce Commission shall prescribe reasonable limits on the amount of cargo lost, missing, stolen, presumed stolen, or otherwise unaccounted for, from common carriers during such period or periods as may be specified by the Commission. States that the Commission may prescribe different limits for different classes of carriers and different types of cargo and provide for appropriate exceptions, including losses resulting from acts of God or other occurrences beyond the control of the carrier. Imposes penalties on any carrier that violates the limits prescribed. Authorizes to be appropriated $1,000,000 for each fiscal year to effect such limitation provisions. Requires the making of regulations prescribing reasonable limits on cargo losses by air carriers and foreign air carriers and forwarders. Title II: Customs Port Security - Customs Port Security Act - Declares that it is the purpose of this title to establish a security program for international maritime cargo, which takes into consideration differences in port topography, and the type and volume of cargo handled. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish such cargo security measures as he may find necessary to protect and safeguard cargo at terminals at a port of entry. Imposes civil penalties on any carrier or terminal operator who fails to comply with any regulation issued pursuant to this title. Provides that if the Secretary determines that the imposition of civil penalties or other sanctions against a terminal operator are unavailing to secure its compliance with procedures made applicable to such terminal pursuant to this title he may prohibit the unlading of imported cargo or the lading of cargo for export at such terminal until compliance is achieved, except that, in the case of cargo transiting the United States destined for another country, it may be unladed and laded at such terminal for purposes of immediate transfer from one carrier to another carrier. Authorizes to be appropriated $500,000 for each fiscal year to effect the purposes of this title. Title III: Studies and Other Provisions - Directs the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and the Department of Transportation to conduct studies to determine and evaluate for the purpose of improving cargo security: (1) methods to deter cargo theft, including analysis of labor-management practices; (2) packaging and labeling of cargo; (3) containerization; (4) claims rules and practices; (5) documentation and waybill practices; (6) carrier insurance and liability standards; and (7) such other matters as may be appropriate. Authorizes to be appropriated such amounts as may be necessary for such purposes. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to carry out specified programs relating to cargo security systems. Authorizes appropriations for such purposes. Establishes an Interagency Council on Transportation Security. Provides that the functions of the Council shall be to: (1) identify Federal department and agency responsibilities in improving cargo security; (2) facilitate interagency communication; (3) obtain and exchange the views and advice of member departments and agencies having statutory responsibilities or a substantial interest in cargo security; (4) propose and review plans, activities, and programs within the Federal Government dealing with cargo security; (5) coordinate Federal activities in carrying out the provisions of this Act; and (6) coordinate State and local government agencies activities."
