Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to develop: (1) a comprehensive national fire research and development program to determine the causes of fires, frequency of occurrence, and other pertinent factors, and develop more effective measures of protection against the hazards of death, injury, and damage to property resulting from fire; (2) educational and training programs in fire safety; and (3) a comprehensive fire data and information program. Directs the Secretary to coordinate and review existing and future Federal interagency research and development programs, fire data programs, and fire training and education programs. Provides that the Secretary shall appoint a Fire Safety Advisory Council, to be composed of fifteen members, which he may consult before taking any action under this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. States that the Secretary may perform the functions authorized by the Act either directly or through contracts. (Repeals 15 U.S.C. 278(f) and (g))"
