Permits the Governor of a non-contiguous State to elect to have all or part of one or more of such non-contiguous State's Federal-aid-highway system apportionments for a fiscal year made available to the Secretary for making grants in that year to such non-contiguous State, or to local public bodies or agencies in such non-contiguous State. Requires such grants to be made in accordance with the provisions of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964, or in accordance with any other Act of Congress authorizing grants to the several States, or political subdivisions thereof, for providing transportation facilities and services, including the development of plans for balanced statewid, metropolitan or regional transportation systems within such non-contiguous State; except that not to exceed one-half of the amount available to the Secretary for making such grants in any non-contiguous State may, upon the requrest of the Governor of such non-contiguous State, be paid to such non-contiguous State, or such agency or agencies thereof as the Governor may designate, for expenditure in accordance with the laws of such non-contiguous State for transportation purposes. Provides that such election shall be made in such manner as the Secretary shall be regulation prescribe, within sixty days after he certifies to the Governor the sums apportioned to that non-contiguous State for a fiscal year. Requires the Governor in making such election, to specify the amount to be deducted from one or more of the non-contiguous State for a fiscal year. Requires the Governor in making such election, to specify the amount to be deducted from one or more of the non-contiguous State's Federal-aid-highway system apportionments in order to make available to the Secretary amounts elected to be used for transportaion purposes. Provides that if the amount which a Governor of a non-contiguous State elects to have used in a fiscal year for transportaion in such non-contiguous State exceeds the sum of amounts expended and obligated by the Secretary in such fiscal year in such non-contiguous State from amounts appropriated, then at the end of such fiscal year, such excess shall no longer be available for such purposes and shall, on January 1 of the next succeeding fiscal year, be added to the non-contiguous State's Federal-aid-highway system apportionments for the second fiscal year beginning after such election. Requires the addition to each of a non-contiguous State's apportionments to bear the same proportion to such excess as the amount deducted from the corresponding apportionment for the fiscal year in which such excess occurred bore to the amount elected to be used for transportation purposes in such fiscal year. Defines various terms in this Act."
