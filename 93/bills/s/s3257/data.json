    "text": "Job Security Assistance Act - Title I: Unemployment Compensation Amendments - Provides that with respect to benefit years beginning on or after July 1, 1976, the weekly benefit amount for any individual eligible for unemployment compensation shall be: (1) an amount equal to at least one-half of such individual's average weekly wage as determined by the State agency; or (2) the maximum weekly benefit amount payable under such State law, whichever is the lesser. Requires that the state maximum weekly benefit amount shall be no less than 66 2/3 percent of the statewide average weekly wage most recently computed before the beginning of the individual's benefit year. States that compensation shall not be paid to any person who the State finds is a striker under the law of that State. Stipulates that compensation shall not be denied to any other person otherwise eligible who is unemployed as a result of a labor dispute and who the State finds is an innocent bystander under the law of that State. Extends coverage of unemployment compensation to agricultural labor performed for an employer who during any calendar quarter in the calendar year for the preceding calendar year paid remuneration in cash of $5,000 or more to individuals employed in agricultural labor; or on each of some 20 days during the calendar year or preceding calendar year, each day being in a different calendar week, employed in agricultural labor for some portion of the day (whether or not at the same moment of time) 4 or more individuals. Increases the unemployment compensation tax on wages paid from 0.5 percent to 0.58 percent. Title II: Special Unemployment Compensation Program - Special Unemployment Compensation Act - Provides that each State which enters into an agreement with the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to which it makes payments of special unemployment compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor hereunder, shall be paid by the United States from time to time such amounts as are deemed necessary by the Secretary of Labor to carry out the provisions of this Act in the State. Provides that an individual shall be eligible to receive a payment of special unemployment compensation or waiting period credit with respect to a week of unemployment occurring during and subsequent to a special unemployment compensation period in accordance with the provisions of this Act if the individual: (1) has exhausted all rights to regular, additional, and extended compensation under all State unemployment compensation law and has no further rights to regular, additional, or extended compensation under any State or Federal unemployment compensation law (including the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act) with respect to such week of unemployment, and is not receiving compensation with respect to such week of unemployment under the unemployment compensation law of Canada; or (2) is not otherwise eligible for compensation under any State or Federal unemployment compensation law (including the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act) with respect to such week of unemployment and is not receiving compensation with respect to such week of unemployment under the unemployment compensation law of Canada; and (3) if the individual is totally or partially unemployed, and is able to work, and is available for work, within the meaning of the applicable State unemployment compensation law, and is not subject to disqualification under that law; and (4) the individual has filed a claim for compensation or waiting period credit under this Act; and (5) in the area in which the individual was last employed for at least one week prior to filing a claim under this Act for compensation or waiting period credit with respect to such week of unemployment, a special unemployment compensation period is in effect with respect to such week of unemployment. Sets forth schedules for the determination of special unemployment compensation periods and weekly benefit amounts under this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
