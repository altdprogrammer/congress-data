Defines the term \"foreign agent\". Provides that no officer or employee of the United States shall engage in the exercise of any powers by means involving the interception of wire or oral communications unless such officer or employee is first specifically authorized in writing, by the President. Requires authorization for interception of wire or oral communications in national security cases. Sets forth the procedure for interception of such communications relating to national security by requiring applications for an order authorizing or approving the interception of a wire or oral communication to be made in writing upon oath or affirmation to a judge of competent jurisdiction. Specifies the content required in any such application."
