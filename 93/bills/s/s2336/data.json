    "text": "Public School Jurisdiction Act - Expresses the findings of Congress and declares that it is necessary and proper that the Congress take action: (1) to enhance the enforcement of court determinations under the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (2) to make court enforcement uniform; and (3) to relieve the congestion of court calendars by providing for the orderly release of continuing Federal jurisdiction over desegregated public schools. Sets forth the definition of \"unitary school system\" under this Act. Provides, under title IV of the Civil Rights Act, that the continuing applicability of any court order requiring the desegregation of public schools shall terminate upon a determination by jury or by a court having review jurisdiction that such schools are and have been a unitary school system for a period of not less than a full school year. States that no district court or court of appeals of the United States shall have original, continuing, or pendent jurisdiction to issue in any case or controversy any command directing, forbidding, or changing: (1) the assignment or transportation of any student; (2) the employment, transfer, or retention of teaching or administrative staffs; (3) any appropriation or expenditure of any funds for any such school; or (4) the accreditation of any such school."
