Empowers the Federal Communications Commission with plenary regulatory jurisdiction over CATV systems, including such areas of regulation as: (1) the origination of programming; (2) the maintenance of technical standards; (3) size and ownership restrictions; (4) pole and duct rates and practices; (5) the setting of franchising standards; (6) use of nonbroadcast channels; and (7) coordination of interconnection and technical compatability. Permits the Commission to authorize the regulation of CATV systems in specified areas."
