    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, in leasing the coal lands or deposits owned by the United States, to award such leases by competitive bidding. Provides that such leases be issued after adoption of comprehensive land use plans prepared in consultation with State and local governments and with opportunity for public review. Eliminates prospecting permits and preference right leases under the Mineral Leasing Act. Provides that coal leases be for a specified term of 20 years and so long thereafter as coal is annually produced. States that within one year after obtaining a coal lease, lessees must submit a development and reclamation plan which must be followed if approved. Broadens the purposes for which moneys paid to the States can be used and the revenue sharing provision of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 so that, in addition to use for roads and schools, such revenues may also be used for planning, construction and maintenance of public facilities."
