Declares public policy on means of increasing timber supplies while improving the quality of the forest environment and in ecological relationships. Title I: Forestry Incentive for Non-Federal Lands - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out a forestry incentive program for non-Federal lands, to allot program grants, to issue advisory guidelines for program actions, and to act on State-prepared program plans.

Authorizes forestry incentive payments for environmental and aesthetic benefits, for recreational use, for public access, and for wildlife habitat. Title II: Forestry Research, Education, and Technical Assistance - Allocates funds for forestry research, education, and technical assistance in the management and development of forest resources. Title III: Federal Forest Land Management - Establishes a Forest Land Management Fund in the Treasury of the United States to fund sustained yield, multiple use and environment programs. Provides that there shall be credited to the Fund all receipts from the sale of timber and other forest products from the national forests and from the national domain lands. Authorizes the Secretary to expend the Fund to improve the intensity and quality of forest management through sustained yield management, development, and protection of forest resources; through the restoration, maintenance and enhancement of the quality of the forest environment and the utilization of ecological information to protect endangered species, to enhance air and water quality, and to promote scenic beauty; through the multiple-use balancing of forest resources; and through the expansion of forestry and wood utilization research. Establishes priorities for the expenditure of money allocated from the Fund. Directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to require contractors and permittees, in the sale or use of Federal timber and forest products, to install safeguards to minimize unfavorable environmental impact. Title IV: National Advisory Board - Establishes a National Forestry Policy Board, composed of not less than fifteen nor more than nineteen members appointed by the President. States the purposes of such Board and the requirements for members on such board. Title V: Policy Goals Involving Forest Lands and Resources - Requires the President to develop and establish a long range national policy with respect to program goals for forest lands within the United States. Requires the President to transmit to the Congress a report on such national policy. Requires the President to present to the Congress estimates of the forest lands and their resources budget needs covering each ten-fiscal-year period. Requires the Congress to establish a statement of policy to guide the President in framing a fiscal budget covering forest lands and their resources. Requires the President to report annually on operations involving or affecting forest lands and their resources within the United States. Title VI: General Provisions - Authorizes the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to issue rules and regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act.
