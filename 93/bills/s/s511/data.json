Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) develop and prescribe forms and standards for the notices of representation and reports filed by persons required to maintain records; (2) compile information contained in notices of representation and reports filed, with respect of each filing period; (3) report such information to the Congress after the end of each filing period; (4) make available for public inspection at reasonable times in the General Accounting Office in the District of Columbia, for a period of six years following the date of filing, all notices of representation, amendments thereto, and reports filed by persons required to maintain records; (5) have each notice of representation and each amendment thereto which is filed by any legislative agent published in the Congressional Record within three days after each such notice is received by the Comptroller General; (6) ascertain whether any person required to maintain records has failed to file a report, or has filed an incomplete or inaccurate report, and promptly notify such persom to file or amend such report in order to satisfy the requirements of this Act or regulations prescribed by the Comptroller General under this Act; and (7) prepare a special study and report upon the request of any Member of the House of Representatives or the Senate from information in the records of the Comptroller General.
