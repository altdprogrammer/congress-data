    "text": "Offshore Marine Environment Protection Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to provide for the fullest protection of the marine environment possible to prevent adverse impact which may result from the construction and operation of large-scale offshore artificial structures. Provides that no person shall construct or operate an artificial structure as defined in this Act until the Secretary of the Department in which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is operating shall have certified that the artificial structure does not pose an unreasonable threat to the integrity of the marine environment in which it is to be located, and that all possible precautions have been taken to minimize adverse impact on the marine environment. Establishes criteria to be considered by the Secretary in reviewing and evaluating applications to build artificial offshore structures. Directs that copies of any communications, documents, reports, or information received or sent by any applicant (except those which relate to trade secrets) shall be made available to the public upon identifiable request. Provides that, in evaluating the effect of any proposed artificial structure on navigation, the Secretary shall consult with and obtain the views of the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating. Prescribes a fine of not less than $50,000 nor more than $200,000 for any person who begins to construct, constructs, or operates an artificial structure after the effective date of this Act without a prior certification by the Secretary. Authorizes to be appropriated $1,000,000 each for the fiscal years 1974, 1975, and 1976 for the administration of this Act."
