    "text": "Food Consumers' Protection Act - Provides that the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare shall formulate and prescribe a system of food quality grade designations, expressed in a uniform nomenclature, for all food products. States that no person shall distribute or cause to be distributed in commerce any packaged or labeled food product except in accordance with regulations which shall be prescribed by the Secretary. Requires that such grade designations shall appear in conspicuous and legible type on each food package. Provides that the food quality designations for food products adopted by the Secretary shall be grades A to E in descending order of the quality of the food product. States that the Secretary shall immediately initiate and carry out a program of consumer education in conjunction with the promulgation of food quality designations prescribed by him. Provides that the Secretary shall prescribe regulations which shall require that any food product distributed in interstate commerce bear a label containing a statement specifying all the ingredients contained in such food products in the order of their predominance. States that no person shall distribute or cause to be distributed in commerce any packaged or labeled food except in accordance with such regulations. Provides that no person shall distribute or cause to be distributed in commerce any packaged or labeled food product except in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary which shall require that any such product shall bear a label containing a statement specifying the nutritional value of food product contained therein. Sets forth labeling requirements for perishable and semiperishable foods. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations requiring that packages of perishable or semiperishable foods contain labels which show: (1) the pull date for such food; and (2) the optimum temperature and humidity conditions for its storage by the ultimate consumer. Provides that such pull date shall be expressed as such combination of letters and numbers as will enable the consumer to readily identify the day, month, and year comprising the pull date. Provides that any person who knowingly or willfully violates such labeling requirements with respect to perishable or semiperishable foods shall be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined not more than $5,000 or both; except that if such person commits a violation after a conviction of such person has become final, or commits such a violation with the intent to defraud or mislead, such person shall be imprisoned for not more than three years or fined not more than $25,000 or both. Provides that the commodities covered by this Act shall bear a label specifying the identity of the commodity and the name and place of business of its manufacturer, packer or distributor."
