Establishes a program of demonstration grants to be used in training personnel in the field of medicine, law and social work and to support innovative projects aimed at preventing or treating child abuse or neglect. Provides that not less than 50 percent of the funds appropriated under the Act for any fiscal year must be reserved for demonstration programs and projects authorized under this Act. States that of the sums appropriated under the Act, not less than 5 percent and not more than 20 percent may be used for grants to the States for programs authorized by the Act. Makes provisions for a State to qualify for assistance under the Act. Provides authorizations for fiscal years 1974 through 1977 of, respectively, $15,000,000; $20,000,000 $25,000,000 and $25,000,000. Directs to be made a complete and full study and investigation of the national incidence of child abuse and neglect, including a determination of the extent to which incidents of child abuse and neglect are increasing in number or severity. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to promulgate regulations and make such arrangements as may be necessary or appropriate to ensure that there is effective coordination between programs related to child abuse and neglect under this Act and other such programs which are assisted by Federal funds."
