    "text": "Federal Drug Abuse Enforcement Reorganization Act - Sets forth Congressional findings related to law enforcement and illegal drug traffic. Establishes in the Department of Justice an Office of Drug Abuse Investigation and Enforcement which shall be headed by a Deputy Attorney General appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. States that the Deputy shall: (1) review the investigative practices and capabilities, regulations, guidelines, and procedures for the several agencies under his direction and control as provided in this Act, in terms of their adequacy and consistency with the policies and priorities he provides or establishes; (2) recommend changes in organization, management, and personnel, which he deems advisable to implement the policies, priorities, and objectives he provides or establishes; and (3) conduct or provide for the conduct of evaluation and studies of the performance and results achieved by all Federal agencies working in the areas of drug abuse enforcement. Transfers to the Attorney General all of the functions of the Secretary of Treasury, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Secretary of State and Commissioner of customs which pertain to seizures and arrests, as well as manufacture and control, of narcotics and dangerous drugs. States that it is the intent of the this Act that the Federal Bureau of Investigation exercise investigative jurisdiction in cases involving alleged violations of Federal narcotics and drug abuse laws when it is determined by the Deputy and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, upon request of the Deputy that such exercise will facilitate the successful investigation and prosecution of such cases or the development of useful intelligence information, either independently or in concert with other Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies. Provides that in carrying out his functions under this Act, the Deputy shall strengthen coordination among all Federal departments and agencies engaged in law enforcement investigations, programs and activities, and activities which relate to drug abuse enforcement and control functions. Directs the Deputy to prepare for the Attorney General and the Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control an annual report on the use of the resources and personnel of the Federal Government and international organizations in which the United States is a member in controlling illicit narcotics traffic. Provides that the Deputy shall coordinate or assure coordination and cooperation of Federal drug enforcement functions with functions of State and local governments and agencies. Establishes a special fund under the direction and control of the Deputy, in order to provide: (1) incentives to Federal, State, and local law enforcement and other criminal justice agencies and international organizations, to develop innovative concepts, methods, and techniques in the investigation and successful prosecution of narcotics trafficking cases generally; and tactical and strategic intelligence information relating to the nature, extent, and impact of such trafficking, and to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of local law enforcement efforts in this area; and (2) funding assistance to such agencies, particularly local law enforcement agencies, to complete successfully specific cases against major narcotics traffickers, and to expedite the disposition of narcotics trafficking cases within local judicial systems. Authorizes for the purposes of providing such assistance appropriations of $30,000,000 for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1973 and $30,000,000 for each of the next succeeding fiscal years."
