Provides that no person shall, on the grounds of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any activity carried on or receiving Federal assistance under any title of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act. States that no person who is eligible for assistance under such Act shall be denied eligibility if he moved from facilities occupied in anticipation of General Services Administration Lease Project GS-03-B-5960 in Alexandria, Virginia. States that any person who moves from his place of business currently located at 57 Kneeland Street, Boston, as a result of the Naltional Cancer Institute Research Center Grant awarded to Tufts University shall be deemed to be a displaced person and eligible for assistance under such Act."
