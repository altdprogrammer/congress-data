Authorizes an allowance of up to $5,000 for official consultation, representation, and other extraordinary expenses to be expended at the discretion of the Director. Authorizes an appropriation for fiscal year 1974 not to exceed $3,000,000 for expenses of the National Science Foundation incurred outside of the United States to be financed from foreign currencies which are determined by the Treasury Department to be in excess of the normal requirements of the United States. Outlines conditions under which institutions of higher education are to deny or withdraw assistance, for a period of two years under specified programs, from individuals involved in acts which constitute substantial disruptions to such institutions."
