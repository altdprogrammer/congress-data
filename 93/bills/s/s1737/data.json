Provides that whenever any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States violates or threatens to violate this Act, the school board aggrieved by the violation or threatened violation, or the parent of any student affected or to be affected by the violation or threatened violation, or any student affected or to be affected by the violation or threatened violation, or any member of any faculty affected or to be affected by the violation or threatened violation may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States complaining of the violation or threatened violation. Provides that no court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to make any decision, enter any judgment, or issue any order requiring any school board to make any change in the racial composition of the student body at any public school or in any class at any public school to which students are assigned in conformity with a freedom of choice system, or requiring any school board to transport any students from one public school to another public school or from one place to another place or from one school district to another school district in order to effect a change in the racial composition of the student body at any school or place or in any school district, or denying to any student the right or privilege of attending any public school or class at any public school chosen by the parent of such student in conformity with a freedom of choice system, or requiring any school board to close any school and transfer the students from the closed school to any other school for the purpose of altering the racial composition of the student body at any public school, or precluding any school board from carrying into effect any provision of any contract between it and any member of the faculty of any public school it operates specifying the public school where the member of the faculty is to perform his or her duties under the contract."
