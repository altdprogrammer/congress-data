    "text": "States that allocation regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 shall require conservation or curtailment of energy use for residential and space heating only to the extent that similar reductions in the consumption of substitute fuels or forms of energy used for the same purposes are required by the Federal Energy Administration or other appropriate Federal agency. Provides that the regulations promulgated under such Act shall not disproportionately require conservation among members of any class of consumers which could use substitute fuels or forms of energy for the same purposes."
