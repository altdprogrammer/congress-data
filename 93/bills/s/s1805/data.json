Provides that the individual's annuity computed under the preceding provisions of Railroad Retirement Act shall be increased in an amount equal to the difference between: (1) the amount (before any reduction on account of age) which would be payable to such individual under the then current law if his or her annuity were computed under this Act, without regard to the words plus 10 percent of such total amount contained therein; and (2) the amount (before any reduction on account of age) which would have been payable to such individual under the law aeffec effect prior to July 1, 1973, if his or her annuity had been computed under this Act without regard to the words plus 10 percent of such total amount contained therein. Revises the method of computing a spouse's annuity under this Act. Provides that representatives of employees and representatives of carriers shall, no later than July 1, 1974, report to the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare and the House of Representatives Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce their joint recommendations for restructuring the railroad retirement system based upon their negotiations and taking into account the report and specific recommendations of the Commission on Railroad retirement. Title II: Interstate Commerce Act Amendments - Railroad Rate Adjustment Act - Provides that notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Interstate Commerce Commission shall, within thirty days of the filing of a verified petition by any carrier of group of carriers subject to this part, permit the establishment of increases in the general level of both the interstate and intrastate rates of said carrier or carriers in an amount approximating that needed to offset increases in expenses theretofore experienced or demonstrably certain to occure commencing on or before the effective date of the increased rates, as a result of the enactment of title I of this Act. Requires the Commission to, within sixty days from the date of establishment of interim rates, commence hearings for the purpose of making the final rate determination. Requires the Commission to then proceed to make such final rate determination. Provides that in making such determination, the Commission may take into account all factors appropriate to ratemaking generally under part I of this Act and shall determine such final rates under the standards and limitations applicable to ratemaking generally under part I of this Act. States that whenever, under the provisions of this Act the Commission permits or authorizes any increase in the general level of rates, it shall require that any carrier or group of carriers making such an increase effective shall make it effective concurrently both as to interstate rate, fares, charges, classifications, regulations or practices and those made or imposed by authority of any State and such interstate increases shall be deemed to have been prescribed within the meaning and under the authority of this Act. Title III: Separability - Provides that if any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstances should be held invalid, the remainder of such Act or the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby."
