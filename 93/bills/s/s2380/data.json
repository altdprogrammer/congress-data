    "text": "Defines \"employer\", under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, to include persons who have twenty or more employees (formerly twenty-five or more employees). Includes State and local governments and instrumentalities and interstate agencies within the definition of \"employer\" for purposes of such Act. Increases the amount authorized to be appropriated for the Act from $3,000,000 to $5,000,000. Prohibits discrimination on account of age in any personnel action affecting employees or applicants for employment in the Federal Government, including military departments, the United States Postal Service, the units of the District of Columbia Government, and the legislative and judicial branches having positions in the competitive service. Authorizes the Civil Service Commission to enforce this prohibition against age discrimination through appropriate remedies. Requires an individual to file a notice with the Commission within 180 days after an alleged unlawful practice."
