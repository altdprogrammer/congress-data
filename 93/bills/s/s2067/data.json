Specifies that an individual shall not serve as a page of the Senate, House of Representatives or the Supreme Court of the United States before he has attained the age of eighteen, or, in other specified instances, the age of twenty-one. States that the eighteen year limitation shall not apply with respect to the reappointment of an individual. Provides for the education in the public school system of the District of Columbia of pages previously appointed. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to reimburse the District of Columbia for any additional expenses incurred by the public school system. Permits pages to continue to elect to attend private or public schools, but limits the amount to be reimbursed. Provides, under the Supplemental Appropriations Act, that the real property acquired for the page school shall be permanently used for such congressional purposes as the Commission for Extension of the United States Capitol may decide."
