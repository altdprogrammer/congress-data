Requires applicants for renewals of broadcasting licenses to (1) be legally, financially, and technically, qualified to hold such a license; (2) be substantially attuned to the needs and interests of the public in its service area; and (3) afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance. Sets forth the procedure to be followed when a renewal application is challenged by a petition to deny or by a competing application for the same broadcast service."
