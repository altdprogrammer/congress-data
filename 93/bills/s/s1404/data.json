    "text": "Educational and Cultural Postal Amendments - Authorizes a phased increase over a specified period of time in postage rates for second-class publications. States that such increases shall take place in two-year steps. Provides that the rates for the first 250,000 pieces of each issue of a second-class publication shall not exceed 66 2/3 percent of the applicable rates. Provides that after July 6, 1972, the revenues received from rates for second-class publications shall not exceed 50 percent of the published rate. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to credit to the Postal Service Fund such sums as may be determined by the Postal Service annually to be equal to the difference between the revenues the Postal Service would have received in the absence of specified reduced rates and the estimated revenues to be received on mail carried under such rates. Provides that the Postal Rate Commission shall in answering requests for changes in rates or fees in each class of mail or type of service, consider the educational, cultural, scientific, and informational value to the recipient of mailed materials. (Amends 39 U.S.C. 3622)"
