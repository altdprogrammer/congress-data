    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1973-06-20", 
    "text": "Offshore Shrimp Fisheries Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to issue permits to vessels to engage in shrimp fishing under requirements of the existing treaty between Brazil and the United States, this Act and other regulations. Limits the number of vessels at present which are subject to permits to 325 or a different number as specified in the treaty from time to time. Outlines the requirements of the permits and allows such permits to be suspended or revoked by the Secretary for failure to comply with any terms or conditions. Gives the permittee, upon suspension, the right to a prompt hearing by the Secretary. Declares the decision of the Secretary to be final and binding. Allows permits to be returned to the Secretary and reissued. Sets annual fees for a permit for 1973 at $1,230 plus not more than $200 for administrative costs. Provides that the method and time for application of permits be announced in advance by the Federal Register. Outlines the procedure for granting permits. Authorizes the Secretary to issue a letter of voluntary compliance to a vessel owner whose vessels have engaged in fishing in the area after May 9, 1972, who have met treaty requirements, and who have prior to August 1, 1972 deposited $700 to the Offshore Shrimp Fisheries Fund. Establishes the Offshore Shrimp Fisheries Fund to be used by the Secretary to make payments for enforcement expenses under article VI of the treaty. Requires each person in charge of a vessel with a permit to keep a logbook in such form and manner as prescribed under the treaty. Requires owners of such vessels to give additional information on shrimp fishery to Secretary. Requires such information to be treated as confidential commercial information. Gives the Secretary power to subpena all such logbooks, records or other information. Prohibits fishing or transship of shrimp in area of agreement unless the vessel is operating under permit issued under this Act. Prohibits any attempt to prevent duly authorized officers from searching or seizing any vessel pursuant to his duties under the treaty. Provides penalties for violations of this Act. Requires that the minimum penalty assessed be sufficient to cover enforcement expense incurred by the United States pursuant to article VI. Requires such minimum civil penalty to be deposited directly into the Offshore Shrimp Fisheries Fund. Provides that this Act be enforced jointly by the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of the department over the Coast Guard, and the Secretary of the Treasury. Empowers any duly authorized law enforcement officer of Brazil (acting under article V of the treaty) to act on behalf of the United States to enforce provisions of the treaty relating to search and seizure of any vessel. Authorizes the Secretary to issue all regulations necessary to carry out objectives of the treaty and this Act. Requires that prior to issue of any regulations dealing with marketing vessels or use of radio-telephone frequencies, the Secretary shall consult with Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. Authorizes appropriations necessary for expenses pursuant to article VI of the treaty to be deposited in the Offshore Shrimp Fisheries Fund. Authorizes appropriation necessary for domestic enforcement expenses and the expenses of administering the provisions of the treaty, the Act and the regulations."
