Provides that such internship program shall be carried out through arrangements with institutions of higher education and State and local governments under which students will serve as interns in offices of State and local elected officials. Provides that the students who have participated in the internship programs at State and local levels may become interns in the offices of Members of Congress for up to three months during the first year following the receipt of their bachelor's degree. Stipulates that students shall be chosen by the Agency from among those whose names are proposed by participating institutions. Limits the Federal contribution to the Program to one-half its cost. Authorizes the Agency to prescribe and administer the terms and conditions of internships, including stipends therefor. Authorizes an appropriation of $3 million in each of the three fiscal years 1974-1976, for carrying out the provisions of this Act."
