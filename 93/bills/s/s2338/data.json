    "text": "Coastal and Anadromous Fish Conservation Act - States that it is the purpose of this Act to provide for the conservation of fish under United States jurisdiction until such time as the necessary treaties or conventions can be entered into. Provides that the United States extends its jurisdiction for conservation purposes over all United States coastal and anadromous fish. Empowers the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize a vessel other than a vessel of the United States to engage in fishing for fish under the jurisdiction of the United States under specified terms and conditions. States that such fishing must not cause or significantly contribute to the commercial depletion of fish and that such fishing is to be carried out in accordance with good conservation practices. Enumerates the circumstances under which such fishery conservation jurisdiction may be terminated. Directs the Secretary of State to: (1)direct the United States delegation to the Law of the Seas Conference to support articles at the conference to carry out the policies of this Act; (2) initiate negotiations with foreign governments which are engaged in commercial fishing operations for fish protected by this Act; and (3) review treaties, conventions, and agreements to which the United States is a party in order to make them consistent with the policies of this Act. Authorizes appropriations necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
