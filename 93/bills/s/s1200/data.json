Prescribes that every brother or sister of an individual entitled to old age or disability insurance benefits, or of an individual who dies a fully and currently insured individual, shall be entitled to a brother's or sister's insurance benefit if such brother or sister: (1) has not attained the age of sixty-two; (2) has filed an application for brother's or sister's insurance benefits and was unmarried at the time such application was filed; (3) was receiving at least one-half of his support, as determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, from a brother or sister meeting specified requirements under this Act; and (4) is not entitled to old-age or disability insurance benefits or is entitled to such benefits which are less than he or she would be entitled to under this Act. Establishes provisions for the termination of benefits afforded under this Act. Stipulates that brother's or sister's insurance benefits for each month shall be equal to 82 1/2 percent of the primary insurance amount of the insured individual if such individual has died in or prior to such month.
