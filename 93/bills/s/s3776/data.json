    "text": "Requires restoration of jurors to former jobs in the public and private sector where they apply within 15 days of end of jury service. Stipulates that such individuals must still be qualified to perform their previous duties, and if so, will be restored to previous seniority, status, and pay. Provides that where a disability occurs during jury service, an individual must be given a job, if such exists, with his employer that he is able to perform. Provides that if during jury service the position of the employer changes so as to make restoration to employment of the juror unreasonable, he need not be so restored. States that jury service shall be considered furlough or leave of absence."
