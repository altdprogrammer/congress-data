Prohibits the transfer of any lands held in trust for any Indian Tribe. Abolishes the Grand Canyon National Monument and the Marble Canyon National Monument. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with other Federal, State, and local public departments and agencies and with interested Indian tribes to provide for the protection and interpretation of the Grand Canyon in its entirety. Declares the lands generally depicted as the Havasupai Reservation Addition be held by the United States in trust for the Havasupai Tribe and included in the Havasupai Reservation. Provides that (1) such lands may be used for traditional purposes, including religious purposes and the gathering of, or hunting for, wild or native foods, materials for paints and medicines; (2) such lands shall be available for use by the Havasupai Tribe for agricultural and grazing purposes, subject to the ability of such lands to sustain such use as determined by the Secretary; (3) any areas historically used as burial grounds may continue to be so used; (4) a study shall be made by the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Havasupai Tribal Council, to develop a plan for the use of such land by the tribe which shall include the selection of areas which may be used for residential, educational, and other community purposes for members of the tribe and which shall not be inconsistent with, or detract from, park uses and values; (5) no commercial timber production, no commercial mining or mineral production, and no commercial or industrial development shall be permitted on such lands, although the Secretary may authorize the establishment of such tribal small business enterprises as he deems advisable to meet the needs of the tribe which are in accordance with the plan provided under this Act; and (6) nonmembers of the tribe shall be permitted to have access across such lands at locations established by the Secretary in consultation with the Tribal Council in order to visit adjacent parklands, and with the consent of the tribe may be permitted to enter and temporarily utilize lands within the reservation in accordance with the plan provided under this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act, not to exceed, however, $1,250,000, in the aggregate for the period of the five fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 1974, for the acquisition of lands and property, and not to exceed $49,000 for fiscal year 1974, $255,000 for fiscal year 1975, $265,000 for fiscal year 1976, and $235,000 for fiscal year 1977, for development."
