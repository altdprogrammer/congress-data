States the objectives of the National Commission on Productivity and Work Quality (formerly known as the President's National Commission on Productivity) to be to help increase the productivity of the American economy and to help improve the morale and quality of work of the American worker. Provides that, in order to achieve these objectives, the Commission shall have the following primary functions: (1) to encourage and assist in the organization and work of labor-management committees which may also include public members, on a plant, community, regional, and industry basis; (2) to conduct such research as is directly necessary to achieve each of the objectives set forth when such research cannot appropriately be accomplished by other Government agencies or private organizations, and; (3) to publicize, disseminate, and otherwise promote material and ideas relating to its objectives. Directs the Commission to: (1) advise the President and the Congress with respect to Government policy affecting productivity and the quality of work; (2) coordinate and promote Government research and technical assistance efforts relating to productivity; and (3) provide technical and consulting assistance. Sets forth the reporting requirements for the Commission to Congress. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums, not to exceed $2,500,000, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act during the period from July 1, 1974 through June 30, 1975."
