Authorizes the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration to make grants to States for assisting families with annual incomes of $8,000 or less to meet the high cost of acquiring heating fuel during the present energy emergency. Authorizes appropriations of $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 for the purpose of making such grants. Directs the Administrator to allot to each State an amount equal to the amount appropriated under this Act multiplied by the ratio obtained by multiplying the temperature factor of the State by the number of eligible families in the State and then dividing that product by the sum of such products for all States."
