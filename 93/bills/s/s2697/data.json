Authorizes the Attorney General to exchange such records with the officials of federally chartered or insured banking institutions. Provides that all copies of records of information filed as a result of an arrest that is legally terminated in favor of the arrested individual shall be returned to that individual within sixty days of final disposition and shall not be maintained in the files of any Federal agency, if a copy of the formal court order disposing of the case is presented, or upon formal notice from one criminal justice agency to another. States that the Attorney General's authority to disseminate records indicating that an individual was arrested or charged with any criminal offense to noncriminal justice agencies shall expire on December 31, 1974."
