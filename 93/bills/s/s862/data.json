States that a person retiring under this Act, during a period of one year after the date of enactment of this Act, shall have his annuity reduced only by 1/12 of 1 percent for each full month the employee is under fifty-five years of age at the date of separation, except that such reduction shall not exceed 5 percent. (Amends 5 U.S.C. 8336(d))"
