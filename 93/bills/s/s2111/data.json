Exempts from these requirements: (1) any individual retail outlet which sells or offers for sale packaged consumer commodities and whose total gross sales do not exceed $250,000 per annum, unless such an outlet is one of a number of outlets owned substantially or whose inventory is supplied substantially, by a single person, partnership, or corporation whose total gross sales exceed $500,000 per annum; or (2) any retail outlet in any State or any political subdivsion thereof which has enacted mandatory unit pricing laws and whose laws, in the judgment of the Federal promulgatin authority, are in full force and effect and are comparable in scope and comprehensiveness to the requirements of this Act, except the retailers (including chainstores and affiliated stores) who operate outlets in any such geographical area who shall be subject to the provisions of this Act if they also operate outlets in one or more other States or political subdivisions."
