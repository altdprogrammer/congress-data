    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1973-02-21", 
    "text": "Electric Facilities Siting Act - Sets forth the findings and declares the purposes of the Act to be the furtherance of the national environmental policy set forth in the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. States that: (1) needed electric power facilities should be constructed in a timely and nationally beneficial manner; (2) there should be long-range planning of the construction and use of the nation's electric supply and facilities, and (3) there should be coordinated Federal and State programs. Requires that each electric utility, as part of a coordinated regional plan, shall annually prepare a long range ten year plan which contains and meets specification established by the Federal Power Commission. Requires that public notice be given of the filing of a plan by an electric utility. Authorizes the several States to designate a regional agency for certification of sites of electric facilities. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to review and to give final approval to an agency so designated by the States. Permits the Secretary to carry out the functions of such agency when none have been approved by him for a particular territory. Gives a State the right to appeal when dissatisfied with the Secretary's findings and provides remedies in those instances of appeal. Establishes a Federal Electric Facilities Sitings Panel within the Department of the Interior made up of designated representatives of specified Federal agencies. Directs the panel to; (1) develop a standard application form for all Federal authorizations; (2) develop a consolidated application form with each certifying agency; (3) coordinate Federal review of applications; (4) encourage high priority to electric facility applications; (5) coordinate Federal participation in review of the environmental inpact statement; and (6) transmit to the Secretary notice of authorization or denial by each Federal entity on the panel. Permits the certifying agency to waive the requirements of certification in certain instances for a period of 48 months from the date of enactment of this Act. Allows reopening of certification proceedings when it is shown that there has been a significant change in circumstances affecting the design characteristic of a facility. Outlines the criteria to be met in order for the certifying agency to issue a certificate of site and facility. Allows the certifying agency to approve an alternative site should the site prepared by the utility be unacceptable. Outlines those duties, responsibilities and powers of each certifying agency. Gives to an electric facility the right to acquire property by eminent domain where justified and the authorization, along with the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare, to assess and collect fees in an equitable manner for the cost of administration of the programs under this Act. Grants the consent of Congress to two or more States to enter into compacts, and provides for judicial review by any person adversely affected by any final order of the Secretary or State or Federal agency or department concerning the treatment of such individual's application. Specifies that the provisions of the Act shall not alter or affect the jurisdiction of the Council on Environmental Quality or the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Outlines those penalties applicable for violation of this Act."
