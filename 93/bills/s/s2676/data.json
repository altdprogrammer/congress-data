Enumerates the criteria under which the Secretary may approve an urban homestead program carried out by a local public agency, including the conditional conveyance of abandoned residential property by a local housing agency to an individual or a family without any substantial consideration. Requires the Secretary to conduct a continuing evaluation of programs carried out pursuant to this Act and, beginning with the third year, transmit an annual report to the Congress. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
