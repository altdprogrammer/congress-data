Provides that not later than six months after a national emergency is declared, and not later than the end of each six-month period thereafter that such emergency continues, each House of Congress shall meet to consider a vote on a concurrent resolution to determine whether that emergency shall be terminated. =Title III: Declarations of War by Congress= - Stipulates that whenever Congress declares war, any provisions of law conferring powers and authorities to be exercised during time of war shall be effective from the date of such declaration. =Title IV: Exercise of Emergency Powers and Authorities= - Requires that when the President declares a national emergency no powers or authorities made available by statute for use in the event of an emergency shall be exercised unless and until the President specifies the provisions of law under which he proposes that he, or other officers will act. =Title V: Accountability and Reporting Requirements of the President= - States that when the President declares a national emergency, or Congress declares war, the President shall be responsible for maintaining a file and index of all significant orders of the President, including Executive orders and proclamations. Requires that all such significant orders of the President, including Executive orders, and such rules and regulations shall be transmitted to the Congress promptly under means to assure confidentiality where appropriate. =Title VI: Repeal and Continuation of Certain Emergency Power and Other Statutes= - Repeals and continues specified provisions of law relating to emergency powers."
