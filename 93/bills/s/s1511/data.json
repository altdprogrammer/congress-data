States that concession agreements may be negotiated with any qualified proposer following due consideration of all proposals received after reasonble public notice of intention to contract. Provides that the concessioner shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to make a profit commensurate with the capital invested and obligations assumed and the consideration paid by him for the concession shall be based on the probable value of such opportunity and not on maximizing revenue to the United States. (Amends 42 U.S.C. 2473)"
