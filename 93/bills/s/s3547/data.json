    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1974-05-29", 
    "text": "States that any person seeking a license to site, manufacture, construct, or operate a utilization or production facility, as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, shall file an application for such license at least three years prior to the time construction of the facility is contemplated to begin. Provides that any such application shall include information sufficient to identify the site, size, and type of the proposed facility. Provides for a regulatory review process with respect to the granting of such a license in which any person who has an interest which may be adversely affected by the construction or operation of the facility may participate. Requires the applicant to file a request for authorization of at least one of nine specified actions within one year after the filing of the application, or the application will be dismissed without prejudice to a subsequent filing. States that an authorization for site selection and preparation shall not be granted unless there is sufficient information to permit an analysis of factors required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
