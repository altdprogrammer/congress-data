    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Special Employment Assistance Act - =Title I: Public Service Employment= - Authorizes the appropriation of $4,000,000,000 for fiscal year 1974 to enable eligible applicants to carry out programs providing transitional public service employment and training. Presecribes a formula for allocation of such funds. Allows prime sponsors, under the Comprhensive Employment and Training Act of 1973, to use funds obligated for public service employment for projects planned to extend over a 12-month period. Disallows a requirement that applicants place a proportion of public service jobholders in other jobs. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to recommend to prime sponsors an aim of maintaining a nationwide average in federally supported wage rates per public service jobholder of $7,500. Authorizes necessary appropriations for carrying out Title III of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973. Requires that there be a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Affairs within the Department of Labor to serve as the Director of the Veterans' Employment Service. Assigns him the duty of administering policies and programs of the Department affecting veterans, especially those relating to employment and traning. Requires the Secretary to provide a public information program, in cooperation with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Veterans' Administration, for acquainting veterans with opportunities under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973, and other provisions of law, and for acquainting labor unions and employers with their obligations under such laws. =Title II: Special Unemployment Assistance Act= - Provides for the payment to each State, which enters into a specified agreement with the Secretary of Labor, of such amounts as are deemed necessary by the Secretary to carry out the provisions of this title in the State. Sets forth a schedule whereunder eligible individuals may receive a payment of assistance or waiting period credit based upon a week of unemployment. Sets a special unemployment assistance period under this title. Sets forth a schedule for determining the weekly benefit amount payable under this title. Sets a limit on the program duration under this title. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out this title for fiscal years 1975 and 1976. =Title III: Job Opportunities Program= - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to provide financial assistance to Federal programs and projects identified through a specified review process. Requires that in allocating funds under this title, the Secretary shall give priority consideration to: (1) the severity of unemployment in the area; and (2) the appropriateness of the proposed activity in relation to the number and needs of unemployed persons in eligible areas. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the heads of departments and agencies of the Federal Government responsible for the administration of laws authorizing Federal financial assistance to States and local communities, to review proposed expenditures of such laws for the next calendar year to evaluate the job effectiveness of such proposed expenditure and to identify programs and projects which have the potential to stimulate job creation in eligible areas. Authorizes to be appropriated $1,000,000,000 for the period fiscal year 1975 to carry out the provisions of this title, except that no further obligation of funds appropriated under this title may be made subsequent to a determination that the average rate of unemployment has receded below 6.5 per cent for three consecutive calendar months as determined by the Secretary of Labor."
