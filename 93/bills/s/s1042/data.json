Directs the President, if he approves a bill, to place on it his signature and the date and, if he so desires, the word \"approved.\" Provides that if the President does not approve a bill presented to him, he shall return it with his objections to the House in which it originated. States that if he returns a bill prior to adjournment but when the respective House is not actually in session, then presentation to an officer designated and authorized by that House to receive bills under those circumstances shall constitute a return of the bill. Provides that the House to which the bill is returned shall enter the Presidents's objections at large on their Journal and proceed to reconsider it. Directs that if any bill is not returned by the President or his successor in office within 10 days, Sunday excepted, after it is presented as provided for in the bill, it shall be law in like manner as if he had signed it unless either the House or Senate prevent its return by their having adjourned sine die.
