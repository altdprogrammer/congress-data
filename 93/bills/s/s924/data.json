    "text": "Land Use Policy and Planning Assistance Act of 1973 - Title I: Findings, Policy and Purpose - Makes the following findings: (1) there is a national interest and need for a more efficient system of land use; (2) there is a lack of understanding of the land use policies established by individual States, regions, and localities; (3) adequate data and information is not readily available to land use decision makers; (4) land resources have too often been wasted because of failure to conduct competent planning; (5) because of lack of coordinated planning between governmental levels there develop conflicts and delays in executing land use policies; (6) primary responsibility in the area of land use should rest with the States and local government with guidance from the national government; and (7) the decision making process in land use planning affects and should include those persons at all income levels and back grounds. Declares a national policy to promote, encourage, develop, assist, and implement land use programs for the general welfare and well being of the United States. Title II: Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make grants to those States whose land use plans according to his judgment meet the criteria established by this Act. Requires the Secretary to consult with the heads of specified Federal agencies during the five year period after the enactment of this Act to consider their views and recommendations. Requires the Federal, State, and local projects and activities which effect land use to be consistent with the land use policies established by this Act. Authorizes hearings to be held and recommendations made where Federal action is to affect a non-Federal area not receiving grants under this Act. Reduces those funds to which a State is entitled under the Airport and Airways Development Act, from Federal-aid highways funds, and under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, if such State is found ineligible for grants under this Act. Title III: Administration of Land Use Policy - Establishes the National Advisory Board on Land Use Policy and designates its members and responsibilities. Requires that the States make available to those interstate entities involved in land use planning a portion of the funds allocated to the State provided such entity is in conformity with the purposes and goals of this Act. Title IV: General - Authorizes the President to designate an agency or agencies to set guidelines for agencies working under this Act. Requires a biennial report to be made to the President and Congress from the Board with the assistance of the Secretary of the Interior. Permits the Secretary to utilize personnel of other agencies and to provide technical assistance to States receiving funds under this Act. Sets forth the judicial procedure to be used in carrying out the provisions of the Act. Requires those States receiving funds to make reports and keep specified financial records. Authorizes appropriations for five fiscal years following the enactment of this Act."
