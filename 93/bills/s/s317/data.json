    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare or his designee to receive, investigate, settle, and pay all claims against the United States for death or permanent mental or physical injury resulting from participation in the continuing study conducted by the Public Health Service in Macon County, Alabama, beginning in 1932, to determine the medical consequences of untreated syphilis. Authorizes the Secretary to issue rules of procedure for the consideration and disposition of claims filed under this Act. Directs the Secretary to determine the validity and amounts of such claims and to pay such amount within twelve months from the date on which the claim was submitted. Prohibits the Secretary from awarding in excess of $25,000 for any claim for death or permanent mental or physical injuries. Provides that the award shall be in full settlement and discharge of all claims of such person against the United States. Prevents the assignment or transfer of such claims except to the United States. Requires the Secretary to submit a report within two years of enactment of this Act to the Congress setting forth the details of each settlement and those claims which have not been settled. Authorizes necessary funds to carry out the provisions of this Act."
