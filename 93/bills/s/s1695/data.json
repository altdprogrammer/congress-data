Sets forth the administrative duties and functions of the Agency. Title II: Economic and Manpower Assistance to Workers - Provides that any adversely affected worker may file an application with the Secretary for one or more of the forms of economic adjustment assistance provided under this title. States that economic adjustment assistance under this title consists of: (1) readjustment allowances; (2) training and counseling benefits; (3) relocation allowances; (4) early retirement benefits; and (5) health benefits. States that the Secretary shall determine whether an applicant is entitled to receive the economic adjustment assistance for which application is made and shall furnish such assistance if the applicant is so entitled. Provides that such determination shall be made as soon as possible after the date on which application is filed but in any event not later than thirty days after such date. Sets forth the qualifying requirements and amount limitations applicable to each of the forms of economic adjustment assistance. Title III: Public Service Employment Opportunities - States that notwithstanding any other provision of law, from sums appropriated pursuant to this Act, the Secretary is authorized to provide financial assistance to any State or locality for public service employment programs for adversely affected workers on terms and conditions as substantially similar to the provisions of the Emergency Employment Act of 1971 as the Secretary determines to be consistent with the purposes of this Act. Title IV: General Provisions - Provides that no person designated by the Secretary as a certifying officer, or disbursing officer shall, in the absence of gross negligence or intent to defraud the United States, be liable with respect to the payment of any allowance certified by him under this Act. States that whoever makes a false statement of a material fact knowing it to be false, or knowingly fails to disclose a material fact, for the purpose of obtaining or increasing for himself or for any other person any payment or assistance authorized to be furnished under this Act shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
