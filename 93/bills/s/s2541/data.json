    "text": "Provides, under the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, that mandatory health and safety standards shall not become effective until it is proven by suitable testing and experience that they will improve or contribute to the health or safety of the miner. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit data and information justifying the adoption of such standards. Requires the Secretary to make a comparison of the effectiveness of the health and safety standards pre-existing under the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act and those standards under the Act. Requires that: (1) notice of public hearings on proposed standards be issued to each mine operator and miner representative, and (2) that copies of all final standards or regulations are to be sent by certified mail to each miner representative and mine operator. Authorizes the Secretary of Interior to appoint an Advisory Committee on Coal Mine Safety Research, and requires the Committee to consult with, and make recommendations to, the Secretary on matters involving coal mine safety research. Requires immediate notification to the operator of the nature of an alleged violation. Permits the use of approved respirators on a temporary basis for the purpose of correcting hazardous situations where it is impossible or impractical to reduce the level of dust to the standard required by law. Directs the Secretary to provide standardized training programs for miners as to proper methods of mine roof-control. Exempts non-gassy mines from having to purchase specified equipment."
