    "text": "Disabled Workers Transportation Assistance Act - States that it is the purpose of this Act to provide for cash reimbursement to disabled workers who incure extraordinary transportation expenses in the production of their income solely because of the limitations imposed on them by their disability. Sets forth definitions of terms used in this Act. Provides that the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare shall reimburse each transportation-handicapped worker for extraordinary expenses incurred by him upon a declaration by such worker that he is entitled to such reimbursement under the provisions of this Act. Provides that such payments shall be made quarterly and may be made in advance upon application therefor. States that application for reimbursement shall be made in such manner and contain such information as the Secretary shall by regulation require. Requires each State, in order to receive payment under any title of the Social Security Act, to have in effect an agreement with the Secretary under which it will: (1) disregard any amount received by an individual under this Act in determining eligibility for or the amount of any benefit paid under any public assistance program, and (2) disregard any such amount in determining the amount of such individual's income for the purpose of computing State income tax liability. Provides that such amounts shall be disregarded in determining the eligibility of such individual for, or the amount of, any Federal assistance or in determining such individual's liability for Federal personal income tax. Provides that the Secretary or his delegate shall conduct a study of this program and report his findings and recommendations to the Congress not later than January 1, 1975. Authorizes to be appropriated for fiscal year 1972 and for each of the next succeeding four fiscal years such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
