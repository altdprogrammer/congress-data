    "text": "States that the purpose of this Act is to eliminate the obstructions to the free flow of commerce in wine among the several States resulting from acts of the States which impose discriminatory and unreasonable burdens upon such commerce. Prohibits any State which permits the transportation or importation of wine into that State from imposing, with respect to any wine produced outside the State, or from materials originating outside the State, any tax, regulation, prohibition, or requirement which is not equally applicable with respect to wine of the same class (1) produced in, or from materials originating in, the State imposing such tax, regulation, prohibition, or requirement, or (2) produced outside the State, or produced from products produced outside the State. Stipulates that a State which permits the sale of wine within the State shall permit the transportation or importation of wine of the same class produced outside the State, or from materials originating outside the State, into such State for sale therein upon terms and conditions equally applicable to all wine of the same class sold in the State. Declares that notwithstanding the provisions of this Act, each State retains the right: (1) to engage in the purchase, sale, or distribution of wine; and (2) to exercise discretion in the selection and listing of wine to be purchased or sold by each such State."
