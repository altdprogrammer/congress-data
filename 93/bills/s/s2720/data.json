Requires the President to certify: (1) that such excess quantity is absolutely essential for the security of the United States; (2) that the need for such excess quantity cannot be alleviated by the postponement or modification of training or testing programs being carried out by the Department of Defense; and (3) that no other source of supply normally available to the Department of Defense, including existing supplies maintained by the Department, is available to meet the need for such excess quantity.\""
