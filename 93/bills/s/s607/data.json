Increases the percentage level for which grants under such Act may fund the cost of developing and carrying out local programs. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to make grants to State agencies to establish centralized laboratory facilties for such programs. Requires that local programs include developing procedures to remove lead based paint from surfaces which create a high risk of health for children. Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in consultation with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, to develop and carry out a demonstration and research program to determine the nature and extent of the problem of lead based paint poisoning in the United States, particularly in urban areas, including the methods by which the lead based paint hazard can most effectively be removed from interior surfaces, porches, and exterior surfaces of residential housing to which children may be exposed. Directs the Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission to conduct appropriate research on multiple layers of dried paint film, containing the various lead compounds commonly used, in order to ascertain the safe level of lead in residential paint products. States that no later than December 31, 1974, the Chairman shall submit to Congress a full and complete report of his findings and recommendations as developed pursuant to such programs, together with a statement of any legislation which should be enacted or any changes in existing law. Grants the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development authority to establish procedures to eliminate the hazards of lead poisoning in housing covered by the Department's mortgage assistance or its housing assistance payments. Provides for the prohibition of the use of lead based paints in the construction of federally assisted facilities and of its application to certain toys and utensils. States that the term 'lead based paint' means: (1) prior to December 31, 1974, any paint containing more than five-tenths of 1 percent lead by weight; and (2) after December 31, 1974, any paint containing more than six one-hundredths of 1 percent lead by weight. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Act through June 30, 1975. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, in consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to establish a National Childhood Lead Based Paint Poisoning Advisory Board to advise the Secretary on policy relating to the administration of this Act. Provides that the members of the Board shall include residents of communities and neighborhoods affected by lead based paint poisoning. Declares that it is the intent of the Congress to supersede any and all laws of the States and units of local government insofar as they may now or hereafter provide for a requirement, prohibition, or standard relating to the lead content in paints or other similar surface-coating materials which differs from the provisions of this Act or regulations issued pursuant to this Act. States that any law, regulation, or ordinance purporting to establish such different requirement, prohibition, or standard shall be null and void."
