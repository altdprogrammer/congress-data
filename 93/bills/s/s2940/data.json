Authorizes the Secretary to construct, operate, and maintain a desalting complex, including: (1) a desalting plant to reduce the salinity of drain water from the Wellton-Mohawk division of the Gila project, Arizona, (2) the necessary appurtenant works including the intake pumping plant system, product waterline, power transmission facilities, and permanent operating facilities; (3) the necessary extension of the existing bypass drain to carry the reject stream from the desalting plant and other drainage waters to the Santa Clara Slough in Mexico, subject to arrangements made pursuant to this Act; (4) replacement of the metal flume in the existing main outlet drain extension with a concrete siphon; (5) reduction of irrigation return flows through acquisition of lands to reduce the size of the division, and irrigation eficiency improvements to limit return flows; and (6) all associated facilities including roads, railroad, and transmission lines. Requires that the Secretary shall use sources of electric power supply for the desalting complex that will not diminish the supply power to preference customers from Federal power systems operated by the Secretary. Authorizes the appropriation of $155,500,000 to accomplish the purposes of this title. =Title II: Measures Upstream from Imperial Dam= - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to implement the salinity control policy adopted for the Colorado River in the \"Conclusions and Recommendations\" Published in the Proceedings of the Reconvened Seventh Session of the Conference in the Matter of Pollution of the Interstate Waters of the Colorado River and its Tributaries in the States of California, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Wyoming, held in Denver, Colorado, on April 26-27, 1972, under the authority of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Enumerates salinity control units which the Secretary is authorized to construct, operate, and maintain as the initial stage of the Colorado River Basin salinity control program. Creates the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Advisory Council composed of no more than three members from each State appointed by the Govenor of each of the Colorado River Basin States. States that the purpose of the Council is to review, and make recommendations in regard to, activities conducted pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $125,100,000 for the construction of works and otherwise carrying out the purposes of this title. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to pay condemnation awards in connection with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970."
