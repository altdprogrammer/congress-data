States that no youth offender committed under the provisions of the Federal Youth Corrections Act on the basis of a conviction of any crime of violence shall be released conditionally or unconditionally until the court which sentenced such offender determines that his release would not endanger the public. Provides that such a determination shall be made only after consideration of the reports of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons and the Youth Corrections Division of the Board of Parole. Declares that no youth offender shall be released until the court makes such a determination or the maximum sentence imposed on the offender expires."
