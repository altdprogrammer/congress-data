States that no such subpena or other legal process shall be issued unless: (1) there is a finding that the testimony or production relates exclusively to matters unconnected with the newsman's gathering of news or; (2) there are reasonable grounds to believe the newsman has information which is not privileged or is otherwise unavailable to the court. Prescribes the procedure and the parties who are to determine whether a newsman is protected under this Act."
