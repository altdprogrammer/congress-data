    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Transportation, under the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, to establish a special motor vehicle diagnostic inspection demonstration project to assist in the rapid development and evaluation of advanced inspection, analysis, and diagnostic equipment suitable for use by the States in standardized high volume inspection facilities and to evaluate the repair characteristics of motor vehicles. Directs the Secretary to establish a special research and development project to evaluate motor vehicle inspection diagnosis and repair as they may affect energy conservation and to evaluate mechanical repairability and comparative costs therefor. Directs the Secretary to establish a special research and development project to design and evaluate low cost equipment which can be used by the small automotive repair garages to accurately determine the repairs needed or required on motor vehicles. Authorizes the Secretary to contract for the design and development of low-cost advanced inspection, analysis, and diagnostic equipment. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress, not later than July 1, 1978, the results of the projects authorized under this Act together with recommendations, if any, for enactment of Federal Motor Vehicle Repairability Standards designed to reduce the unnecessary frustration and costs associated with motor vehicle repairs. Requires that all research and development funded in whole or in part by the Government for such projects shall be made available at the earliest possible date to the general public. Authorizes the appropriation of specified sums for the fiscal year 1976, 1977 and 1978 to carry out demonstration projects under this Act."
