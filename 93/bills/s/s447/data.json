Directs the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect, collate and report at least annually to the Congress the full and complete statistics on the conditions of workers employed by the United States Government and United States corporations outside the territorial limits of the United States and the products and distribution of the products of the same. Provides that no producer, manufacturer, or dealer shall ship or deliver for shipment in commerce any goods containing foreign-made components unless such goods are clearly marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and permanently as the nature of the article or container will permit in such manner as to indicate to an ultimate purchaser in the United States the English name of the country or countries of origin of the foreign-made components."
