Authorizes the Commissioner to make grants to and enter into contracts with: (1) appropriate State agencies, local educational agencies, postsecondary educational institutions, private nonprofit community-based organizations in supplying training and employment in recognized occupations and new and emerging occupations; (2) States, or educational institutions, either public or private, to assist them in conducting training for instructors of bilingual vocational training programs; and (3) States, public and private educational institutions, and to other appropriate nonprofit organizations, and to enter into contracts with private for-profit individuals and organizations, to assist them in developing instructional material, methods, or techniques for bilingual vocational training. Requires such grants or contracts for assistance under this part to be made only upon application to the Secretary, at such time, in such manner, and containing or accompanied by such information as the Secretary deems necessary."
