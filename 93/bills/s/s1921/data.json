Entitles an employee, the duties of whose position are primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, including an employee engaged in this activity who is transferred to a supervisory or administrative position, who is separated from the service after becoming 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service in the performance of these duties to an annuity. Grants an annuity to an employee separated from the service: (1) involuntarily, except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency; or (2) while his agency, or subdivision thereof, is undergoing a major reduction in force, as determined by the Commission, and who is serving in such geographic areas as may be designated by the Commission; after completing 25 years of service or after becoming 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service. Provides that a Member who is separated from the service after attaining age plus service aggregating at least 80 years is entitled to an annuity. Reduces the annuity for an employee or Member by one-twelfth of one percent for each full month the employee or Member is under 55 years of age at the date of separation. (Amends 5 U.S.C. 8336)"
