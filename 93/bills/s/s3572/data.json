Provides that loans made under such Act's authority may be released by a discharge in bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy Act only if such discharge is granted after the five-year period (exclusive of any applicable suspension of the repayment period) beginning on the date of commencement of the repayment period of such loan. Requires the Commissioner of Education to issue regulations to insure that each student borrower under such Act is notified of the terms and conditions associated with such loans, together with the financial responsibility of such student to repay the loan."
