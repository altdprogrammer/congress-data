    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Provides, under the Atomic Weapons Rewards Act of 1955, for the rewarding by payment of up to $500,000 to any person who furnishes original information to the United States leading to the finding or other acquisition by the United States of special nuclear material or an atomic weapon manufactured contrary to the laws of the United States. Authorizes the Atomic Energy Commission to cooperate with any nation or group of nations by distributing special nuclear material. Stipulates that the Commission may distribute to the International Atomic Energy Agency or to any group of nations only such amounts of special nuclear materials and for such period of time as are authorized by Congress. Directs the Commission to license or otherwise permit others to distribute special nuclear material to any person outside the United States under the same conditions, except as to charges, as would be applicable if the material were distributed by the Commission. Authorizes the Commission to establish classes of special nuclear material and to exempt such classes from the requirements for a license set forth in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 when it makes a finding that such exemption would not be inimical to the common defense and security and would not constitute an unreasonable risk to the health and safety of the public."
