    "text": "Comprehensive Child Nutrition Act - Declares it to be the policy of Congress that every child in the United States be provided an adequate nutritional diet throughout the entire year, that such diet be provided under comprehensive child nutrition programs carried out by the Nation's schools, child development institutions, and other agencies and organizations concerned with the development of children, and that special emphasis under such programs be given to economically disadvantaged children. Provides that funds appropriate under this Act may be used for planning and developing, and surveying child nutrition programs. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, for each fiscal year, to be disbursed to each State, and amount equal to a sum determined by: (1) multiplying 10 cents by the number of children residing in each State, and multiplying the product thereof by 160; and (2) multiplying 50 cents by the number of children residing in each State who are members of households whose annual incomes are not above the applicable family size income level set forth in the income eligibility guidelines, and multiplying the product thereof by 160. Authorizes the Secretary to disburse such funds directly to nonprofit private schools when such disbursements are prohibited by State law. Provides that meals, snacks, and milk provided in child nutrition programs under this Act shall be served without cost to any child who is a member of a household which has an annual income not above the applicable household size income level set forth in the income eligibility guidelines established by the Secretary. Provides that each child nutrition program shall utilize commodities designated from time to time by the Secretary as being in abundance nationally or in the program area. Provides that each State educational agency shall, not later than April 1 of each fiscal year, submit to the Secretary, for approval by him as a prerequisite to receipt of Federal funds for the next fiscal year, a State plan of child nutrition operations for such next fiscal year. Provides that each child development institution or public or private nonprofit agency or organization operating a child nutrition program through funds from a State under this Act shall file an annual report with the Secretary giving a description of the manner in which it used funds provided under this Act to meet the requirements of this Act. Provides that each school food authority participating in a child nutrition program shall report to its State educational agency within ten days after the close of each school month the average daily number of children who received free and nonfree meals, snacks, and milk during the immediately preceding month, together with a detailed accounting of program disbursements, and such data shall be reported to the Secretary by each State. Provides that the National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act are repealed effective one year after the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
