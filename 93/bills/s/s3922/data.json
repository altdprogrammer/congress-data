    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Extends, under the Coastal Zone Management Act, the availability of coastal zone management grants for an additional 2 years (presently expires in 1977). Removes the present 10-percent limitation on the amount any one State may receive out of the total appropriated amount for management grants and replaces it with specific dollar limitations for specified yearly intervals. Authorizes the appropriation for grants to States for use for developing individual coastal zone management programs of $12,000,000 for fiscal years 1975-1979. Extends through fiscal year 1979 the period for which appropriations are authorized for State management program administration grants and for Federal administrative expenses under the Coastal Zone Management Act. Continues through fiscal year 1977 appropriation authorizations for estuarine sanctuaries. Stipulates that, in equitable actions brought at the request of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or under any Act administered by such Administrator, the failure of the party seeking equitable relief to prove existing or impending demonstrable harm to public health shall not in and of itself preclude granting the relief sought."
