    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Authorizes to be appropriated such surplus amounts to the Land and Water Conservation Fund as are necessary to insure that the annual income of the Fund, including revenues and collections, is at least $1,000,000,000. Increases the maximum percentage of the total amount made available to the States under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act which any one State may receive from 7 to 10 percent. Limits Federal payments to any State to 50 percent of the cost of planning projects and 70 percent of the cost of acquisition projects. Allows a State to apply up to 25 percent of its annual allocation from the fund to the development of sheltered recreation facilities in areas where the Secretary of the Interior determines that: (1) the unavailability of land or climatic conditions provide no feasible or prudent alternative to serve identified unmet demands for recreation resources; and (2) the increased public use thereby made possible justifies the construction of such facilities. Requires States annually to provide the Secretary basic information regarding the use of fund monies. Revises the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act by allowing fund monies to be used for the acquisition of natural areas for wildlife refuge purposes. Allows Federal funding of up to 70 percent of the total cost of statewide historical planning and survey projects, historical preservation demonstration projects, and specified preservation projects. Creates a National Historic Preservation Fund to meet the funding needs of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, to derive its revenues from the sale of resources under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Provides up to $150,000,000 annually to match State preservation expenditures under the National Historic Preservation Act. Requires the President to make appointments to the following offices with the advice and consent of the Senate: (1) Director of the Bureau of Land Management, (2) Director of the National Park Service, (3) Director of the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, (4) Commissioner of Reclamation, and (5) Governor of American Samoa. Specifies purposes for which funds paid to States from sales, royalties and rentals of oil shale in public lands may be applied. Allows the Department of the Interior to accept specified property for the Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site."
