Sets forth specific requirements to be met by such standard form. Provides that the Secretary shall prepare booklets to help persons borrowing money to finance the purchase of residential real estate to better understand settlement services. Enumerates the items to be included in such booklet, including an explanation of the unfair settlement practices and unnecessary charges to be avoided by the prospective buyer. Requires any lender agreeing to make a federally related mortgage loan to provide to the prospective buyer, and to any Federal Government agency insuring such loan, an itemized disclosure of all charges arising in connection with settlement. Penalizes any lender failing to provide such disclosures. Prohibits persons from giving or accepting any kickbacks, percentages and unearned fees incident to real estate settlement services. Sets forth penalties for violation of this provision."
