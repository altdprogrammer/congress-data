    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Tariff Simplification and Freight Rate Disparities Act - Requires the Federal Maritime Commission, within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, to publicly propose regulations for comment by interested parties and after consideration of such comments to adopt a system of uniform commodity descriptions and codes to be used by all common carriers by water in foreign commerce and all conferences of such carriers, when filing any rate, charge, or tariff with the Commission. Provides that within 60 days after the adoption of such system the Commission shall propose regulations requiring all common carriers by water in foreign commerce and all conferences of such carriers when filing any outbound or inbound rate or charge with the Commission to file a rate or charge for the movement of the commodity in the opposite direction. Authorizes the Commission, whenever any common carrier by water in foreign commerce or any conference of carriers files any schedule with the Commission, to order a public hearing to determine whether such schedule is in compliance with this Act and its regulations. Provides criteria to determine if the Commission shall order a hearing. Permits the Commission to suspend the operation of a schedule and defer the use of a rate, charge, classification, rule, or regulation for up to 180 days pending the outcome of such hearings. Allows the Commission, after hearing, to reject a filed schedule if the Commission determines that the disparity is in violation of this Act."
