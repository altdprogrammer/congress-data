Provides that the Federal share for each fiscal year shall not exceed 75 percent of the cost of each application. Authorizes the Secretary to establish and operate a National Clearinghouse on Youth Services which shall: (1) collect, analyze, and disseminate research materials relating to the services assisted under the provisions of this Act; (2) conduct a thorough evaluation of the programs assisted pursuant to this Act; and (3) develop recommendations for a longterm approach, by the Federal Government, to the problems of young Americans. Establishes a Youth Advisory Board to: (1) assist in the establishment of priorities for the award of grants under this Act; (2) to recommend general policies for, and review the conduct of, the Office; and (3) advise the Director of the Office on development of programs to be carried out by the Office."
