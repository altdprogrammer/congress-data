    "text": "Provides, under the National Labor Relations Act, that in determining whether a representative labor unit is appropriate for collective bargaining purposes, the National Labor Relations Board shall not consider the extent to which the employees have organized or the fact that no labor organization seeks to represent employees in a broader or narrower unit. States that, when there is filed with the Board one or more petitions with respect to one or more segments of a unit that is otherwise appropriate, the Board shall not find any such segments to be appropriate, unless under the Board's rules of decisions, such segments are clearly more appropriate than the broader unit; provided, that any employees who previously have been excluded for a unit for which a labor organization was certified or recognized as the representative shall not be included in such unit unless a majority of such employees vote for inclusion in said unit. (Amends 29 U.S.C. 159(c)(5))"
