Authorizes the Governor of Hawaii, Guam, or American Samoa, or the High Commissioner of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands to petition any United States district court having jurisdiction to issue an injunction or temporary restraining order to enforce this provision. Provides that employees working during this 160 day period shall receive in addition to regular wages, if the strike or lockout is resolved, wages at a rate equal to the difference between the wage provided under the agreement which resolves the dispute and the wage received prior to resolution of the dispute. Prohibits the application of the Norris-La Guardia Act to any injunction issued under this Act."
