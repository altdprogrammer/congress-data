    "text": "Women's Equal Educational Opportunity Act - Declares that sex discrimination is detrimental to the Nation's welfare because it limits the potential of all citizens, and women in particular; that the elimination of sex discrimination from public education is in the National interest; and that federally-supported education programs should be used to ensure women equal educational opportunity. Requires, under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965, that State plans for Title II school library and textbook grants setting forth criteria to be used in the selection of library resources, textbooks and other instructional materials provided under Title II include those designed to preclude sex bias. Requires that such State plans provide assurances that Federal funds made available under such Act for any fiscal year shall be used, on a priority basis and where possible, in the acquisition of non-sex-biased library resources, textbooks, and other instructional materials. Allows funds under ESEA's Title III - Supplementary Educational Centers and Service-to be used for demonstration projects promoting new approaches to expand educational opportunities for women, including comprehensive physical education programs and sports activities for women. States that not less than 15 percent of the funds granted under ESEA in any fiscal year shall be used for programs or projects designed to meet the special educational needs of women. Allows, under ESEA's Title V - Grants to Strengthen State Departments of Education, funds apportioned to the States to be used for programs promoting equal educational opportunities for women, the elimination, reduction or prevention of sex discrimination in education and public information activities to increase the awareness of educational personnel and the public concerning problems relating to sex discrimination. Requires that in using funds reserved for special projects to develop State leadership in education, priority consideration be given to projects designed to increase the proportion of women in leadership positions and to promote equal educational opportunities for women. Authorizes funds for the improvement of post-secondary education activities designed to improve the status of women in post-secondary education. Specifies programs to meet the needs of women as one of the methods by which the National Institute of Education shall seek to improve education. Requires, under the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965, that consider theation be given to the capability and willingness of institutions of higher education to provide effective community service programs designed to improve the status of women. Expands the uses of HEA funds to include programs designed to increase the proportion of women serving as school administrators, and programs to train teachers and other personnel. Expands the criteria for making leadership development awards to include encouraging the participation of women in vocational education leadership. Increases, under the Vocational Education Act (VEA) of 1963, the eligible purposes of grants for State vocational education programs to include the training of students of both sexes for occupations dominated by the other sex. Requires that State plans consider the need to ensure the training of students for occupations traditionally dominated by one sex. Includes VEA programs to include occupational aspirations and opportunities by eliminating barriers based on sex. Requires that State plans under VEA include provisions for all persons who have use for skills relating to the establishment and maintenance of the home. Includes, under VEA, the development and dissemination of vocational educational materials which increase awareness of the changing role of women in the world of work and also requires that curriculum materials developed or disseminated under VEA be free of sex biases."
