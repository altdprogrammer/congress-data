    "text": "Solar, Hydrogen, and Geothermal Energy Act - Expresses the findings of Congress, including: (1) that the United States with 6 percent of the world population is using 35 percent of the world's energy; (2) that there are recognized hazards associated with the production of nuclear energy; and (3) that geothermal energy sources are capable of providing substantial energy during a time of growing concern for our energy reserves. Authorizes to be appropriated to the National Science Foundation for research applied to national needs, for fiscal year 1974, for the following areas of research: (1) solar energy, including wind, solar thermal conversion, photovoltaics, ocean thermal, and photosynthetic production of organic materials, $80,000,000; (2) hydrogen energy, $20,000,000; and (3) geothermal energy, $10,000,000. Authorizes to be appropriated to the National Science Foundation for research applied to national needs for each of the four fiscal years beginning 1974, for the following areas of research: (1) solar energy, $400,000,000; (2) hydrogen energy, $100,000,000; (3) geothermal energy, $45,000,000. Authorizes to be appropriated to the National Science Foundation, research applied to national needs, for the fiscal year 1974, for a feasibility study regarding the establishment of a National Data Bank for Solar, Hydrogen, and Geothermal Energy, $50,000."
