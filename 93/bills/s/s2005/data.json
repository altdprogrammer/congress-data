Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to purchase adequate reserves of wheat, feed grains, and soybeans at any time that the market price falls to 125 percent of the announced nonrecourse loan level for such commodities. Provides a two-year extension of the price support loan on any quantity of wheat, feed grains, or soybeans stored under seal on a farm or private commercial facility."
