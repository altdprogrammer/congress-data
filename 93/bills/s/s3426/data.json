    "text": "Age Discrimination in Employment Amendments - States that the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with respect to unfair employment practices shall include discrimination on account of age with regard to persons at least forty years of age but less than sixty-five. Provides that the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Commission of Civil Rights, shall establish and carry out a program to prevent discrimination by any recipients of Federal assistance, including Government contractors and subcontractors. Makes the Age Discrimination in Employment Act applicable to those employers engaged in an industry affecting commerce with twenty or more employees. Exempts persons elected to public office, their personal staff, and immediate advisers from such provision. Provides for the nondiscrimination on account of age in Federal Government employment, including employment by the District of Columbia and the Library of Congress. Authorizes the Civil Service Commission to enforce the nondiscriminatory policy with respect to age in Government employment. Provides that any person, after thirty days notice of intent to do so, may file a civil action in Federal district court to enforce the policy announced by this Act."
