    "text": "Consumer Fraud Act - Provides that whoever, in connection with the sale or distribution of goods, services, or other property by the use of any means or instrumentality of transportation or communication in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or by use of the mails, willfully engages in or offers or attempts to engage in an unfair consumer practice, shall be fined not more that $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both. Sets forth the definition of \"unfair consumer practice\", including: (1) offering goods or services intending not to sell them as offered; (2) advertising goods or services intending not to supply reasonably expectable public demands, unless the advertisement discloses a limitation; (3) knowingly making false or misleading statements concerning the need for, or necessity of, any goods, service replacements, or repairs; and (4) representing that the consumer will obtain any rights, privileges, or remedies knowing that the consumer will not in fact obtain them. States that any contract or agreement which provides for the purchase of goods or services in furtherance of an unfair consumer practice is void."
