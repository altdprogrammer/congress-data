    "text": "National Human Experimentation Standards Board Act - Establishes in the executive branch an independent agency to be known as the National Human Experimentation Standards Board. Provides that the Board be composed of five members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Establishes the qualifications and term of office for those eligible for appointment. Gives such Board administrative powers to employ and fix compensation of personnel, make rules and regulations, appoint such advisory committees as are advisable, utilize the services and facilities of other state or Federal departments and agencies, accept voluntary services and gifts, and take such action and make such contracts as may be necessary to the accomplishment of the objectives of the Board. Authorizes the Board to compensate such individuals as appointed to committees established by it at the rate of GS-18. Permits the Board to hold hearings with the power to take testimony, subpena witnesses, and order the production of documents, books, and other information. Enforces the power of the Board to use these powers by application made by the Chairman of the Board to the Attorney General for the issuance of an order requiring any one refusing to obey an order of the Board to do so. Outlines those functions and duties of the Board, including establishing guidelines for federally funded experiments involving humans, reviewing such experiments, seeking necessary injunctive relief, compensating victims of improper experiments, and reporting annually to the President on its activities under this Act."
