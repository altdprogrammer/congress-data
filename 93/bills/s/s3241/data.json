    "text": "Provides that any United States district court shall have jurisdiction to make an order in a disciplinary proceeding disbarring, suspending, censuring, or taking such other action as justice may require, with respect to any attorney who is a member of the bar of such court and has: (1) been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude in any State, territory, Commonwealth, possession, or the District of Columbia; or (2) is guilty of conduct unbecoming a member of the bar of such court. States that, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, conduct unbecoming a member of the bar of a United States district court shall be deemed to include fraud, deceit, malpractice, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, incitement to arson, riot, espionage, or sabotage or violation of the Code of Professional Responsibilities of the American Bar Association or the bar association of the State in which such United States district court has jurisdiction. Provides that, whenever it shall come to the attention of the district court by any means that a member of its bar may have been convicted as defined in this Act or may have been guilty of unbecoming conduct under this Act, the court shall refer the matter to the United States attorney for such district. States that if the United States attorney believes that the attorney has either been convicted as defined in this Act or has been guilty of unbecoming conduct as defined by this Act he should proceed against such attorney by a petition setting forth the charges against him. Provides, in the case of conviction, disbarment, or suspension, that notice of such transaction will be transmitted to the Court of the State, territory, Commonwealth, or possession where the attorney was admitted to practice. (Adds 28 U.S.C. 1364)"
