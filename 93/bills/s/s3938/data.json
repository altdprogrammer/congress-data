    "text": "Truth in Energy Act - Title I: Truth in Energy - Declares it to be the intent of Congress to assure, through a uniform national system, noncompliance with which shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice, meaningful disclosure of the estimated annual operating cost of climate conditioning systems, so that consumers can readily compare them and thereby avoid purchasing or leasing buildings equipped with climate conditioning systems which unnecessarily waste energy. Directs the Federal Trade Commission, within 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, after consultation with the National Bureau of Standards, to establish: (1) model calculation procedures for use by suppliers in determining the estimated annual operating costs of climate conditioning systems; and (2) procedures for suppliers to disclose such estimates to their clients. States that, beginning 6 months after the date of adoption of procedures for determining and disclosing annual operating costs in accordance with this Act, it shall be unlawful for any person to sell or lease, or to offer for sale or lease, any previously unoccupied building for which a climate conditioning system has been designed subsequent to the adoption of such procedures; unless the estimated annual operating cost of such system is disclosed by the person prior to any such sale or lease. Stipulates that violation of any disclosure provision of this Act shall constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice and shall be subject to proceedings thereunder. Authorizes appropriations of not to exceed $2,000,000 for fiscal years 1975, 1976, and 1977 to carry out the above provisions. Title II: Renovation and Retrofitting of Existing Federal Buildings - Provides that, within 90 days after the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the General Services Administration, in consultation with the Director of the National Bureau of Standards, and the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration, shall establish procedures for identifying existing buildings as candidates for renovation and retrofitting with energy conservation equipment and systems for the purpose of decreasing the cost of supplying such buildings with energy for climate-conditioning, water heating, lighting, and other major uses of energy. Directs the Administrator to solicit proposals for renovation and retrofitting each identified building with energy conservation equipment and systems. Authorizes the Administrator to award contracts for the design and installation of energy conservation equipment in the federally owned buildings identified above. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this title, not to exceed $3,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and $3,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976."
