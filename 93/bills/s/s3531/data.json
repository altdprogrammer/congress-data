    "text": "Clean Air Amendments - Authorizes $150,000,000 to be appropriated for the fiscal years 1975 and 1976 for research related to fuels and vehicles under the Clean Air Act. Authorizes $300,000,000 to be appropriated for the fiscal years 1975 and 1976 for air pollution control under the Clean Air Act. States that, upon application by the Governor of a State on or after June 1, 1976, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may extend for not more than five years the deadline for attainment of national primary ambient air quality standards where transportation control measures are necessary for the attainment of such standards, and where the implementation of such control measures would have serious adverse social or economic effects. Provides that, within one hundred and twenty days following the submission of an application and all supporting materials, and after providing an opportunity for public comment, the Administrator shall grant an extension, if he determines that the requirements of this subsection have been met. Authorizes the Governor of any State, on or after June 1, 1981, to apply for a further extension. Provides that no extension may go beyond May 31, 1987. Provides that if the Administrator determines that technological or economic limitations on the application of measurement methodology to a particular class of new stationary air pollutant sources (as defined under the Clean Air Act) would make the imposition of an emission standard infeasible, he may instead prescribe a design or equipment standard meeting the requirements of this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to request the Attorney General to commence a civil action for a permanent or temporary injunction or to assess and recover a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 per day of violation, or both, whenever any person: (1) violates or fails or refuses to comply with any order issued under the Clean Air Act; or (2) violates any requirement of an applicable implementation plan during any period of federally assumed enforcement or more than thirty days after having been notified by the Administrator of a finding that such person is violating such requirement. Authorizes the Administrator to, for any period beginning on or after the date of enactment of this section and ending on or before November 1, 1974, temporarily suspend any stationary source fuel or emission limitation under specified conditions. States than any such suspension shall be conditioned upon compliance with such interim requirements as the Administrator determines are reasonable and practicable. Provides that, after public notice and public hearing, the Administrator may, for any period beginning after November 1, 1974, and ending not later than January 1, 1980, temporarily suspend any stationary source fuel or emission limitation as it applies to any fuel burning stationary source if the Administrator makes specified findings. Authorizes the President, to the extent practicable and consistent with the objectives of this Act and any legislation relating to the production, conservation, distribution, or allocation of energy or energy resources, to prohibit the burning of natural gas or petroleum products by any major fuel-burning installation (including any existing electric powerplant) which, on the date of enactment of this section, has the capability and reasonably available necessary plant equipment to burn coal. Directs the Administrator to promptly review all State implementation plans and revisions thereof and to determine whether in the aggregate (1) available domestic supplies of fossil fuels, or (2) supplies of control systems, are adequate to enable applicable emission requirements, standards, or limitations to be met within the date set for attainment of a national ambient air quality standard under the Clean Air Act."
