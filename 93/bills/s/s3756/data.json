    "text": "Amendments Act to the Federal-Aid Highway Act - Declares it to be a finding of the Congress that it is in the highest national interest that there should be established a national transportation policy which takes fully into account the interdependence of the cities and the countryside, the metropolitan areas and the nonmetropolitan areas, and the interrelationships of the various transportation modes, and which encourages the development of and the most efficient multimodal use of the best available technology and transportation resources in such a way as to fill the needs of the whole Nation. Makes it the intent of the Congress that this Act shall be administered as an integral part of said national transportation policy. Drops the use of the term \"rural\" areas in specified highway-aid legislation to redefine such areas as \"countryside areas', covering all areas of a State not included in urban areas. Authorizes the following appropriations under the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973: (1) for the Federal-aid primary system in rural areas, out of the Highway Trust Fund, $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 1975, and $1,400,000,000 for fiscal year 1976; and (2) for the Federal-aid secondary system in rural areas, out of the Highway Trust Fund, $500,000,000 for fiscal year 1975, and $500,000,000 for the fiscal 1976."
