    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Revises the present procedures for payment of retirement annuities to Federal employees. Authorizes the payment of a single life rate annuity. Eliminates the present provisions of Federal law which provide for a reduction in the annuity of a retired Federal employee or Member of Congress who acquires a spouse after retirement and who elects to provide a survivor annuity for that spouse in lieu of the survivor benefit which he previously elected for a person having an insurable interest. Provides that when an annuitant dies and is survived by a spouse, the spouse is entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of the maximum annuity to which the annuitant was entitled. Provides that no annuity is payable to the surviving spouse of an annuitant who failed to elect to provide a survivor annuity for his spouse in lieu of a survivor benefit for a person having an insurable interest. Defines the term \"spouse\" for civil service retirement purposes as meaning the surviving wife or husband of any employee, Member, or annuitant who was married to the employee, Member, or annuitant for at least one year immediately before the death of the employee, Member or annuitant or who is the parent of issue by that marriage. Repeals the requirement for reducing an annuity of a retired Federal employee or Member of Congress in order to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse and eliminates the provisions under which the married retiree may either deny his spouse a survivor benefit or provide an amount less than that based upon his maximum rate. Revises the supplemental annuity provisions to grant a reemployed annuitant an unreduced annuity benefit earned during reemployment, and an automatic increase in the survivor benefit attributable to such reemployment. Reduces the existing two-year marriage requirement for spouses of Federal employees or Members to one year for the purpose of qualifying for civil service retirement and survivor benefits. Provides that the annuity payable to an eligible spouse shall be equal to 55 percent of the annuity otherwise payable to the annuitant who retires or is separated on or after the date of enactment of this Act, and who dies on or after such enactment."
