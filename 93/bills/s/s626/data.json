States that the annuity of a survivor payable under this subchapter, or prior comparable provision of law, shall in no event be: (1) in the case of a surviving child, less than 36 times the smallest primary insurance amount (including any cost-of-living increase added to that amount) used as a basis for determining the amount of benefits payable to individuals under title II of the Social Security Act divided by the number of children; and (2) in the case of any other survivor, less than 12 times such primary insurance amount (including any such cost-of-living increase). Provides that an annuity payable from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund to a former employee or Member, which is based on a separation occurring prior to October 20, 1969, shall be increased by $300 ($165 in the case of the surviving spouse of an annuitant). (Adds 5 U.S.C. 8339(o), 8341(h))"
