Provides that a newsman shall not be compelled to disclose to a court, a grand jury, a legislative body, or other investigatory or adjudicative agency of government, which acts under the authority of the United States or any State, the identity of any person who supplies information to him while he is engaged in his occupation if he expressly or impliedly gives the person supplying the information a contemporaneous assurance that the source of the information will not be disclosed by him. States that nothing contained in the preceding sentence or any subsequent provision of this Act shall be construed to excuse a newsman from testifying to the identity of any person who commits a crime in his presence. Provides that neither a newsman nor any other person having custody or control of the same shall be compelled to produce before a court, grand jury, legislative body, or other investigatory or adjudicative agency of government, which acts under the authority of the United States or any State, anything which constitutes unpublished information. Sets forth the procedure by which a newsman can invoke the privilege accorded under this Act. Provides that in invoking such procedures a newsman shall have the right to the assistance of counsel of his own choosing. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to impair or preempt the enactment or application of any State law which secures the minimum privileges established by this Act."
