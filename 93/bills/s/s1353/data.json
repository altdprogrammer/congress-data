Provides that the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall issue regulations to define the slop oil mixtures, cleaning residue, and waste materials, establish the miximum deductions which may be made, and define the manner in which the spaces shall be used and marked."
