    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Alcohol and Drug Abuse Education Act Amendments - Provides that it is the purpose of this Act to provide leadership to schools and other institutions in the community by supporting projects to identify, evaluate, demonstrate and disseminate effective strategies for prevention and early intervention and to provide training and technical assistance to schools and other segments of the community in adapting such strategies to identified local needs. Directs the Commissioner of Education to carry out a program of making grants to support and evaluate demonstration projects, to disseminate these nationally, to train educational and community personnel, and to provide technical assistance in program development. Provides that funds appropriated for grants and contracts under this Act shall be available for enumerated purposes, including: (1) projects for the development of exemplary materials for use in education programs; (2) comprehensive demonstration programs which focus on the causes of drug and alcohol abuse rather than the symptoms; (3) creative primary prevention and early intervention programs in schools; (4) training programs for teachers and other personnel; (5) community education programs on drug and alcohol abuse, especially for parents and others in the community; and (6) programs to recruit and train persons, including former drug and alcohol abusers, to organize programs of public education in drug and alcohol abuse. States that financial assistance may be made only upon application. Sets forth the terms and conditions for such applications. Requires the Commission to submit an annual evaluation report on the programs carried out under this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated to carry out the purpose of this Act $26,000,000 for fiscal year 1975; $30,000,000 for fiscal year 1976; and $34,000,000 for fiscal year 1977."
