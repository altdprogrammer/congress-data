    "text": "High Seas Fisheries Conservation Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to promulgate regulations governing fishing in the fisheries zone and all high seas seaward of such zone by vessels of a party to an international fishery agreement with the United States, and by vessels documented under the laws of the United States, or otherwise registered under the laws of any State, for the purpose of fish conservation. States that such regulations may designate zones where, and establish periods when, no fishing shall be permitted; establish size and catch limits for any species of fish; prohibit the use of certain types of fishing gear; and prescribe such other measures as the Secretary deems appropriate to carry out such purposes. Sets forth rules governing the promulgation of such regulations. States that the provisions of this Act shall be deemed to be in addition to and not in contravention of the provisions of any existing international fishery agreement or any statute implementing the same. Provides that in the exercise of his powers the Secretary may at any time adopt as Federal regulations the regulations of any State or group of States regarding fishing adjacent to such State or States in the fisheries zone or in high seas adjacent to such zone. States that the Congress shall consent to any compact or agreement which is not in conflict with any law or treaty in force of the United States between any two or more States for the purpose of preparing regulations for submission to the Secretary. Requires that the Secretary of State shall, upon notification from the Secretary of the promulgation of regulations pursuant to this Act for waters of the high seas seaward of the fisheries zone, notify the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and any contracting party to the Convention whose nationals fish in the waters covered by such regulations of their contents. States that the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary, is authorized to enter into agreements with any contracting party to the Convention for the implementation of regulations adopted by the United States or by such contracting party pursuant to the aforesaid Convention in waters beyond the respective jurisdiction of any such contracting party. Sets forth penalties for violation of the provisions of this Act. Provides for enforcement of the provisions of this Act by the Secretary and the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating. States that the Federal district courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all cases arising under this Act. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to: (1) restrict the authority of any State to regulate its citizens regarding fishery matters where such regulation is not contrary to regulations adopted pursuant to this Act; and (2) extend the jurisdiction of the States to the natural resources beneath and in the waters beyond the territorial seas of the United States, or to diminish their jurisdiction to such resources beneath and in the waters of the territorial seas of the United States. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
