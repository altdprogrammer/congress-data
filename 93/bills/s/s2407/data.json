Establishes a Federal Audio-Visual Coordination Board to: (1) work to achieve a coordinated and cooperative relationship between Federal agencies and the audio-visual industry of the United States; (2) undertake systematic utilization and production of audio-visual supplies and equipment, and promulgate standards to create uniformity and interchangeability, and increase economies; and (3) organize and supervise the administration of this Act, and to prescribe such rules and regulations as are necessary to carry out this Act. Provides that no Government agency shall produce any audio-visual materials and that all such materials shall be obtained from private sources, except that any Government agency may produce up to 25 percent of the audio-visual materials which are solely for the internal consumption of such agency. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
