Authorizes to be appropriated not to exceed $8,400,000 to provide for such moving costs, relocation benefits, and other related expenses in connection with the acquisition of such lands. Provides that whenever an owner of property elects to retain a right of use and occupancy pursuant to any statute authorizing the acquisition of property for purposes of a unit of the national park system, such owner shall be deemed to have waived any benefits under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, and such owner shall not be considered a displaced person as defined in that Act."
