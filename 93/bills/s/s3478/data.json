    "text": "District of Columbia Defender Services Act - Establishes a District of Columbia Defender Service to be governed by a Board of Trustees which shall provide or cause to be provided legal representation before the courts of the District of Columbia for persons financially unable to retain counsel. Provides that, after consultation with the Joint Committee on Judicial Administration in the District of Columbia and the bar of the District of Columbia, the Board shall establish and place in operation in the District of Columbia a plan for furnishing representation for any person who is financially unable to obtain adequate representation and (1) who is charged with a felony, misdemeanor, or petty offense for which a jury trial may be required by the laws of the District of Columbia or the Constitution; or (2) who is under arrest, when such representation is required by law; or (3) who is subject to proceedings pursuant to the District of Columbia Code (hospitalization of the mentally ill); or (4) who is a juvenile and alleged to be delinquent or in need of supervision; or (5) who is charged with violating a condition of probation or parole, in custody as a material witness, or seeking collateral relief. Stipulates that counsel furnishing representation under the plan shall in every case be selected from panels of attorneys designated and approved by the Service in accordance with procedures established by the Board. Provides that a person for whom counsel is appointed shall be represented at every stage of the proceedings from his initial appearance before the court through appeals, including ancillary matters appropriate to the proceedings. Authorizes to be appropriated for each fiscal year, out of any moneys in the Treasury to the credit of the District of Columbia, such sums as may be necessary to implement the purposes of this Act. Directs the Director to employ a staff of attorneys and clerical personnel necessary to provide adequate and effective defense services. States that no attorney employed by the Service shall engage in private practice."
