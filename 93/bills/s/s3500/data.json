Defines the terms used in this Act. =Title II: Coordination of Amateur Athletic Activity= - Establishes an independent agency known as the Amateur Sports Board composed of five members who shall elect their own chairman. Authorizes the Board to issue charters, with respect to each sport for which application is made for a charter, to a corporation which meets the requirements and any applicable regulations under this Act. Lists prerequisites which must be met before a charter is granted. Declares that a charter issued pursuant to this title shall grant authority to the holders of such charters to: (1) act as the representatives of the United States to the appropriate international governing body or bodies for the sport or sports over which it has jurisdiction; (2) act as the representative of athletes competing in international competition in its sport or sports; (3) designate individuals and teams to participate in international competition and certify in accordance with international rules the amateur status of such individuals and teams; (4) conduct domestic competition in which all eligible amateur athletes may compete, including, but not limited to, Olympic trials or national championships; (5) conduct domestic exhibitions with representatives of foreign nations, the purpose of which is to promote interest in its sport or sports; (6) to take whatever actions, consistent with rules and regulations promulgated by the Board pursuant to this Act, as may be necessary to insure the safety and well-being of athletes representing the United States in international competition in its sport or sports; and (7) assume such other authority as the Board deems appropriate to carry out the purposes of this Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title. =Title III: Support and Encouragement of Sports and Physical Fitness= - Establishes the National Sports Development Foundation. Provides that the Foundation shall, to the extent practicable: (1) promote equal opportunity for and encourage participation and excellence in athletic activity and physical fitness programs for individuals of all ages; (2) foster and support organizations, groups, and individuals concerned with sports and coordinate their activities voluntarily with educational recreational programs conducted by Federal, State, and local governments; (3) support the development and dissemination of technical, financial, and training assistance to not-for-profit organizations and to individuals concerned with sports and physical fitness education; (4) promote increased athletic exchanges with foreign nations; (5) support studies with respect to athletic activity, including competition and physical fitness; (6) extend the practice of sports by establishing a data bank for the compilation of information pertaining to all significant aspects of sports; (7) encourage useful research in such areas as sports medicine, equipment design and performance analysis; (8) stimulate the establishment of improved coaching, physical training, and education programs; and (9) identify, without duplicating existing government or private activities, the need for provision of sports facilities by public or private groups and availability of such facilities. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the purpose of this title."
