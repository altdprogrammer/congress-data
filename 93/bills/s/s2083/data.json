    "text": "Authorizes the President, under the Foreign Assistance Act, to make loans in response to efforts in developing countries to address the problems of the poorest people. Places emphasis on programs of health, nutrition, education, family planning and small farm agriculture. Specifies that the host country must: (1) finance 20 percent of the project cost; (2) seek other financial sources within three years; and (3) not link one project to another. Authorizes such loans in connection with: (1) the Development Loan Fund; (2) technical cooperation and development grants; and (3) the Alliance for Progress. Expresses the belief of Congress that foreign aid funds could be utilized more effectively by developing program purposes, set forth in measurable terms, and by strengthening program management practices. Directs the President to establish a management system setting forth final program objectives and goals for each country to which program resources are directed."
