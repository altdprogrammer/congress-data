    "text": "Environmental Centers Act - Allows the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to provide financial assistance to enable any State, if such State does not participate in a regional environmental center assisted under this title, to establish and operate one State environmental center. Establishes prerequisites for the designation of such State environmental centers. Allows the Administrator to provide financial assistance to enable two or more States, if none of such States has a State environmental center, to establish and operate a regional environmental center. Establishes prerequisites for the designation of such regional centers. Establishes eligibility requirements for environmental centers. Declares that the functions of each State and regional environmental center shall include: (1) the planning and implementing of research, investigations, and experiments relating to the study and resolution of environmental pollution, natural resource management, and other local, State, and regional environmental problems and opportunities; and (2) the training of environmental professionals through such research, investigations, and experiments, which training may include, but is not limited to, biological, ecological, geographic,geological, engineering, economic, legal, energy resource, natural resource and land use planning, social, recreational, and other aspects of environmental problems. Authorizes $7,000,000 for fiscal year 1974; $9,800,000 for fiscal year 1975; and $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1976 to be disbursed in equal shares to the environmental centers, except that each regional center shall receive a number of shares equal to the number of states participating in such regional center. Authorizes $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1974, 1975, and 1976 to be allocated to the environmental centers on a proportional basis determined by population, land area, severity of the environmental problems in the areas served by the centers, and the ability and willingness of such centers to address themselves to such problems. Establishes the Environmental Centers Research Coordination Board for the purpose of assisting the Administrator with the development and operation of the program. Requires the Governor of each State having a State environmental center, and the Governor of States participating in each regional environmental center, to appoint an advisory board to advise such centers of the efforts of Federal, State, and local governments and private industry relating to the protection and enhancement of the environment. Requires the Administrator to report on or before January 1, of each year to the President and to Congress regarding the receipts and expenditures and works of all State and regional environmental centers."
