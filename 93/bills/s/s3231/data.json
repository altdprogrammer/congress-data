Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to compensate employees of poultry and egg producers, growers, and processors for any lost wages as a result of the condition which qualifies the producer, grower, or processor for compensation under this Act. Authorizes appropriations not to exceed $10,000,000 to carry out the purposes of this Act. Provides that the authority granted by this Act shall expire on December 31, 1974."
