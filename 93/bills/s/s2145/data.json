    "date": "1973-07-11", 
    "text": "Civilian Oceanographic underwater Research Facilities Act - Expresses the finding of Congress that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in the Department of Commerce, is the civilian agency designated to provide leadership in developing a national oceanic and atmospheric research program and, as such, is the primary Federal agency responsible for promoting Federal and private nonmilitary underwater research. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to prescribe minimum standards of human safety for the use, occupation, inhabitation, maintenance, and intrinsic construction of underwater research facilities. Specifies elements to be included in such standards. Establishes the Underwater Research Facilities Safety Advisory Board. Sets forth the membership composition of such Board. Directs the Board to assist the Secretary in the prescription of safety standards for underwater research facilities. Prohibits the use of any appropriated funds to finance, directly or indirectly, any research utilizing an underwater facility unless the facility is determined to meet the applicable safety standards prescribed by this Act. Provides that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall, on request, provide advice and assistance to Federal agencies and others in interpreting the standards prescribed. States that the Coast Guard shall be responsible for making investigations and discovering violations, and shall report its findings to the Comptroller General of the United States, the Secretary, and the affected Federal agency. Requires that all underwater research facilities in existence on the effective date of this Act shall be subject to all its requirements just as those which in the future are constructed. Empowers the Secretary to grant exceptions from applicable standards when conditions cannot be altered without substantial expense or hardship and which will not pose an unreasonable threat to human safety in the underwater research to be undertaken. Authorizes to be appropriated $2,000,000 for the fiscal year 1974 and each fiscal year thereafter for the purposes of administering this Act."
