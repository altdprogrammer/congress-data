Provides that if the Federal Trade Commission finds that the existence of a patent relating to the manufacture, use, or sale of such drug has constituted a substantial contributing factor to the high price of such drug, it shall institute a public rulemaking proceeding to determine whether such patent should be subject to mandatory licensing. Specifies the formulation of rules by the Commission to determine a proper price and licensing procedure. Provides civil penalties for violation of any mandatory licensing rule. Provides for judicial review of such rules."
