Provides that to be eligible for immunity under this Act, an applicant shall: (1) present himself by individual appearance, or that of an attorney-at-law or family member to the Immunity Review Board within one year after the date of this Act; (2) enter into a written agreement with the Immunity Review Board under which the applicant agrees, in return for immunity, to enlist to serve two years in the Armed Forces of the United States, or up to two years in alternative service; and (3) agree to compensation adequate to provide a standard of living reasonably comparable to that which the same man would have enjoyed if he entered the Armed Forces. Establishes an Immunity Review Board, to execute agreements necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Act and to determine the length of service required to earn immunity. Specifies the composition and compensation rates of such Board. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
