States that no evidence or information obtained by an investigation shall be released to any person without the written consent of the individual who is the subject of the investigation. Provides that if an individual investigated consents in writing to the disclosure of the information, the Attorney General shall permit inspection of such information by the Presidential candidate who requested the investigation together with one other person designated by the candidate, if such candidate has been nominated by the national nominating convention of the political party with which he is affiliated. Provides that upon the nomination a candidate for election to the office of Vice President by the national nominating convention of a political party all evidence and information obtained relating to potential Vice- Presidential nominees of that party shall be destroyed and no memorandum, copy, or other record of such evidence or information shall be retained. Provides that the disclosure, release, or retention of evidence or information in violation of the provisions of this Act shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $50,000, imprisonment not to exceed five years, or both."
