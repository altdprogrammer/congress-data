    "text": "Natural Gas Act Amendments - Expands the provision of the Natural Gas Act to apply to the sale of natural gas delivered for the first time in interstate commerce or sold in interstate commerce upon the expiration of an existing contract on or after the effective date of this Act, or produced from wells commenced on or after such date. Provides that where a natural gas company purchases natural gas from an affiliate, the Federal Power Commission may disallow any change by such company which is based on the amount paid in excess of current prices to nonaffiliates. States that, in order to protect the interests of consumers, the Federal Energy Office is authorized for three years to monitor the wellhead prices of exempted natural gas sales, and if necessary, to establish ceiling prices. Sets forth the factors to be taken into account in making such a ceiling determination."
