    "text": "Provides that funds appropriated for any fiscal year to carry out any Federal program shall not be made available to any organization unless such organization has given acceptable assurance that such funds will not be used in research involving human subjects in the absence of initial and continuing review and approval by an appropriate organizational committee. States that such review shall determine that: (1) the rights and welfare of the subjects involved are adequately protected; (2) the risks to the individual are outweighed by the potential benefits to him or by the importance of the knowledge to be gained; and (3) informed consent is to be obtained by methods that are adequate. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to identify those Federal programs which may involve human subjects at risk, set guidelines for the establishment of organizational committees, and establish such additional regulations as the implementation of this Act may require."
