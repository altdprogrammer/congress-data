States that after public hearing and a finding by the appropriate Secretary of the department administering appropriate Federal lands that specific quantities, grades, and species of unprocessed timber are surplus to the needs of domestic users and processors, such quantities, grades, and species may be designated by such Secretary as available for export from the United States. Provides that the appropriate Secretaries may, in their discretion, issue regulations to exclude from the limitations imposed by this section sales having an appraised value of less than $2,000 or timber which does not meet the utilization specifications of the Federal timber sale contract from which it originated. Requires that the Secretaries of the appropriate departments shall issue rules and regulations to carry out the purposes of this Act. Sets forth penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act. Provides that during the fiscal years 1974, 1975, and 1976, not more than two and twenty-five one-hundredths billion board feet (scribner scale) of softwood logs and not more than one and two-tenths billion board feet (lumber scale) of softwood lumber may be exported from the United States. States that for fiscal years 1975 and 1976, these limits may be increased or removed under specified conditions."
