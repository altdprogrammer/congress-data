Authorizes the court, after a hearing, to commit the person to the custody of the Attorney General, who shall hospitalize such person in a suitable mental institution or other facility. Sets forth the criteria for unconditional release, conditional release with supervision, and annual reviews of such institutionalized persons. (Adds 18 U.S.C. 4249)"
