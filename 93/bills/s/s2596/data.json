Authorizes funds to be appropriated to the State and Local Government Fiscal Assistance Trust Fund, out of amounts in the general fund of the Treasury attributable to the collections of the Federal individual income taxes not otherwise appropriated. Specifies the amounts of such sums for fiscal years 1974 through 1976."
