States that in any hearing involving an application for renewal of a broadcasting license, if the applicant for renewal makes a prima facie showing that its broadcasting service during the preceding license period: (1) has reflected a good-faith effort to serve, and demonstrated a responsiveness to, the needs and interest of its area; and (2) that the operation of the station has not otherwise been characterized by serious deficiencies, then the burden of proof with respect to any petition to deny such application or any other application for the same broadcasting service shall be upon the petitioner or competing applicant to show that it would not be in the public interest, convenience, and necessity to grant the application for renewal."
