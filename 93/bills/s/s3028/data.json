Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to assist any State in its regulation of weather modification activity and in the dissemination of information concerning such activity. Requires a Federal permit for any person engaged in any weather modification activity, and enumerates qualifications for such permit. States that no permit shall be issued unless the applicant has first obtained a license. Outlines conditions whereby a permit may be revoked or suspended by the Secretary after an opportunity of hearing. Requires any holder of a permit to make daily reports covering any weather modification which are to be transmitted to the Secretary by certified mail daily. Outlines what information shall be included in each report. Requires additional weather reports if the Secretary requests them. Allows the Secretary to require records to be maintained by each holder of a permit which can be inspected under prescribed conditions by the Secretary. Requires any agency, military department, local government or State conducting weather modification activities to prepare daily reports, and to submit such reports to the Secretary by certified mail daily. Prescribes penalties for the violation of requirements for a Federal permit of fines between $10,000 and $50,000, and fines of not more than $25,000 for failure to make weather reports to the Secretary. Gives the U.S. district courts power to enjoin any violation concerning Federal permits reporting requirements, or other regulations promulgated by the Secretary. Title II: Weather Modification Information System - Authorizes the Secretary to establish within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a weather modification information system to monitor daily weather conditions, and to record and evaluate weather modification. Permits the Secretary to use the system to assist in determining whether: (1) to issue, revoke or suspend permits; (2) to obtain data from the Weather Bureau on a timely basis; and (3) to use such system to maintain records of any weather modification and such activity conducted in any State. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a computerized data processing system to facilitate the operation of the weather modification information system. Title III: International Weather Modification Control - Allows the President to enter into agreements with other nations and international organizations to establish, monitor, and regulate weather modification activities. Requires any U.S. citizen who has primary supervisory responsibility for carrying out weather modification activities in any foreign nation to submit reports to the Secretary at lease 10 days prior to such activity. Outlines what information is to be included in these reports. Requires the Secretary to establish and maintain a register of persons engaged in weather modification activities in the U.S. and other nations whom he deems properly qualified. Allows the Secretary to distribute copies of such register upon request to any foreign nation. Requires approval by the Secretary of State, unless the President determines it unnecessary in a particular case, for any agency or military department before engaging in any weather modification activity in any foreign nation. Prescribes penalties of fines up to $25,000 for failure of a U.S. citizen to make reports or register while engaging in weather modification activities in any foreign country. Title IV: General Provisions - Authorizes the Secretary to make such regulations as are necessary to carry out this Act. Authorizes necessary appropriations to carry out this Act. Repeals the former provisions of law regulating weather modification activities. (Amends 15 U.S.C. 330 et seq.)"
