Permits the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to take whatever action he deems necessary to prevent, mitigate, or eliminate a threat of oil pollution resulting from a maritime accident beyond the coastal States territorial sea. Requires that there be an express determination by the Secretary that there exists a grave and imminent danger to the coast line or related interests of the United States from pollution or threat of pollution of the sea by oil before such authority is exercised. Provides the necessary regulatory and enforcement powers for carrying out the purpose of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to use the revolving fund established pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as a means of funding extraordinary Federal activities under this Act. Specifies those limits within which the Secretary must act and those criteria upon which action should be taken."
