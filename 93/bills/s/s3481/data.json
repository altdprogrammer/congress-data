    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) International Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act - States that Federal departments and agencies shall take all appropriate actions within their jurisdictions to attempt to eliminate discrimination and unfair competitive practices against United States air carriers in the international air transportation industry. Provides for compensatory charges to be imposed on foreign air carriers of the country concerned if discriminatory charges against United States air carriers are not reduced or eliminated within a reasonable time after negotiations are undertaken for such purpose. States that the amounts so collected shall be used to compensate such air carriers for the excessive or discriminatory charges paid by them to the foreign countries involved. Directs the Civil Aeronautics Board, in considering rate changes for foreign air transportation of mail, to take into account the rates paid pursuant to the Universal Postal Service Convention, the rate-making elements employed by the Universal Postal Union, and the competitive disadvantage to the United States flag air carriers resulting from the foreign air carriers receiving universal Postal Union rates for the carriage of United States mail and the mail of their own countries. Requires that the Government-financed air transportation of passengers and property be provided by air carriers holding certificates under the Federal Aviation Act to the extent practicable. Prohibits departure from tariff rates by air carriers and ticket agents. Gives the Board the same access to the equipment and records of foreign air carriers and ticket agents as it now has to those of domestic air carriers. Provides criminal penalties for the solicitation or acceptance of rebates by shippers of air freight."
