Provides that the amount allowable for the taxable year with respect to any dependent shall not exceed the lesser of: (1) 50 percent of the tuition paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year to a private nonprofit elementary or secondary school for the elementary or secondary education as a full-time student of such dependent during a school year which begins or ends in such taxable year, or (2) $200. Provides that the amount of the tuition with respect to any student which may be taken into account for any school year shall not exceed $100. Reduces the aggregate amount allowable by an amount equal to $1 for each full $20 by which the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer (or, if the taxpayer is married, the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer and his spouse) for the taxable year exceeds $18,000."
