Provides that in issuing, or in determining whether to issue, any such subpena the court shall require specified criteria, including: (1) that on the same day on which such subpena is issued the party whose communication or records are sought is served in person with, or there is mailed to, a copy of such subpena and that the subpena so certifies; and (2) compliance in not less than ten days after service, except in any case where the court determines in an ex parte proceeding that immediate disclosure is required to protect an individual against an immediate danger of bodily harm, to protect the Nation against actual or potential attack or other hostile acts of a foreign power, or to obtain foreign intelligence information deemed essential to the security of the United States."
