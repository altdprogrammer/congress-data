Sets forth the definitions of terms used in this Act. Provides that any organization maintaining an administrative automated personal data system shall: (1) identify one person immediately responsible for the system; (2) inform each of its employees having any function in the operation of the system, or the use of any data contained therein, about all safeguard requirements; (3) specify penalties to be applied to any employee who contributes to any disciplinary or other punitive action against any individual who brings to the attention of appropriate authorities, the press, or any member of the public, evidence of unfair personal information practice; (4) take reasonable precautions to protect data in the system from any anticipated threats or hazards to the security of the system; (5) make no transfer of individually identifiable personal data to another system without specifying requirements for security of the data and determining that the conditions of the transfer provide assurance that those requirements will be observed; (6) maintain a record of every access to any data in the system; and (7) maintain data accurately and completely. Requires that any organization maintaining an administrative automated personal data system give public notice of the existence and character of its system once each year. Provides that any organization maintaining a record of personal data, not part of an automated system used exclusively for statistical-reporting or research, shall make no transfer of such data to another organization without prior informed consent of the individual to whom the data pertains, if, as a consequence of the transfer, such data will become part of an automated personal data system that is not subject to safeguard requirements. Requires any organization maintaining an automated personal data system used exclusively for statistical reporting or research shall perform specified duties, including informing an individual asked to supply personal data for the system whether he is legally required, or may refuse, to supply the data requested, and also of any specific consequences for him. Penalizes unathorized disclousre of any identifying numbers, including social security numbers. Authorizes the issuance of injunctions for insuring compliance with this Act.
