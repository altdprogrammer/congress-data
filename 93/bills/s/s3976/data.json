Sets forth increased criminal penalties for piracy and counterfeiting of sound recordings, and for the knowing and fraudulent transportation, sale, or receipt of phonograph records bearing forged or counterfeit labels. Establishes in the Library of Congress a National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works. States that the purpose of the Commission is to study and compile data on: (1) the reproduction and use of copyrighted works of authorship (A) in conjunction with automatic systems capable of storing, processing, retrieving, and transferring information, and (B) by various forms of machine reproduction, not including reproduction by or at the request of instructors for use in face-to-face teaching activities; and (2) the creation of new works by the application or intervention of such automatic systems or machine reproduction. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
