Requires each State to provide by law for the registration of all citizens outside the United States and entitled to vote in a Federal election in such State who apply, not later than thirty days immediately prior to any such election, to vote in such election. Sets forth the items required to be mailed, by airmail, to such citizens. Prescribes the format of the postcard to be included in such materials. Directs the Administrator of General Services to print and distribute postcards to carry out the purposes of this Act. Provides for the enforcement of the provisions and penalizes falsification of information under this Act. States that nothing in this Act shall: (1) be deemed to require registration in any State or election district in which registration is not required as a precondition to voting in any Federal election; or (2) prevent any State or election district from adopting or following any voting practice which is less restrictive than the practices prescribed by this Act."
