    "text": "Rail Passenger Service Amendments - Directs the National Railroad Passenger Corporation to establish rail passenger service on such extensions of the basic system as are necessary to provide the following: (A) by July 1, 1974, through service to every standard metropolitan statistical area in the contiguous 48 States exceeding 1,000,000 in population; (B) by July 1, 1976, through service to every such standard metropolitan statistical area exceeding 500,000 in population; (C) by July 1, 1978, through service to every such standard metropolitan statistical area exceeding 250,000 in population; and (D) by July 1, 1976, adequate service between all standard metropolitan statistical areas exceeding 500,000 in population which are between 100 and 300 miles apart. States that the Corporation may preliminarily exclude an entension upon a preliminary finding by the Secretary of Transportation that the public convenience and necessity does not require such extension, or that establishment of such service is unnecessary or impracticable. Authorizes appropriations for the benefit of the Corporation of $10,000,000 in fiscal year 1976, $25,000,000 in fiscal year 1977, and 25,000,000 in fiscal year 1978. Directs the Corporation to initiate not less than two experimental routes each year, such routes to be designated by the Corporation on the sole basis of the demonstrated need and probable use of such service, and to operate such routes for not less than two years. Requires the Corporation to study the need for and potential use of routes between major centers of population and heavily used recreation areas 100 to 300 miles from such population centers. Authorizes the Secretary to purchase evidences of indebtedness and to make loans to any State or to any local or regional agency for purposes of capital construction, acquisition, and improvement cost of rail lines and facilities to recreation areas. Directs the Secretary to study the need for and potential use of routes between urbanized population centers and airports serving those population centers and the estimated initial costs of each such route. Provides that not later than July 1, 1975, he shall report to the Congress on the results of this study along with his recommendations as to whether the Corporation should provide any or all such service."
