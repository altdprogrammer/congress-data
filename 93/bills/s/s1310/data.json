    "text": "Meat Export Control Act - Provides that the President shall monitor statistics issued by the United States Department of Labor showing estimated retail prices of individual foods as derived from data collected by the United States Department of Labor for use in the Consumer Price Index. States that not more than three days after issuance of any such statistics which show that there has been a cumulative rise in the average of the retail prices of the meat products specified in this Act during a period of three consecutive months commencing on or after January 1, 1973, which, when divided by the number of months in the period shows an average month-to-month rise equal to or greater than three-tenths of 1 per centum, the President shall issue an order prohibiting the exportation outside the United States or any territory or possession of the United States after the effective date of the order of all the meat products specified in this Act. Provides for a termination procedure once such an order is issued. States that the President may, during the period of effectiveness of any order issued by him pursuant to this Act, allow exportation of any or all of the products affected by such order exclusively to such country or countries as the President may determine are suffering from such emergency shortages of such meat products that exportation will have a substantial and immediate effect in reducing such shortages and in relieving human suffering within such country or countries. Provides that such exportation shall be allowable for a period not to exceed thirty days, without Congressional approval. States that this Act shall not extend beyond April 30, 1974."
