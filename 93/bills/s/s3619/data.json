Authorizes the head of any executive agency to terminate for the convenience of the Government any fixed-price contract between that agency and a small business concern upon a finding that (1) during the performance of the contract, the concern has experienced significant unanticipated cost increases directly affecting the cost of contract compliance; and (2) the conditions which have caused such cost increases were experienced generally by other small business concerns in the market at the same time and were not caused by negligence, underbidding, or other special management factors peculiar to that small business concern. Sets forth documentation required of small business concerns requesting relief under this Act."
