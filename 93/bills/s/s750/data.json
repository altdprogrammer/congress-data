Permits a professional newsman to claim a privilege not to disclose either his source of information or any unpublished information to any Federal or State court, grand jury, agency or legislature. Permits any person seeking information protected by this Act to apply to the United States district court or the highest trial court of a State for an order to require disclosure upon a showing by a preponderance of the evidence, that the information is unobtainable from other sources and either an overriding public interest exists or a matter of national security is involved. Provides that this Act will not apply to civil defamation suits in which a defendant asserts a defense based on the source of such information. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect any State or local ordinance which prohibits greater protection for professional newsman."
