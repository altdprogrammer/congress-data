    "text": "Federal Elective Office Campaign Act - Provides that no person shall make any contribution to or for the benefit of any candidate except by making that contribution to a political committee authorized by that candidate to receive contributions on his behalf. States that no political committee shall receive any contribution or make any expenditure on behalf of a candidate unless it is authorized in writing by that candidate to do so. Prohibits a candidate from authorizing more than one political committee to receive contributions or make expenditures in connection with his campaign for nomination for election, or for election, to Federal office. States that no political committee shall receive a contribution, or contributions in the aggregate, from any person in excess of $10 other than in the form of a check drawn on the account of the person making the contribution and that no political committee shall make any expenditure in excess of $10 other than by check drawn on the account of that committee and signed by the treasurer of the committee. Requires reports under the Federal Election Campaign Act to be filed on the first day of January, April, July, September and October in each year, on the tenth day before the date on which any election is held and on the fifth day following that day. Requires the report to detail the identification of any individual who performs any service for the committee without compensation, together with his regular place of employment when not performing services for the committee, and a description of the services performed by him for the committee; and the identification of any individual who is employed by the committee or who, as a consultant or otherwise, performs services for the committee for compensation, together with the amount received by that individual as salary, reimbursement of expenses, or other compensation, and that individual's next previous place of employment and his regular occupation. Sets forth formulae determining the limitations on expenditures for election to Federal Office by a candidate for such office. Provides that no person shall make any charge for services or product furnished to, or for the benefit of, any candidate in connection with his campaign for nonimation for election, or election, in an amount in excess of $100 unless the candidate (or a person specifically authorized by the candidate in writing to do so) certifies in writing to the person making the charge that the payment of that charge will not exceed the expenditure limitations set forth in this Act. States that any person who knowingly or willfully violates the provision of this section shall be subject to a fine of $10,000 or to imprisonment for a period of not more than one year, or both. States that no individual shall make contributions in excess, in the aggregate, of $5,000 to any candidate or to the political committee authorized by the candidate to receive contributions for him, or otherwise for the benefit of that candidate in connection with any of his campaigns. Provides that such limitations on expenditures imposed by this Act shall apply separately to each primary, primary runoff, general, and special election campaign in which a candidate participates. Increases the tax credit for political contributions under the Internal Revenue Code."
