Provides that it is the continuing responsibility of the Federal Government to use all practicable means, consistent with other essential considerations of national policy, to and coordinate Federal plans, functions, programs, and resources to the end that the Nation may assure for all Americans a sound and productive economy, and meet other specified national objectives. Title II: Cooperation of Agencies; Reports; Availability of Information; Recommendations; International and National Coordination of Efforts - States that Congress directs that, to the extent possible, the policies, regulations, and public laws of the United States shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with the policies set forth in the Act. Directs all agencies of the Federal Government to perform enumerated productivity functions, including to: (1) use a systematic, interdisciplinary approach to insure the integrated use of the natural and social sciences, engineering disciplines, safety and environmental design arts in planning and decisionmaking which may have an impact on productivity; (2) include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation, in every major program recommendation contained in the President's budget and other major Federal actions significantly affecting productivity, a detailed statement by the responsible official on impacts on productivity; (3) study alternatives to courses of action in any proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concerning the impact on productivity of proposed actions; and (4) generate and use productivity information in the planning and development of projects and programs to enhance internal productivity. Title III: Directs the President to transmit annually to the Congress beginning July 1, 1975, a productivity report setting forth specified information, including: (1) the status and condition of the major factors affecting productivity; (2) current and forseeable trends in the quality, quantity, management, and use of these elements; and (3) the adequacy of the productive base of the Nation for fulfilling the economic requirements of the Nation in the light of anticipated growth and available resources. Establishes within the Department of Commerce the National Productivity Center.

Provides that grants authorized may be up to 100 percent of the total cost of each project for which such grant is made.
