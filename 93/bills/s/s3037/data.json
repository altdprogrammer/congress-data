Requires each individual who has served at any time during any calendar year as President, Vice President, or Member of Congress to file with the Comptroller General a financial disclosure report for that year. Prescribes the deadline dates for such filings. Provides that each such report shall contain a full and complete statement of: (1) the amount and sources of all income, other than reimbursements for expenditures actually incurred, and each gift or aggregate of gifts from one source of a value of more than $100 (other than gifts received from any relative or his spouse) received by him or by him and his spouse jointly or by his spouse or by his children during the preceding calendar year, including any fee or other honorarium received; (2) the value of all assets held by him, and of each liability owed by him, or by him and his spouse jointly; (3) all dealings in securities or commodities by him, or by him and his spouse jointly, or by any person acting on his behalf; (4) all purchases and sales of real property or any interest therein; (5) the amount of each tax paid by the candidate during the preceding calendar year. States that all reports filed under this Act shall be maintained by the Comptroller General as public records, and shall be available, under such regulations as the Comptroller General may prescribe, for inspection by the public."
