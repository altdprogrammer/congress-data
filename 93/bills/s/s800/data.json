Provides that the Board shall determine the amount of compensation under this Act: (1) in the case of a claim by an intervenor or his surviving dependent or dependents, by computing the net losses of the claimant; and (2) in the case of a claim by a victim or his surviving dependent or dependents, by computing the pecuniary losses of the claimant.

Provides that each policy purchased by the Administration under this Act shall contain a provision for the conversion of such insurance effective the day following the date such insurance would cease.

Requires that during any period in which a public safety officer is insured under a policy, of insurance purchased by the Administration under this Act, his employer shall withhold each month from his basic or other pay until separation or release from full-time duty as a public safety officer an amount determined by the Administration to be such officer's share of the cost of his group life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance.
