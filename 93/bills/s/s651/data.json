States that in the case of his second or subsequent conviction, such person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for any term of years not less than ten, or to life imprisonment. Provides that the court shall not suspend the sentence in the case of any person convicted under this Act, or give him a probationary sentence, nor shall the term of imprisonment imposed under this Act run concurrently with any term of imprisonment imposed for the commission of such felony or crime. Reduces from twenty-one to eighteen the age limit for various provisions concerning firearms under chapter 44 of title 18 of the U.S. Code. Eliminates the requirement, with regard to the sale or delivery of ammunition, of obtaining the individual's name, age, and place of residence."
