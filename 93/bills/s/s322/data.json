    "text": "Nutritional Labeling Act - Finds that the labeling on the packages of all food commodities should be required to clearly and accurately indicate the nutritional value of such commodities. Makes it unlawful for any person engaged in the packaging or labeling of any food commodity for distribution in commerce to distribute in commerce any such commodity if it is contained in a package or if there is affixed to the commodity a label which does not conform to the provisions of the Act. Prohibits any person from distributing any packaged or labeled food commodity except in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. Provides that whenever the Secretary of Commerce determines that there is undue proliferation of methods of indicating the nutritional value of food commodities, he shall request manufacturers, packers, and distributors of the commodities to participate in the development of a voluntary product standard for such commodities."
