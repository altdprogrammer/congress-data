Authorizes the Agency to secure from any department or agency of the United States any information relating to international trade and United States foreign policy necessary to enable it to carry out its duties under this Act. Provides that the Agency shall: (1) foster the development of United States export associations composed of small businesses which have not actively engaged in substantial export sales operations; (2) survey and identify small businesses which possess undeveloped export potential and which are interested in joining with other small businesses in United States export associations in order to develop a joint export operation; (3) obtain operating and other business information from such small businesses and from any other person engaged in exporting in order to provide assistance and advice to such small businesses with respect to the identification of products which have export potential, the combination of products for efficient exportation, and the development of export markets; (4) provide technical assistance and advice and financial support through grants and loans in accordance with the provisions of this Act; (5) provide institutional leadership to bring together small businesses who are interested in entering into joint exporting arrangements through the formation of a United States export assocation and to provide assistance in the formation of such associations; and (6) establish and conduct programs for the development of technical, professional, and managerial skills necessary to the establishment and operation of United States export associations, and for the development of liaison between the Agency, United States export associations, and international financial, investment, and marketing institutions. Provides for the Agency to assist associations of small businesses which have associated for the purpose of securing export advice and assistance in developing the operating agreements necessary to further joint export operations. Authorizes the agency to make technical assistance grants to such associations to finance management seminars and instruction for association members relating to market analysis, export marketing, channels of export distribution, the identification of original market areas for American products, the development of common catalogs and other marketing aids, and such other export information determined by the Agency to be appropriate. Authorizes as a deduction from gross income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 a deficit in earnings and profits of an export association covered by this Act. Provides for the apportionment of such loss among the members of the export association. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums for each fiscal year as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
