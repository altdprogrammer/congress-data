Provides that to be eligible for assistance under this Act a State shall adopt a program which shall meet requirements set forth in this Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to furnish financial assistance to any State if he determines that such State has adopted and is carrying out a program which meets the requirements of this Act. Provides that the federal share of any State program shall not exceed 80 percent of the cost of such program. Requires the Secretary on July 1, 1976, to reduce by 10 percent the amount available for expenditure from the highway Trust Fund for highway construction in any State which has not adopted a program which meets the requirements of this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
