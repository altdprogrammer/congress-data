Provides that in any case in which a court is authorized to impose a sentence of death, such court shall not so impose such a sentence unless it has first conducted a separate proceeding to determine whether the individual to be sentenced should be sentenced to death. Provides that such proceeding shall be conducted before a jury, unless such individual, with the approval of the court, waives a jury. Stipulates that the determination as to whether a sentence of death shall be imposed shall be in the discretion of the court, except that in a proceeding conducted before the court sitting with a jury, the court shall not impose a sentence of death unless it submits to the jury the issue whether the individual to be sentenced should be sentenced to death and the jury returns a verdict that the sentence should be death. Enumerates aggravating and mitigating circumstances to be considered by the court and the jury in determining whether a sentence of death should be imposed."
