    "text": "Federal Child Support Security Act - Declares that it is the purpose of this Act to assure that parents who have abandoned their children will be required to carry out their obligations for child support and maintenance, and that such children will receive the parental support to which they are entitled. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to provide, to an authorized person, the most recent address and place of employment of any individual if the Secretary is reasonably satisfied that such information is sought in connection with the enforcement of the legal duty of the individual to provide for the support and maintenance of a child or children of such individual. Authorizes the Secretary to secure such information from other departments and agencies of the Government. Establishes in the Treasury a revolving fund to be known as the Federal Child Support Security Fund which shall be available to the Secretary to enable him to make child support payments authorized by this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated to the security fund an initial fund of $75,000,000, and thereafter such sums as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to make such child support payments. Provides that the Secretary shall make child support payments under this Act. States that the Secretary shall provide reasonable notice and opportunity for any child who is or claims to be eligible for child support payments under this Act and is in disagreement with any determination of the Secretary shall be subject to judicial review. Provides that the final determination of the Secretary shall be subject to judicial review. Provides penalties for fraud with respect to an application for child support payments under this Act. Provides that any child support payments made under this Act shall be considered to have been made for the benefit of the parent of the child and such parent shall be liable to the United States for the amount of such payments plus interest. Authorizes the Attorney General to initiate appropriate proceedings or the recovery of such amounts due the United States. Declares that it is the duty of recipients of aid to families with dependent children to provide any information which such individual has regarding the identify, address, or place of employment of the parent of such dependent child. States that whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce to avoid parental responsibilities shall be fined not more than $1,000 and/or imprisoned for not more than one year. Provides that legal services programs shall be operated in such cases involving the securing of parental support for children who have been abandoned by a parent."
