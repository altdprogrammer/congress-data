Provides that, during any energy emergency determined in accordance with the provisions of this Act, the President or the appropriate agency head is authorized: (1) to direct the delivery of energy supplies to the affected area; (2) to allocate energy supplies among distributors thereof in the affected area to establish priorities for allocation of energy supplies to categories of end users; (3) to establish an energy conservation program in the affected area; (4) to make emergency energy loans to individuals, families, and public or nonprofit organizations performing essential public services; and (5) to furnish technical assistance and make loans to reestablish disrupted sources of energy supplies or to establish new sources of energy supplies in the affected area. Authorizes the President or the appropriate agency head with the approval of the President: (1) by order, to direct the head of any Federal agency to terminate any contract for the procurement of energy supplies or to suspend performance under any such contract where such action is necessary in order to provide additional energy supplies in the affected area; (2) to establish price ceilings at all levels for one or more types of energy supplies; and (3) to impose compulsory energy conservation programs. Authorizes necessary appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
