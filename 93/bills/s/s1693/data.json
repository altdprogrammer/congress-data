Establishes as an independent agency in the executive branch a Federal Full Employment Board, to consist of five members appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate as follows: one representative of labor, one of management, one distinguished economist, one distinguished manpower expert; and one member of the general public. Authorizes and directs the Board to: (1) recommend to the President and to the Congress a program to achieve full employment; (2) undertake manpower planning and long-range and short-term surveys in terms of demand, supply and sector; (3) review decisions made by public and private employers affecting full employment; (4) develop guidelines and standards for use of public funds in job development programs; (5) review the implementation of manpower training and employment implementation of manpower training and employment programs in terms of the extent to which they contribute to full employment; (6) direct the Secretary of Labor to obligate funds made available under the Full Employment Assistance Fund; (7) hold nationwide and regional conferences; (8) analyze the extent to which the Federal budget may assist in reaching full employment; (9) evaluate programs; and (10) carry out such other functions as the President may direct. Authorizes $3,000,000 to be appropriated for fiscal year 1974 and for each fiscal year thereafter for the activities of the Board. Provides for an annual Full Employment Report setting forth the Board's recommendations with respect to implementation of a full employment policy for each fiscal year and for succeeding fiscal years. Establishes the Full Employment Assistance Fund and authorizes therefor $1 billion for fiscal 1974, and such funds as necessary for each year thereafter. Provides that the Secretary of Labor is to provide assistance from the fund pursuant to specific directions of the Board to public agencies and non-profit private organizations (including prime sponsors of manpower training and employment programs) for public service job development programs, and related training and assistance. Provides that assistance is to be provided by the Secretary only by application submitted to the Secretary and approved by him. States that each application must set forth a program to provide employment and related training and assistance for unemployed persons to enable them to obtain employment not supported under the Act and meet other special requirements. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to use such sums as may be necessary from those appropriated to the Fund for training and other services related to employment. Requires the President to establish an Intergovernmental Full Employment Advisory Council, which shall meet at least twice a year to advise the Board with regard to matters related to achieving the objective of full employment. Provides that in selecting members of the Council, the President shall assure an equitable balance in political and geographical affiliation of its members and shall insure inclusion of State and local prime sponsors and other public and private agencies and organizations responsible for conducting manpower training and employment programs."
