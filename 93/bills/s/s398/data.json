Changes the regulatory definition of the \"working poor\" from those earning $2.75 per hour to those earning $3.50 per hour. Establishes that the Economic Stabilization Act does not authorize the President to withhold or reserve any obligational authority or any funds appropriated under such authority. Requires business enterprises making price reports to make such reports public if the price increase is more than 1.5 percent over the price lawfully in effect for such product on January 11, 1973."
