Asserts that notice of the impoundment shall be given as prescribed by regulation of the Secretary. Provides that any animal impounded may be claimed by the owner within the time specified in the notice, upon payment of $5 per day for each animal impounded and the reasonable value of the forage consumed. Directs that an animal not so claimed shall be sold and the net proceeds thereof, after payment of all necessary expenses and the deduction of the $5 per day and forage charge, shall be paid to the owner if claim and proof of ownership satisfactory to the Secretary are submitted within six months after the date of sale. Declares that the $5 per day and forage charge and the net proceeds of the sale, if not paid to the owner of the animal, shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the tribe, if tribal land is involved, or paid to the individual Indian owners, if individually owned land is involved. Asserts that any unbranded livestock over one year of age found running at large on trust or restricted land may be presumed to be in trespass and shall be subject to such provisions. Provides that Indian tribal governments may enact laws and ordinances relating to the issuance of traders licenses on their particular reservations."
