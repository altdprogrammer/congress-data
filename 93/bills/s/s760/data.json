Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to make loans in any area designated by him or by the President as a major disaster area: (1) to qualifying farmers, ranchers, or oyster planters who are citizens of the United States; and (2) to eligible private domestic corporations or partnerships engaged primarily in farming, ranching, or oyster planting. Establishes a 5% interest rate on emergency agricultural loans. Increases to $500,000,000 the limitation on loans made from the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund"
