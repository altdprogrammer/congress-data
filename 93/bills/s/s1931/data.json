    "text": "States that notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, if the Secretary of Agriculture determines for 1973 that because of a natural disaster a portion of the farm peanut acreage allotment in a county cannot be timely planted or replanted in such year, he may authorize for such year the transfer of all or part of the peanut acreage allotments for any farm in the county so affected to another farm in the county or in an adjoining county on which one or more of the producers on the farm from which the transfer is to be made will be engaged in the production of peanuts and will share in the proceeds thereof, in accordance with such regulation as the Secretary may prescribe. Provides that any farm allotment transferred under this Act shall be deemed to be released acreage for the purpose of acreage history credits under the Agricultural Adjustment Act. Provides that nothwithstanding the provisions of this Act, the transfer of any farm allotment under this Act shall operate to make the farm from which the allotment was transferred eligible for an allotment as having peanuts planted thereon during a three-year base period. (Adds 7 U.S.C. 1358 (j))"
