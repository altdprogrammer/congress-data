Establishes a National Metric Conversion Board, consisting of 11 members, 9 of whom shall be appointed by the Presidnet with the advice and consent of the Senate from the following areas: business, labor, education, consumer protection, science, and technology. Provides that one member of the Board shall be a Member of the House of Representatives appointed by the Speaker and one member shall be a Member of the Senate appointed by the President of the Senate. Requires the Board, within 18 months after funding, to submit to the President and the Congress a comprehensive plan to accomplish a changeover to the metric system of measurement in the United States, together with legislative recommendations. Authorizes the Board in carrying out its duties to enter into contracts for research, hold hearings, and establish advisory committees. Provides that the Board shall cease to exist ten years after submission of its comprehensive plan. Authorizes to be appropriated a total of $20,500,000 for fiscal years 1974-77 for the purposes of this Act. Provides, under the Internal Revenue Code, for the depreciation of property necessary for metric conversion. (Amends 26 U.S.C 167) Authorizes assistance under the Small Business Act to small businesses and individuals to aid in the expense of metric conversion. Directs the Commission of Education to make grants to, and contracts with, institutions of higher education, State and local educational agencies, and other public and private nonprofit agencies, organizations, and institutions to develop and carry out programs of public education necessary to carry out the policy objectives of this Act.
