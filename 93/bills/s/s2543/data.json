    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Revises the Freedom of Information Act by requiring each Government agency to make available for public inspection and copying current indexes providing identifying information for the public as to any matter issued, adopted, or promulgated after July 4, 1967, and required by this Act to be made available and published. Provides that each agency, upon any request for records which describes such records and is made in accordance with the procedural rules shall make the records promptly available to any person. Directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to promulgate regulations regarding duplication and search fees applicable to all agencies. States that such fees shall ordinarily not be charged when: (1) the person requesting the records is indigent; (2) such fees would amount to less than $3; (3) the requested records are not found; and (4) the records are exempt from disclosure. Describes the complaint procedure to be followed when records are improperly withheld. Requires each agency to submit an annual report to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, detailing statistics relating to requests for records."
