    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "National Community Television Antenna Act - States that the Congress declares that community antenna television systems provide an essential service, and that access to a full offering of diversified television communications and supplemental electronics service via such systems is not a luxury, but is an essential condition for the survival of our society; that few communities will need, or be able to support, two such systems and that a full offering of such service must be uniformly and universally available for public needs and public use. Provides under Communication Act that \"community antenna system\" means any facility which, in whole or in part, receives directly or indirectly over the air and amplifies or otherwise modifies the signals transmitting programs broadcast by one or more broadcast stations and distributes such signals by wire or cable to subscribing members of the public who pay for such service. Authorizes the Federal Communications Commission, as the public interest, convenience and necessity requires, to prescribe such rules and regulations, issue such authorizations and orders, and prescribe such conditions and restrictions, with respect to community antenna television systems as may be necessary to regulate community antenna systems."
