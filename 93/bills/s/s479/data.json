Provides that if the Director determines that the importation of such a material is contrary to such policy he shall promptly so advise the President. States that when the President is so advised he shall promptly order the imposition of quantitative restrictions upon such importation. Provides that the President may permit additional importations to protect the health of the domestic economy and to maintain the capability of the United States to meet national security requirements."
