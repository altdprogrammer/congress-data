Repeals specified statutes relating to safety appliances and equipment on railroad engines and cars, and protection of employees and travelers. Increases civil penalties for railroad safety violations to not less than $250 or more than $2,500, with each day constituting a separate offense. Makes it unlawful for any railroad carrier to use on its line any locomotive unless said locomotive, its tender, and all parts thereof are in proper condition, have been inspected from time to time, and are safe to operate in service. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe appropriate rules and standards governing the safe operation of all locomotives, their tenders and all parts thereof. Sets forth provisions concerning the inspection of locomotives, and appeals to the Secretary from adverse determinations. Prescribes a $250 to $2,500 civil penalty for a common carrier which violates the provisions of this Act relating to locomotives. (Amends 45 U.S.C. 441, 22-34; 49 U.S.C. 1762)"
