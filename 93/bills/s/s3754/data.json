    "text": "Child and Family Services Act - Expresses the findings of Congress and declares that the purposes of this Act are to establish and expand children and family service programs, build upon the experience of Headstart, give special emphasis to preschool children and families with the greatest needs, and provide decision making with direct parent participation through a partnership of parents, State, local and Federal government. Authorizes to be appropriated $150 million for fiscal year 1975 and $200 million for fiscal year 1976 for training, planning, and technical assistance and $500 million in fiscal year 1976 and $1 billion in fiscal year 1977 for program operation. Title I: Child and Family Service Programs - Establishes the Office of Child and Family Services in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare as the principal agency for administration of this Act. Creates the Child and Family Services Coordinating Council with representatives from various federal agencies to assure coordination of federal programs in the field. Defines the purposes for which Federal funds can be used: (1) planning and developing programs, including pilot programs; (2) establishing programs, including child care in the home: after-school programs; family prenatal care; programs to meet special needs of minorities, Indians, migrants and bilingual children; food and nutrition services; and special activities for handicapped children within regular programs; (3) rental, renovation, acquisition or construction of facilities, including mobile facilities; (4) preservice and inservice training; (5) staff and administration expenses of councils and committees required by the Act; and (6) dissemination of information to families. Provides for the reservation of funds proportionately for handicapped children and for migrant and Indian children, and up to 5 percent for model programs. Allocates the remainder among the States and within the States, and within the States, 50 percent according to relative number of economically disadvantaged children, 25 percent according to relative number of children through age five, and 25 percent according to relative number of children of working mothers and single parents. Allows the use of up to 5 percent of a State's allocation for special State programs. Provides that a State, locality, or combination of localities may be designated by the Secretary as a prime sponsor for the purpose of entering into arrangements to carry out programs under this title. Establishes performance criteria for prime sponsors, including coordination of all services for children within the prime sponsorship area and establishment of a Child and Family Service Council to administer and coordinate programs. Empowers the Secretary to directly fund an Indian tribe to carry out programs on a reservation and public or private nonprofit agencies to operate migrant programs, model programs, or programs where no prime sponsor has been designated or where a designated prime sponsor is not meeting certain needs. Provides for the Governor to comment on prime sponsorship applications and provides appeal procedures for applicants who are disapproved. Sets forth the composition, method of selection, and functions of Child and Family Service Councils to be established by each prime sponsor. Requires that at least one-third of the total membership of the Child and Family Service Council shall be persons who are economically disadvantaged. States that financial assistance under this title may be provided by the Secretary for fiscal year 1975 and any subsequent fiscal year to a prime sponsor only pursuant to a child and family service plan which is approved by the Secretary in accordance with the provisions of this title. Sets forth the conditions for such approval, requiring that any such program shall: (1) provide that programs or services under this title shall be provided only for children whose parents request them; (2) identifies child and family service needs and goals within the area and describes the purposes for which the financial assistance will be used; and (3) meets the needs of children and families in the prime sponsorship area, with priority for services to children who have not attained six years of age, and other enumerated criteria. Allows Federal funding for construction or acquisition only where no alternatives are practicable. Provides that no more than 15 percent of a prime sponsor's funds may be used for construction, and that no more than half of that may be in the form of grants rather than loans. Requires that the Federal Government and prime sponsors make available for child and family service programs, facilities they own and lease, when they are not fully utilized for other purposes. Provides a 100 percent Federal share for planning in the first year, 90 percent Federal share for fiscal years 1976 and 1977, and 80 percent for subsequent fiscal years. Provides a 100 percent Federal share for programs for migrants and Indians, and allows waiver of part or all of the non-Federal share where necessary to meet needs of economically disadvantaged children. States that the non-Federal share may be in cash or in kind. Requires that revenues generated by fees may not be used as the non-Federal share but must be used as the non-Federal share but must be used by the prime sponsor to expand programs. Title II: Supportive Services and Special Activities - Requires a national committee on Federal standards, with one-half parent participation, to establish standards for all child care services programs funded by this or any other Federal act. Requires a committee to develop a uniform minimum code dealing with health and safety of children and applicable to all facilities funded by this Act. Requires the Secretary to make annual evaluations and report to Congress on Federal child family services activities. Title III: Research and Demonstrations - Authorizes child and family services research and requires that the Office of Child and Family Services coordinate research by Federal agencies. Title IV: General Provisions - Defines terms used in this Act. Requires that procedures be established to assure adequate nutrition services in programs under this Act, including use of the special food service programs of the School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act. Sets forth an anti-crimination provision, including separate provisions on sex discrimination. Requires that programs meet the minimum wage. Prohibits the use of funds for constructing, operating, or maintaining facilities for sectarian instruction or religious worship. Provides that no child may be the subject of research or experimentation without parental approval, and that no child may be forced to undergo examination or treatment if parents object. Requires approval of the Secretary for child development programs for very young children. Requires that all applications, plans, and written material pertaining thereto be made available to the public without charge."
