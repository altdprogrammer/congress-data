Provides that the Comptroller General will have 60 days to make the studies requested and submit the reports thereon to the committee chairmen and the Members. Requires the Comptroller General to submit status reports to the Congress not later than 30 days after the beginning of each congressional session and at such other times as he believes useful during periods when authorizations and appropriations are being considered on such major weapons systems, major construction programs, and research and development programs as he considers will be of primary interest to the Congress. Provides that such reports shall be designed to advise Congress of : (1) current cost estimates as compared with prior estimates for (a) research, development, and engineering and (b) production; (2) the reasons for significant fluctuations in cost estimates between the original authorization and contract and the current cost requirement; (3) options available under the contract for additional procurement and whether the agency intends to exercise any options, and the projected cost of exercising options; (4) changes in the performance specifications or estimates made by the contractor or agency and the reasons for any major change in actual or estimated differences from that stated in the original contract specifications; and (5) significant slippages in time schedules and reasons therefor. Title II: Office of the Comptroller General of the United States - Changes the name of the General Accounting Office to the Office of the Comptroller General of the United States. Authorizes the Comptroller General to place two positions at a salary rate not to exceed level IV of the Executive Schedule ($38,000) when he considers that action necessary to reflect changes in organization, management responsibilities, or workload of the Office.

Makes a similar change in the frequency of audit and reporting date with respect to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Homeowners Foundation.
