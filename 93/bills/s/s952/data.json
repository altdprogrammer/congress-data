    "text": "Domestic Fisherman's Emergency Assistance Act - Provides reimbursement to fishermen for losses incurred as a result of fishing restrictions imposed by a State or the United States. Provides for a Federal payment of up to 70 percent of the yearly gross earnings from domestic fishing lost as a result of the restrictions. Determines lost gross income on the basis of income per fishnet for a non-restricted year versus that income per fishnet for the restricted year; or if this formula is not applicable, then lost gross income shall be determined by the difference between gross earnings in an unrestricted year and gross earnings in a restricted year. Provides that if the fisherman accepts reimbursement, he automatically authorizes the Federal Government to file suit in his behalf against those who committed acts which resulted in the imposition of the Federal or State restriction. Directs that any amount collected in excess of the initial reimbursement and court cost would be turned over to the aggrieved fisherman by the governmental entity which initiated the suit. Authorizes appropriations of $4 million for operation of the program for fiscal year 1973 and $5 million for each of the four succeeding years."
