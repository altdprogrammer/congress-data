    "text": "North Slope Energy Resources Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, to grant, issue, or renew rights-of-way over, upon, or through the Federal lands for any purpose authorized by said Act except for those purposes prohibited by this Act, in such widths as he may deem necessary and proper, after complying with all existing applicable statutes, regulations, and proceedings pertaining to granting, issuance, or renewal of such permits, for a period of two years from the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to submit to Congress a catalog of existing rights-of-way laws; a description of the extent to which Federal lands are now dedicated to private rights-of-way; a comprehensive Federal plan for the granting of rights-of-way across the Federal lands; and the required environmental impact statements thereon, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Requests the President of the United States, utilizing the services of the Secretary of State, to enter into negotiations with the appropriate officials of the Government of Canada to ascertain within one hundred and eighty days of the date of enactment of this Act the feasibility of construction, operation, and maintenance of a transportation corridor for the North Slope oil and gas. Directs the Director of the National Science Foundation to undertake a study of the feasibility of alternatives for a corridor for the delivery of North Slope oil and natural gas insofar as such a corridor: (1) affects the national interest and welfare of the United States, and (2) poses environmental risks along the length of its route. Provides that the Secretary of the Interior, within three hundred and thirty days of the date of enactment of this Act, shall submit to the Committee on the Interior of the House and Senate his recommendations as to the most desirable route for transmission of North Slope Alaska oil and natural gas to the other States of the United States. Authorizes necessary appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
