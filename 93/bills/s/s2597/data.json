    "text": "Provides, under the National Security Act, that the powers and duties of the Central Intelligence Agency shall be for the purpose of coordinating the foreign intelligence activities of government departments and agencies in the interest of national security (formerly not directed exclusively at foreign intelligence). States that nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorizing the Central Intelligence Agency to engage, within the United States, in any police or police-type activity or any internal security operation. (Amends 50 U.S.C. 403) Provides that any unit of local government which received payments under the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 for the first three entitlement periods which were, in the aggregate, in excess of 500 per cent of the total amount of such payments, is relieved from liability for repayment to the United States of the amount which exceeds the amount of entitlement. Authorizes funds to be appropriated to the State and Local Government Fiscal Assistance Trust Fund, out of amounts in the general fund of the Treasury attributable to the collections of the Federal individual income taxes not otherwise appropriated. Specifies the amounts of such sums for fiscal years 1974 through 1976."
