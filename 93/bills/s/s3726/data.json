    "text": "Redefines the term \"household,\" for purposes of the Food Stamp Act of 1964, to mean a group of individuals who are not residents of an institution or boarding house but are living as one economic unit sharing common cooking facilities and for whom food is customarily purchased in common. Deletes provisions of such Act allowing distribution of federally donated foods (during a transition period to a food stamp program) for emergencies or on the request of a State agency. Deletes provisions of such Act making 18 year-olds ineligible for one year for food stamps, if from an ineligible household and claimed as a dependent in the previous year. States that households shall have food stamp eligibility terminated for a year if they refuse necessary information to the State administering agency. Removes provisions allowing households to choose to receive coupon allotments having a face value that is less than the face value of the coupon allotment authorized for them."
