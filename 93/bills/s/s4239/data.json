    "text": "International Disaster Relief Act - Expresses the policy of Congress that prompt United States assistance to alleviate human suffering caused by natural and man-made disasters abroad is an important expression of the humanitarian concern and tradition of the American people, and affirms the willingness of the United States to provide assistance for the humanitarian relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction of peoples and countries affected by such disasters. Authorizes the President to furnish assistance for disaster relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction in the case of disasters that require large-scale relief and rehabilitation efforts which cannot be met adequately with the funds available for obligation for disaster relief under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. States that assistance made available under this Act shall be distributed to the maximum extent practicable under the auspices and direction of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, other international organizations or arrangements, multilateral institutions, or private voluntary agencies. Authorizes appropriations to the President, in addition to funds which may otherwise be available for such purposes, for fiscal year 1975 not to exceed $100,000,000 to assist in meeting the international relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction needs caused by the massive flooding and food shortages in the People's Republic of Bangladesh, the civil and international strife in the Republic of Cyprus, the drought and famine conditions in the nations of Africa, the hurricane damage in Honduras, and for such other international disasters that require large-scale humanitarian assistance."
