Specifies the composition of the Commission. States that it shall be the function of the Commission to make reports to the President and to the Congress with respect to: (1) the existence or possibility of any long- or short-term shortages or market adversities affecting the supply of any natural resources, raw agriculture commodities, materials, manufactured products, and the reason for such shortages or adversities; (2) the adverse impact or possible adverse impact of such shortages, practices, or adversities upon consumers, in terms of price and lack of availability of desired goods; (3) the need for, and the assessment of, alternative actions necessary to increase the availability of the items referred to in (1) or otherwise to mitigate the adverse impact or possible adverse impact of shortages, practices, or adversities upon consumers; and (4) existing policies and practices of government which may tend to affect the supply of natural resources and other commodities. Authorizes the Commission to establish such advisory committees as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out any specific analytical or investigative undertakings on behalf of the Commission. Requires the Commission, in order to integrate the study of supplies and shortages of resources and commodities into the total problem of balanced national growth and development, to establish an advisory committee to develop recommendations regarding the establishment of a policy making process and structure within the executive and legislative branches of the Federal Government and a system for coordinating these efforts with appropriate multi-State, regional, and State governmental jurisdiction. Authorizes the appropriation of not in excess of $75,000 for fiscal year 1975 for the purpose of carrying out this provision. Authorizes the appropriation of not in excess of $500,000 for fiscal year 1975 to carry out the provisions of this Act."
