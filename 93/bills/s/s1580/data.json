Specifies that the Board shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Empowers the Board to establish rules and regulations under which a corporation may receive a charter as a United States Sports Association. Provides that such Association shall be the sole sanctioning authority for amateur athletic competition in the United States. Requires that in order to receive a charter an Association would be required to meet the regulations and procedures established by the Board and receive recognition by the international sports organization governing the sport. Provides that no open amateur athletic competitive meet be conducted within the United States more than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act (unless such meet is sanctioned by a United States Sports Association). Authorizes necessary appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
