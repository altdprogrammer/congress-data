Enumerates powers granted to the Board in order to carry out its function. Specifies that the board is authorized to employ experts and consultants as provided by law, appoint advisory committees, make contracts, and take such other actions as may be required. States that the Board may hold hearings and that the process of the Board is recognizable and punishable by any court of law with proper jurisdiction. Lists the powers of duly designated employees, officers, and agents relating to the conduct of surface transportation accidents. Authorizes the Board to carry out a statewide motor vehicle accidents demonstration project in a State representative of the conditions and highways existing in the Nation. Declares that the purpose of such project is to determine if a greater focus on motor vehicle accidents by the Board would significantly reduce the number of motor vehicle accidents and fatalities. Authorizes the appropriation of $4,000,000 for this project for fiscal year 1975."
