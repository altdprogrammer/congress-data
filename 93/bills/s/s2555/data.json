    "text": "School Guidelines Act - Declares the policy of the United States with respect to the application of Federal law relating to desegregation. States that nothing in this Act or in any other Act shall be construed: (1) as requiring any local educational agency which assigns students to schools on the basis of geographic attendance areas drawn on a racially nondiscriminatory basis to adopt any other method of student assignment; or (2) construed to require the assignment or transportation of students or teachers in order to overcome racial imbalance, or to carry out a plan of racial desegregation, except on the express written voluntary request of appropriate officials of the local educational agency involved. Prohibits the use of funds appropriated for educational purposes to be used for busing. States that a parent of a child transported to a public school in accordance with a court order, may seek to reopen or intervene in the further implementation of such court order if the time or distance of travel is so great as to risk the health of the student or significantly impinge on his or her educational process. Provides that the rules of evidence required to prove that State or local authorities are practicing racial discrimination in assigning students to public schools shall be uniform throughout the United States."
