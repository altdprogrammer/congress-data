Authorizes the President to establish, within the Executive Office of the President, a Cost of Living Task Force to which he may delegate his authority under this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 to carry out the purposes of this Act. Terminates the authority under this Act at midnight, October 1, 1975."
