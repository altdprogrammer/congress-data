    "text": "Mined Area Protection Act - Title I: Asserts that mining operations are essential activities affecting interstate commerce and that such operations sometimes adversely affect the environment. Declares that a nationwide effort to eliminate and prevent the adverse effects of mining operations is necessary, and that the principal responsibility for development and enforcement of environmental regulations vis a vis mining operations should rest with the States. Title II: Environmental Regulations for Mining Operations - Allows each State to submit to the Secretary of the Interior State environmental regulations for mining operations on all non-Federal lands within such State. Requires the Secretary to approve such regulations if they: (1) require procurement of a State permit and submission of a mine reclamation plan by each mine operator; (2) contain provisions assuring that the mining operation will not violate water quality standards and will control erosion, pollution and hazards to public health and safety; (3) require reclamation and posting of performance bonds to insure such reclamation; (4) provide for filing engineering maps of all inactive and active surface and underground mining operations; (5) provide for regular reports to the Secretary; (6) designate an agency vested with power to enforce regulations and to monitor environmental changes in mined areas; (7) are developed with the full participation of all interested government bodies and other groups; (8) provide for funding, manpower and training; and (9) provide for regular review and updating of their provisions. Directs the Secretary to issue guidelines elaborating the above criteria so as to assure that the State regulations provide the mine operator sufficient flexibility to choose the most economically efficient means of meeting State regulations. Establishes an advisory committee to assist in developing such guidelines. Stipulates that if within 2 years a State has failed to devise approved environmental regulations for mining operations, the Secretary shall issue environmental regulations governing mining operations within such State. Provides for the cessation of the applicability of Federal regulations upon the subsequent approval of State regulations by the Secretary. Grants the Secretary the right to inspect and investigate mining operations. Prescribes civil and criminal penalties for various violations of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and to provide nonfinancial assistance to States for the purpose of carrying out environmental regulations. Title III: Authorizes the heads of Federal departments, having jurisdiction over land on which mining operations are permitted, to promulgate environmental regulations of such mining operations. Specifies that such regulations may not be less stringent than the regulations existing in the State where the land is located."
