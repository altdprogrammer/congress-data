States that each department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government having jurisdiction over any construction program shall require the preparation of a complete life-cycle cost analysis for all new facilities exceeding fifty thousand square feet of usable floor space. Provides that such life-cycle cost analysis shall include specified elements, including: (1) the positioning of the facility on its physical site; (2) the amount and type of glass and insulation employed in the facility; (3) the variable occupancy and operating conditions of the facility; and (4) an energy consumption analysis of the facility's heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning system, lighting system, and all other energy consuming systems."
