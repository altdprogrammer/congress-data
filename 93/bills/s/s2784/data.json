    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act - =Title I: Vocational Rehabilitation and Educational Assistance Rate Adjustments= - Increases the base figures for vocational rehabilitation and Educational assistance for Veterans. Adjusts three-quarter and half-time rates to provide the same proportion as the amount of training taken. Provides increases for trainees pursuing farm-cooperative apprentice programs or other on the job training. Extends vocational rehabilitation benefits to qualified veterans of the Vietnam era. =Title II: Educational Assistance Program Adjustments= - Extends the current 8-year delimiting date for veterans to complete their programs of education to 10 years. Excludes in computing the delimiting date, those veterans and civilians held as prisoners of war in the Vietnam theater of operations for the period of time which they were detained plus any period of time which they were hospitalized immediately subsequent to their release. Extends to those Veterans discharged from military service up to 6 months of educational assistance to pursue refresher training to update knowledge, skills, and technological advances occurring in their fields of employment during their period of active military service. Stipulates that the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs shall not approve the enrollment of an eligible veteran or eligible person in any course offered by an institution which utilizes advertising, sales, or enrollment practices of any type which are erroneous, deceptive, or misleading either by actual statement, omission, or intimation. Directs the Administrator to assign to each educational institution a full-time veteran's representative. Sets forth the functions of such veterans' representatives, including the following: (1) to answer all inquiries related to Veterans' Administration educational assistance and other benefits, and take all necessary action to resolve such inquiries expeditiously, especially those relating to payments of educational assistance benefits; (2) to assure correctness and proper handling of applications, completion of certifications of attendance, and submission of all necessary information in support of benefit claims submitted; and (3) to maintain active liaison and cooperation with the officials of the educational institution to which assigned, in order to alert veterans to changes in law and Veterans' Administration policies or procedures. Establishes an Interagency Advisory Council on Veterans' Services. States that the functions of the Council shall be to seek to promote maximum feasible effectiveness, coordination, and interrelationship of services among all programs and activities affecting veterans and their dependents. =Title III: Veterans' Education Loan Program= - Establishes a veterans' education loan program. Prescribes the eligibility requirements, the amount and conditions, and interest rate of such loans. Requies that a fee shall be collected from each veteran obtaining a loan for the purpose of insuring against defaults on such loans. =Title IV: Veterans, Wives, and Widows Employment Assistance and Preference and Veterans' Reemployment Rights= - Extends job counseling, training, and placement services for veterans to include among those eligible to receive services, widows of veterans who have died of service-connected causes and wives of totally disabled veterans. Directs the Civil Service Commission, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, the Administrator of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, to establish an affirmative action plan for every Federal department and agency for the preferential employment of disabled veterans and veterans of the Vietnam era. Extends reemployment rights to those who were employed by State or local governments prior to entering the service. =Title V: Effective Dates= - Makes the effective date of Titles I-IV of this Act as follows: (1) Title I-July 1, 1974, except as otherwise provided therein; (2) Titles II and IV-effective on the date of their enactment, and (3) Title III-September 1, 1974."
