    "text": "Clean Air Amendments - Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to approve State air quality control plans that include fixed or variable emission limitations (based, whenever technically feasible, on measurement and field-validated models of the impact of individual sources), schedules, and timetables for compliance with such limitations, or such other meausres as may be necessary to insure attainment and maintenance of such primary or secondary standard; provide for revision, after public hearings, of such plan from time to time as may be necessary to take account of (1) revisions of such national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard and (2) the availability of improved or more expeditious methods, including more cost-effective methods, of achieving such primary or secondary standard; and provides a procedure for petition by a source owner or operator to the State agency for promulgation of emission limitations or other measures with respect to a particular source different from those approved elsewhere in the Act. Allows any owner or operator of a new stationary source to petition the Administrator for a permit to operate a new source with emission limits in excess of those established by the Administrator as standards of performance for such source. Requires the Administrator to establish procedures for conduct of hearings on the record with respect to such petitions. Requires the Administrator to revise State plans within nine months that are not in conformance with this Act."
