States that such guarantee shall be made pursuant to an agreement by the Administration to purchase equity securities evidencing the interest of an investor in such a concern in accordance with terms and conditions prescribed by the Administration subject to specified limitations and restrictions. States that a guarantee agreement entered into under this Act by the Administration shall obligate the Administration to purchase securities covered by the agreement and held by an investor. Provides that the Administration shall fix a uniform fee which it deems reasonable and necessary for any guarantee issued under this Act to be payable at such time and under such conditions as may be determined by the Administration."
