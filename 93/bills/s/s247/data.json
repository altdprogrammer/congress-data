Provides that an applicant for renewal who is legally, financially and technically qualified shall be awarded the grant if such applicant shows that its broadcast service during the preceding license period has reflected a good-faith effort to serve the needs and interests of its area as represented in its immediately preceding and pending license renewal application and if it has not demonstrated a callous disregard for law or the Commission's regulations."
