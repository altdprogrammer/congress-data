Provides that once an employee becomes eligible to participate in a pension plan, his years of service with the employer (on and after the effective date of the plan) before becoming a participant, up to a maximum of 5 years, are to be credited toward his required years for minimum vesting. States that additional preparticipation service, beyond 5 years, is to be credited to the employee for any years which which (although the employee technically may not have been a participant) the employee contributed to the plan or the employer contributed on the employee's behalf.

States that a qualified retirement plan (whether trusteed or insured) required to give each participant vested rights to at least 25 percent of his accrued benefit from employer contributions after 5 years of service, plus 5 percentage points a year for each of the next 5 years of service and 10 percentage points a year for each year of service thereafter. Provides with respect to the coverage and antidiscrimination requirements, for the exclusion of those employees who are nonresident aliens with no United States income from the employment in question. Stipulates that any plan which, on the date of enactment, provides for 100 percent vesting of employer contributions by the end of the tenth year of the employee's service with the employer under the plan may continue to use this vesting schedule. States that a class year plan may meet the vesting requirements under the bill if the plan provides for 100 percent vesting of the employer contributions within 5 years after the end of the plan year for which the contributions were made. Provides that no rights to accrued benefits, once vested, can be assigned or alienated under a qualified plan, and such rights cannot be forfeited (except that benefits attributable to employer contributions may be forfeited in the event of death, or if the employee withdraws his own mandatory contributions to the plan).

Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to bring actions for equitable relief to restrain plans from failing to comply with the vesting requirements in practice. Authorizes highly mobile employees to trade off high benefits which might be available under one pension plan of their employer for the right to participate in another plan with lower benefits but very rapid vesting. Also, authorizes the Secretary of Labor to develop recommendations for modifications of Federal procurement regulations to insure that highly mobile professional, scientific, technical and other personnel in occupations employed under Federal contracts will be protected against forfeitures of their retirement benefits.

Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make a study of the funding of government plans, which takes account of the minimum funding standards under this Act, and the taxing power of the governmental unit, and make recommendations as to whether it would be advisable to require such plans to comply with the funding requirements applicable to private pension plans, or some other funding standards, as recommended by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to file his report with the Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee by December 31, 1976. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to develop, in consultation with professional societies, business organizations, and other Federal agencies, recommendations for modifications of Federal procurement regulations to ensure, to the maximum possible extent, that professional, scientific, technical and other personnel employed under Federal contracts shall be protected against loss of their pensions resulting from job transfers or loss of employment. Requires such recommendations to be published in the Federal Register within six months after enactment and are to be adopted by each Federal department and agency unless the head of such department or agency has substantial grounds for determining that the recommendations should not be applied in the case of his department. =Title III: Portability= - Establishes a voluntary portability fund for the use of employees who leave an employer with vested retirement plan benefits.

Provides that the insurance program would be funded through premiums imposed upon employers at an initial flat rate of $1 per plan participant. States that in order to be \"qualified\" for tax benefits in the sense of the Internal Revenue Code, defined benefit plans must provide plan termination insurance coverage for their participants through payment of the premiums. States that coverage of a plan participant is limited to the lesser of 50 percent of the participant's average monthly gross income during his highest-paid five consecutive year period as a plan participant or $750 monthly (adjusted for changes in the Social Security contributions and benefits base). Provides that employers are liable to the extent of 30 percent of their net worth for the Corporation's payments upon terminations of their plans, but employers may elect to avoid this liability by paying an additional premium in an amount to be determined, from time to time, by the Corporation. =Title V: Disclosure and Fiduciary Standards= - Requires under the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act additional information be provided in the plan descriptions and annual reports filed with the Labor Department. States that annual reports would be required for private funded employee benefit plans of any size maintained by an employer or employee organization affecting interstate commerce and coverage would be extended to most tax-exempt organizations. Requires plan administrators to furnish to each new participant a summary of the plan's important provisions, including an explantion of plan benefits and the circumstances which would disqualify a person from receiving benefits. States that under the Internal Revenue Code applications for qualification of employee benefit plans (except for plans covering less than 26 persons) and annual returns filed with regard to these plans would be available to the public.

Authorizes both employees and employers to appeal determination letters issued by the Internal Revenue Service to the United States Tax Court after exhausting their remedies under the Internal Revenue Service's administrative procedures. Employees as well as employers are to be allowed to participate in the Service's administrative proceedings. States that if either the employer or the employee exercises his right of appeal and requests the Tax Court to issue a declaratory judgment, the other party is to have the right to intervene in the proceedings. Requires an arbitration procedure to be provided in each employee benefit plan, for settlement of claims under the plans. Directs the Department of Labor to prescribe regulations for the type of arbitration provisions which are to be included in the plans. Provides for the imposition of a $1 audit-fee-excise tax on the employer for each plan participant in a qualified employee plan to provide for Internal Revenue Service costs of administering the retirement plan provisions. Makes it illegal to discriminate against any participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the bill. =Title VII: Retirement Savings; Limitation on Proprietary Employee Contributions; Taxation of Certain Lump-Sum Distributions= - States that any individual who was not covered during a year as an active participant in a qualified retirement plan, or a government plan (whether or not qualified), or an annuity plan, is to be permitted a deduction of $1,000 a year from earned income, or (if greater) 15 percent of earned income up to $1,500, for contributions to a personal retirement account. Provides that the deduction in this case is to be from gross income.

States that if an individual wishes to establish an individual retirement account, the trustee of the account has to maintain, under the provisions of a written governing instrument, a separate accounting of the individual's contributions, the earnings on them, and the distributions made either to the individual involved or to his beneficiaries. Stipulates that if the individual establishing the account dies before his entire interest in the account has been distributed to him, the governing instrument is to require that the undistributed assets be distributed, or be applied to the purchase of an annuity for his beneficiaries, within 5 years after his death. States that the proceeds from an individual retirement account are to be taxable to the individual when distributed.
