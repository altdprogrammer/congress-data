Makes it unlawful for any pipeline company to transport any crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbon, or any finished product, which is produced or manufactured by such pipeline company or any company which is an affiliate of such pipeline company. Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to require companies holding ownership interests in facilities which are prohibited by this Act to submit plans for the divestment of such ownership interest within one year from the date of enactment of this Act.
