Not later than March 30, 1974, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, in cooperation with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Secretary of Defense acting through the Interdepartment Group on Collision Avoidance and Pilot Warning, shall complete the flight test and evaluation currently competing airborne collision avoidance systems, as defined in the Federal Aviation Act, and, not later than June 30, 1974, shall select a national standard for such systems. Provides that not later than December 30, 1974, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall publish implementation rules and regulations to describe compatible use and operating procedures between CAS systems and the existing air traffic control system. Sets forth minimum standards regarding collison avoidance systems and the specified dates upon which there must be compliance with such standards."
