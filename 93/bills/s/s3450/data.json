Imposes such civil penalties, of up to a $1,000 fine, for: (1) violating any rule or regulation governing drawbridges; and (2) unreasonably delaying the opening of a drawbridge after a reasonable signal has been given. Provides that it shall not be lawful for any bridge, drawbridge or causeway to obstruct, hazard or endanger the free navigation of any navigable waters of the United States, when such obstruction, harzard or danger results from a failure to keep the bridge, drawbridge or causeway and its accessory works in proper repair."
