    "text": "Freedom of Information Act Security Classification Amendments - Sets forth statutory provisions governing the administration of the security classification system under the Freedom of Information Act. Establishes an independent Classification Review Commission, with regulatory and quasi-adjudicatory authority over the administration of the security classification system. Provides the Commission with responsibility for settling disputes between the Congress and the Executive branch over access to classified information requested by a majority of either House of Congress, by congressional committees, or by the Comptroller General of the United States. States that decisions of the Commission in this field are subject to judicial review. Limits the authority of executive departments, agencies, and officials to classify documents. Provides for automatic declassification after 15 years of national defense information previously classified. Limits the classification period for \"Top Secret\" documents and information to three years, except for a category of highly sensitive national defense information. Provides for enforcement mechanisms to prevent classification of documents to hide incompetence, inefficiency wrongdoing, or embarrassment. (Amends 5 U.S.C. 552(d))"
