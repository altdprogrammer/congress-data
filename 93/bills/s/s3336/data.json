    "text": "Farm Labor Contractor Registration Amendments - Redefines the terms \"farm labor contractor\" and \"agricultural employment\" for purposes of the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act of 1963. Requires farm labor contractors, in order to receive registration certificates, to carry insurance on vehicles for transportation of migrant workers of $25,000 for injury or death of one person and $100,000 for injury or death of all persons in any one accident. States that the Secretary of Labor may refuse to issue or may revoke a certificate of registration if the contractor is merely a front for one who has previously had a certificate refused or revoked. Requires a written contract of employment between contractors and workers, stating, among other matters, the terms and conditions of any strike or slowdown. Removes the word \"interstate\" from the description of agricultural employment requiring payroll records. Requires the Secretary to respect the confidentiality of employees filing a complaint where the Secretary has begun an investigation of a contractor. Adds a one-year prison term and penalties for second violations to the penalty provisions of the Act. Makes it unlawful for a contractor to fire, demote or threaten a worker in retaliation for such worker's exercise of rights under this Act or any other provision of Federal law. Allows any person claiming to be aggrieved by violation of this Act to bring an action in any district court. Voids any agreement by an employee purporting to modify his rights under this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $5,000,000 for carrying out this Act in fiscal year 1975 and for each fiscal year thereafter."
