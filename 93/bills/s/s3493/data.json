Directs the Secretary to establish, administer, and conduct such programs of investigation and research, and undertake such pilot projects for management of wetlands, and develop and demonstrate such techniques, as he determines necessary in order to maintain or increase the biological productivity of the principal migratory bird habitats of the Atlantic flyway. Directs the Secretary to establish an Advisory Council of no more than seven members to represent the views of the principal agencies, organizations, and institutions concerned with the preservation, perpetuation, and management of wetland resources for migratory birds in the Atlantic flyway and to advise him with respect thereto. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
