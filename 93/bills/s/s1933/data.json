Provides that this restriction shall not apply to any purchases by an association for its investment account or accounts of any such obligations (1) it alone has underwritten or (2) directly from the underwriting syndicate or member thereof in which it is a participant, or to associations not in the underwriting syndicate. States that the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit an annual report to the Congress showing the extent to which the business of underwriting and dealing in State and local obligations is being carried on by commercial banks as compared with other banking institution with a view to determining the effect of the amendment made by the first section of this Act on the institutional distribution of such business.
