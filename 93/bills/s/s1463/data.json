    "text": "Parole Commission Act - Creates as an agency of the Department of Justice the United States Parole Commission, the members of which shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Provides that the President shall designate from among the Commissioners one to serve as Chairman, five to serve as National Parole Commissioners and such others as may be necessary to serve as Regional Parole Commissioners. Specifies the duties of the Chairman of the Commission. Provides that the national Parole Commissioners, by majority vote, shall: (1) have authority to accept, reject, or modify any decision of any Regional Parole Commissioner; (2) give reasons in detail for their decisions in any appropriate case, including the review of any decision of any region; (3) transfer to themselves the authority to grant, modify, or revoke an order paroling any eligible person when the national well-being so requires; and (4) perform other functions specified in this Act. Authorizes a Regional Commissioner to carry out specified duties, including: (1) to grant or deny any application or recommendation to parole or re-parole any eligible person, (2) to specify reasonable conditions of any order granting parole; and (3) to re-parole any person whose parole has been revoked and who is not otherwise ineligible for parole. Makes a person eligible for parole after serving one-third of his term or terms or after serving fifteen years of a life sentence or of a sentence of more than forty-five years. Provides that once a person is eligible for parole he must be given a parole appearance and at least one additional parole appearance every two years. Authorizes the Commission to release such a person if it appears from a report and recommendation by proper institution officers that such person has observed the rules of the institution, that there is a reasonable probability that such person will live and remain at liberty without violating the law and if in the opinion of the Commission such release is not incompatible with the welfare of society. Sets forth the procedures for an appearance of a person before the Parole authority. Provides that a warrant for the retaking of any person who is alleged to have violated his parole may be issued by any Commissioner within the maximum term or terms for which such prisoner was sentenced. States that such person shall be given a hearing before a United States magistrate as soon as possible subsequent to his being retaken pursuant to such a warrant. Provides that counsel may be appointed if the alleged violator is unable to retain counsel. Authorizes the magistrate to release the parolee on bail until a determination has been made as to whether or not his parole will be revoked. Provides that, upon entering a judgement of conviction, the court having jurisdiction to impose sentence, when in its opinion the ends of justice and best interests of the public require that the defendant be sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, may: (1) designate in the sentence of imprisonment imposed a minimum term at the expiration of which the person shall become eligible for parole, which term may be less than but shall not be more than one-third of the maximum sentence imposed by the court, or (2) fix the maximum sentence of imprisonment to be served in which event the court may specify that the person may become eligible for parole at such time as the Commission may determine. Requires the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, upon the commitment of any person sentenced to imprisonment under any law of the United States for a definite term or terms of over one hundred and eighty days, and under such regulations as the Attorney General may prescribe, to cause a complete study to be made of the person and to furnish to the Commission a summary report, together with any recommendations which in the Director's opinion would he helpful in determining the suitability of the prisoner for parole. Creates an Advisory Corrections Council and specifies the members of such Council. Provides that the Council shall consider problems of treatment and corrections of all offenders against the United States and shall make such recommendations to the Congress, the President, the Judicial Conference of the United States and other appropriate officials as may improve the administration of criminal justice and assure the coordination and integration of policies of the Federal agencies, private industry, labor and local jurisdictions respecting the disposition, treatment and correction of all persons convicted of crime. Provides that the Commission may grant or deny any application or recommendation for parole, modify, or revoke any order of parole of any person sentenced pursuant to the Federal Youth Corrections Act. Authorizes the Attorney General to designate one Commissioner to serve as Youth Corrections Comissioner. States that it shall be the responsibility of such Commissioner to oversee the policies pertaining to offenders sentenced under such Act, and to serve as vice chairman of the Commission. Re-enacts applicable sections of the Federal Youth Corrections Act to make the language conform to the changes made by this Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the purposes of this Act."
