Provides that whenever the President determines that, as a result of any such employment loss, low-income households are unable to purchase adequate amounts of nutritious food, he is authorized to distribute through the Secretary of Agriculture coupon allotments pursuant to the Food Stamp Act and to make surplus commodities available. Directs the Secretary of Labor to provide reemployment assistance services under other laws of the United States to any such individual so unemployed. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section."
