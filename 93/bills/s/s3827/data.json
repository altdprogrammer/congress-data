Provides that it shall be unlawful for any employer or any person acting as an agent for such an employer, or any person who for a fee refers an alien for employment by such an employer, to employ, continue to employ, or refer for employment any alien in the United States who has not been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, unless the employment of such alien is authorized by the Attorney General. Requires any officer or employee of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to disclose to the Immigration Service the name and most recent address of any alien who such officer or employee knows is not lawfully in the United States and who is receiving assistance under provisions of the Social Security Act."
