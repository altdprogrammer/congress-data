    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Coal Pipeline Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior or appropriate agency heads to grant rights-of-way through Federal lands for construction of coal pipelines. Provides that no common carrier of coal by pipeline shall by exercise of the power of eminent domain granted under this Act extend an existing pipeline, construct a new pipeline, or engage in transportation of coal by means of an additional or extended pipeline until obtaining from the Interstate Commerce Commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity for such activity. Provides that in order to abandon any such activity after a certificate of public convenience and necessity has been granted, a certificate must be obtained from the ICC that the present or future public convenience and necessity permit such abandonment. Sets forth criteria for the granting of such certificates. Allows any common carrier of coal by pipeline which cannot acquire by negotiation the right-of-way required for pipelines for which the ICC has granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity, to acquire such right-of-way by exercise of the power of eminent domain in a District Court of the United States for the district in which such property is located. Requires any common carrier of coal by pipeline, upon application of any party tendering interstate traffic for transportation, to construct, maintain and operate upon reasonable terms a feeder line constructed to connect with its coal pipeline. Disallows a carrier that is granted the power of eminent domain from transporting coal mined by it or under its authority or which it may own in whole or in part. Prohibits the Commission from issuing certificates under this Act unless it has been advised by the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission that issuance would not adversely affect competition or restrain trade."
