Requires the President, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, the Department of Commerce, and any other person or organization, to conduct a comprehensive study of the causes of inflation, both short-term and long-term, and to report to the Congress no later than Janaury 1, 1975, the results of such study, together with his recommendations for legislation and any other appropriate action."
