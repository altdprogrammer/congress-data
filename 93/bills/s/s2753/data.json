Directs the Commission to undertake studies of the feasibility of establishing a transportation rate policy for all recovered materials based only on the type, size, and kind of transportation equipment used, the characteristics of movement, services, and facilities provided and the weight and/or volume of the shipment. Makes it unlawful for any railroad, common carrier by water, or motor carrier in interstate or foreign commerce to demand, charge, or collect any rate or charge for the transportation of recovered materials which are unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory when compared with the charge demanded for the transportation of virgin natural resources. Penalizes violations of this provision. Title III: Federal Procurement and Measurement - Provides that with respect to each purchase and contract for property, which exceeds $5,000, no procurement shall be made of any procurement item which is not composed of the greatest percentage, or to the maximum extent feasible, of recovered materials.

Directs the Administrator to conduct a sutdy of possible methods of regulating the design, use, reuse, and recycling of products to reduce the generation of solid waste, reduce the consumption of virgin materials resources, or to reduce burdens on the environment associated with the manufacture, utilization, or disposal of such products. Title V: Unsafe Disposal Practices - Directs the Administrator to issue regulations: (1) identifying unsafe disposal practices; (2) identifying hazardous wastes; and (3) establishing standards for the control of unsafe disposal practices. Requires that within 18 months after promulgation of final regulations, each State shall establish an implementation plan to regulate disposal practices and submit such plan to the Administrator for approval. Provides for Federal enforcement of violations of requirements and standards under this title. Provides for inspections by the Environmental Protection Agency or State or political subdivision, of the records of any person who stores, treats, transports, disposes of, or otherwise handles hazardous wastes. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to appropriate States, agencies and local governments, not to exceed 60 percent, to assist them in the administration, enforcement, training, public information, or analytical services relating to: collection, and disposal of hazardous waste, control of disposal practices and recovery of energy resources. Directs the Administrator to conduct studies relating to enumerated areas of waste management. Title VI: Energy Recovery - Directs the Administrator, alone or in conjunction with the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to conduct research, into the means of increasing the recovery of energy in usable forms. Authorizes the Administrator to make loans and guarantee loans under this title. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Administrator an amount not to exceed $50,000,000 to pay interest on, and the principal balance of, any obligation guaranteed by the Administrator as to which the obligor has defaulted.

Title VII: National Commission On Environmental Costs - Establishes a National Commission on Environmental Costs. Enumerates the duties of the Commission, including to conduct studies on: (1) the feasibility, practicality, and value of the establishment of a system of national disposal cost charges on all products, other than consumables; (2) the means of reducing the wasteful use of materials in the production of goods; and (3) the means of mitigating damage done by sources of pollution and internalizing the costs of such pollution. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Commission such sums as may be necessary not to exceed $1,500,000.
