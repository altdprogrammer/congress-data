Provides that whenever the Secretary of Labor makes a determination that the rate of national unemployment (seasonally adjusted) has exceeded 5 percent for three consecutive months, he shall within ten days of such determination, notify the Congress and shall publish such determination in the Federal Register. States that at such time the Secretary shall recommend to the Congress any further steps including recommendations for legislation, if any, he deems appropriate. Provides that an application for assistance under such Act shall include a provision setting forth assurances that all persons employed under any such program, other than necessary technical, supervisory, and administrative personnel, will be selected from among unemployed and underemployed persons who are from economically disadvantaged backgrounds or have been unemployed for not less than fifteen weeks immediately prior to employment under such program. Provides that sponsors of public service job programs shall make commitments to assure that by the end of fiscal year 1974 not less than 50 percent of all public service jobs supported under the Act will be filled by veterans who are either disabled or veterans of the Vietnam era."
