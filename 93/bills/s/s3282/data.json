    "text": "Export Administration Amendments - Makes it the policy of the United States to use export controls to the extent appropriate to retaliate against a nation or group of nations which have unreasonably restricted United States access to their supply of a particular commodity. Makes it the policy of the United States to deal with world shortages of particular commodities, whenever feasible, through international cooperation with the major suppliers and consumers of such commodities. Allows the President, in curtailing the exportation of any article, to use whatever method of regulation he deems most appropriate, including, but not limited to, the imposition of an export fee or the auction of export licenses. Provides that any person who enters into a contract, or other written understanding, which contemplates or is likely to result in the exportation, by a United States person or one of its affiliates to a communist country or area, of United States origin technical data which is not generally available, shall report the details of the transaction to the Secretary of Commerce and provide him with copies of documents pertaining to such transaction within 15 days from entering into such contract, protocol, agreement, or other written understanding. Extends the termination date on export regulations from June 30, 1974 to June 30, 1977."
