    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Safe Drinking Water Act - Defines the terms used in this Act. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to publish proposed national interim primary drinking water regulations within 90 days after the date of this Act's enactment. Makes provisions for national drinking water regulations including the determination of maximum contaminant levels. Declares that for purposes of this Act a State has primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems during any period the State meets the criteria set forth in this Act as determined by the Administrator. Provides for civil actions to require compliance by any State failing to assure enforcement of drinking water regulations. Allows a State to grant variances from an applicable national primary drinking water regulation to one or more public water systems within its jurisdiction. Permits a State which has primary enforcement responsibility to exempt any public water system within the State's jurisdiction from any requirement respecting a maximum contaminant level or any treatment technique requirement, or of an applicable national primary drinking water regulation upon a finding that: (1) due to compelling factors (which may include economic factors) the public water system is unable to comply with such contaminant level or treatment technique requirement, (2) the public water system was in operation on the effective date of such regulation, and (3) the granting of the exemption will not result in an unreasonable risk to health. Provides for the protection of underground sources of drinking water through underground injection control programs. Provides civil penalties for violation of an applicable underground injection control program. Authorizes the Administrator to take emergency measures to protect public health upon receipt of information that a dangerous contaminant is present in or is likely to enter a public water system. Requires that the Administrator confer with State and local authorities before exercising this emergency power, to the extent he determines it to be practical. Sets forth provisions on the availabiltiy of adequate supplies of chemicals necessary for the treatment of water. Authorizes the Administrator to conduct research and programs to control diseases resulting from contaminants in water, including improved methods to identify and measure contaminants, and improved methods of water treatment, purification, and distribution. Authorizes grants for projects designed to train personnel for occupations involving the public health aspects of providing safe drinking water. Authorizes appropriations of $15,000,000, $25,000,000, and $35,000,000 for fiscal years 1975 - 1977 for carrying out such research. Requires the Administrator to conduct a comprehensive study of public water supplies and drinking water sources and to report to Congress within six months. Authorizes appropriations for grants to States to carry out the drinking water programs established under this Act. Makes provisions for State plans and applications for assistance. Allows the Administrator to make special study and demonstration project grants. Directs the Administrator to carry out a program of guaranteeing loans made by private lenders to small public water systems for the purpose of enabling such systems to meet primary drinking water regulations. Establishes a National Drinking Water Advisory Council of 15 members to advise the Administrator on matters relating to this Act. Makes provisions for judicial review, including a citizen's civil action on his behalf. Authorizes the Administrator to prescribe such regulations as are necessary to carry out his functions under this Act. Directs the Administrator to enter into arrangements with public or private entities to conduct a survey of the quantity, quality and availability of rural drinking water supplies. Provides for bottled drinking water standards under this Act."
