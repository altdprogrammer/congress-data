    "text": "Provides that a Federal Prosecutor or duly authorized officer of a Federal court who undertakes an investigation into violations of law, during or after the Presidential campaign of 1972, shall notify the Chief Justice of the United States who shall appoint a committee to supervise the activities of such officer or members of his staff. Directs that the committee shall consist of three United States circuit judges who served as Chief Judges of the United States Court of Appeals but have since retired from active service, who shall serve until termination of the investigation or until reaching the age of seventy-five. Requires that members of the committee shall retain their offices as, but not exercise judicial functions as, circuit judges and shall not receive any other compensation. Requires the officer in charge of the investigation to report regularly to the committee and to take no action in his investigation or to obtain evidence without committee approval. Provides that the decision of the majority of the members of the committee shall be final. States that should the Prosecutor or other officer of a Federal court take action in disregard of the committee's decision, the committee shall so report to the President."
