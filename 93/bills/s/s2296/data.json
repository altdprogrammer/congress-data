Stipulates that the Assessment shall include but not be limited to: (1) an analysis of present and anticipated uses, demand for, and supply of the forest and related resources, with consideration of the international forest resource situation, and an analysis of pertinent supply and demand and price relationship trends; (2) an inventory, based on information available to the Forest Service and other Federal agencies, of present and potential forest and related resources, and an evaluation of opportunities for improving their yield of tangible and intangible goods and services, together with estimates of investment costs and direct and indirect returns to the Federal Government; (3) a description of Forest Service programs and responsibilities in research, cooperative programs, and management of the National Forest System, their interrelationships, and the relationship of these programs and responsibilities to public and private activities; and (4) a discussion of important policy considerations, laws, regulations, and other factors expected to significantly influence and affect the use, ownership, and management of forest and related resource lands. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to prepare and transmit to the President a recommended Renewable Resource Program displaying alternative objectives and associated programs which shall provide in appropriate detail for protection, management, and development of the National Forest System, including forest development roads and trails; and for forest and related resources research. States that the Program shall include, but not be limited to: (1) an inventory of specific needs and opportunities for both public and private program investments; (2) specific identification of program outputs, results anticipated, and benefits associated with investments in such a manner that the anticipated costs can be directly compared with the total related benefits and direct and indirect returns to the Federal Government; and (3) a discussion of priorities for accomplishment of inventoried program opportunities, with specified costs, outputs, results, and benefits. Provides that, in carrying out this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall utilize information and data available from other Federal, State, and private organization and shall avoid duplication and overlap of resource assessment and program planning efforts of other Federal agencies."
