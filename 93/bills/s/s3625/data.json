    "text": "National Oil Recycling Act - Directs all Federal officials to act within their authority to encourage the use of recycled oil. States that this Act shall in no way preempt State regulation of recycled oil or used oil disposal whenever such regulation provides for stricter control of recycled oil or used oil than provided for by Federal law. States that the States should encourage the use of recycled oil in order to accomplish the purposes of this Act. Requires that in order to qualify for Federal grants under this Act, a State shall adopt laws, regulations, and administrative machinery which shall provide for, but not be limited to: (1) requiring that used oil collectors obtain a State permit prior to engaging in used oil collecting activities; (2) requiring that used oil recyclers obtain a State permit prior to engaging in recycling operations; (3) when recycled oil is available at prices competitive with new oil produced for the same purpose, using recycled oil for all automotive and industrial uses of the State government, and requiring all parties contracting with the State to use recycled oil in the performance of such contracts; (4) regulating the retail sales of automobile oil so as to encourage the recycling of used oil; (5) prohibiting the use of used oil as fuel oil or for the oiling of State roads, unless such oil has been processed to meet the minimum standards for such uses established by Federal and State pollution control laws; and (6) educating the public and private sectors of the State as to the merits of recycled oil, and the need for its use in order to reduce the drain on the Nation's oil reserves and minimize the disposal of used oil in ways harmful to the environment. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate regulations with respect to the labeling of recycled oil in order to carry out the purpose of this Act. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations requiring all containers of automotive and industrial oil, both new and recycled, to bear labels relating to the proper disposal of such oils after use. Makes it unlawful for any person to enter into any contract or agreement where the intent of such contract or agreement is to discourage the recycling of used oil. Provides for a fine of $50,000 for a violation of such prohibition, or imprisonment for a term of one year or less, or both. Requires records to be kept by parties covered by the provisions of this Act. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to make annual reports to the Congress. Sets forth the contents of such reports. Provides that whenever the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determines that: (1) in implementing the provisions of this Act, a United States patent right not otherwise available is necessary to enable any person to comply with this Act; (2) there are no reasonable alternative methods to accomplish this Act's purposes; and (3) the inavailability of such patent right may result in a substantial lessening of competition or a tendency to create a monopoly in any line of the Nation's commerce; the Administrator, through the Attorney General, may so certify to a district court of the United States, which may order the person owning the patent to license it on such reasonable terms as the court, after hearing, may determine. Provides that any person violating any provision of this Act which does not provide for specific penalties or punishment thereunder shall upon conviction thereof be guilty of a misdemeanor which shall be punishable by a term of six months in prison for each violation, or a fine of not to exceed $25,000, or both. Authorizes to be appropriated for fiscal year 1974, and for each succeeding fiscal year, $25,000,000 for grants to the States to assist them in fulfilling the purposes and provisions of this Act. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to make allotments to the States, not to exceed 10 cents per capita for any State based on the latest national census, when he has determined that they are in compliance with this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated for fiscal year 1974, and for each succeeding fiscal year through fiscal year 1977, $10,000,000 for the development of new processes and technology to be used in the economical and ecological recycling of used oil. Authorizes to be appropriated for fiscal year 1974, and for each succeeding fiscal year, through fiscal year 1977, $5,000,000 for the development of standards and testing methods to facilitate the comparison of recycled oil with new oil. Imposes a tax of 6 cents per gallon on specified oils other than recycled oils sold in the United States by the manufacturer or producer."
