Establishes a National Commission on the Olympic Games composed of nine public members who shall be appointed by the President. Sets forth the duties of the Commission. Requires a final report of the Commission's findings and recommendations to be submitted to the President and the Congress not later than December 31, 1974, or 180 days after all members of the Commission have been appointed whichever is later. Provides for the compensation of Commission members. Authorizes the appropriation of $750,000 to carry out the provisions of this Act. Provides that the Commission shall cease to exist 30 days after submission of its final report."
