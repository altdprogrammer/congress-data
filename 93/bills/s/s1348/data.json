Provides that in prescribing standards under this Act, the Secretary shall: (1) consider relevant available mobile home safety data: (2) consult with such State or interstate agencies (including legislative committees) as he deems appropriate; (3) consider whether any such proposed standard is reasonable, practicable, and appropriate for the particular type of mobile home for which it is prescribed; (4) consider whether any such standard will place an undue financial burden upon manufacturers and distributors of mobile homes; (5) consider whether any such standard will result in a substantial increase in the retail price of mobile homes; and (6) consider the extent to which any such standard will contribute to carrying out the purpose of this title. Directs the Secretary to issue initial Federal mobile home safety standards upon the expiration of a one hundred eighty-day period which begins on the date of enactment of this Act. Provides that the Secretary shall issue new and revised Federal mobile home safety standards under this title upon the expiration of the three hundred sixty-day period which begins on the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish a National Mobile Home Safety Advisory Council, a majority of which shall be representatives of the general public, including representatives of State and local governments, and the remainder shall include members of the American National Standards Institute Committee on Mobile Homes and Recreational Vehicles and representatives of mobile home manufacturers, dealers and insurers. Provides that the Secretary shall consult with the Advisory Council before establishing or revoking any mobile home safety standard pursuant to this title. Directs the Secretary to conduct research, testing, development and training necessary to carry out the purposes of this title. Provides that no person shall: (1) manufacture for sale, sell, offer for sale, or introduce or deliver for introduction in interstate commerce, or import into the United States, any mobile home manufactured on or after the date any applicable Federal mobile home safety standard takes effect under this title unless it is in conformity with such standard; (2) fail or refuse access to or copying of records, or fail to make reports or provide information, or fail or refuse to permit entry or inspection, as required under this Act; (3) fail to issue a certificate required by this Act, or issue a certificate to the effect that a mobile home conforms to all applicable Federal mobile home safety standards, if such person in the exercise of due care has reason to know that such certificate is false or misleading in a material respect; or (4) fail to furnish notification of any defect as required by this Act. Prescribes a civil penalty of not to exceed $1,000 for each violation of this title. Provides that each violation shall constitute a separate violation, and that the maximum civil penalty shall not exceed $400,000 for any related series of violations. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this title. Establishes the National Mobile Home Safety Bureau within the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Provides that the provisions of this title shall be carried out through such Bureau. Title II: Changes in Existing Law - Authorizes Federal participation under the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 in any loan made for the purchase of a mobile home which meets or exceeds the mobile home safety standards established under this Act. Provides for Federal participation in loans made to veterans purchasing mobile homes which meet such standards."
