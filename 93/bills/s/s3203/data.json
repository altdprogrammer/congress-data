Sets forth collective bargaining, notice, mediation, and agreement procedures to govern employees of a health care institution. Provides that if a labor dispute between a health care institution and its employees, in the judgement of the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, threatens to substantially interrupt the delivery of health care, the Director shall create a board to investigate and report respecting such labor dispute. Sets forth the criteria for board membership and the procedures to be followed in settlement of the dispute. Provides that an employee of a health care institution who is a member of and adheres to tenents or teachings of a bona fide religion, body, or sect which has historically held conscientious objections to joining or financially supporting labor organizations shall not be required to join or financially support any labor organization as a condition of employment. Provides for periodic payments by such employees to a nonreligious, charitable fund."
