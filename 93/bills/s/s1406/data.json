Authorizes the Secretary to suspend, when he deems it to be in the public interest, and for such periods as he deems necessary, the prohibition against his apportioning any Federal funds to a State that is not implementing a qualified program approved by him. Provides for the apportionment of such funds in accordance with this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to increase, to the extent necessary, the Federal share of the costs to an Indian tribe of implementing a qualified program. Authorizes the Secretary to perform any of the research and development activities authorized by the section through the giving of grants. Authorizes the Secretary where he deems it to be in furtherance of the purposes of chapter 4 of title 23, to vest in State or local governments, on such terms and conditions as he deems appropriate, title to equipment purchased for demonstration projects by such government with funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out purposes of this Act. Prohibits the admission into evidence of any portion of any statement or information relating to a highway crash that has been furnished by any individual to the Secretary relating such crash or investigation thereof pursuant to section 403, of title 23 or of any portion of any report of the Secretary relating such crash or investigation thereof pursuant to section 403, in any subsequent criminal, civil or administrative proceeding except administrative proceedings held by the National Transportation Safety Board and administrative proceedings held by the Department of Transportation under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.
