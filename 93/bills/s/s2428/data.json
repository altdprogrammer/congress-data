Requires that such investigations include tests: (1) of each automobile model subject to such tax equipped: (a) with each available engine size, (b) with each, and combinations of each, type of optional accessory which has a significant effect on fuel consumption economy; and (2) which shall be conducted under specified controlled conditions. Requires, under the Automobile Information Disclosure Act, that every label required to be affixed shall include, in the case of any automobile on which a tax was imposed by the Internal Revenue Code (relating to automobile fuel economy taxes): (1) the fuel consumption rate determined to be applicable for such automobile; and (2) the tax paid."
