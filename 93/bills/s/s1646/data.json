Requires that the U.S. Delegate to the U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs requests the recommendation of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare regarding scientific considerations involved in proceedings before the Commission. Authorizes and directs the Attorney General to regulate such controlled substances. Permits the Attorney General to withhold any controls he finds are not required by American obligations under the Convention. Requires him to transmit notice of such determination to the Secretary of State for transmittal to the Secretary General of the United Nations. Permits the Attorney General to require reports from manufacturers regarding non-narcotic-controlled substances which are psychotropic substances subject to the Convention. Requires the Attorney General to consult with the Secretary prior to: (1) issuing rules for dispensation, (2) establishing production quotas, and (3) restricting advertising of psychotropic substances. States that the provisions of the Convention shall not: (1) prohibit research with scheduled substances, (2) prevent the protection of patient records, or (3) prevent the confidentiality of names of research subjects."
