States that when a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work in which copyright subsists under this title is utilized in an original ornamental design of a useful article, by the copyright proprietor or under an express license from him, the design shall be eligible for protection under title III of this Act.

States that copyright in work protected under this title vests initially in the author or authors of the work. Provides that ownership of a copyright is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work is embodied. Prescribes the conditions for termination of transfers and licenses granted by the author and the effect of such termination. States that a transfer of copyright ownership is not valid unless an instrument of conveyance, or a memorandum of the transfer, is in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or his duly authorized agent. Provides for the recordation of transfers and other documents with the Copyright Office. Directs that on and after January 1, 1975, all rights in the nature of copyright shall be governed exclusively by this title. Retains specified common law rights in enumerated instances. Sets forth the periods for duration of copyrights for: (1) works created on or after January 1, 1975; (2) works created by not published or copyrighted before January 1, 1975; and (3) subsisting copyrights. Directs that whenever a protected work is published in the United States or elsewhere by authority of the copyright owner, a notice of copyright shall be placed on all publicly distributed copies from which the work can be visually perceived. Sets forth the form of such notice.

Details the effect of omission of such notices. Requires the deposit of copyrighted works at the Copyright Office for use of the Library of Congress. Outlines the procedures for registration of copyright claims, stating that registration is a prerequisite to specified remedies for infringement. Provides that anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner or who imports copies or phonorecords into the United States in violation of this Act is an infringer of the copyright. Enumerates the remedies for infringement, including: (1) injunctions; (2) impounding and disposition of infringing articles; (3) damages and profits; and (4) costs and attorney's fees. Imposes criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Provides that, with specified exceptions, the importation into or public distribution in the United States of copies of work consisting preponderantly of nondramatic literary material that is in the English language and is protected under this title is prohibited unless the portions consisting of such material have been manufactured in the United States on copies or phonorecords acquired abroad. Enumerates the general responsibilities and organization of the Copyright Office in the Library of Congress, including: (1) retention and distribution of articles; (2) preparation, maintenance, public inspection, and searching; and (3) forms publications and fees of the Copyright Office. Creates in the Library of Congress a Copyright Royalty Tribunal to: (1) make determinations concerning the adjustment of the copyright royalty rates to assure that such rates continue to be reasonable; and (2) determine in specified circumstances the distribution of the royalty fees deposited with the Register of Copyrights.

Provides that protection under this title shall not be available for a design that is: (1) not original; (2) staple or commonplace (or an insignificant modification thereof), such as a standard geometric figure, familiar symbol, emblem, or motif, or other shape, pattern, or configuration which has become common, prevalent, or ordinary; (3) dictated solely by a utilitarian function of the article that embodies it; or (4) composed of three-dimensional features of shape and surface with respect to men's, women's, and children's apparel.
