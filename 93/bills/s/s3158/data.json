Provides that the Federal Credit Union Supervisory Committee shall make an annual audit and shall submit a report of that audit to the Board of Directors. States that any insured credit union other than a Federal Credit Union may, upon not less than ninety-days' written notice to the Administrator and upon the affirmative vote of a majority of its members within one year prior to the giving of such notice or upon obtaining a certificate of insurance from a corporation authorized and duly licensed to insure the accounts of such credit union, terminate its status as an insured credit union."
