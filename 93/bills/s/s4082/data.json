    "text": "Social Services Amendments - Authorizes necessary appropriations each fiscal year for payments to States for provision of social services directed toward the goal of: (1) achieving or maintaining economic self-support to prevent, reduce, or eliminate dependency; (2) preventing or remedying neglect, abuse, or exploitation of children and adults unable to protect their own interests, or preserving, rehabilitating, or reuniting families; (3) preventing or reducing inappropriate institutional care by providing for community-based care, home-based, or other forms of less intensive care, or; (4) securing referral or admission for institutional care when other forms of care are not appropriate. Requires that 50 percent of such payments to States be for provision of services to individuals who are receiving (or are eligible to receive) aid under the Aid to Needy Families with Children, Supplemental Security Income, and Medicaid programs of the Social Security Act. Prohibits payments to States for aid to individuals with incomes above specified levels. Requires that expenditure by States under this Act for child day care services be for day care services which meet the Federal interagency day care requirements as approved by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Office of Economic Opportunity. Prohibits, with specified exceptions, State expenditures under this Act for services to individuals living in hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities, prisons, or foster homes. Prohibits such expenditures for services to individuals eligible for Medicare aid. Requires that States participating in the programs established under this Act report annually on the results of specified evaluations and audits of their participation. Allows suspension of payments to States failing to meet requirements under this Act. Requires States to provide hearings for individuals whose claims to services under this Act are denied, to restrict disclosure of information obtained on individuals pursuant to this Act, and to refrain from imposing durational residency or citizenship requirements upon individuals as a condition to participation in programs under this Act. States that comprehensive plans must be published by States setting forth their programs under this Act which will be pursued in the ensuing year. Requires that such plan include descriptions of objectives, individuals and geographic areas to be served, descriptions of implementation procedures, estimated expenditures, and services to be rendered. Requires annual evaluations of the programs under this Act by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare."
