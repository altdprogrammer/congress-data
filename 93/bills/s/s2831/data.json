Provides for the maximum price the Secretary shall pay for the commodities and the net additional quantity procured under this Act. Prescribes the priorities by which the acquisition shall be made to increase the reserve of stocks or to rotate the stocks of any commodity. Specifies the circumstances under which the Secretary is also authorized to dispose of commodities in such reserve, including: (1) for use in relieving distress in any State, declared by the President to be an acute distress area because of unemployment or other economic cause, and in connection with any major disaster; (2) for use in connection with a state of civil defense emergency; (3) for use in the preservation and maintenance of foundation herds of cattle, sheep, and goats; and (4) for use by the President to meet famine or other urgent or extraordinary relief requirements in friendly foreign countries. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
