    "text": "Antitrust Settlement Act - Provides that before any court of the United States permits any proposed consent judgement or decree, or other settlement of any suit, action, or proceeding arising under the antitrust laws and brought by or on behalf of the United States, to become final it shall: (1) direct the United States to publicize the terms of the proposed settlement; and (2) withhold decision on whether to permit the proposed consent judgement or decree or other settlement to become final for at least sixty days to allow the public adequate time to comment thereon and the United States and the court adequate time to consider such comments. Requires the Attorney General or his designee to distribute to the court and to the defendant copies of any comment he has received and, if changes of public interest are made in such judgement, decree, or other settlement, a statement that he believes the proposed judgement, decree or other settlement to be consistent with the antitrust laws and to be in the best interests of the United States. Provides that the court shall order that a hearing be held on whether the proposed judgment, decree or other settlement should be allowed to become final unless it finds that there is no substantial controversy concerning the matter. Authorizes the court to award to any person the actual, necessary and responsible costs incurred in preparing and presenting comments pursuant to this Act whenever the court finds it is in the public interest to make such an award."
