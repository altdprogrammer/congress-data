    "text": "Civil Remedies for Victims of Racketeering Activity and Theft Act - Provides that any person may institute proceedings for civil relief in the district courts of the United States to prevent and restrain racketeering activities. Sets forth those unlawful activities the victims of which may seek relief under this Act. Provides that relief shall be granted in conformity with the principles which govern the granting of injunctive relief from threatened loss or damage in other cases. Provides that, upon the execution of proper bond against damages for an injunction improvidently granted and a showing of immediate danger of irreparable loss or damage, a preliminary injuction may be issued in any action before a determination thereof upon its merits. Authorizes the Attorney General, whenever the United States is injured, to recover actual damages plus the cost of the action and a person injured in his business to recover treble damages for violations of such activities. Provides that actions under such provisions shall be brough without regard to the amount in controversy. Provides that the Attorney General may upon timely application intervene in any civil action or proceeding brought under such Act, if the Attorney General certifies that in his opinion the case is of general public importance. Provides that a final judgment or decree rendered in favor of the United States in any criminal or civil action or proceeding under this chapter shall estop the defendant in any subsequent civil proceeding as to all matters respecting which said judgment or decree would be an estoppel as between the parties thereto. States that any civil action under this title shall be barred unless it is commenced within five years after the cause of action occurred."
