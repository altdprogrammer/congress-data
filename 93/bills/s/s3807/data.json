States that the amount to be paid with respect to an individual under this Act is an amount equal to the expenses paid by such individual to enable him to attend such institution during the academic period in which such institution ceases operations. Provides for additonal protection to losses not covered by such guarantees. Authorizes necessary appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
