Provides that amounts appropriated to a State for projects on routes or portions thereof for which approval has been withdrawn in accordance with this Act shall be transferred to and added to the amounts apportioned to such State under the Federal-aid urban system for the account of the urbanized area from which the withdrawal of the routes or portions thereof was made. (Amends 23 U.S.C. 103) Provides for emergency assistance for transportation system improvements in those air quality regions within a State which the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has certified necessary will fail to achieve, by July 1, 1975, levels of air quality. Makes ten percent of the funds appropriated for expenditure upon the Federal-aid systems available for such assistance."
