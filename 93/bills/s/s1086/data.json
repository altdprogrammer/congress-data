    "text": "Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, within eighteen months after the enactment of this Act, to: (1) identify hazardous wastes; (2) establish standards for treatment and disposal of such waste; and (3) establish guidelines for State programs for implementing such standards. Requires the guidelines to provide that: (1) with respect to disposal sites for hazardous wastes, the State program requires that any person obtain from the State a permit to operate such site; (2) such permits require compliance with the minimum standards of performance acceptable set by the guidelines; and (3) the State have such regulatory and other authorities as may be necessary to carry out the purpose of this Act. Directs the administrator to promulgate regulations establishing requirements for generators of hazardous waste in such a manner so as to: (1) maintain records indicating the quantities of hazardous waste generated and the disposition thereof; (2) package hazardous waste in such a manner so as to protect human health and other living organisms, and label such packaging so as to identify accurately such wastes; (3) treat or dispose of all hazardous waste at a hazardous waste disposal site or treatment facility for which a permit has been issued under this Act; (4) handle and store all hazardous waste in such a manner so as not to pose a threat to human health or other living organisms; and (5) submit reports to the Administrator, at such times as the Administrator deems necessary. Allows injunctive relief for noncompliance with standards and regulations. Establishes a maximum civil penalty of $25,000 per day for continued noncompliance. Authorizes the Administrator to conduct, encourage, cooperate with, and render financial and other assistance to appropriate public and private agencies, institutions, and individuals for research, development, investigations, and other activities concerning waste management. Permits any person to commence a civil action for injunctive relief on his own behalf. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Environmental Protection Agency such sums as may be necessary for the purposes and administration of this Act. Provides that a petition for review of action of the Administrator in promulgating of any regulation shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Provides that any person who will be adversely affected by a final order or other final determination may file a petition with the United States court of appeals for the circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business."
