Requires the Administrator and Deputy Administrator to be specially qualified by training and experience to manage a full range of energy research and development programs. Describes the functions of the Administrator as including: (1) exercising central responsibility for policy planning, coordination, support, and management of research and development programs respecting all energy sources; (2) undertaking research and development in the extraction, conversion, transmission, and utilization phases related to the development and use of energy from fossils, nuclear, solar, geothermal, and other energy sources; (3) participating in and supporting cooperative research and development projects which may involve contributions by public or private persons or agencies, of financial or other resources to the performance of the work; and (4) developing, collecting, distributing, and making available for distributing, scientific and technical information concerning the manufacture or development of energy and its efficient extraction, conversion, transmission, and utilization. Expresses the intent of Congress that no energy technology be given an unwarranted priority. Transfers to the Administrator all functions of the Atomic Energy Commission, the Chairman and members of the Commission, and the officers and components of the Commission, except as otherwise provided in this Act. Transfers to the Administrator such functions of the Secretary of the Interior, the Department of Interior, and officers and components of such department: (1) as relate to or are utilized by the Office of Coal Research; and (2) as relate to or are utilized in connection with fossil fuel energy research and development programs and related activities conducted by the Bureau of Mines. Transfers to the Administrator such functions of the National Science Foundations as relate to or are utilized in connection with: (1) solar heating and cooling development; and (2) geothermal power development. Provides for cooperation between the Energy Research and Development Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency in order to prevent duplication stemming from EPA's regulatory functions and ERDA's development and demonstration functions in the areas relating to development of alternative automotive power systems and of technologies for emission controls on stationary sources. Establishes a Cabinet-level Interagency Energy Resources Committee in the Executive Office of the President to assist the Council on Energy Policy to coordinate the operations of ERDA, the Federal Energy Administration, the Department of the Interior and other Federal agencies pending congressional enactment of a long-term reorganization measure involving the principal energy agencies. Establishes a permanent three-member Council on Energy Policy in the Executive Office of the President to establish a comprehensive national energy policy, to coordinate all Federal energy activities on a long-range basis, and to submit a comprehensive energy plan, including research and development activities. =Title II: Nuclear Safety and Licensing Commission= - Establishes an independent regulatory commission to be known as the Nuclear Safety and Licensing Commission, to be composed of five members appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Transfers to the Commission all the licensing and related regulatory functions of the Atomic Energy Commission, as well as: (1) the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, the Atomic Safety and licensing Board Panel, and the Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Panel; and (2) all personnel whose primary responsibility is research related to confirmatory assessment of the safety or reactors licensed under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended, and of this Act, with the exception of such personnel as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget determines are necessary to assist in reactor development research. Establishes in the Nuclear Safety and Licensing Commission an Office of Nuclear Safety Research under the direction of a Director of Nuclear Safety Research who shall be appointed by the Commission, who shall report directly to the Commission, and who shall serve at the pleasure of and be removable by the Commission. Establishes within the Commission a Bureau of Nuclear Materials Security. Sets forth the duties of the Director of Nuclear Materials Security, including the responsibility to: (1) recommend regulations relating to safeguarding against threats, thefts, and sabotage involving special nuclear materials, high-level radioactive wastes, and nuclear facilities resulting from all activities licensed under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; (2) enforce such regulations which are promulgated by the Commission; and (3) monitor, test, and recommend upgrading internal accounting systems for special nuclear materials licensed under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Requires the Commission to provide existing technical reports to any party to a licensing or rulemaking proceeding, including citizen intervenor groups, and to respond to good-faith requests for relevant new studies. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for officers and employees of licensed nuclear firms, or of firms supplying basic components to licensed firms or constructing licensed facilities, who fail to notify the Commission of noncompliance with regulations or of any potentially hazardous defect. Requires the Commission to file an annual report which includes the relative benefits, costs, and risks of commercial nuclear power based on an assessment of safety and safeguards questions. =Title III: Miscellaneous and Transitional Provisions= - Provides that, except as otherwise provided in this Act, whenever all of the functions or programs of an agency, or other body, or any component thereof, affected by this Act, have been transferred from that agency, or that body, or component, the agency, or other body, or component shall lapse. =Title IV: Sex Discrimination= - Provides that no person shall on the ground of sex be excluded from participation in, be denied a license under, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity carried on or receiving Federal assistance under any title of this Act. =Title V: Costs and Fees= - Requires the Nuclear Safety and Licensing Commission, upon request, to reimburse eligible parties for the cost of participation in any licensing related hearing or agency proceeding. =Title VI: Non-Nuclear Energy Research and Development= - Non-Nuclear Energy Research and Development Policy Act - States the purpose of this Act as the development within ten years of the option and the capability for the United States to become energy self-sufficient through the use of domestic energy resources by socially and environmentally acceptable means. Requires the Administrator to perform certain duties consistent with the purpose of this Act, including formulating a comprehensive energy research and development strategy for the Federal Government. Sets forth research priorities to accomplish the purpose of this Act. Authorizes Federal assistance and participation in research and development including: (1) joint Federal-industry corporations; (2) contractual arrangements with non-Federal participants; (3) contracts for the contruction and operation of federally owned facilities; (4) Federal purchases or guaranteed price of the products of demonstration plants or activities; and (5) Federal loans to non-Federal entities conducting demonstration of new technologies.
