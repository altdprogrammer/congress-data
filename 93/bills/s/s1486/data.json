    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Omnibus Export Expansion Act - Expresses the findings of Congress. Declares the purposes of this Act with regard to the assistance and stimulation of export expansion. Defines the terms used in this Act. Empowers the Secretary of Commerce to make a grant or loan or provide technical assistance to a sponsoring government for up to 50 percent of any project which is likely to result in an increase in American exports and which is endorsed and supported by such government. Prescribes the factors to be taken into consideration in determining whether to make such a loan or grant, including: (1) the sales potential of such project; (2) the qualifications and capability of the exporters who would benefit from such assistance; and (3) the availability of assistance. Sets forth the record and audit requirements to be followed by each sponsoring government. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) establish educational and training programs to increase the expertise and interest of American citizens and business in the export trade and to facilitate the efforts of small, new, or potential American exporters; (2) contract with American or foreign universities or private individuals or firms to operate and assist in conducting such export training programs; and (3) charge each participant in an export training program a fee for one-half of the total cost of such program. Directs the Secretary, in cooperation with other Federal agencies, to design rules, regulations and requirements for reporting, conduct of programs, recordkeeping, furnishing and compilation of data, inspection of documents, application requirements, and the like in such a manner as to reduce the cost of and expedite the administration, reporting, recordkeeping, and trade documentation and procedures required under this Act. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to encourage and develop adoption of simplified and standardized international trade documentation and procedural requirements. States that the Secretary of Transportation shall implement specified actions if, after consultation and review, he determines that they are likely to further the policy of this Act, including: (1) acceleration of business and Government programs to adopt simplified standardized trade and transporation documentation and procedures; (2) encouragement of international agreements on the acceptance of common invoice forms, including the elimination of unnecessary language translation of documentation; and (3) simplification of documentation and identification through the use of standard control numbers. Establishes in the Department of Commerce an agency to be known as the Federal Export Agency, to be administered by a Director appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Details the duties of the Agency, including to: (1) foster the development of United States export associations or joint export projects composed of businesses which have not actively engaged in substantial export sales operations, or which, in the opinion of the Director, may have potential for further exports; (2) identify small businesses which possess undeveloped export potential and which are interested in joining with other small businesses in United States export associations or in joint export projects in order to develop a joint export operation; and (3) establish and conduct programs for the development of technical, professional, and managerial skills necessary to the establishment and operation of United States export associations and groups. Requires the filing of an annual report by the Agency. Specifies the content of such report. Enumerates the administrative powers of the Agency. States that, upon application in writing by a small business, the Agency shall certify such business as eligible to participate in a United States export association, if specified criteria are met, including that its average annual sales during the five calendar years preceding the year in which such application is made were less than $30,000,000. Outlines the procedures for formation of United States export associations by three or more eligible businesses. Provides that a United States export association shall be liable to the United States for repayment of the full principal, interest, and any penalty due on any loan received from the Agency. Establishes within the Department of Commerce and in its field offices an international trade specialist program. Requires the Secretary to recruit, train, and assign such personnel to the program as may be necessary to implement the purposes of this Act. Provides that the function of the specialists will be to augment existing field office staffs. Provides that international trade specialists will be engaged exclusively in the promotion of export expansion activities through the export expansion programs administered by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to establish and implement a procedure within the Bureau of the Census of the Department of Commerce to insure adequate measurement of the progress of the export expansion programs carried out by the Secretary. Sets forth specific procedures for such measurement. Authorizes the Agency: (1) to make technical assistance grants and loans to United States export associations; and (2) to enter into a cost-sharing contract with any export group or persons comprising such group to further the purposes of this Act and to foster, promote, and develop the export trade of the United States. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1974 to 1976 for the purposes of carrying out this Act."
