    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Provides that a person shall be subjected to the penalty of death for any offense prohibited by the laws of the United States only if a hearing is held in accordance with this Act. States that when a defendant is found guilty of or pleads guilty to an offense for which one of the sentences provided is death, the judge who presided at the trial or before whom the guilty plea was entered shall conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine the existence or nonexistence of the factors set forth in this Act for the purpose of determining the sentence to be imposed. Provides that the hearing shall not be held if the government stipulates that none of the aggravating factors set forth in the Act exists or that one or more of the mitigating factors set forth in the Act exists. Provides that in the sentencing hearing the court shall disclose to the defendant or his counsel all material contained in any presentence report, if one has been prepared, except such material as the court determines is required to be withheld for the protection of human life or for the protection of the national security. Sets forth rules of evidence to be used in such hearing. States that the jury or, if there is no jury, the court shall return a special verdict setting forth its findings as to the existence or nonexistence of each of the factors set forth in this Act. Provides that the jury or, if there is no jury, the court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that one or more of the aggravating factors set forth in the Act exists, the court shall sentence the defendant to death. States that if the jury or, if there is no jury, the court finds by a preponderance of the information that one or more of the mitigating factors exists, the court shall not sentence the defendant to death but shall impose any other sentence provided for the offense for which the defendant was convicted. States that the court shall not impose the sentence of death on the defendant if the jury or, if there is no jury, the court finds by a special verdict as provided in the Act that at the time of the offense there existed one of the specified mitigating factors. Lists the mitigating factors which the courts are to recognize. Sets forth specified crimes and circumstances which shall be considered aggravating factors for the purposes of this Act. Makes conforming technical amendments."
