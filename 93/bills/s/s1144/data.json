Requires the Secretary to submit an annual report of his activities under this Act to the President for transmission to the Congress.

Provides that each property insurance policy now in effect shall be endorsed to extend coverage to catastrophic disasters as specified by the Secretary. Provides that the States and municipalities are to be consulted by the Administrator regarding the particular kinds of disasters to be covered under the act; the nature of and limits of loss or damage to be covered; zoning and other land use provisions; and other similar matters.
