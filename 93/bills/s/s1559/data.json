    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Comprehensive Employment and Training Act - Authorizes necessary appropriations to carry out this Act for fiscal years 1974-1977, of which amounts $250,000,000 in fiscal 1974 and $350,000 in fiscal 1975 shall be for carrying out public employment programs under Title II. Limits to 20 percent the amount of appropriations to be used for Title III and IV. Authorizes to be appropriated and made available for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1974, and June 30, 1975, such sums as may be necessary to carry out public service employment programs under Title II. Authorizes to be appropriated and made available for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976, and for the succeeding fiscal year such sums as may be necessary to carry out public service employment programs under Title II. =Title I: Comprehensive Manpower Services= - States that the purpose of this title is to establish a comprehensive manpower services program, which shall include development and creation of job opportunities and training, education, and other services individuals need to secure and retain employment. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to make financial assistance available to prime sponsors so that they can carry out a comprehensive manpower program. Defines prime sponsors as States and units of local government and a limited number of existing concentrated employment program grantees serving rural areas with high unemployment. Requires States seeking assistance to submit comprehensive manpower plans before receiving such assistance. Prescribes how funds authorized for Title I shall be allocated. Requires prime sponsors to establish planning councils consisting of representatives of the community, who shall monitor the programs of prime sponsors. Directs that such manpower plans shall provide assurances that institutional training programs be designed for occupations in which shortages exist. Requires State manpower plans to provide for serving all areas under its jurisdiction and to provide for the cooperation of all appropriate State agencies. States that specified funds may be used for assistance for special programs and services for rural areas outside major labor markets, and may be used to provide prime sponsors with information and technical assistance. Requires States seeking to be prime sponsors to establish Manpower Services Councils to be composed of representatives of units of local governments which have comprehensive manpower plans and representatives from local government, the State vocational education agency, the public employment service, labor, business, and the general public. Requires the Councils to monitor the programs of prime sponsors. States that whenever the Secretary of Labor determines, after notice and opportunity for a public hearing, that any prime sponsor designated to serve under this Act is maintaining a pattern or practice of discrimination or otherwise failing to serve equitably the economically disadvantaged, unemployed, or underemployed persons in the area it serves, is incurring unreasonable administrative costs in the conduct of activities and programs or is otherwise materially failing to carry out the purposes and provisions of this Act, the Secretary shall revoke the prime sponsor's plan for the area, in whole or in part, and to the extent necessary and appropriate shall not make further payments to such prime sponsor. Allows judicial review of the Secretary's decisions regarding acceptability of comprehensive manpower plans. States that weekly allowances for persons receiving services under this title shall be at rates prescribed by the Secretary which shall, together with the trainee's wages or unemployment compensation, at least equal the minimum wage for a 40-hour week. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to State vocational education boards to assist them in providing their services. =Title II: Public Employment Programs= - Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to make financial assistance available in areas of substantial unemployment to provide transitional employment in needed public service jobs and training and manpower services related to such employment enabling persons to move into other employment or training. Defines eligible applicants for such assistance as prime sponsors and Indian tribes on reservations which include substantial unemployment. Defines areas of substantial unemployment as those with a 6.5 percent unemployment rate. Requires public service employment programs assisted under this title to be designed with a view toward: (1) developing new careers; (2) providing opportunities for career advancement; (3) providing opportunities for continued training, including on-the-job training; or (4) providing transitional public service employment which will enable the individuals so employed to move into public or private employment or training not supported under this Act. Requires applications for such assistance to, among other things: (1) assure special consideration to filling jobs providing for advancement and continuous employment by providing training and manpower services; (2) assure special consideration to post-1954 Korea and Vietnam veterans; (3) describe how participants will be selected; (4) describe jobs to be filled and salaries; (5) assure that the program employs only unemployed persons; and (6) assure that jobs funded under this title are in addition to those that would otherwise be funded. Directs the Secretary, where an Indian Tribe is unable to submit such an application, to assist in its preparation and submission and in implementation of the program. Prohibits financial assistance if a program does not result in an increase in employment opportunities; does not pay usual fringe benefits; does not contribute to occupational development or upward mobility of participants; does not provide for reports enabling evaluation of the comparative effectiveness programs; and does not discriminate because of race, creed, color, national origin, sex, political affiliation, or beliefs. Requires the Secretary to annually report in detail to the Congress on the effectiveness of this title. =Title III: Special Federal Responsibilities= - Authorizes the Secretary to use funds under this title to provide additional manpower services to segments of the population in particular need, including youth, inmates, persons of limited English-speaking ability and older workers. States that the Secretary shall, wherever possible, utilize Indian tribes, bands or groups having a governing body, for the provision of manpower services under this title. Directs the Secretary to establish a nationally administered comprehensive manpower services program for Indians. Alaska natives, and migrant and seasonal workers. Authorizes comprehensive work and training programs for low-income, high-unemployment urban areas and rural areas with high out-migration to cities. Describes special programs that may be established for youth who are low-income, unemployed, and undertrained, and for middle-aged and older men and women. Directs the Secretary to develop a comprehensive system of labor market information, which shall be made public in a timely fashion. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a computerized job bank program. Requires the Secretary to continuously evaluate programs under this Act and compare their effectiveness. Requires the Secretary to develop guidelines to do away with artificial barriers to employment and advancement. =Title IV: Job Corps= - Establishes a Job Corps within the Department of Labor for low-income disadvantaged young men and women. Sets forth standards and procedures for selecting individuals as enrollees in the Job Corps and authorizes the establishment of residential and nonresidential centers in which enrollees will participate in intensive programs of education, vocational training, work experience, counseling and other activities. Requires that an appropriate number of Job Corps candidates be selected from rural areas. Sets a two-year limitation on Job Corps service. Prescribes an oath for Job Corps enrollees. Provides for the establishment of Job Corps Centers to provide enrollees with education, training, work experience and counseling. Requires such centers to include Civilian Conservation Centers to provide resource and recreation management. Prescribes the content of education programs for such centers. States that the Secretary may provide enrollees with such personal, travel and leave allowances, and such quarters, subsistence, transportation, equipment, clothing, recreational services, and other expenses as he may deem necessary or appropriate to their needs. Sets such allowance at $35 per month for the first six months and thereafter at $50 per month. Provides for the establishment of community advisory councils for Job Corps centers to foster center-community cooperation. Requires counseling and testing of enrollees for job placement or further education upon termination of service. Requires systematic evaluation of the Job Corps program. Provides for the establishment of model vocational education schools and skill centers in urban areas of high dropout rates. Calls for the Secretary to take necessary action to facilitate the effective participation of States in the Job Corps program. Requires the Secretary to take action to assure a 50 percent ratio of women in Job Corps training programs. Limits spending per enrollee to $6,900 per year. =Title V: National Commission for Manpower Policy= - Establishes a National Commission for Manpower Policy to: (1) formulate recommendations for a coherent national manpower policy; and (2) examine and evaluate the effectiveness of any federally-assisted education, training, or existing manpower and related legislation. Provides that the Institute shall annually issue a report to the President and the Congress of its proceedings, findings, and recommendations. Requires a study of the impact of energy shortages upon manpower needs. =Title IV: General Provisions= - Prohibits financial assistance under any program of this Act unless such assistance agreement prohibits employment discrimination, unless participants are protected by appropriate health and safety standards, unless the program contributes to occupational development or upward mobility, and unless the program makes appropriate provision for youth. Allows States to enter into agreements to facilitate compliance with this Act. Establishes penalties for embezzlement, theft, and misapplication of funds authorized by this Act. Provides that no person in the United States shall on the ground of race, color, national origin, or sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available under this Act."
