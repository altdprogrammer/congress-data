Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to establish by order appropriate Federal mobile home safety standards. Provides that in prescribing standards under this Act, the Secretary shall: (1) consider relevant available mobile home safety data; (2) consult with such State or interstate agencies (including legislative committees); (3) consider whether any such proposed standard is reasonable for the particular type of mobile home for which it is prescribed; (4) considered whether any such standard increases the cost of the mobile home substantially beyond the value of expected benefits to the public; and (5) consider the extent to which any such standard will contribute to carrying out the purpose of this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish a National Mobile Home Advisory Council. Specifies the composition of such Council and their rates of compensation.

States that whenever any manufacturer is opposed to action taken by the Secretary, such manufacturer shall submit cost information for evaluation by the Secretary.

Authorizes the Secretary to advise and assist Federal agencies, State agencies, and other interested public and private agencies in the planning and development of mobile home safety standards.

Prescribes a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each violation of this Act. Provides that each violation shall constitute a separate violation, and that the maximum civil penalty shall not exceed $1,000,000 for any related series of violations. Provides that if the Secretary or a court determines that any mobile home does not conform to Federal standards, the manufacturer shall (1) repurchase the mobile home or (2) furnish the equipment, at his own expense, to bring the mobile home into conformance with such standards. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct inspections necessary to enforce the standards promulgated under this Act. Enumerates addtional authorizations empowered to the Secretary. Requires each manufacturer of mobile homes to submit the building plans of every model to the Secretary for technical evaluation and approval.
