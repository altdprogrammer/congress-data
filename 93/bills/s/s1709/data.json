    "text": "Provides that no action may be taken by the Department of Defense which: (1) results in the permanent reduction in the number of direct hire civilians of the United States employed at any military installation in the United States unless, prior to the date on which such termination is to become effective, there is a comparable reduction in force of foreign nationals employed by the United States at military installations overseas; or (2) results in the closing of any military installation in the United States, while there exists an equivalent United States overseas which performs a like function and that function can be performed at either the domestic or foreign installation. States that the prohibitions contained in this Act shall not apply in any case in which the Secretary of Defense makes a finding that a reduction in the civilian personnel overseas or the transfer of an activity from an overseas installation would seriously and adversely affect the defense posture or the economy of the United States and promptly reports such finding(s) in writing to the Congress."
