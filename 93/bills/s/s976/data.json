Requires the Secretary to establish simplified requirements for small business concerns designed to eliminate unnecessary and duplicative recordkeeping and reporting. Provides that small business concerns shall be given upon request one onsite inspection and no citation shall be issued or penalty assessed against a small business for violation of any standards based on such inspection. Requires the Secretary to make an annual report to the Select Committee on Small Business of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the steps taken to assure that small business concerns are not unintentionally injured economically as a result of standards imposed under such Act."
