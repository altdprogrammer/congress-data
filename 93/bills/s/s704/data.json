Provides that any communication to Congress respecting legislation, made by any of these regulatory commissions shall not be submitted to, or subject to change by the President, the Office of Management and Budget, or any other authority. States that none of the independent regulatory commissions (as defined in this Act) shall be required to submit legislative recommendations to any Federal Government employee or agency prior to submission of such to the Congress. States that such regulatory commissions shall not require clearance or approval by the Office of Management and Budget to collect information. Authorizes each regulatory commission, in any civil action, to act in its own name and through its own attorneys, who shall have the power to supervise or conduct litigation in which the agency is a party."
