    "text": "Truth in Advertising Act - Declares it to be the purpose of this Act to protect consumers by ensuring that no advertisement can be disseminated if substantiating documentation is not available to the public and by ensuring that individuals will be able to exercise their right to know and to act to promote fairness in advertising. Defines the terms \"advertisement,\" \"documentation,\" and \"principal office.\" Makes it unlawful for any person to disseminate through the United States mail or in commerce by the use of such media - as radio, television, cinema, newspapers, magazines, billboards, posters, and display material, any advertisement concerning the safety, performance, efficacy, characteristics or comparative price of any product or service unless documentation is available at the principal office of such person for public inspection. Requires the disseminator to furnish copies of such documentation to any requester by mail, telephone, or otherwise, with the actual cost of duplication being charged to the requester. Makes the publisher, broadcast station, agency, or medium for the dissemination liable by reason of such advertising if he refuses, upon request, to furnish the name and address of the person who causes him to disseminate such advertisement. Makes the dissemination, or the causing to be disseminated, of any advertisement in violation of the provisions of this Act an unfair or deceptive act or practice in commerce within the meaning of of Federal Trade Commission Act. Directs that the Act will be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, which may exercise the same powers that it exercises under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Empowers the Commission to prescribe all necessary substantive and procedural rules."
