Provides for matching fund grants to associated community health councils for the development, utilization, organization, and financing of health care services in rural areas. Authorizes to be appropriated to carry out such purposes $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1975, and each of the next two succeeding fiscal years. Defines the term \"associated community health councils\" as two or more political subdivisions which have voluntarily joined together for the purpose of providing health care to individuals residing in their jurisdictions by contracting with direct providers of health care services for the provision of such services in rural areas. Prohibits the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from establishing higher fees for comparable services in urban areas than in rural areas within the same State."
