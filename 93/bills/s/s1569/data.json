Authorizes and directs the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out such a forestry incentive program. Empowers the Secretary to: (1) make payments and grants of aid, up to $2,500, to owners for carrying out the purposes of the program; (2) utilize the services of State and local committees under the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act; and (3) designate advisers to serve as ex officio members of such committees. Requires cooperating landowners to agree in writing to follow a ten-year forest management plan for their property. Authorizes approprations of $25,000,000 to carry out the provisions of this Act."
