Provides that no program may be established within a State if it is disapproved within 45 days of submission to the Governor. Authorizes enrollment of volunteers for periods up to two years. Grants the Director to enroll full-time volunteers for shorter periods. Estends the tax treatment of the volunteer's stipend presently available to Peace Corps Volunteers to full-time domestic volunteers under the Act. Exempts from income tax amounts received by volunteers or volunteer leaders as allowances other than amounts received as: (1) leave allowances, or (2) such portion of living allowances as the Director may determine is basic compensation. Provides that no compensation paid to individual volunteers in the Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) program for out-of-pocket expenses shall be considered income for any purposes whatsoever. Exempts payments to Foster Grandparents from any tax or charge for the purposes of unemployment, temporary disability, retirement or similar payment benefits. Provides that such payments are not subject to minimum wage laws. Only a small percentage of Foster Grandparents are not currently eligible for social security benefits.
