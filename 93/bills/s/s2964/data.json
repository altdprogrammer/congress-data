Provides that no information relating to an arrest may be disseminated without the inclusion of the final disposition of the charges if a disposition has been reported.

Lists exceptions to the foregoing provision. Provides that criminal offender record information shall be sealed in accord with the requirements of a court order, a Federal or State statute, or regulations issued by the Attorney General, when appropriate notification is provided by the agency directly responsible for compliance with the order, statute, or regulation.
