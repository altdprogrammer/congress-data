    "text": "Food Labeling Act - Provides, under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, that the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare shall formulate and prescribe a system of food quality grade designations, expressed in a uniform nomenclature, for all food products. States that no person shall distribute or cause to be distributed in commerce any packaged or labeled food product except in accordance with regulations which shall be prescribed by the Secretary. Requires that such grade designations shall appear in conspicuous and legible type on each food package. Provides that the food quality designations for food products adopted by the Secretary shall be grades A to E in descending order of the quality of the food product. States that the Secretary of Commerce shall immediately initiate and carry out a program of consumer education in conjunction with the promulgation of food quality designations precribed by him. Provides that the Secretary of Commerce shall prescribe regulations which shall require that any food product distributed in interstate commerce bear a label containing a statement specifying all the ingredients contained in such food products in the order of their predominance. States that no person shall distribute or cause to be distributed in commerce any packaged or labeled food except in accordance with such regulations. Provides that no person shall distribute or cause to be distributed in commerce any packaged or labeled food product except in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Commerce which shall require that any such product shall bear a label containing a statement specifying the nutritional value of the food product contained therein. Sets forth labeling requirements for perishable and semiperishable foods. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations requiring that packages of perishable or semiperishable foods contain labels which show: (1) the expiration date for such food; (2) the optimum temperature and humidity conditions for its storage by the ultimate consumer; and (3) other specified information to protect consumers. Provides that such expiration date shall be expressed as such combination of letters and numbers as will enable the consumer to readily identify the day, month, and year comprising the expiration date. Provides that any person who knowingly or willfully violates such labeling requirements with respect to perishable or semiperishable foods shall be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined not more than $5,000 or both; except that if such person commits a violation after a conviction of such person has become final, or commits such a violation with the intent to defraud or mislead, such person shall be imprisoned for not more than three years or fined not more than $25,000 or both."
