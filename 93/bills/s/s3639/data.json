    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Children and Youth Camp Safety Act - Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to develop, promulgate, and modify regulations on children and youth camp safety standards. Requires that such proposed regulations be submitted to the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee and the House Education and Labor Committee, whereupon either House may disapprove such proposals. Allows States which desire to assume responsibility for development or enforcement of youth camp safety standards applicable to children and youth camps in such States to submit a State plan for such action. Requires such plans, in order to be approved by the Secretary, to designate a State agency for administering such plan; to provide for comprehensive enforcement of camp safety standards promulgated pursuant to this Act, or of equally effective standards of the State; to require inspection of camps annually at least for compliance with applicable regulations; and to insure adequate legal authority and funds for such State agency. Directs the Secretary to annually review State plans for compliance with this Act. Sets forth procedures to be followed where there are noncomplying State plans. Allows grants to States to assist them in carrying out such State plans. Grants power to the Secretary's representatives to enter camps for inspection and power to inspect records of the camps. Grants power to the Secretary to require testimony of witnesses and production of other evidence under oath. Requires camp operators to report annually on all accidents, deaths, injuries, and illnesses within the camp. Requires that the obtaining of information from camps under this Act be done with a minimum of burden upon such camps and camp operators. Directs the Secretary to withhold funds from States in which there is a pattern of violations of this Act. Provides for citation of camp operators and penalties of up to $2,500 in cases of violations of this Act. Grants jurisdiction to the Federal district courts to restrain imminent dangers arising from conditions and practices in camps. Establishes the Advisory Council on Children and Youth Camp Safety to advise and consult on matters relating to children and youth camp safety. Disavows any purpose in this Act to restrict, determine, or influence the curriculum, program, or ministry of any camp. Authorizes appropriations of $7,500,000 for the fiscal year 1975, and for each of the five succeeding fiscal years."
