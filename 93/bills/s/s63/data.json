Establishes the California Desert Advisory Commission which shall consist of Federal and State representatives, representatives of the academic community, representatives of residents of the desert, environmentalists, and representatives of groups which make use of the desert and its resources for recreational, study, or business purposes. States that it shall be the function of the Commission to advise the Secretary of the Interior with respect to the preparation of the long-range program and plan for the management, use and protection of the California desert, which is required by this Act. Provides that such plan shall be completed and reported to Congress by June 30, 1979. States that the plan shall take into account the principles of multiple use, the maintenance of environmental quality of the area, and the possibility of selective acquisition and disposal of public lands in order to better carry out the purposes of this Act. Delays the effective date of any such plan until after the expiration of the sixty day period following the date of its submission to the Congress. Authorizes the Secretary to execute an interim plan prior to the implementation of the long-range plan. Provides that all mining carried out within the conservation area shall be subject to such reasonable regulations as the Secretary may prescribe to carry out the purposes of this Act. States that such regulations shall provide for such measures as may be reasonable to protect the scenic, scientific, and environmental values of the conservation area. Authorizes to be appropriated not to exceed $28,600,000 for the purposes of this Act, such amount to remain available until expended."
