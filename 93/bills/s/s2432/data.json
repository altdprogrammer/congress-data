    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Congressional Right to Information Act - Requires the head of every Federal agency to keep each committee of the Congress and the subcommittees thereof fully and currently informed with respect to all matters relating to that agency which are within the jurisdiction of such committee or subcommittee. Requires a Federal agency, on request of a standing committee of either House of Congress, or a subcommittee thereof or two-fifths of its Members, to submit any information requested of it relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee or subcommittee. States that when an officer or employee of the United States is summoned to testify or to produce information, before either House of Congress, or a committee of Congress, or a subcommittee of either House, that officer or employee shall appear at the time and place specified and shall answer all questions propounded to him, or produce all information, unless in the case of an officer or employee of a Federal agency in the Executive Branch, either within twenty days of the date of the summons, or, in the case of any such information which was first requested at an appearance, within ten days after that appearance, the President formally and expressly instructs the officer or employee in writing to withhold the information requested, in which event such Presidential instruction shall set forth grounds on which it is based. Sets forth the procedures to be followed if there is a failure to comply with this Act, including introduction of a resolution citing such failure. Prescribes the procedure for motions to proceed to the consideration of the resolution, motions to postpone and appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to application of rules to the procedures. States that the United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have original jurisdiction of actions brought pursuant to this Act, without regard to the sum or value of the matter in controversy. States that each House of Congress and the committees and subcommittees shall take appropriate measures to insure the confidentiality of any information which requires protection against disclosure which would endanger: (1) personal privacy, (2) trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information, or (3) the conduct of the national defense, foreign policy, or law enforcement activities."
