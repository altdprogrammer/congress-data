States that in reviewing such application the court of appeals shall consider whether the sentence imposed on the defendent is excessive, although within lawful limits. Provides that if the application for leave to appeal is denied by the court of appeals, the decision is final and not subject to further judicial review. Provides that upon consideration of the appeal the court of appeals may dismiss the appeal, affirm, reduce, modify, vacate, or set aside the sentence imposed, remand the cause and direct the entry of an appropriate sentence or direct such further proceedings to be had as may be required under the circumstances. States the defendent's sentence shall not be increased as a result of an appeal under this Act. (Adds 18 U.S.C. 3742)"
