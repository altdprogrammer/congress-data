    "text": "Consumer Product Testing Act - Requires the Federal Trade Commission to categorize consumer products into priority classifications for the purpose of developing standards for test protocols, the results of which will provide a basis to the consumer for judging and comparing product characteristics. Defines the terms used in this Act. Specifies relevant factors for the designation of priority classifications. Requires the Commission to commence a proceeding for the development of such a test protocol whenever the Commission determines that such would assist consumers in making informed purchases. Requires the Commission to promulgate advertising regulations with regard to products tested under this Act, and to furnish consumers with information about such products. Allows the Commission to contract for compliance of test results furnished by any person who has tested such products. Provides that the United States district courts shall have jurisdiction over any alleged violations or hardship claims arising out of the provisions of this Act. States that it shall be a civil violation under the Federal Trade Commission Act to induce or encourage the purchase of a product by falsely representing that it has been tested or by misrepresenting the results of such test, and, further, in the case of a person engaged in testing consumer products, to advertise or distribute a consumer product with respect to which there has been any statement or representation in violation of this Act. Provides, for a conviction of a wilful violation of this Act or regulations promulgated hereunder, a fine of not more than $10,000 for each day of violation, or imprisonment for more than one year or both. Authorizes specified appropriations for fiscal years 1974, 1975, and 1976 in order to carry out the provisions of this Act."
