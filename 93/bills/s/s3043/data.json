    "text": "Federal Citizens Appeal Act - Title I: - Declares that it is the policy of the United States to guarantee citizen access to the operation of the Federal government, and to provide assistance to citizens who have complaints for agency actions which they feel are arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, in excess of authority, or harmful to person or livelihood. Title II: Right of Citizen Appeal - States that this chapter applies, according to the provisions thereof, except to the extent that: (1) statutes preclude citizen appeal; and (2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by law. Defines the terms used in this Act. Declares that a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected, or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to citizen review. States which actions shall be reviewable, the relief available pending review, and the scope of citizen review. Title III: Establishment of Federal Citizens Appeal Board - Establishes, in each of ten Federal districts as independent establishments of the executive branch of the Government of the United States, a board to be known as the Federal Citizens Appeal Board. Specifies the membership composition of such Boards. Enumerates the powers of such Boards. Imposes civil penalties for violations of this title. Prescribes the staes which shall comprise the Federal districts for which a Federal Citizens Review Board shall be established. Title IV: Advisory Council on Citizen Appeal - Establishes an Advisory Council on Citizen Appeal, to be composed of twenty members, two of which who shall be appointed by each of the ten Federal Citizen Appeal Boards. Directs the Council to, at the close of each fiscal year, report to the Congress and to the President concerning the actions it and each of the Regional Federal Citizens Appeal Boards have taken. States that the Council shall be responsible for establishing regulations regarding the procedures of each Federal Citizen Review Board, including, although not limited to, procedures for: (1) filing requests for citizen review, (2) conducting preliminary and prehearing investigations; (3) conducting hearings to determine facts and to mediate disputes, and (4) all other activities of the Boards. Title V: Procedures for Citizen Review - Provides that upon receipt of a request for citizen review as determined under this Act, the Board shall conduct a preliminary investigation. Details the procedures for such investigations. States that prior to the calling of a hearing, the Board shall conduct an investigation to compile all available information regarding the request for citizen review. Requires investigations to be completed no later than twenty days following the initiation. Empowers the Board to issue emergency rulings compelling or setting aside agency action. Title VI: Hearing Procedures - States that the transcript of testimony and exhibits, together with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, constitutes the exclusive record for decision and shall be made available without charge to the parties. Provides that the record shall show the ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented. Provides that if the Board determines that any employee or officer of any agency has been guilty of a breach of duty or misconduct, the Board shall make note of such breach of duty or misconduct in the official record, and copies of the record shall be made available to the appropriate agency, the Department of Justice, and the Civil Service Commission. Empowers the Board to file motions in Federal district court and to represent a complainant in action brought against a Federal agency which fails to comply with a Board ruling and to provide adequate representation, without cost, to complainants in a court proceeding initiated by a Federal agency appealing a ruling of the Board. States that all rulings of the Board shall be subject to judicial review. Title VII: Grants for Citizens Appeals Board - Authorizes the Advisory Council on Citizen Appeal to make grants to any State or political subdivision for the purpose of establishing citizens appeal boards, to ease conflicts between the citizens and the various agencies of government. Provides that such a grant may be up to 50 per cent of the fair and reasonable cost of establishing and carrying out such a program. Authorizes, for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this title, to be appropriated, for fiscal year 1975, and for the two succeeding fiscal years, the sum of $5,000,000 each year. States that for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of Titles II, III, IV, V, and VI, there is authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 1975, and for the two succeeding fiscal years, the sum of $15,000,000 each year."
