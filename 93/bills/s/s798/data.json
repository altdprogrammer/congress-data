Provides that the criminal charge against the released individual shall be continued for twelve months following such individual's release and authorizes the committing officer to dismiss the charge against him if at the end of such period the administrative head certifies that the individual has successfully completed his plan. States that the chief judge of any district may appoint an advisory committee for a program of community supervision and services, to be composed of the chief judge, who shall serve as chairman, the attorney for the United States, and any other judges of the district or persons residing in the district so designated.
