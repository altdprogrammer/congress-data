    "text": "Establishes the Interdisciplinary Clearcutting Practice Study Commission to investigate the practice of clearcutting of timber resources of the United States on Federal lands. States that the Commission shall be composed of seventeen members from the Senate, House and public. Directs the Commission to transmit to the Congress a report of its study and its recommendations. Provides that the Commission shall cease to exist sixty days after the submission of its report to the Congress. Provides that, on and after the date of enactment of this Act, no clearcutting of timber resources of the United States shall be permitted on any Federal lands until the expiration of ninety days following the submission of the report or the expiration of the twenty-four-month period, whichever first occurs. Defines \"clearcutting\" as the practice customarily used in the timber industry which requires the removal of substantially the entire stock of timber within a particular designated area for the purpose of commercial harvest of timber or silviculture management of timber. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums, not to exceed $2,500,000, as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
