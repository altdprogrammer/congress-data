    "text": "Ground Transport Reorganization Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to promote a balanced and competitive ground transportation system by securing a balanced and competitive ground transport manufacturing industry, in which firms are free to encourage the sale of ground transport vehicles without regard to the conflicting interests of automobile manufacturers. Title I: Prohibition of Interlocking Control - Prohibits specified interests, activities, and interlocking relationships by any person who manufactures 10 percent or more of the total number of automobiles sold within the United States, including making it unlawful for such person: (1) to manufacture or sell for use in the United States any other type of ground passenger transport vehicle or any component used in the manufacture of any such vehicle; (2) to control in any manner any facility, or any other interest in any other person, engaged in the manufacture or sale for use in the United States of any type of ground passenger transport vehicle or of any component used in the manufacture of any such vehicle; and (3) to have any officer or director who is an officer, director, or member, or who as a stockholder holds controlling interest in any other person engaged in the manufacture or sale for use in the United States of any other type of ground passenger transport vehicle or of any component used in the manufacture of any such vehicle. Imposes similar restrictions on manufacturers of trucks sold within the United States. Title II: Ground Transport Reorganization Office - Establishes in the Executive Office the Ground Transport Reorganization Office. Requires the Director of the Ground Transport Reorganization Office, after notice and hearing, to acquire all of the plants, facilities, assets, tools, patents, designs, drawings, and know-how related directly or indirectly to or arising out of the production, in violation of title I, of rival forms of ground transport equipment by automobile and truck manufacturers. Authorizes the Director to exercise enumerated powers in order to carry out the provisions of this Act, including: (1) to negotiate for the acquisition of plants and facilities with unused or excess capacity in the automotive, aerospace, and other heavy equipment industries; and (2) to construct new bus and rail production facilities. Authorizes the Director to coordinate studies relating to ground transportation. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Transporation will give priority to rail rather than highway modes and to electric rather than diesel or gasoline motive power in the allocation of Federal funds for public transport in metropolitan areas which fail to meet national ambient air quality standards. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
