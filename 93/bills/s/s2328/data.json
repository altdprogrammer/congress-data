    "text": "Consumer Fuel Disclosure Act - Sets forth the purposes of this Act, including to assist consumers in avoiding the purchase of gasoline with unnecessarily high octane ratings. Prohibits the shipment, transportation, or sale of gasoline which has been shipped in interstate commerce unless the person offering such gasoline for shipment, transportation, or sale has certified the octaine rating of such gasoline. Provides additional octaine-rating prohibitions relating to the sale of such gasoline to consumers and the sale of automobiles. Prescribes penalties for violations of each such prohibition. Directs the Federal Trade Commission to: (1) establish standard methods to measure octaine; (2) conduct a study of the quality of performance of various brands of gasoline; (3) require manufacturers of gasoline which has been moved in interstate commerce to provide adequate substantiation of any claim advertised with respect to the performance of such gasoline or any additive; and (4) perform spot tests of the quality of various brands of gasoline. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
