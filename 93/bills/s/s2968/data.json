Requires that each order specifying a series of effective dates should include a statement of the reasons for which the series of effective dates is found to be in the public interest. States that the effective dates within any series specified by the Secretary shall be at one-year intervals. Provides that the final effective date in a series shall be not more than two years after the initial effective date, and all motor vehicles, to which the standard applies, manufactured on or after the final effective date for purposes of sale in the United States shall conform to the standard. (Adds 15 U.S.C. 1392(i)(1))"
