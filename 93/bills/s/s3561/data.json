Provides the employee with thirty days in which to answer the notice. States that if the determination of the agency is to propose to take adverse action against the employee, and the employee files written objection with the agency, within ten days after receiving a copy of the decision, the agency may file with the Board a proposal to take adverse action against the employee. Sets forth procedures to be followed whenever an employing agency files with the Board a proposal to take adverse action against an employee.
