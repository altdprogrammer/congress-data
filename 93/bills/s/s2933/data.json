Provides that if such registration is not made within the time prescribed, it shall be presumed that such person is not a citizen of the United States by birth. Imposes criminal penalties on persons for failure to surrender a passport when requested to do so and for collusion with foreign governments to evade passport laws and regulations. Provides that no person who refuses to swear or affirm his allegiance to the United States shall be entitled to receive, hold, or use any passport or other credential issued by, or under authority of, the United States which identifies such person as one bearing allegiance to the United States. (Amends 8 U.S.C. 1401, 1548, 1547)"
