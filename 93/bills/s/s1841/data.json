States that the right to broadcast such game by means of television at such time and in such area shall be made available, by the person or persons having such right, to a television broadcast licensee on reasonable terms. Directs the Federal Communications Commission to conduct a continuing study of the effect of this section and to, not later than April 15 of each year, submit a report to the Committee on Commerce of the Senate and the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives with respect thereto. Repeals the provisions of this Act effective December 31, 1975."
