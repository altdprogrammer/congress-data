Limits the authority of the National Endowment for the Arts to construct facilities by requiring that: (1) there be a finding that the construction involved in the project either is for demonstration purposes or is a project in which there is no other means by which the artistic purposes of the project may be accomplished; and (2) two-thirds of the National Council on the Arts, who are present and voting, approve of the projects. Provides authority for the Arts and Humanities Endowments to support programs in areas where citizens do not have access to such programs for geographical or economic reasons. Requires that construction projects be for demonstration purposes, or under unusual circumstances. Provides that each State may be allotted $200,000 each fiscal year from the National Endowment for the Arts, and that loans from the Endowment shall be made in accordance with terms made by the Secretary of the Treasury. Requires the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities to correlate programs of that Endowment with State humanities agencies, to the extent practicable. Expands the membership of the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities to include a member designated by the Chairman of the Senate Commission on Arts and Antiquities and a member designated by the Speaker of the House. Provides that advisory panels appointed to approve applications for funding shall have geographic representation. Includes research libraries within the definition of \"public library\" for purposes of the Library Services Construction Act."
