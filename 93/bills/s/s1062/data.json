    "text": "Flammable Fabrics Act Amendments - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to institute proceedings for the development and determination of an appropriate flammability standard or other regulation may be needed to protect the public Provides that the Secretary may exempt any fabric, related material, or product from any such standard or regulation if a person shows that he is subject to, but cannot comply with, the standard or regulation. States that any fabric, related material or product so exempted shall be clearly and conspicously labeled, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission, to indicate: (1) that such fabric, related material, or product does not meet with a standard; (2) that such fabric, related material, or products should not be worn near sources of fire; and (3) the standard from which such fabric, related material, or product has been exempted from. Provides that the manufacturing, importing, selling, or offering for sale, or transporting in commerce of any product, fabric, or related material which has not been certified shall be unlawful and shall constitute an unfair method of competition and an unfair or deceptive act or practice in commerce under the Federal Trade Commission Act. States that certification shall be based on a reasonable testing program conducted by the manufacturer and approved by the Federal Trade Commission. Provides that no certification would be valid unless the Commission had approved the reasonable testing program. Asserts that whoever with knowledge performs an act in violation of various provisions of the Flammable Fabrics Act shall be guilty of a felony and upon conviction shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than 3 years, or both. Requires the certification of all products, fabrics, or related material for which flammability standards have been promulgated. Makes it unlawful to furnish false guarantees of compliance with flammability standards applicable to any product, fabric, or related material. Adds a civil penalty provision to the Flammable Fabric Act not to exceed $10,000 for each violation of the Act. Provides that a person shall not be subject to any criminal or civil penalty if he establishes a guarantee received in good faith signed by and containing the name and address of the person by whom the product, fabric, or related material guaranteed was manufactured, and has not by further processing affected the flammability of the fabric and related material or product covered by the guarantee which he recieved. Provides that not later than ninety days after the date of enactment of this Act the Secretary shall submit a report to the Congress setting forth the specific types of fabrics for which new flammability standards should be adopted. Requires such report to include a schedule of the proposed dates for the institution of proceedings by the Secretary for the determination of such standards and to include a special section relating to the need for standards to protect person over 65 years of age. States that not later than six months after the date of enactment of this Act the Secretary shall promulgate standards for children's sleepwear, including any product of wearing apparel such as nightgowns, pajamas, or similar or related items."
