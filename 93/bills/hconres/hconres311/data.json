Makes it the sense of the Congress that the President should direct the United States delegation to the United Nations to support a more effective implementation of United Nations' procedures for reviewing communications directed to the United Nations concerning alleged human rights violations including: (1) disclosure to the petitioner of the accused government's reply to the United Nations concerning the petitioner's communication, (2) notification to the petitioner and the accused government of a decision made by any organ of the United Nations reviewing the petitioner's communication, (3) provision for the petitioner (or his counsel) and the accused government of any decision made by any before the United Nations organs reviewing the communication, and (4) provision for any member of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities to notify the United Nations working group (which initially reviews such communications) of any communication he considers deserves special attention by the working group. Requests the President to report to the Congress in writing concerning actions taken by him to carry out the policy of this concurrent resolution."
