Provides that not more than half of the delegation's members shall be from one political party, and that all shall be citizens of high stature and wide influence, representing together a broad range of experience in the various major challenges facing this undertaking, and so conscious of its importance and urgency as to be willing to give it personally the necessary priority and time. Provides that six of the delegates shall be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, after consultation with the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, six by the President of the Senate, after consultation with the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, and six by the President of the United States."
