    "text": "Calls upon the President of the United States to initiate high-level studies in the executive branch of the Government to determine what changes should be made in the Charter of the United Nations, to promote a just and lasting peace through the development of the rule of law, including protection of individual rights and liberties as well as the field of war prevention. Requests the President to report to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives before March 31, 1974, on the results of such studies. Makes it the sense of the Congress that the Government of the United States support the formal calling of a conference to review the United Nations Charter not later than 1976."
