Urges the President to initiate through diplomatic, military, and any other available channels, such action as may be necessary to insure that the tenets of fair and humane treatment, as expressed in the Geneva Convention of 1949, are accorded to American servicemen held as prisoners of war in North and South Vietnam and especially to urge the Government of North Vietnam and its allies to: (1) identify prisoners whom they hold; (2) release seriously sick or injured prisoners; (3) permit impartial inspections of all prisoner-of-war facilities; and (4) permit the free exchange of mail between families and prisoners."
