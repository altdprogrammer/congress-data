    "text": "Declares that the Congress of the United States recognizes the existence of a serious conservation problem and requests that the President take unilateral action imposing and enforcing a moratorium upon foreign fishery operations on United States coastal stocks of fish, and further requests the President to prohibit foreign fishing of any American coastal species within American coastal waters, unless specific permission is granted to fish in these waters by the American Government. Declares that the Senate urges the President to maintain this moratorium until an international regime for the conservation of American coastal fish species can be established."
