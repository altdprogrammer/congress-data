Makes it the sense of the Congress that the President should issue a public statement of United States policy condemning the treatment of the Jewish population of Iraq and Syria by their Governments. Makes it the sense of the Congress that the Attorney General should exercise his parole authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act to facilitate entry into the United States by Jewish citizens of Iraq and Syria fleeing persecution in such countries."
