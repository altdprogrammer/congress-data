Makes it the sense of the Congress that it is the right of every citizen of the United States to travel freely, both the legislative and executive branches of the United States Government have vigorously supported the right to international travel in the case of Soviet Jews seeking to emigrate from the Soviet Union, and this right to travel freely is self-executing and needs no legislation to take full force and effect, and cannot be diminished or impaired by any Act of Congress."
