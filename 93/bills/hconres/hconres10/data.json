    "text": "Makes it the sense of the Congress that the regulation of insurance should, in general continue with the States, subject to the admonition that Congress cannot, and will not, long ignore the need for evolving new and updated approaches to insurance and accident compensation. Makes it the sense of the Congress that there must evolve at the State level a rational, equitable, and compatible reparation system for motor vehicle accident victims supported and sustained by a similarly rational, equitable, and compatible private insurance system. Makes it the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of Transportation be authorized and directed to request that the Council of State Government, using the appropriate instrumentalities, develop model legislation for submission to the States for their consideration. Authorizes the Secretary to analyze the actions of the States, their legislatures and insurance regulatory officials to determine to what extent such States act hereafter to bring about motor vehicle insurance and accident compensation systems consistent with the intent of this resolution; to provide technical assistance to and interact with such States, their legislatures and insurance regulatory officials in effecting in all the States compensation systems consistent with such principles, and to report such progress as has been made, or is being made, in effecting such compensation systems, with a final report to be made by the Secretary detailing the action by each State in moving toward or providing an automobile accident compensation system consistent with these principles; the experience of the States with these system; and, concluding with the Secretary's views regarding the feasibility of attaining a satisfactory and compatible motor vehicle accident reparations system without further Federal legislation."
