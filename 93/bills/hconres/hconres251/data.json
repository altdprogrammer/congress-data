Declares that the Congress recognizes, encourages, and intends to support the key responsibilities of the several States for conservation and scientific management of fisheries resources within U.S. territorial waters, and that the Congress particularly commends Federal programs designed to improve coordinated protection, enhancement, and scientific management of all United States fisheries, both coastal and distant, including presently successful Federal aid programs under the Commercial Fisheries, Research and Development Act of 1964, and the newly developing Federal-State fisheries management programs."
