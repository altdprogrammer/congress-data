Makes it the sense of the Congress that the President should take such steps as may be necessary to assure that the international conference referred to in the first section of this concurrent resolution will consider specific measures directed against international aircraft hijacking, which measures should include, but not be limited to: (1) a requirement that any individual guilty of international aircraft hijacking must be returned to the country in which the hijacking originated within thirty days; (2) requirements that each country must take adequate steps to assure the safety of the hijacked aircraft, together with its passengers and crew, and provide for their safe return to the country from which the flight originated within five days; and (3) appropriate provisions requiring that all funds or other valuable items extorted by the hijacker must be returned together with the hijacked aircraft, its passengers and crew."
