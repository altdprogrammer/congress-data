Provides that the House of Representatives will oppose any action by the President of the United States which would result in the spread of nuclear technology to Egypt and other nations which do not presently have such technology, by refusing to approve authorizations and appropriations for such undertakings, until the President can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the House of Representatives that there are adequate safeguards and controls limiting the use of such reactors and other forms of nuclear technology to peaceful uses."
