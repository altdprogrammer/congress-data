Requires the Secretary of Transportation to submit to the Congress a report not later than forty-five days from the enactment of this joint resolution which regardless of the settlement of the particular dispute between the Penn Central Transportation Company and its employees represented by the United Transportation Union, provides a full and comprehensive plan for the preservation of essential rail transportation services in the Northeast section of the Nation, including the President's proposals, if any regarding Federal financial expenditures necessary for restoration or preservation of rail transportation services imperiled by the financial failure of rail carriers, and for alternative means for providing essential transportation services now provided by such carriers. Requires the Secretary of Labor not later than thirty days prior to the expiration date specified in the first section of his joint resolution to submit to the Congress a full and comprehensive report containing: (1) the progress, if any, of negotiations between the Penn Central Transportation Company and its employees represented by the United Transportation Union; and (2) any such recommendations for a proposed solution of the dispute described in this joint resolution as he deems appropriate."
