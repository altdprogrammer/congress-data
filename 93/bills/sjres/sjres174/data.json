States that the ICC shall give due consideration to the desirability, as a means of removing undue prejudice or unjust discrimination, of requiring carriers to provide specifically in their tariffs the terms under which, during any period of time when the supply of cars available for grain gathering does not equal the requirements, all shippers may demand and secure upon even terms the use of cars employed upon the lines of any railroad."
