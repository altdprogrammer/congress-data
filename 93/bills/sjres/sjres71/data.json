Requires the Commission to transmit to the President and to the Congress one or more interim reports and, not later than two years after the first meeting of the Commission, one final report, containing detailed statements of the findings and conclusions of the Commission, together with its recommendations, including such recommendations for action by public and private bodies and individuals as it deems advisable. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary, but not to exceed $1,000,000 for each of the two years during which the Commission shall serve for the purpose of carrying out this joint resolution. Provides that on the ninetieth day after the date of submission of its final report to the President and the Congress the Commission shall cease to exist."
