Directs the Commission to conduct an extensive and exhaustive study of the practices engaged in by political parties and individuals in the course of Federal political campaigns including, but not limited to: (1) the adequacy of procedures for the enforcement of existing laws relating to political campaigns and campaign financing; (2) the existing and alternative methods of financing political campaigns and limitations on campaign spending; (3) the review of Federal tax laws as they relate to the financing of political campaigns; (4) the purposes for which money is expended in political campaigns, such as development of campaign organizations, campaign advertising, voter registration, and polling; (5) the methods and procedures by which candidates are nominated for Federal office by political parties; (6) the adequacy of safeguards against unethical, disruptive, fraudulent, violent or wrongful campaign tactics; (7) the interrelationship of Federal, State, and local campaigns and Federal, State, and local laws relating to campaigns and campaign financing; and (8) the length of the period over which candidates are required to campaign for nomination and election to Federal office. Directs the Commission to make recommendations for such legislation, constitutional amendment, or other reforms as its findings indicate, and in its judgment, are needed to revise and control the practices and procedures of political parties, organizations, and individuals participating in the Federal electoral process. Sets forth the powers and membership of the Commission. Requires that the Commission submit to Congress and the President appropriate interim reports and a final report describing the results of the study together with its findings and such legislative proposals as it deems necesary or desirable, not later than one year from the date of enactment of this joint resolution. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this joint resolution."
