Provides that Federal facilities shall not be available for the performance of psychosurgery or for any project which includes the performance of psychosurgery. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to conduct a study of the employment of psychosurgery with a view to determining the number and types of cases, during the five-year period ending December 31, 1972, in which psychosurgery has been performed in all private and public hospitals in the United States, and of compiling an analysis, on a case-by-case basis, of a sufficient number of such cases to provide the basis for an objective scientific evaluation of psychosurgery performed during such period with regard to the types of psychosurgery performed, the conditions for which it was performed, and the results thereof. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this joint resolution."
