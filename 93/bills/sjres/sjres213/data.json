States that it shall be the purpose of the Task Force to help expedite the construction of energy producing facilities. Directs the Task Force to deal with specific construction problems presented to it by representatives of associations, industries, unions, environmentalists, and other groups by reviewing information from the planners concerned, defining the scope of the problem as it relates to the construction industry engaged in the construction of energy-producing facilities, and communicating national energy requirements to local energy sources. Directs that it shall be the function of the Task Force to make recommendations to interested parties aimed at minimizing the amount of construction time needed for the establishment of energy-producing facilities without disrupting the resources of the construction industry. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this joint resolution."
