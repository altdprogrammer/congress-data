Directs the Commission to (1) conduct public hearings when appropriate to provide for public scrutiny of inflationary problems in various sectors of the economy; (2) report to the President, the Congress, and the public, when appropriate, of any decisions, actions, or price and wage increases which the Commission determines would substantially contribute to inflationary pressures in the economy; and (3) transmit to the President and the Congress an interim report not later than September 1, 1974, and a final report not later than March 1, 1975, on its findings and recommendations.
