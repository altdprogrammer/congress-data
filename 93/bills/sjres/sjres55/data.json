    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Prohibits the Congress from enacting any law providing for the involuntary induction of persons into the military forces unless the enactment of such a law has been approved by a majority of the electors of the United States voting in a national referendum to determine whether the people of the United States favor such a law. Provides that, whenever the President determines that, because of national security reasons, a law should be enacted authorizing the involuntary induction of persons into the military forces of the United States, he shall issue a proclamation to that effect, and on a day specified by him at least thirty days but not more than ninety days after the issuance of such proclamation a special election shall be conducted in such manner as the Congress may prescribe by law to determine whether the people of the United States favor the enactment of a law authorizing involuntary induction of persons into the military forces. Provides that, whenever the Congress has enacted a law authorizing the involuntary induction of persons into the military forces of the United States following approval of such action by a national referendum and the authority under such law subsequently terminates, the Congress may not thereafter enact a new law providing for involuntary induction except pursuant to another national referendum approving enactment of such a law. Excludes from the provisions of this article the authority of the Congress to enact a law providing for the involuntary induction of persons into the military forces of the United States to repel an actual invasion of the United States. Gives Congress the power to implement the provisions of this article by appropriate legislation."
