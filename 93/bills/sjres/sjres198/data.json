    "text": "Establishes a Joint Committee on Energy, to be composed to twenty members of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Directs the President to submit to the Congress an annual report on energy. States that such report should specify the status of energy resources both domestic and imported and include information about energy consumption, utilization, allocation, control, research and development efforts, long-term needs and demands, and tariff and tax measures. Directs the joint committee, on a continuing basis, to investigate and study the development, use, and control of all forms of energy other than energy which is released in the course of nuclear fission or nuclear transformation. Provides that such investigations and studies shall relate, but shall not be confined, to information or recommendations contained in the President's Annual Report on Energy. States that investigations and studies conducted by the joint committee shall include: (1) studies on coordination of energy policy; (2) examination of current proposals for legislation relating to the development, use, and control of energy; and (3) review of the policies and actions of the agencies of the executive branch with respect to the development, use, and control of energy. Sets forth powers of the joint committee. Authorizes the committee to secure from any executive department, agency, board, bureau, independent establishment, or instrumentality of the Federal Government any information, suggestions, rulings, data, estimates, and statistics for the purpose of making investigations, reports, and studies relating to energy. Provides that the expenses of the joint committee shall be paid from the contingent fund of the Senate from funds appropriated for the joint committee."
