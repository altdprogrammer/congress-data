Provides that if it is decided that the invocation is not well taken, the officer or employee shall be ordered to appear and to answer the question or questions propounded and produce any documents or other matter requested. Provides that when the Congress, either House of Congress, joint committee, or subcommittee upholds or denies the invocation of executive privilege, it shall, within ten days, file: (1) in the case of a joint committee, a concurrent resolution with both Houses of Congress; and (2) in the case of a committee or subcommittee, a resolution with its House of Congress; with a report and record of its proceedings relating to such invocation of executive privilege."
