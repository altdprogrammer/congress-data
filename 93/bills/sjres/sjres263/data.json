Establishes a Federal Savings and Loan Advisory Council, which shall continue to exist as long as the Board biannually determines, as a matter of formal record, after consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, with timely notice in the Federal Register, to be in the public interest in connection with the performance of duties imposed on the Council by law."
