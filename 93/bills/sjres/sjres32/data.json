States that he shall hold his office during the term of four years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same term, be elected as provided in this Amendment. Provides that no person constitutionally ineligible for the office of President shall be eligible for the office of Vice President. Provides that the President and Vice President shall be elected by the people of the several States and the District of Columbia. Provides that the electors shall have the qualifications of the most numerous branch of the State legislature, except that the legislature of any State may prescribe lesser qualifications with respect to residence therein. States that the electors in the District of Columbia shall have such qualifications as the Congress may prescribe. Provides that the Congress shall determine the time of such election, which shall be the same throughout the United States. States that, until otherwise determined by the Congress, such election shall be held on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November of the year preceding the year in which the regular term of the President is to begin. Entitles each State to a number of electoral votes equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which such State may be entitled in the Congress. Entitles the District of columbia to a number of electoral votes equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which such District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State. Provides that on the 6th day of January following the election, unless the Congress by law appoints a different day not earlier than the 4th day of January and not later than the 10th day of January, the President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all certificates and the votes shall then be counted. States that each person for whom votes were cast for President in each State and the District of Columbia shall be credited with such proportion of the electoral votes thereof as he received of the total vote cast by the electors therein for President. Provides that the person having the greatest aggregate number of electoral votes of the States and the District of Columbia for President shall be President, if such number be at least 40 percent of the whole number of such electoral votes. States that if no person has received 40 percent of the whole number of such electoral votes, or if two persons have recieved an identical number of such electoral votes which is at least 40 percent of the whole number of electoral votes, then from the persons having the two greatest numbers of such electoral votes for President, the Sentate and the House of Representatives sitting in joint session shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. Provides that a majority of the votes of the combined membership of the Senate and House of Representatives shall be necessary for a choice. States that the Vice President shall be likewise elected, at the same time, in the same manner, and subject to the same provisions as the President. Provides that the Congress may by law provide for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the Senate and the House of Representatives may choose a President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them, and for the case of death of any of the persons from whom the Senate and the House of Representatives may choose a Vice President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them."
