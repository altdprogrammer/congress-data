    "text": "Directs the President, after public hearing, to provide for the establishment of priorities of use and for systematic allocation of supplies of petroleum products including crude oil in order to meet the essential needs of various sections of the Nation and to prevent anticompetitive effects resulting from shortages of such products. Creates in the Executive Office of the President an Emergency Fuels Allocation Board, composed of five members, to expedite the implementation of directives by the President, as authorized by this resolution. Grants the Board necessary powers to carry out the functions of this joint resolution. Requires the Board to implement specific programs to promote the expansion of domestic refinery capacity consistent with reasonable requirements of environmental protection, and public awareness of the dimensions of the fuel shortage crisis in the United States, and voluntary action to curtail nonessential use of private transportation and of living conveniences requiring electric power. Directs the Attorney General to take such steps as may be necessary to assure that during the existing fuel shortage emergency, marketing practices by major refiners and fuel allocation polices by the Government of the United States are not detrimental to the maintenance of a viable competitive domestic petroleum industry and do not result in a foreclosure to independent marketers of supplies from major oil companies. Provides that the authorities provided for in this resolution shall be effective through the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this resolution."
