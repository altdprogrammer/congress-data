    "text": "Directs the United States Department of Justice to undertake a study of the operation of the Youth Corrections Act, particularly with respect to: (1) the effectiveness of the Act in leading to rehabilitation of those offenders sentenced under it; (2) the need for new correctional institutions to provide the specialized treatment directed to be given under the Act; (3) the need for new correctional procedures and programs designed to increase opportunities for rehabilitation under the Act; (4) the need for new legislative guidelines to enable the judges of the courts of the United States to use the Act in accordance with the intent of Congress; and (5) the desirability of providing separate facilities and programs for minor offenders, as opposed to youthful felons and those committing more serious offenses. Requires the Department to complete the study of the Act within one year of the date of the enactment of this resolution and to submit to the Congress its conclusions and recommendations within this period."
