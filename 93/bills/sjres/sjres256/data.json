Directs the Commission to prepare, within twelve months after its establishment, a comprehensive report to the Congress and the President containing its conclusions and recommendations with respect to specified factors, including: (1) the consequences to the Nation of regulation by regulatory agencies; (2) the economic costs, including any inflationary impact upon the price of goods and services resulting from such regulation; (3) the consequences of discontinuing regulation by regulatory agencies; and (4) the economic costs and benefits to consumers, to those who produce or sell goods or services in commerce and to taxpayers, of the collection of information by regulatory agencies from those who produce or sell goods or services in commerce. Requires further reports after eighteen and thirty-six months, providing specific comprehensive information on the impact and consequences of discontinuing the regulatory agencies and alternative methods for accomplishing increased effectiveness, responsiveness, and accountability of such agencies. Stipulates that after thirty-six months the Commission shall prepare a final comprehensive report to the Congress and the President detailing steps taken or underway to carry out the recommendations set forth in the first, second, and third comprehensive reports together with any additions, modifications, or further refinements of such earlier conclusions and recommendations.
