    "text": "Establishes a Joint Legislative Committee on Energy. Directs the committee to make a continuing study of the problems related to the development, use, and control of all forms of energy other than energy which is released in the course of nuclear fission or nuclear transformation and is primarily related to military use. Provides that the joint committee shall report to the Senate and House of Representatives the results of its study together with its recommendations. States that all bills, resolutions, and other matters relating primarily to the development, use, or control of energy shall be referred to the joint committee within ninety days of their initial referral to the appropriate standing committee, unless the joint committee otherwise provides by a majority vote of all members of the committee. Requires the joint committee to make a recommendation or report on each resolution, bill, or other matter to the floor of each House of Congress together with the report or recommendation, if any, of the standing committee or committees to which the matter was initially referred. Provides that the expenses of the joint committee shall be paid from the contingent funds of the House and Senate, from funds appropriated for the joint committee by a concurrent resolution of each House of Congress."
