Authorizes the President to: (1) cooperate with and encourage local officials and civic leaders across the Nation to dedicate and suitably mark individual trees in local ceremonies as living commemoration to former residents who are still missing as a result of the fighting in Southeast Asia, as well as to all those who served and died there; and (2) dedicate and suitably mark a national commemorative tree or national commemorative grove of trees at an appropriate location as a national living commemoration to all those who are still missing in Southeast Asia as well as to all those who served and died there."
