    "text": "Makes it the sense of Congress that: (1) the deplorable conditions under which American Indians and Alaska Natives live will be alleviated only through an Indian policy which contains and supports constructive programs and services directed to the governing bodies of these groups for application in their respective communities, offering self-help and self-determination features; (2) American Indian property will be protected; Indian culture and identity will be respected; the necessary technical guidance and assistance and support will be given to insure future economic independence as well as for continued efforts to reach maximum development of natural resources; inadequate and substandard housing and sanitation will be corrected; a comprehensive health program incorporating and assuring curative and preventive physical and mental health will be further developed for Indians; and a long-term general, vocational and professional education program will be encouraged and developed for both old and young American Indians so that they share fully in our society; (3) American Indian communities will be given the freedom and encouragement and support to develop their maximum potential, and Congress will pursue a policy of developing the necessary programs and services to bring Indians and Alaska Natives to a desirable social and economic level of full participating citizens; and (4) our national Indian policy will give full recognization to and be predicated upon the unique relationship that exists between this group of citizens and the Federal Government and that a government-wide commitment shall derive from this relationship that will be designed to give Indians the freedom and encouragement and support to develop their individual, family and community potential and to determine their own future to the maximum extent possible. Declares it to be the sense of Congress that this statement of national Indian policy replaces the policy set forth in H. Con. Res. 108 (83rd Congress (August 1, 1953)); and that the Secretary of the Interior should examine all existing legislation dealing with Indians and Alaska natives and report to the Congress at the earliest predictable date his recommendations for such legislation and such additional legislation and reorganization of existing federal agencies dealing with Indian programs as, in his judgment, may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this resolution."
