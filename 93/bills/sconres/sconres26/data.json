Makes it the sense of Congress that, in order to ensure the enactment of effective and practicable safety belt usage laws, the States should consider inclusion in such laws of provisions that are consistent with the principles enumerated in this concurrent resolution. Makes it the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Transportation shall provide technical assistance to the States to aid them in their efforts to enact effective and practicable laws requiring the use of safety belts in motor vehicles."
