Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should use every effort to bring about such reciprocal actions by the parties to the peace agreements, including the Government of the Republic of Vietnam and the Royal Lao Government, as will be most likely to bring an end to the abhorrent conduct of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of Vietnam and the Lao Patriotic Front regarding the missing in action. Declares the Congresses staunch support to the families and loved ones of the Americans missing in action, who have suffered such deep human anguish for so long due to the undisclosed fate of the missing in action."
