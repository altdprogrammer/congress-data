    "text": "States that Congress hereby expresses its grave concern with respect to the actions of Japan and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which violate the spirit and intent of the agreements of the International Whaling Commission which would cause further depletion of whales, a valuable marine resource; and violate the treaty provisions concerning salmon and conservation recommendations on halibut adopted by international commissions. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to determine and report to the Congress what action can be taken to promote international compliance with conservation measures agreed to by the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment, the First Session of the United Nations Governing Council for Environmental Programs, the International Whaling Commission, or contained in the marine and fishery treaties, conventions, and international agreements to which the United States is a party, to include but not be limited to: (1) a determination whether the provisions of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 should now be invoked, the extent to which it should be invoked, and whether it should be amended to include products in addition to fisheries products; (2) a study of what other unilateral steps or international measures can be taken to promote the objectives of this joint resolution, including bilateral talks with the Soviet Union, Japan, and other nations party to the international understandings and agreements referred to above; and (3) an examination of trade agreements with Japan and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the light of the objectives of this joint resolution."
