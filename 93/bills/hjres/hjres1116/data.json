Provides that the United States of America shall discontinue all military aid and training programs with the United Kingdom of Great Britain which are related to the suppression of the minority in Northern Ireland and which are not directly related to North Atlantic Treaty Organization commitments and that the United States of America shall embargo the exportation of all weapons and ammunition to the United Kingdom of Great Britain which are related to the suppression of the minority in Northern Ireland and which are not exclusively reserved for North Atlantic Treaty Organization usage."
