Exlcudes from the term \"war\" a state of international combat where less than five thousand personnel of land, sea, or air force are committed to armed combat outside of the United States for less than ten days, unless expressly so declared by the Congress in accordance with the first section of this joint resolution. Provides that no Act of Congress authorizing or appropriating funds, directly or indirectly, for activities of the Department of Defense, or indirectly supporting the commitment of troops to armed combat outside of the United States, shall be deemed to be an express declaration of a state of international combat for the purposes of the first section of this joint resolution."
