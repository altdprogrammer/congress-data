Requires the President, not later than sixty days from the enactment of this joint resolution, to submit to the Congress a report which, regardless of the settlement of the particular dispute between the Penn Central Transportation Company and its employees represented by the United Transportation Union, provides a full and comprehensive plan for the preservation of essential rail transportation services in the northeast section of the Nation, including the President's proposals, if any, regarding Federal financial expenditures necessary for restoration or preservation of rail transportation services imperiled by the financial failure of rail carriers, and for alternative means for providing essential transportation services now provided by such carriers. Requires the President, not later than thirty days prior to the expiration date specified in the first section of this joint resolution, to submit to the Congress a full and comprehensive report containing: (1) the progress, if any, of negotiations between the Penn Central Transportation Company and its employees represented by the United Transportation Union; and (2) any such recommendations for a proposed solution of the dispute described in this joint resolution as he deems appropriate."
