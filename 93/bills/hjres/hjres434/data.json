Requires the establishment of an advisory committee on social service programs at the State and local level. Requires the establishment of an advisory committee on day care services. Makes provisions for a fair hearing under which applicants and recipients may appeal denial of or an exclusion from a service program. Requires a State plan to specify how the services will be provided and, in the case of provision by other public agencies, identify the agency and the service to be provided. States that, if a State elects to provide services for additional groups of families or individuals, the state plan must identify such groups and specify the services to be made available to each group. Provides that services to individuals must be in accord with plans developed in cooperation with the individual, be responsive to the needs of the individual applicant, and be related to one or more of the specific goals described in this Act. Defines the term \"services\" to include chore services, day care services for adults, child care services, educational services, employment services, family planning services, adult services, foster care services for adults, foster care services for children, services to meet health needs, home delivered or congregate meals, homemaker services, home management and other functional educational services, housing improvement services, legal services, community planning, protective services for adults and children, special services for the blind, and transportation services.
