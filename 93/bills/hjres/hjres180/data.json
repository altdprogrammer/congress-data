Permits the President, from time to time, to transmit revisions of his estimates of the receipts, and revisions of his estimates and recommendations with respect to expenditures. Permits the President, in transmitting the budget for any fiscal year, to recommend measures for raising additional revenues and measures for the expenditure of all or part of such additional revenues. Provides that, on or before the last day of the second month following the close of such fiscal year, the President shall report to the Congress the actual amount of receipts and expenditures of the Government during such fiscal year, other than receipts and expenditures of trust funds. Provides that during a war or other national emergency the provisions that require the President to submit a budget in which recommended expenditures do not exceed estimated receipts, shall not apply with respect to any period if: (1) the President recommends to the Congress the suspension of such provisions with respect to such period; (2) the Congress by a two-third vote of each House agrees to a resolution suspending such provisions with respect to such period."
