    "text": "Establishes a joint congressional committee which shall be known as the Joint Committee on Energy, to be composed of sixteen members. Directs the joint committee to conduct a study and investigation of the current energy crisis, including a discussion of specified questions: (1) to what extent is the inadequate refining capacity of the United States the result of planning errors, and to what extent can such errors be avoided in the future? (2) is the fuel shortage in any way a result of collusion among the oil companies? (3) to what extent is the fuel shortage a result of fear, confusion, and hoarding? and (4) are American businesses using our energy problems as an excuse for noncompliance with environmental standards? Directs the joint committee to transmit an interim report to Congress within three months, and a final report not later than six months from the date of approval of this joint resolution. Enumerates the powers of the joint committee. Authorizes the joint committee, upon the approval of the chairman, to secure directly from any organizational unit of the Federal Government such information as is necessary to enable it to carry out this joint resolution."
