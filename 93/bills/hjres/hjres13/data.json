Provides, in the event that no candidates receive 40 percent of the votes cast, that the Congress shall assemble in special session and choose the President and Vice President by publicly recorded vote from among those two pairs receiving the highest number of votes cast in the election. Requires a uniform national election day, and gives the Congress power to provide for the manner in which the candidacies to appear on the ballot shall be determined, for the places at which and the manner in which the election shall be held, for the manner in which its outcome shall be determined, for primary elections, and for the eventuality of death or withdrawal of a candidate on or before the date of election. States that the qualifications for voters in any State shall be the same as apply in the case of voters in such State in elections of Senators, except that the Congress may by law prescribe uniform qualification as to age and residence."
