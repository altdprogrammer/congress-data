    "text": "Declares that the Congress finds that serious problems have arisen in the conduct of Olympic games which have led to widespread criticism of certain aspects of the games and of the manner in which the United States administers its preparation for and participation in the games. Establishes a National Commission on the Olympic Games composed of twelve members, four of whom shall be appointed by the President, four by the President of the Senate, and four by the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Excludes from membership any officer or director, past or present, of the United States Olympic Committee or any national athletic association or federation. Sets forth the duties of the Commission. Requires the commission to recommend the form of future United States participation in the Olympic movement, if any, with proposals for the legislative action required to carry out such recommendation. Requires a final report of the Commission's findings and recommendations to be submitted to the President and the Congress not later than July 31, 1973. Provides for the compensation of Commission members. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Provides that the Commission shall cease to exist 30 days after submission of its final report."
