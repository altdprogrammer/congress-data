    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Provides for the direct election of the President and the Vice President. Requires a plurality of at least 40 percent of the votes cast for election to office. Provides that if no candidates have received 40 percent of the total number of votes, but the persons joined as candidates having the greatest number of votes cast in the election received the greatest number of votes cast in each of several States which in combination are entitled to a number of Senators and Representatives in the Congress constituting a majority of the whole number of Members of both Houses of the Congress, such persons shall be elected President and Vice President. Provides in the event that no candidates receive 40 percent of the votes cast and fail to meet the above specifications, that the Congress shall assemble in special session and choose the President and Vice President by publicly recorded vote from among those two pairs receiving the highest number of votes cast in the election. Requires a uniform national election day, and provides that the times, places, and manner of holding such elections and entitlement to inclusion on the ballot shall be prescribed in each State by the legislature thereof. Authorizes the Congress to alter such regulations, and to provide for the eventuality of death or withdrawal of a candidate before or after election day. States that the qualifications for voters in any State shall be the same as apply in the case of voters in such State in elections for the most numerous branch of the State legislature, except that the Congress may by law prescribe uniform qualifications as to residence. Makes this Amendment effective two years after ratification by the States, and makes provisions for Presidential elections in the time between Congressional passage and State ratification of the Amendment."
