States that the person having the greatest number of votes for President shall be the President and the person having the greatest number of votes for Vice President shall be the Vice President. Provides that if, at the time fixed for the counting of the certified vote totals from the respective States and the District of Columbia, the Presidential candidate who would have been entitled to election as President shall have died, the Vice Presidential candidate entitled to election as Vice President shall be declared elected President.
