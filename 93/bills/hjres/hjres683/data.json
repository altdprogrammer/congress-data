Requires the President to appoint an Advisory Board to be composed of 10 members for the purpose of recommending policy to the Administrator as designated in Executive Order Numbered 11246 for the purpose of exercising his authority under this joint resolution. Makes it the duty of the Administrator, after notice and opportunity for hearing: (1) to review the employment practices of each United States person, having a major investment in an enterprise in South Africa or affiliated with an entity doing business in South Africa, and (2) to issue an order establishing a roster of all such United States persons doing business in South Africa in accordance with fair employment practices. Requires the Administrator to review the eligibility of each United States person, having a major investment in an enterprise in South Africa or affiliated with an entity doing business in South Africa, for inclusion on the roster established under this section. Provides that the Administrator shall conduct a review of eligibility not less than once every two years. Allows any United States person aggrieved by an order of the Administrator to seek judicial review of such order. Authorizes the President, for reasons of national security or national defense, to exempt any United States person from the provisions of this joint resolution for a period not exceeding ninety days. Provides that any such exemption may be renewed by the President for a period not exceeding an additional ninety days, and that thereafter no additional exemption may be granted to the same United States person for a period of two years. Requires the Administrator to furnish any United States person with a copy of the charge and to make a preliminary investigation of the charge whenever it is charged in writing under oath by any person, real or corporate, in a statement setting forth the facts upon which it is based, or a written charge has been filed by a member of the Advisory Board where he has reasonable cause to believe, that a United States person having a major investment in South Africa or affiliated with an entity doing business in South Africa, who is entering or has entered into a contract with any agency of the United States Government, is not doing business in South Africa in accordance with fair employment practices. Provides that, if the Administrator determines that the charge is nonfrivolus, he shall set the matter for hearing as speedily as possible, and make a finding and issue an appropriate order in accordance with the provision of this joint resolution. Requires the Administrator to submit to the President and to the Congress an annual report, including a report of the Advisory Board, on the operations and activities under this joint resolution."
