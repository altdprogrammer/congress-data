    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Provides that the people of the several States and the District of Columbia shall be the electors of the President and Vice President. Requires each elector to cast a single vote for two persons who shall have consented to the joining of their names on the ballot. Allows each State to adopt less restrictive voting requirements for the offices of President and Vice President than for the Congressional offices from that State. Permits Congress to adopt uniform residence and age requirements for voting in such elections. Authorizes Congress to prescribe the qualifications for electors from the District of Columbia. Provides that persons joined as candidates for President and Vice President who shall have received the greatest number of votes shall be declared elected President and Vice President, if such number be at least 40 percent of the total number of votes certified. Provides that if none of the persons joined as candidates for President and Vice President shall have at least 40 percent of the total number of votes certified, a runoff election shall be held between the two pairs joined as candidates for President and Vice President who shall have received the highest number of votes certified. Requires Congress to determine the days of such elections. Allows the States to determine the times, places, and manner of holding such elections. Authorizes Congress to prescribe by law the time, place, and manner in which the results of such elections shall be ascertained and declared. Permits Congress to provide, by law, for the case of the death or withdrawal of any candidate or candidates, for the death of both the President-elect and Vice-President-elect, and for the case of a tie."
