States that if it is decided that the invocation is not well taken, the officer or employee shall be ordered to appear, answer questions, and produce any documents or other matter requested. Provides that when the Congress, either House of Congress, joint committee, or subcommittee unholds or denies the invocation of executive privilege, it shall within ten days file a resolution with a report and record of its proceedings relating to such invocation of executive privilege. Requires Congress to take proper action with respect to the disposition of such resolution."
