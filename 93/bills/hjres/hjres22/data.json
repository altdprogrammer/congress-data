    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Requires each State to choose a number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress; but no Senator or Representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be chosen an elector. Provides that the electors assigned to each State with its Senators shall be elected by the people thereof and that each of the electors elected by the people of a single-member electoral district formed by the legislature of the State. Requires electoral districts within each State to be of compact and contiguous territory containing substantially equal numbers of inhabitants, and to not be altered until another census of the United States has been taken. Provides that each candidate for the office of elector of President and Vice President shall file in writing under oath a declaration of the identity of the persons for whom he will vote for President and Vice President, which declaration shall be binding upon any successor to his office. Requires the voters in each State to have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature in choosing electors. Provides that the electors shall vote by signed ballot for President and Vice President one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same State with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice President; and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as Vice President, the number of votes for each, and the name and electoral district, if any, of each elector who cast his vote for each such person, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. Requires the President of the Senate to, in the presence of the Senate and the House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted. Provides that any vote cast by an elector contrary to the declaration made by him shall be counted as a vote cast in accordance with his declaration. Provides that: (1) the person having the greatest number of electoral votes for President shall be the President, and the person having the greatest number of electoral votes for Vice President shall be the Vice President, if such numbers are a majority of the whole number of electors chosen; or (2) if two persons have the same total number of electoral votes, which number is one-half of the whole number of electors chosen, the person having the greatest number of votes cast by electors chosen from electoral districts shall be President, or Vice President, as the case may be. Provides that if no person voted for as President or Vice President has such a majority, then from the persons having the three highest numbers of votes for such office, the Senate and House of Representatives together, each member having one vote, shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President or Vice President. Provides that if an additional ballot is necessary, the choice on the second ballot shall be between the two persons having the highest numbers of votes on the first ballot. Gives Congress the power to carry this article into effect by appropriate legislation. Provides that this Amendment supersedes the second and third paragraphs of section 1, aritcle II, of the Constitution, the twelfth article of amendment to the Constitution, and section 4 of the twentieth article of amendment to the Constitution. Requires electors appointed pursuant to the twenty-third article of amendment to this Constitution to be elected by the people of such district in such manner as the Congress may direct and requires candidates for elector and electors of such district to have the same obligations, and to perform the same duties, as candidates for elector and electors of the several States under this article."
