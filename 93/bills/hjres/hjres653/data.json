Provides that within seventy-two hours after enlarging U.S. Armed Forces in any foreign nation the President shall submit a report to Congress setting forth: (1) the circumstances necessitating his action; (2) the constitutional and legislative provisions under the authority of which he took such action; (3) the estimated scope of activities; and (4) such other information as the President may deem useful to the Congress in the fulfillment of its constitutional responsibilities with respect to placing or enlarging United States Armed Forces abroad. Requires that, within one hundred and twenty calender days after a report is submitted, the President shall remove such enlargement and terminate such placement of Armed Forces, unless the Congress enacts a specific authorization for such use of the Armed Forces."
