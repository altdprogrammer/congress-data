Provides that the term of office of a Representative shall be four years. Stipulates that if a Member of the House of Representatives is a candidate for the Senate of the United States for a term commencing in the calendar year in which a presidential term begins, the term of such Member shall end at noon on the third of January of the year in which such presidential term begins and the Member shall not be eligible to serve in the House of Representatives for two years from such date.
