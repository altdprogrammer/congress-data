Provides that beginning on the date of enactment of this resolution, such limitation shall not apply to the importation of crude oil or number 2 fuel oil (home heating oil) until the ninety-first day after the date of enactment of this resolution (in the case of crude oil) or April 1, 1974 (in the case of number 2 fuel oil)."
