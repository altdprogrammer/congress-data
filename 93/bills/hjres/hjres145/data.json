    "text": "Establishes a joint congressional committee which shall be known as the Joint Committee on Environment and Technology consisting of nineteen members of the Senate to be designated by the President of the Senate, and twenty-one Members of the House of Representatives to be designated by the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Provides that no legislative measure shall be referred to the committee, and it shall have no authority to report any such measure to the Senate or to the House of Representatives. Makes it the duty of the committee to: (1) conduct a continuing comprehensive study and review of the character and extent of environmental and technological changes that may occur in the future and their effect on population, communities, and industries, including but not limited to the effects of such changes on the need for public and private planning and investment in housing, water resources (including oceanography), pollution control, food supplies, education, automation affecting interstate commerce, fish and wildlife, forestry, mining communications, transportation power supplies, welfare and other services and facilities; (2) study methods of using all practicable means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to foster, promote, create, and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans; (3) develop policies that would encourage maximum private investment in means of improving environmental quality; and (4) review any recommendations made by the President (including the Environmental Quality Report required to be submitted pursuant to section 201 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969) relating to environmental policy. Gives the Committee necessary powers, authorizes necessary appropriations, and requires the committee to report its findings to the Congress."
