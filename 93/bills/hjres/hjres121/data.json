    "text": "Establishes a 21 Member Commission to be known as the Commission for Re-establishing Constitutional Principles. Directs the Commission to study the decisions and orders, including dissenting opinions, of the United States Supreme Court and the decisions and orders of any other Federal court resulting from such Supreme Court decisions and orders, rendered during the twelve years preceding the date of enactment of this joint resolution to determine: (1) the extent to which such decisions and orders have hindered or prevented Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies from performing their functions and consequently endangered persons and property in the United States and contributed to an increase in violations of law, including mob violence; and (2) the extent to which the United States Supreme Court has usurped the authority and powers of the legislative and executive branches of the Federal Government granted by the Constitution, including the powers retained to the States and thereby to the people under the Constitution. Requires the Commission to submit a comprehensive report of its studies to the Congress and to the President, together with recommendations as to such action as may be required to prevent further usurpation by one branch of the Federal Government of the authority and powers of another and to restore to the appropriate branch of the Federal Government such powers and authority as may have been usurped, including such proposed administrative actions, legislative enactments, and constitutional amendments as in its judgment are necessary to carry out its recommendations. Requires the Commission to submit interim reports on the results of its studies every six months. Grants the Commission necessary powers."
