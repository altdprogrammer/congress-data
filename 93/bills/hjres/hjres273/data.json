    "text": "Declares that the Congress recognizes that late appropriations of funds for Federal educational programs create a severe and growing burden upon State and local school systems and institutions of higher learning and inhibit adequate planning for the wise and effective use of such funds; that in order to overcome these difficulties educational officials must have notice of the availability of Federal funds well in advance of the beginning of a new school or college year; and that the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate are hereby requested to report to their respective bodies a bill or bills, appropriating funds for educational assistance programs, not later than April 1 of the year preceding the beginning of the fiscal year for which such funds are authorized to be appropriated. Prescribes the sums to be appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare for each fiscal year."
