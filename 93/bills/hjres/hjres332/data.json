Provides that, in time of war or national emergency, as declared by the Congress, the application of this Amendment may be suspended by a concurrent resolution which has passed the Senate and the House of Representatives by an affirmative vote of three-fourths of the authorized membership of each such House. Makes such suspension effective for the two-year term of the Congress which passes such resolution. Prohibits an increase in the national debt. Provides that such debt, as it exists on the date on which this article is ratified, shall be repaid during the one-hundred-year period beginning with the first fiscal year which begins after the date on which this article is ratified at the rate of one-tenth of such debt during each ten-year interval of such one-hundred-year period."
