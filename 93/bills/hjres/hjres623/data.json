Declares that this policy is so essential to the assurance of a sound economy, within which framework all goals of the people are sought, that it merits equal consideration with other national objectives. Directs the Joint Economic Committee to make and furnish such studies, reports, and recommendations on proposed legislation with respect to the policies set forth in this Resolution as may be requested by any standing committee of the Senate or House of Representatives having such legislation before it."
