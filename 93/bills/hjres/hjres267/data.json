Provides that no declaration of war shall be deemed sufficient authorization for this purpose unless such authorization is specifically included therein. Requires the President, in asking for such authorization, to provide the Congress with such material as will allow the Congress to judge the necessity of granting this power, and to carefully describe the circumstances in which this power would be used. Provides that such authorization shall not extend beyond the circumstances for which it was specifically intended."
