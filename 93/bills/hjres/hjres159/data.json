    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Abolishes the electoral college system of electing the President and Vice President of the United States, and replaces this system with election by the people of the several States and the District of Columbia. Entitles each State to the number of electoral votes equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which such State may be entitled in Congress. Provides that each State's official custodian of election returns shall make distinct lists of all persons for whom votes were cast for President and the number of votes cast for each, and shall transmit these lists to the President of the Senate so that the votes may be counted. Directs the crediting of each person for whom votes were cast for President with such proportion of the electoral votes of a State as he received of the total vote of the electors therein for President. States that in making the computations, fractional members less than one one-thousandth shall be disregared unless a more detailed calculation would change the result of the election. Provides that the person having the greatest number of electoral votes for President shall be President, and that if two or more persons have an equal and the highest number of such votes, then the one for whom the greatest number of popular votes were cast shall be President. Repeals the provisions of section I, article II, of the Constitution, preceding the fourth paragraph, and the twelfth and twenty-third articles of amendment to the Constitution."
