    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Provides that the people of the several States and the District constituting the seat of government of the United States shall elect the President and Vice President. Provides that each elector shall cast a single vote for two persons who shall have consented to the joining of their names as candidates for the offices of President and Vice President, but stipulates that no candidate shall consent to the joinder of his name with that of more than one other person. Provides that, unless Congress provides otherwise, the electors of President and Vice President in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature, or such less restrictive qualifications as the State legislatures may prescribe. States that the pair of persons having the greatest number of votes for President and Vice President shall be elected, if such number be at least 40 percent of the whole number of votes cast for such offices, but that if no pair of persons has such number, a runoff election shall be held in which the choice of President and Vice President shall be made from the two pairs of persons who received the highest numbers of votes. Authorizes the times places, and manner of holding such elections and entitlement to inclusion on the ballot to be prescribed in each State by the legislature thereof subject to the Congress power to make or alter such regulations. Specifies that the days for such elections shall be determined by Congress and shall be uniform throughout the United States. Authorizes the Congress, by law, to provide for the case of the death or withdrawal of any candidate for President or Vice President before a President and Vice President have been elected, and for the case of the death of both the President-elect and Vice-President-elect. Makes this article effective one year after the 21st day of January next occurring after ratification."
