    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Provides that the executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. States that he shall hold his office during the term of four years, and together with the Vice President chosen for the same term, be elected as provided in this Constitution. Provides that the President and Vice President shall be elected by the people of each State in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, and by the people of the District constituting the seat of the Government of the United States in such manner as the Congress shall by law prescribe. States that the Congress may determine the time of the election of the President and Vice President, which day shall be the same throughout the United States. Provides that, in such an election, a vote may be cast only as a joint vote for the election of two persons one of whom has consented that his name appear as candidate for President on the ballot with the name of the other as candidate for Vice President, and the other of whom has consented that his name appear as candidate for Vice President on the ballot with the name of the said candidate for President. States that no person may consent to have his name appear on the ballot with more than one other person. Provides that the official custodian of election returns in each State and in the District of Columbia shall make distinct lists of all presidential candidacies for which votes were cast, and of the number of votes in such State for each candidacy, which lists he shall sign and certify and transmit to the seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. Provides that the President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the electoral votes shall be computed in the manner provided in this amendment. Entitles each State to a number of electoral votes for each of the offices of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which such State may be entitled in the Congress. Entitles the District to a number of electoral votes for each such office equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State. Provides that, in the case of each State and the District, the presidential candidacy receiving the greatest number of votes shall be entitled to the whole number of the electoral votes of such State or District. Provides that, if a presidential candidacy receives a plurality of at least 40 percent of the electoral votes, the persons comprising such candidacy shall be the President-elect and the Vice-President-elect. States that, if no presidential candidacy receives a plurality of at least 40 percent of the electoral votes, a run-off election shall be conducted, in such manner as the Congress shall by law prescribe, between the two presidential candidacies which received the greatest number of electoral votes. Provides that the Congress shall by law provide procedures to be followed in consequence of the death or withdrawal of a candidate on or before the date of an election under this article, or in the case of a tie. States that this article shall not apply to any election of the President or Vice President for a term of office beginning earlier than one year after the date of ratification of this article."
