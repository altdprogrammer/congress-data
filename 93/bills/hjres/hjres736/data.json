Requires the Architect of the Capitol to review such report and submit the same, with his recommendations, to the Speaker and majority and minority leaders of the House of Representatives and to the U.S. Senate Commission on Art and Antiquities. Provides that if the project, as presented, with or without modifications, meets with the approval of such House and Senate officials, the Architect of the Capitol, notwithstanding any other provision of law, is authorized after such approval to accept gifts and expend funds to carry out this joint resolution."
