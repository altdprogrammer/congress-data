Directs the committees to report the results to their respective Houses and make recommendations to the appropriate branches of Government concerning the best way to resolve the impasse in the negotiations. Prohibits, in the interim, aid to North Vietnam or any other government supported by insurgent Communist forces in Southeast Asia, until the conflict concerning the missing, captured, or dead in the Vietnam conflict is resolved to the satisfaction of Congress. Requires that inquiries shall be made of all nations in the vicinity of Vietnam concerning any Americans being held in any nation as a result of the Vietnam conflict."
