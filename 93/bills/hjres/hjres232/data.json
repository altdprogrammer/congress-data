    "text": "Establishes a Commission to be known as the Commission on Philippine Guerrilla Recognition. Directs the Commission to undertake a thorough investigation and study with respect to: (1) the number of natives of the Philippines who were dropped from the Revised Reconstructed Roster of Recognized Guerrillas of 1948, and estimated to have served as guerrillas during the Japanese occupation; (2) the criteria used, both immediately after World War II and at the time the roster was closed, in determining whether or not service as a Philippine guerrilla was \"recognized\" for purposes of entitlement to United States veterans' benefits; and (3) the availability of reliable data, from the United States Army, appropriate Philippine agencies, and elsewhere, with respect to making, at the present time, determinations of actual guerrilla service during World War II, on the basis of the criteria. Provides that the Commission be composed of three Members to be appointed by the President. Grants the Commission necessary powers and authorizes necessary appropriations to carry out this Act."
