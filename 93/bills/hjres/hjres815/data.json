States that the Special Prosecutor shall have primary authority to prosecute any offense against the United States: (1) arising out of the unauthorized entry into Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate; (2) arising out of any campaign with respect to the election in 1972 for the office of President. Provides that the Special Prosecutor may be removed from office by the Attorney General of the United States for gross impropriety, gross misconduct, gross dereliction of duty, or for violation of this Act, but for no other cause. Requires the Attorney General to give thirty days notice in writing to the Congress of his intention to remove the Special Prosecutor, setting forth in detail the grounds for such removal."
