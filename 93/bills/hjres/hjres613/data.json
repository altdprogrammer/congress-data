    "text": "Establishes a Joint Committee on Classified Information to be composed of: (1) the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Armed Services Committees of the Senate and of the House of Representatives; (2) the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate; (3) the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives; (4) the chairman and ranking minority member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate and of the House of Representatives; (5) three other Members of the Senate appointed by the President of the Senate; and (6) three other Members of the House of Representatives appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Provides that the joint committee shall make continuing investigations and studies with respect to: (1) the practices and methods used in the executive branch to classify information in the interests of the common defense and security, and (2) suspected uses of such classification procedures within the executive branch for purposes contrary to the public welfare. Authorizes the joint committee to, at such times as it finds classification procedures being used for purposes contrary to the public welfare, initiate such action as it deems appropriate in order to prohibit such misuse; and to publicly disclose any classified information the classification of which the joint committee considers not to be merited in the interests of the common defense and security and the disclosure of which the joint committee considers to be in the public interest. Requires the joint committee to report to the Senate and the House of Representatives, from time to time, the results of its investigations and studies, together with such recommendations as it may deem desirable. Provides that the expenses of the joint committee shall be paid one-half from the contingent fund of the House of Representatives and one-half from the contingent fund of the Senate, upon vouchers signed by the chairman of the joint committee."
