    "text": "Establishes the territorial sea of the United States as extending five nautical miles from the coastline of the United States. Provides that in the case of any coastal country which claims a territorial sea extending more than five nautical miles from its coastline, the territorial sea of the United States shall be equal in distance to that claimed by such other country, but not to exceed twelve nautical miles. Provides that any extension of the territorial sea beyond five nautical miles shall not result in any extension of the fisheries zone. Provides that if the President of the United States determines that any portion of the territorial sea as extended by this Act conflicts with that of another country he may make modifications thereof. Makes it the sense of the Congress that the President consider taking appropriate initiative through the United Nations to convene an international conference for the purpose of establishing a universally recognized seaward boundary for the territorial seas of all coastal countries."
