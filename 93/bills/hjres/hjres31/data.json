    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Provides that the President and Vice President shall be chosen in an election by the people of the several States and the District constituting the seat of Government of the United States. Provides that in such an election, a vote may be cast only as a joint vote for the election of two persons, one of whom has consented that his name appear as candidate for President on the ballot with the name of the other as candidate for Vice President, and the other of whom has consented that his name appear as candidate for Vice President on the ballot with the name of the said candidate for President. Provides that where a presidential candidacy receives a plurality of at least 50 percent of the votes cast, the persons comprising such candidacy shall become the President and the Vice-President-elect. Provides that in the event that no candidacy receives 50 percent of the votes, a further election shall be held in which the people of the several States and the District constituting the seat of government of the United States shall choose between the two candidates receiving the largest number of votes. Provides that the Congress shall have power to provide by law for the manner in which the candidacies to appear on the ballot shall be determined, the places at which and the manner in which the election shall be held, and the manner in which its outcome shall be determined. Provides that the qualifications for voters in any State in any election under this amendment shall be the same as apply in the case of voters in such State in elections of Senators, except that the Congress may by law prescribe uniform qualifications as to age and residence. Provides that whenever no qualification so prescribed by Congress as to residence is in effect, any State may prescribe a residence qualification less restrictive than that which applies in such a State with respect to voters in elections of Senators."
