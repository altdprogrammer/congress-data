Vests the Chief Judge of the United States District Court with authority to appoint a Special Prosecutor for the purposes and with the powers set forth in this Act, and to replace such officer only for extraordinary improprieties in the exercise of his responsibilities. Sets forth the authority and responsibilities of the Special Prosecutor. States that the prosecutor shall have exclusive authority to conduct all grand jury presentments and all other criminal proceedings arising from the following acts or transactions: (1) offenses arising out of the unauthorized entry into Democratic National Committee Headquarters at the Watergate; (2) offenses arising out of the 1972 Presidential election; (3) allegations of criminal offenses involving the President, members of the White House Staff, or other Presidential appointees; and (4) such other matters as bear a relation to the foregoing and which the Special Prosecutor consents to accept. Sets forth powers of the Special Prosecutor, including: (1) the power to determine whether and how far to contest the assertion of executive privilege or any other testimonial or evidentiary privilege, and (2) the power to decide whether or not to prosecute any person and how to conduct and argue any appeals or petitions arising out of his prosecutorial activities. Authorizes the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to extend the term of the Grand Jury of that Court which was impaneled on June 5, 1972, for additional periods of six months, until the court determines that the business of that Grand Jury has been completed. Authorizes to be appropriated to the office of the Special Prosecutor such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
