Requires the Secretary of Commerce to take such action as he deems necessary to insure that the data acquired from the 1974 Census of Agriculture be made available to the public through appropriate publication as soon as practicable following the taking of the census, and in all events in a shorter period than data was made available to the public following the 1964 and 1969 censuses of agriculture."
