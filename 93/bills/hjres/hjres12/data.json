    "text": "Authorizes the President to appoint by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a chief judge and two associate judges who shall constitute a court of record known as the United States Court of Ethics. Provides that the court: (1) shall hear complaints of unehtical conduct by Federal officers and employees if it determines that such a hearing is of sufficient public interest and importance to be warranted, and (2) shall render a decision on whether specified ethical principles have been violated. Stipulates that if the court determines that there is probable cause for believing that any person is guilty of an act or omission which violates any law of the United States, it shall forward a copy of its decision and all facts pertinent thereto to the Attorney General of the United States. Provides, upon determination of a violation, for the forwarding of a copy of the decision to the head of the Federal Government agency, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate, or a judge of the court concerned, depending on the position and place of employment of the Federal employee. Authorizes appropriate and permissible disciplinary action by the person notified with respect to the officer or employee guilty of a violation. Requires all decisions of the Court of Ethics to be published, and provides for review of decisions by the United States Courts of Appeal."
