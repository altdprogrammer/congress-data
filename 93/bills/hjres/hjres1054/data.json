Authorizes the Administrator of General Services to provide for the care, maintenance, repair, improvement, alteration, and furnishing of the official residence and grounds. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary from time to time to carry out the foregoing purposes. Expresses the sense of Congress that living accommodations, generally equivalent to those available to the highest ranking officer on active duty in each of the other military services, should be provided for the Chief of Naval Operations. Repeals the Federal law authorizing the planning, design, construction, furnishing, and maintenance of an official residence for the Vice President of the United States."
