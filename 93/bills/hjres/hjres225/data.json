    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Provides that each State shall choose a number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress. Specifies that the electors assigned to each State with its Senators shall be elected by the people thereof, and that each of the electors apportioned with its Representatives shall be elected by the people of a single-member electoral district formed by the legislature of the State. Requies each candidate for the office of elector of President and Vice President to file in writing under oath a declaration of the identity of the persons for whom he will vote for President and Vice President, which declaration shall be binding upon any successor to his office. States that the electors shall meet in their respective States, fill any vacancies in their number as directed by the State legislature, and vote by signed ballot for President and Vice President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same State with themselves. Provides that they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice President. Requires them to make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as Vice President, the number of votes for each, and the name and electoral district, if any, of each elector who cast his vote for each such person, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. Provides that the President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and the House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted. States that any vote cast by an elector contrary to the declaration made by him shall be counted as a vote cast in accordance with his declaration. Specifies that the person having the greatest number of electoral votes for President shall be the President, and the person having the greatest number of electoral votes for Vice President shall be the Vice President, if such numbers are a majority of the whole number of electors chosen. Provides that if two persons have the same total number of electoral votes, which number is one-half of the whole number of electors chosen, the person having the greatest number of votes cast by electors chosen from electoral districts shall be President, or Vice President, as the case may be. Provides that if no person voted for as President has such a majority, then from the persons having the three highest numbers of votes for President, the Senate and House of Representatives together, each member having one vote, shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. States that if no person voted for as Vice President has such a majority, then the Vice President shall be chosen from the persons having the three highest numbers of votes for Vice President in the same manner as herein provided for choosing the President. Specifies that this article supercedes the second and third paragraphs of section 1, article II, of the Constitution, the twelfth article of amendment to the Constitution, and section 4 of the twentieth article of amendment to the Constitution."
