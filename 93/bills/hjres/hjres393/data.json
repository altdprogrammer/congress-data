Extends through July 1, 1974, the time for carrying out the provisions of the Education Amendments of 1972 relating to the study of the financing of postsecondary education. Provides that the Commission shall cease to exist upon the submission of its final report except that it shall, if necessary, have a reasonable time to terminate the affairs of the Commission (but not later than June 30, 1974). Provides that if the appropriation for the fiscal year 1973 for making payments under subpart 1 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 does not exceed $385,000,000, payments under such subpart from such appropriation shall not be paid on the basis of any entitlement for any student (1) who was in attendance, as a regular student (as defined by the Commissioner of Education), at an institution of higher education prior to July 1, 1973, or (2) who is in attendance at such an institution on less than a full-time basis. Makes the provisions of this joint resolution effective on and after May 1, 1973, and such provisions shall be deemed to be enacted immediately before such date."
