Provides that the official opening time and closing time, respectively, of the polling places in the United States for appointment of electors of President and Vice President shall be as follows: 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. in the eastern standard time zone; 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. in the central standard time zone; 7 A.M. to 7 P.M. in the mountain standard time zone; and 6 A.M. to 6 P.M. in the Pacific standard time zone. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study for the Congress with legislative recommendations concerning the present operation of the Federal electoral system, examining in particular: (1) the feasibility of changing Election Day from the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, to an appropriate day in October; (2) the size, composition, and contents of ballots presently used in the States for Presidential, Senatorial, and Congressional elections, with a view toward determining whether such ballots should be altered to facilitate the operation of the Federal electoral system; and (3) the number of registered voters residing in the voting precincts of the several States, with a view toward determining whether disparities in the composition of such precincts impede the operation of the Federal electoral system. (Amends 5 U.S.C. 6103(a); 3 U.S.C. 1)"
