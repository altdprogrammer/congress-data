    "text": "Establishes the Commission To Investigate the Increase in Law Violations and To Fix Responsibility for the Breakdown in Law Enforcement, With Resulting Increase in Loss of Life and Property which shall be composed of seventeen members. Requires the Commission to study the decisions and orders, including dissenting opinions, of the United States Supreme Court and the decisions and orders of any other Federal court resulting from such Supreme Court decisions and orders, preceding the date of enactment of this joint resolution, to determine if the violation of court decided or established rules was sufficient to override the overall evidence of guilt, to the point of reversal, and the extent to which such decisions and orders have hindered or prevented Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies from performing their functions and consequently endangered persons and property in the United States and contributed to an increase in violations of law, including mob violence. Provides that the Commission shall determine and specify the causes of the breakdown in law enforcement and shall submit a comprehensive report of its studies to the Congress and to the President, together with recommendations as to such legislation as may be required to prevent further breakdown in law enforcement and in government itself. Requires the Commission to initiate or recommend the initiation of other appropriate action, where it is determined that individuals or courts have set aside general rules for the protection of society to the point of destroying or aiding in the destruction of constitutional guarantees of the safety of the general public from criminals, and criminal acts, essential to maintaining an orderly and law-abiding society. Requires the Commission to submit interim reports every six months, beginning December 31, 1973, and to submit additional reports each six months thereafter, for three successive periods or until a final report is submitted. Authorizes to be appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated such funds as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this joint resolution."
