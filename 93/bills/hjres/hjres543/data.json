Provides that any fee-paid license issued to a refiner for imports of crude oil, unfinished oils, and finished products into Districts I-IV, District V, and Puerto Rico shall require that refiners supply to small independent refiners and independent marketers crude oil, unfinished oils, and finished products in reasonable quantities and at reasonable prices based on past supply relationships."
