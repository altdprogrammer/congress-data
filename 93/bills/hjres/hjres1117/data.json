Sets forth the duties of the Commission with respect to making a comprehensive investigation and study of Indian affairs, including, but not limited to: (1) a study and analysis of the Constitution, treaties, statutes, judicial interpretations, and Executive orders to determine the attributes of the unique relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes and the land and other resources they possess; (2) a review of the policies, practices, and structure of the Federal agencies charged with protecting Indian resources and providing services to Indians including a management study of the Bureau of Indian Affairs utilizing experts from the public and private sectors; (3) an examination of the statutes and procedures for granting Federal recognition and extending services to Indian communities and individuals; (4) the collection and compilation of data necessary to understand the extent of Indian needs which presently exist or will exist in the near future; and (5) an exploration of the feasibility of alternative elective bodies which could fully represent Indians at the National level of government to provide Indians with maximum participation in policy formation and program development. Requires the Commission to appoint investigating task forces to make preliminary investigations and studies in the various areas of Indian affairs. Directs the Commission, within six months after the reports of the investigating task forces, to submit its final report, together with recommendations thereon, to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the the House of Representatives. Authorizes an appropriation of $2,500,000 to carry out the provisions of this resolution."
