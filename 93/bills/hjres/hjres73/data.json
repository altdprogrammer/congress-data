    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Provides that the official candidates of political parties for President shall be nominated at a primary election by direct popular vote. Requires each candidate for nomination to be a candidate of the party of his registered affiliation and his name shall be on that party's ballot in all States if he shall have filed a petition at the seat of the Government of the United States with the President of the Senate. Requires such petition to have been signed by at least one percent of the qualified voters in seventeen States who voted in the most recent presidential election. Recognizes a political party as one if the electors for candidates for President of such party received in any or all of the several States, an aggregate number of ten percent of the total number of votes cast in the most recent previous presidential election. Requires such primary day to be uniform throughout the United States and provides that unless Congress shall appoint a different day the primary shall be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in August of the year preceding the expiration of the regular term of President. Provides that the person receiving the greatest number of votes in each party shall be the official candidate if the number be a plurality amounting to at least forty percent of the total votes cast. States that if no person receives forty percent then Congress shall provide for a runoff to be held on the 28th day after the primary between the two persons receiving the greatest number of votes in his party. Provides for nominating a Vice Presidential candidate in the same procedure. Provides that in the event of the death or resignation or disqualification of the official candidate of any political party for President, the person nominated by such political party for Vice President shall resign the vice-presidential nomination and shall be the official candidate of such party for President. Provides that in the event of the deaths or resignations or disqualifications of the official candidates of any political party for President and Vice President, a national committee of such party shall designate such candidates, who shall then be deemed the official candidates of such party, but in choosing such candidates the vote shall be taken by States, the delegation from each State having one vote. Provides that the places and manner of holding any such primary or runoff election shall be prescribed in each State by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations. Allows Congress to provide by appropriate legislation for cases in which two or more candidates receive an equal number of votes and controversy that may arise in the counting and canvassing of the votes cast in elections held in accordance with this amendment. Gives Congress the power to enforce this amendment by appropriate legislation."
