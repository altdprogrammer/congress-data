Provides that each State shall have a number of electoral votes for President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which that State may be entitled in the Congress. Provides that the places and manner of electing the President and Vice President shall be prescribed by law in each State, but the Congress may at any time by law prescribe the places and manner of electing the President and Vice President. Provides that the people of each State shall cast their votes for the candidates for President and Vice President. Provides that the candidate for President in each State receiving the greatest number of votes shall receive that State's electoral votes for President, and the candidate for Vice President in each State receiving the greatest number of votes for Vice President shall receive that State's electoral votes for Vice President. Provides that the person receiving the greatest number of electoral votes for President shall be President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electoral votes; and the person receiving the greatest number of electoral votes for Vice President shall be Vice President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electoral votes. Provides that, if no person has a majority of the whole number of electoral votes for President or Vice President, there shall be a runoff election in which the names of the two persons with the greatest number of electoral votes for President or Vice President, as the case may be, shall appear on the ballot in each of the several States. Provides that the winner of such election shall be decided in the same manner as the election provided by sections 3 and 4 of this article. Provides that the District of Columbia, constituting the seat of government of the United States, shall have a number of electoral votes equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State. Provides that the Congress may provide by law for the determination of any case affecting the election of the President or Vice President for which provision is not made by this amendment."
