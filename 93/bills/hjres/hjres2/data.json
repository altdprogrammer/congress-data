Provides that such report shall include the following: (A) the circumstances necessitating his action; (B) the constitutional, legislative, and treaty provisions under the authority of which he took such action, together with his reasons for not seeking specific prior congressional authorization; (C) the estimated scope of activities; and (4) such other information as the President may deem useful to the Congress in the fulfillment of its constitutional responsibilities with respect to committing the Nation to war. Requires both Houses of Congress upon receipt of such a report to immediately proceed to the consideration of the question whether Congress shall authorize the use of the Armed Forces. Provides that this resolution shall take effect on the date of its enactment."
