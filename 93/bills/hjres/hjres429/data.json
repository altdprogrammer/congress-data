Requires each Senator or Representative so elected to be an inhabitant of the District and to possess the same qualifications as to age and citizenship and have the same rights, privileges, and obligations as a Senator or Representative from a State. Provides that this article shall have no affect on the provision made in the twenty-third article of amendment to the Constitution for determining the number of electors for President and Vice President to be appointed for the District. Entitles each Representative or Senator from the District to participate in the choosing of the President or Vice President in the House of Representatives or Senate under the twelfth article of amendment as if the District were a State. Grants the Congress the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."
