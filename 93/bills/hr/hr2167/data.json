Provides that any person who has been convicted and is serving a prison sentence for evading or failing to register for the draft or for evading or refusing induction in the Armed Forces of the United States after August 4, 1964, shall be released from prison if such person complies with the provisions of this Act set forth above. States that the period of military or public service required shall be reduced by any period equal to the period served by such person in prison for his conviction, but such period shall not be reduced by more than one year. States that any pending legal proceedings brought against any person as a result of his evading or failing to register for the draft or for waiting or refusing induction in the Armed Forces after August 4, 1964, shall be dismissed if such person enters into the agreement set forth above. Declares that it is the sense of Congress that the President grant a pardon to any person convicted of any offense described above if such person enters into an agreement as set forth in this Act and completes the period of service prescribed. Authorizes the Attorney General to issue such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out effectively the provisions of this Act. Requires the Secretary of Defense to promulgate and revise a listing of public service employment approved by him for purposes of this Act. States that no national of the United States shall lose his United States nationality unless and until he shall have obtained nationality or permanent status in another country."
