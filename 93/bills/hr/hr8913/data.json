Makes provisions for the waiver by the District of Columbia government of claims for overpayment of pay to an employee where the collection would be against equity and good conscience. Authorizes the Commissioner to provide transportation in emergency situations and where necessary for good cause to employees working in municipal facilities outside the District of Columbia. Repeals the provision of law which exempted the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia from the prohibition on political activities by Federal or District employees."
