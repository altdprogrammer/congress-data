    "text": "Provides that no license granted for the operation of any class of station shall be for a longer term than five years and any license granted may be revoked as hereinafter provided. States that upon the expiration of any license, upon application therefor, a renewal of such license may be granted from time to time for a term of not to exceed five years if the Federal Communications Commission finds that the public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served thereby. Provides that in any hearing for the renewal of a broadcast license an applicant for renewal who is legally, financially, and technically qualified shall be awarded the grant if such applicant shows that its broadcast service during the preceding license period has reflected a good-faith effort to serve the needs and interests of its area as represented in its immediately preceding and pending license renewal application and if it has not demonstrated a callous disregard for law or the Commission's regulations. Provides that such failure or demonstration shall be weighed against the renewal applicant."
