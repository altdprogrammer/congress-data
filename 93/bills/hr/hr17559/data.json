    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1974-12-03", 
    "text": "Emergency Refinancing Disaster Relief Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make loans to provide financial assistance to producers of agricultural commodities for the purpose of allowing them to repay natural disaster loans over a long period rather than facing the burden of providing vast amounts of agricultural products at a time when they are forced to pay off loans obtained as a result of a recent natural disaster which damaged or destroyed their operations. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to make loans in any area designated by him or by the President as a major disaster area: (1) to qualifying farmers, ranchers, or oyster planters who are citizens of the United States; and (2) to eligible private domestic corporations or partnerships engaged primarily in farming, ranching, or oyster planting. Establishes a 6 percent interest rate on emergency agricultural loans. Removes the $500,000,000 limitation on loans made from the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund for purposes of this Act."
