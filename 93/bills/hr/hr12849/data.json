    "text": "Wholesome Fish and Fishery Products Act - Declares the finding of the Congress that fish and fishery products are an important source of the Nations's total food supply. Declares that it is essential that the health and welfare of consumers be protected by assuring that fish and fishery products distributed to them are of good quality, wholesome, not adulterated, and are properly marked, labeled and packaged. Defines the terms used in the Act. Defines the term \"fish\" as meaning any aquatic animal, including amphibians, or part thereof capable of use as human food. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to make a survey of as many establishments in the United States and vessels which process fish and fishery products for interstate commerce as the Secretary deems appropriate to inform himself concerning the operations and sanitary conditions thereof for the purpose of developing adequate standards of good manufacturing practices under which such establishments and vessels shall be maintained and operated. Directs the Secretary to prescribe standards of sanitation and quality control for the processing of fish and fishery products which shall be applicable to persons covered by this Act. Directs the Secretary to cause to be made a continuous inspection of each establishment where fish or fishery products are processed for interstate commerce. Authorizes the Secretary to require that adequate inspections be made, by inspectors appointed for that purpose, of vessels processing fish or fishery products for interstate commerce. Provides that any inspector appointed for the purpose of this Act shall at any time have access to any establishment or vessel where fish or fishery products are processed for interstate commerce. States that denial of access to such inspector shall be ground for suspension of the certificate of registration. Provides that any fish or fishery products found to be adulterated shall be immediately condemned, segregated, and destroyed for food purposes by said establishment or vessel in the presence of an inspector. Places restrictions upon the importation of fish into the United States. Provides that after the effective date of regulations issued under this Act no fish or fishery products shall be imported into the United States if such articles are adulterated or misbranded or otherwise fail to comply with all the inspection, good manufacturing practice, and other provisions of this Act and regulations issued thereunder applicable to such articles in commerce within the United States. Enumerates the exceptions to such rule. Authorizes the Secretary to prohibit the importation of any fish or fishery products manufactured, processed, packed, or held in any factory, warehouse, establishment, or vessel which refuses to allow reasonable inspection upon the request of any officer or employee authorized therefor by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe the terms and conditions of the destruction of all such articles which are imported contrary to this Act, (1) unless they are exported by the consignee within the time fixed therefor by the Secretary, or (2) in the case of articles which are not in compliance with this Act solely because of misbranding, such articles are brought into compliance with the Act under supervision of authorized repersentatives of the Secretary. Provides that any person who violates this Act shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. Provides that if such violation involves intent to defraud, or any distribution or attempted distribution of an article that is adulterated, such person shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
