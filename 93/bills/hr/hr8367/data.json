Requires the President, in case of an emergency, to report to the Congress in writing, as expeditiously as possible, the commitment of the Armed Forces to combat. Provides that not later than 90 days after the receipt of the President's report, the Congress shall either approve or disapprove the President's action. States that, upon approval of the President's action, the President shall report to the Congress at intervals of not more than 6 months as to the status of the situation; and that upon disapproval the President shall discontinue the action, shall report to the Congress, and shall withdraw the Armed Forces involved as expeditiously as possible. Declares that, in the absence of Congressional legislation, such failure to act on the part of the Congress shall be taken to be an approval of the President's action. Includes the Panama Canal Zone as a territory or possession of the United States. Takes effect on the date of enactment, but does not apply to current hostilities."
