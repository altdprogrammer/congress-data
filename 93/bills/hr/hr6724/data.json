    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1973-04-09", 
    "text": "Establishes the Joint Committee on National Security: (1) to enable Congress to more effectively carry out its constitutional responsibility in the formulation of foreign, domestic and military policies; (2) to provide an improved means for formulating legislation and providing for integration of cooperation with the executive branch to further promote the security of the United States; and (3) to improve the means of rapidly responding to and participating in decisions to commit the Nation to war and the use of United States Armed Forces abroad. Specifies that the committee shall be convened within 24 hours in any case where the President, without prior authorization of Congress and in the absence of a declaration of war by Congress, commits: (1) United States military forces to armed conflict; (2) commits military forces to the territory of a foreign nation except for those instances in which such commitment is for humanitarian or training purposes, or (3) substantially enlarges military forces already located in a foreign nation. Directs the committee to consult with the President on issues and reasons surrounding any of the above decisions. Forbids the committee from reporting legislation to the floor of either House, but authorizes the transmittal of proposed legislation to the appropriate committees of the Congress, together with recommendations it deems to be necessary. Authorizes the joint committee to make expenditures, employ personnel, adopt rules and procedures, hold hearings, sit and act at anytime or place, subpena witnesses, procure printing and binding, procure the services of consultants and to provide assistance for training a professional staff, to use facilities of other agencies and to take depositions and other testimony. Requires a vote of a majority of the committee before policies may be undertaken. Provides that a subpena may be issued upon the signature of the chairman of the committee and that any member may administer oaths to witnesses. Provides that with the consent of any standing select or special committee of the Congress the joint committee may utilize the service of any staff member of such committee whenever the chairman of the joint committee determines that such services are necessary and appropriate. Provides that members of the committee shall receive a per diem allowance for expenses to be paid from the contingent fund of the House."
