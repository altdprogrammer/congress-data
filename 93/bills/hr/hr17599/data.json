States that such orders and regulations shall provide for: (1) the making of such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent gross inequities; (2) wage and salary increases or adjustments, after April 30, 1974, based on the application of cost of living and productivity formulas; (3) price, rent, or interest rate increases or adjustments, after April 30, 1974, based on cost or productivity increases; and (4) profit or dividend increases, after April 30, 1974, attributable to increased productivity, efficiency, or sales or revenues. Provides that the President may delegate the performance of any function under this Act to such officers, departments and agencies of the United States as he may deem appropriate. Stipulates that, not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the President or his delegate shall transmit to the Congress a plan setting forth detailed proposals for the implementation of the authority conferred by this Act, including specific descriptions of the manner in which such authority would be exercised and the organizational and administrative provisions which would be used. States that the plan required under this Act shall: (1) be generally fair and equitable; (2) provide for a comparable level of control of all sectors of the economy; and (3) impose comparable duties and sacrifices on individuals and organizations in all segments of the economy."
