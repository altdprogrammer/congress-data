Provides that if the Committee, to which a resolution has been referred disapproving the recommendations of the President. Provides that the House has not reported the resolution after ten calendar days, it is in order to discharge the committee from further consideration of the resolution. Directs that such motion to discharge may be made only by an individual favoring the resolution and debate thereon is limited to not more than one hour divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. Directs that the motion to discharge may not be renewed, nor may another motion to discharge the committee be made with respect to any other resolution concerning the same recommendations. Specifies that when the committee has reported, or has been discharged from the further consideration of such resolution, it is in order to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. Stipulates that such motion is not debatable and may not be amended. Limits debate on the resolution to not more than two hours to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. Provides that motions to postpone, motions to proceed to the consideration of other business and appeals from the decisions of the chair shall be decided without debate. Authorizes any part of the recommendations of the President, in accordance with express provisions of such recommendations, to be made operative on a date later than a date on which such recommendations otherwise are to take effect.
