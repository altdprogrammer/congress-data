Provides that for the purpose of assuring that the apportionment of Representatives among the States will be made on the basis of the most accurate and realistic population count possible, and thereby assuring equitable representation in Congress for all, the Secretary of Commerce shall: (1) conduct a study of the methods used in counting military personnel, students, Government employees, and other mobile segments of the population; (2) establish appropriate guidelines for such methods; and (3) investigate inconsistencies between census-taking methods used in different areas and take such action as may be necessary to end such inconsistencies. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on the results of such study and to make such recommendations for legislation as he deems necessary."
