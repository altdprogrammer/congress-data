    "text": "International Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act - States that Federal departments and agencies shall take all appropriate actions within their jurisdiction to attempt to eliminate discriminatory and unfair competitive practices against United States air carriers in the international air transportation industry. Provides for compensatory charges to be imposed on foreign air carriers of the Country concerned if discriminatory charges against United States air carriers are not reduced or eliminated within a reasonable time after negotiations are undertaken for such purpose. States that the amounts so collected shall be used to compensate such air carriers for the excessive or discriminatory charges paid by them to the foreign countries involved. Provides that the Postmaster General shall not authorize a higher rate of compensation for the transportation by foreign carriers of mail between the United States and such foreign country as that country pays to air carriers transporting its mail by aircraft between such country and the United States. Requires that the government-financed air transportation of passengers and property be provided by air carriers holding certificates under the Federal Aviation Act to the extent practicable."
