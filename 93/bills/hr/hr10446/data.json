Sets forth specified standards to be followed in entering into and renewing such contracts of employment. Provides that the status of an alien admitted to the United States under this Act shall terminate when the employment with the petitioning employer of such alien ends. Requires such employer to notify the Attorney General in writing, within three days after the alien ceases such employment, that the employment of such alien has ended. Directs said employer to provide notification of termination to the alien at his last known address not less than two weeks prior to the termination date. States that any employer who fails to furnish written notice to the Attorney General, as required by this Act, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not to exceed $200 or be imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both. Title II: Immigrants - Requires an immigrant alien to maintain a permanent residence as a condition for entering and remaining as an immigrant of the United States."
