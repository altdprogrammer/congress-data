    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1973-03-01", 
    "text": "Sets forth the Congressional finding that the construction and operation of large-scale offshore structures, both fixed and floating, designed to be used as ports, terminals, powerplants, airports, research platforms, or for other purposes (1) are presently planned; (2) involve interstate and foreign commerce, fisheries and wildlife, and navigation; and (3) will affect U.S. citizens and the marine environment over a broad geographical area. Prohibits the construction or operation of such structure until the Secretary of Commerce shall have certified that the activity involved will not result in an unacceptably adverse compact on the marine environment, and that all possible precautions have been taken to minimize any adverse impact that may result. Sets forth criteria to be considered by the Secretary, in his evaluation including: (1) the need for siting such structure offshore; (2) the effect of such structure on human health and welfare, on fish and wildlife resources, on ocean patterns and shorelines, and on scientific study and navigation; (3) the dangers to such structure occasioned by waves and weather; and (4) such other considerations as deemed appropriate. Requires copies of any communications, reports, or information received or sent by any applicant for certification to be made available to the public upon identifiable request, and at reasonable cost, unless such information relates to a trade secret. States that in considering the effect of any proposed structure on navigation, the Secretary shall consult with and obtain the views of the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating. Provides that no action taken pursuant to this Act shall relieve or immunize any person from any other requirements imposed by Federal, State, or local laws. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act, and authorizes U.S. district courts to grant injunctive relief. Authorizes appropriations of $1,000,000 annually for fiscal years 1974-1976 to carry out this Act."
