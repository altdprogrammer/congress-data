Provides that the use or the Armed Forces of the United States in hostilities in the absence of a declaration of war or specific authorization by Congress shall be reported promptly, and in no event later than twenty-four hours after the commencement of hostilities, in writing by the President to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, together with: (1) a full account of the circumstances under which such hostilities were initiated; and (2) the constitutional and treaty authority for his action, and his reasons for not seeking prior Congressional approval; and (3) the estimated scope of such hostilities. Provides that the authority of the President to direct or authorize U.S. Armed Forces to engage in armed conflict outside the U.S., in the absence of a declaration of war or specific authorization of the Congress, shall terminate upon the adoption by either House of the Congress of a resolution disapproving continuance of the action taken."
