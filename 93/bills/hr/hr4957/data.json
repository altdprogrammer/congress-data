    "text": "Includes the interference with the right of employees to organize, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively, and to engage in other concerted activities or interference with or denial of their right to refrain from any or all of such activities within the findings and the purpose of the National Labor Relations Act. Asserts that inequality of bargaining power between labor organizations and employers substantially burdens the process of collective bargaining and affects the flow of commerce. States that experience has proven that protection by law of the right of employees to determine whether they wish to organize and bargain collectively encourages practices fundamental to the friendly adjustment of industrial disputes arising out of the differences as to wages, hours, or other working conditions. Declares it to be the policy of the United States under the Act to eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have occurred by protecting the right of employees to exercise by workers of full freedom of choice in determining whether they wish to designate collective bargaining representatives and, when such representatives have been designated, by encouraging the settlement of industrial disputes through free collective bargaining for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment. (Amends 29 U.S.C. 151)"
