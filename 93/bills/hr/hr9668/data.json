    "text": "Congressional Election Campaign Fund Act - Provides that in order to be eligible to receive any payments from the Congressional Election Campaign Fund (to be established on the books of the Treasury) a candidate of a political party in a congressional election shall, in writing, agree to keep and furnish to the supervisory officer (Secretary of the Senate or Clerk of the House of Representatives) such records, books, and other information as he may request; and agree to an audit and examination by the supervisory officer. Requires that a candidate of a major party shall certify that he and his committees will not incur qualified campaign expenses in excess of the aggregate payment to which he is entitled from the fund. Sets forth procedures and requirements by which candidates of minor parties may receive payments from the fund. Provides that no candidate of any party, including candidates for President and Vice President, or authorized committees of such candidates shall accept contributions to defray qualified campaign expenses. Provides that an eligible candidate of a major party in a congressional election shall be entitled to payments from the fund in the aggregate to the greater of: (1) 20 cents multiplied by the voting age population of the geographical area in which the election for such office is held; or (2) $175,000 if the congressional office sought is from a State that is entitled to only one Representative, or $90,000 if from a State that is entitled to more than one Representative. Requires congressional candidates to pay to the fund an amount equal to the sum of such expenses they incur in excess of the payments they are entitled to from the fund. Requires congressional candidates to furnish to the supervisory officer a detailed statement of qualified campaign expenses from time to time and more frequently as the election day approaches. Authorizes the supervisory officer to instutute judicial proceedings, including petition for declaratory or injunctive relief, to enforce the provisions of this Act. Prescribes a $5,000 fine, imprisonment of one year, or both for incurring excess campaign expenses. Prescribes a $10,000 fine and five years imprisonment or both, for using payments for other than legitimate campaign uses; furnishing false information to the supervisory officer, or giving or accepting kickbacks in connection with any qualified campaign expense. Prohibits non-authorized committees of candidates from incurring expenses in excess of $1,000. Establishes a Congressional Election Campaign Fund Advisory Board to assist the supervisory officer, which shall consist of the majority and minority leader of the Senate and the Speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives who shall serve ex-officio, two members representing each major political party and three members representing the public. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this title. Provides for this Act to take effect January 1, 1975."
