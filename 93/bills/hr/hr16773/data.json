States that, before issuance of such certificate, environmental considerations and the need for energy domestically shall be weighed before the Secretary of the Interior makes his finding. Provides that no carrier granted the power of eminent domain under this Act shall transport any coal in which it has any ownership interest. Provides procedures for making application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for antitrust review, and for enforcement under this Act. Provides a maximum fine of $10,000, six months in jail, or both, for the violation of any provision of, or regulation issued pursuant to, this Act."
