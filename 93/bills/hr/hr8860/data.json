Extends the wheat set-aside program under the Agriculture Act for 4 years. Provides for a program for the 1974 crops of wheat under which: (1) marketing certificates would not be issued to producers or, effective January 1, 1974, required to be purchased by processors; (2) if the higher of the level or average market price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year should be less than an \"established\" price of $2.05 per bushel, adjusted for 1975 and subsequent years to reflect changes in production costs, a government payment would be made to producers on each farm equal to the difference between such higher loan or average price and such established price multiplied by the projected yield of the farm acreage allotment; (3) the Secretary could permit guar, castor beans, or other crop to be counted as wheat for the purpose of preserving the farm wheat acreage allotment; and (4) the national acreage allotment would be calculated to cover both domestic consumption and exports, but would be apportioned among States, counties, and farms in the same manner as now provided for the national domestic allotment. Permits the Secretary to make payments to assist in carrying out practices on set-aside acres for pest and erosion control and the promotion of wildlife habitat. Makes the provision requiring that the projected yield not be less than the producer's proven yield inapplicable to wheat. Provides for release without penalty of wheat stored to avoid penalty..

Authorizes the Secretary to permit guar, castor beans, or other crop to be counted as feed grains for the purpose of preserving the farm acreage allotment. Calculates the national acreage allotment to cover both domestic consumption and exports, and provides that such allotment would be distributed among States, counties, and farms in essentially the same manner as now provided for the farm feed grain bases. Permits the Secretary to make payments to assist in carrying out practices on set-aside acres for pest and erosion control and the promotion of wildlife habitat. Provides for a set-aside program for the 1974 through 1977 crops of cotton. Provides that if the higher of the loan or the average spot market price during the first five months of the marketing year should be less than an \"established\" price of 38 cents per pound, adjusted for 1975 and subsequent years to reflect changes in production costs, a government payment would be made to producers on each farm equal to the difference between such higher loan or average price and such established price multiplied by the projected yeild of the farm acreage allotment. States that, in the case of farmers prevented from conserving crop, such payment would not be less than one-third of such established price. Authorizes the Secretary to permit guar, castor beans, sesame, crambe, or any crop to be counted as cotton for the purpose of preserving the farm acreage allotment.
