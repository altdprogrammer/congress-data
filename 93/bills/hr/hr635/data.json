    "text": "Pollution Control Tax Act - Imposes a tax under the Internal Revenue Code on the discharge of taxable items by any source of pollution into the atmosphere or into or upon the navigable waters of the United States or the oceans. Requires the tax to be paid by: (1) the operator of the source in the case of a stationary source, or (2) by the manufacturer or importer of the source, in the case of an unstationary source. Defines the term \"taxable item\" for purposes of this Act. Provides that such item shall include: (1) any substance discharged into water which results in biochemical oxygen demand, (2) any suspended solid discharged into water, (3) any thermal discharged into water, (4) any toxic waste discharged into water, (5) any sulfur oxide, (6) any nitrogen oxide, (7) any hydrocarbon, (8) any carbon monoxide, (9) asbestos, (10) beryllium, and (11) mercury. Provides that the rate of the tax imposed by this Act on the discharge of any taxable item shall relate to the estimated environmental damage caused by such discharge. Requires such tax rate to be uniform geographically throughout the United States. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to submit to the Congress his recommendations of the rates of tax which he deems necessary to carry out the purposes and provisions of this Act. Provides for a refund of the tax imposed under this Act where discharges from existing sources are reduced."
