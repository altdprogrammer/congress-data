Prohibits contributions in excess of $100 on behalf of Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates. States that no authorized committee may accept contributions other than those from individuals or political party organizations. Prohibits such contributions from nonresident aliens. Sets a $25,000 limit which such contributions may not exceed for a Presidential election and $5,000 for other Federal offices. Limits cash contributions to $100. Requires that contributions go only to the authorized committee of a candidate. Describes the purposes for which contributions may be expended. Requires reports from the authorized committees on their finances to be made to the Federal Election Commission. Establishes the Federal Elections Commission as an independent establishment of the executive branch, which may require reports and testimony from persons, initiate civil actions, and present evidence of violations of this Act to a grand jury and prosecute such violations."
