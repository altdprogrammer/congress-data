    "text": "Provides, under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act, that farmers displaced by a Federal program shall receive payments for actual direct losses when it is impracticable to determine relocation expenses. (Amends 42 U.S.C. 4622) Extends to 1976 the obligation of the Federal Government to pay 100 percent of the first $25,000 of assistance and assurances incurred by State agencies in acquiring real property incident to a Federal program. (Amends 42 U.S.C. 4627) Provides that during the period from July 1, 1972, through June 30, 1974, the head of a Federal agency is authorized to pay to a State which is not in compliance with the Act such sums in excess of the first $25,000 of cost as may be necessary to make all payments and provide all assistance required by the Act. Provides that whenever a program or project to be undertaken by a person, other than an individual, furnished Federal financial assistance for such program or project under specified programs, the head of a Federal agency furnishing such financial assistance, shall insure that the following payments and services, in accordance with the Act, be provided: (1) fair and reasonable relocation payments and assistance to such displaced persons; (2) relocation assistance programs; and (3) prior to the approval of the grant, contract, or agreement by the head of the Federal agency, that decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings will be available to such displaced persons within a reasonable period of time prior to displacement. Provides that no department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government administering any program providing Federal financial assistance shall, for the purposes of assuring compliance with the Act, impose any limitation on the removal of vacant improvements located on real property acquired in connection with such a federally assisted project."
