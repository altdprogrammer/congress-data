    "text": "Provides that a person may not procure or cause to be prepared an investigative consumer report on any consumer unless it is clearly and accurately disclosed to the consumer that a report including information as to his character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living, whichever are applicable, may be made. Requires that the disclosure: (1) be made in eight-point, boldface type in the application form for credit, employment, or insurance; and (2) include a statement informing the consumer of his right to request the additional disclosures. Requires that the disclosure contain the name and address of the consumer reporting agency making the report. Provides that whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report, it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure that only information relevant to the permissible purposes of the report is gathered and that such information is as accurate as possible. Provides that a consumer reporting agency which compiles and reports items of information on consumers which are matters of public record shall: (1) at the time such public record information is reported to the user of the consumer report, notify the consumer of the fact that public record information is being reported by the consumer reporting agency, together with the name and address of the person to whom such information is being reported; and (2) maintain strict procedures designed to insure that whenever public record information is reported it is complete and up to date."
