Provides, under the Controlled Substances Act, that practitioners who dispense narcotic drugs to individuals for maintenance treatment or detoxification treatment shall obtain annually a separate registration for that purpose from the Attorney General. States that the Attorney General shall register an applicant to dispense narcotic drugs to individuals for maintenance treatment or detoxification treatment (or both): (1) if the applicant is a practitioner who is determined by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to be qualified (under standards established by the Secretary) to engage in the treatment with respect to which registration is sought; (2) if the Attorney General determines that the applicant will comply with standards established by the Attorney General respecting (A) security of stocks of narcotic drugs for such treatment, and (B) the maintenance of records, in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act, on such drugs; and (3) if the Secretary determines that the applicant will comply with standards established by the Secretary (after consultation with the Attorney General) respecting the quantities of narcotic drugs which may be provided for unsupervised use by individuals in such treatment. Grants the Attorney General the power to revoke or suspend a registration upon a finding that the registrant has failed to comply with any standard of this Act."
