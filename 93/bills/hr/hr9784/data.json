    "text": "Federal Employee Labor-Management Act - States that labor organizations and collective bargaining in the Federal service are in the public interest. States further that it is the purpose of this Act to prescribe certain rights and obligations of the employees of the Federal Government and to establish procedures which are designed to meet the special requirements and needs of the Federal Government. Defines the terms used in this Act. Establishes a Federal Employee Labor Relations Board to regulate Federal labor-management relations. Provides that the Board shall consist of five members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Provides that the labor organization designated or selected for the purpose of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in an appropriate collective-bargaining unit shall be the exclusive representative of all the employees in such unit for such purpose, and an agency shall not bargain in regard to matters covered by this Act with any employee, group of employees, or other labor organization. Permits any labor organization to file a request for recognition as the exclusive representative with an agency and the Board. Requires such a request to allege that a majority of the employees in an appropriate collective-bargaining unit wish to be represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by such organization. Specifies other information which must be included in the request for recognition. Establishes criterion for the approval or disapproval of a request for recognition. Provides methods whereby employees may challenge an existing collective-bargaining unit as no longer representative. Provides that either an agency or an exclusive representative may declare that an impasse has been reached between them in collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment and other matters of mutual concern relating thereto, and may request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to appoint a mediator for the purpose of assisting them in reconciling their differences and resolving the controversy on terms which are mutually acceptable. Requires an agency and an exclusive representative who enter into an agreement covering terms and conditions of employment and other matters of mutual concern relating thereto to include in such agreement procedures for binding arbitration of grievances, including questions of arbitrability. Provides that such negotiated grievance procedures shall be the exclusive procedures available to bargaining unit employees for the settlement of grievances. States that nothing in this Act or in any other law or enactment of the United States, or of any State, territory, or possession of the United States, or any political subdivision thereof, shall be construed to interfere with, impede, or diminish the right of an exclusive representative to engage or of an employee to participate in a strike arising out of or in connection with a labor dispute. Provides that the Act shall take effect one hundred and twenty days following its enactment."
