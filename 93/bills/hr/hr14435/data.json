    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1974-04-29", 
    "text": "States the finding of the Congress that: (1) an individual's personal privacy is directly affected by the kind of disclosure and use made of identifiable information about him in a record; (2) a record containing information about an individual in identifiable form must be governed by procedures that afford the individual a right to participate in deciding what the content of the record will be, and what disclosure and use will be made of the identifiable information in it; and (3) any recording, disclosure, and use of identifiable information by an agency not governed by such procedures must be prescribed as an unfair information practice unless such recording, disclosure, or use is specifically authorized by Federal statute. Declares the purpose of this Act to be to insure safeguards for personal privacy from Federal agencies. Requires each Federal agency that maintains records to: (1) refrain from disclosing the record or any information contained therein to any other Federal, State, or local agency or to any person not employed by the agency maintaining such record, except: (A) with consent or constructive consent of the individual concerned or, in the event such individual cannot be located or communicated with after reasonable effort, with permission from members of the individual's immediate family, guardian, or, only in the event that such individual, members of the individual's immediate family, and guardian cannot be located or communicated with after reasonable effort, upon good cause for such disclosure, or (B) that if disclosure of such record is required under this section of this chapter or by any other provision of law, including by means of compulsory legal process, the individual concerned shall be notified by mail at his last known address of any such required disclosure, and shall be afforded full access to the records at least ten days before they are made available in response to the demand; (2) refrain from disclosing the records to any individuals within that agency other than those individuals who need to examine such records in the performance of their duties; (3) maintain an accurate register which shall become part of the individual's record, of the names and job classifications of all persons to whom such records are disclosed and the purposes for which such disclosure was made; (4) permit any data subject to inspect his own record upon proper identification at a convenient local office or by mail, or by telephone, and have copies thereof made at his expense, which in no event shall be greater than the cost of reproduction; (5) permit any data subject to supplement the information contained in his record by the addition of any document or writing or photograph containing information such individual deems pertinent to his record, and notify all agencies and persons to whom the records were previously disclosed of the supplemental information; (6) remove from records and promptly destroy all erroneous or irrelevant information and notify all agencies or persons to whom such information has been previously transferred of its removal, and in case of dispute as to what constitutes erroneous or irrelevant information, the issue shall be determined by the Federal Privacy Board; (7) upon written request of any data subject, give notice to such individual, in the event that his record has been augmented, of the contents of the augmentation, the source of the augmentation, and the purpose for which the augmentation is being effected; (8) inform an individual asked to supply personal data for any agency record keeping system whether he is legally required, or may refuse, to supply the data requested, and also of any specific consequences for him, which are known to the agency, of providing or not providing such data; and (9) assure that no use of individually identifiable data is made that is not within the stated purposes of the system as reasonably understood by the individual, unless, in the case of each use of such date, the informed consent of the individual has been explicitly obtained. Makes exceptions to provisions of this Act for records authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and the disclosure of which would: (1) endanger the active military plans or deployment of United States forces, (2) reveal details about current military technology or weaponry, or (3) endanger the life of any person engaged in foreign intelligence gathering operations of the United States Government. Requires the President to report to Congress before January 30 of each year on an agency-by-agency basis the number of records which were exempted from the application of this Act. Provides that any person who under the color of agency authority willingly or knowingly permits or causes to occur an unfair information practice shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year or suspended from employment without pay for not more than one year, or any combination thereof. Provides that any individual who has reason to believe that his records have been, are being, or are about to be disclosed in violation of this Act may bring an action in the appropriate district court of the United States to enjoin such disclosure, and upon a proper showing a temporary restraining order or a preliminary or permanent injunction shall be granted without bond. Establishes the Federal Privacy Board. Requires such Board to periodically publish and distribute through local post offices a Citizen's Privacy Index which shall include: (1) the name and location of every agency data keeping system; (2) the title, name, and address of the person immediately responsible for the system; (3) the nature and purpose of the system; (4) the categories and number of persons on whom data are maintained; (5) the categories of data maintained, indicating which categories are stored in computer-accessible files; (6) each agency's policies and practices regarding data storage, duration of retention of data, and disposal thereof; (7) the categories of data sources; (8) a description of all types of use made of data, including all classes of users and the agency relationships among them; and (9) the procedures whereby an individual can (A) be informed if he is the subject of data in the systems; (B) gain access to such data; and (C) contest their accuracy, completeness, timeliness, pertinence, and the necessity for retaining such data."
