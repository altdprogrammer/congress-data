    "text": "Urban Mass Transportation Amendments Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to incur obligations on behalf of the United States for urban mass transportation in the form of grant agreements or otherwise in amounts not to exceed $7,400,000,000. States that of this sum, the Secretary shall apportion to the Governors of the fifty States and Puerto Rico and to the Mayor of the District of Columbia $700,000,000 for fiscal year 1975, $800,000,000 for fiscal year 1976, and $900,000,000 for fiscal year 1977. Declares that these amounts shall become available upon the effective date of this Act and shall remain available until obligated. Authorizes sums to be appropriated for liquidation of the obligation incurred under this Act not to exceed $1,260,000,000 prior to July 1, 1974, not to exceed an aggregate of $1,860,000,000 prior to July 1, 1975, and not to exceed an aggregate of $7,400,000,000 thereafter. Provides that administration reservations for grants authorized under this Act shall not exceed $700,000,000 for fiscal year 1975. Declares that on the first day of fiscal years 1975, 1976, and 1977, the Secretary shall apportion the authorized sums to the Governors in the ratio which the population in urbanized areas, or parts thereof, as designated by the Bureau of the Census, in each State bears to the total population in such urbanized areas, or parts thereof, in all the States as shown by the latest available Federal census. Sets forth an allocation formula for such funds. Provides that sums apportioned to any Governor under this Act, shall be available for obligation by that Governor for a period of two years after the close of the fiscal year for which such sums are apportioned, and any amounts so apportioned remaining unobligated at the end of such period shall lapse and shall be returned to the Treasury of the United States for deposits as miscellaneous receipts. States that the Secretary may approve as a project under this Act, on such terms and conditions as he may prescribe: (1) the acquisition, construction, and improvement of facilities and equipment for use, by operation or lease or otherwise, in mass transportation service, (2) the payment of operating expenses to improve such service, and (3) mass transportation related projects. Declares that the Federal share payable on account of any project financed with funds available under this Act shall not exceed 80 percent of the cost of the project. Provides that funds available for the payment of operating expenses to improve mass transportation service shall be supplementary to and not in substitution for the average amount of the State and local government funds expended on the operation of mass transportation service for the two Federal fiscal years preceding the fiscal year for which the project was intended. Sets forth the procedure for approving programs under this Act including surveys, plans, specifications estimates, and public hearings. Permits the Secretary to discharge any of his responsibilities under this Act for projects upon the request of any Governor, by accepting a certification by the Governor, or his designee, if he finds projects will be carried out in accordance with State laws, regulations, directives, and standards establishing requirements at least equivalent to those contained in, or issued pursuant to, this Act. Provides that as soon as practicable after the plans, specifications, and estimates for a specific project have been approved, the Secretary shall enter into a formal project agreement with the Governor. Declares that the development of projects under this Act shall be based upon a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive planning process covering all modes of surface transportation."
