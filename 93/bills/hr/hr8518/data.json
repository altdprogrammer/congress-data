Allows the President to increase the quantity of articles which may be imported from one country, and permits him upon specified determinations to reapply this Act to any article or country after its termination or non-application in 1975. Authorizes the President to exempt from import quotas any article produced in a foreign county that is determined not to contribute to market disruption in the United States. Directs the President to conclude bilateral and multilateral arrangements or agreements with foreign countries concerning footwear. Authorize the President to increase imports where the supply of footwear is inadequate to meet the domestic demand at reasonable prices. Outlines those definitions applicable under this Act."
