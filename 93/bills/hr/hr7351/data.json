Sets forth the procedures for issuance of such licenses. Permits revokation of any license if the licensee: (1) has misrepresented his qualifications for such license; (2) has misrepresented to any person the nature of the service he is qualified to provide; or (3) has intentionally misrepresented any item of information on any return. Provides penalties for (1) failure of a preparer of income tax returns to sign the return; (2) for failure of the preparer to obtain a license; and (3) for understatements of tax by the tax return preparer. (Adds 26 U.S.C. 7002, 7407, 7217-18, 6050A, 6689)"
