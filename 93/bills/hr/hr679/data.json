    "text": "Firearms Registration Act - Title I: Registration - Makes it unlawful for a person to knowingly possess a firearm not registered in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Provides that a certified dealer who sells a firearm to a person in whose possession the firearm must be registered shall require from the purchaser a completed application for registering the firearm and shall file the application with the Secretary of the Treasury at the time of sale. States that an application for registration of a firearm shall be in a form to be prescribed by the Secretary, which shall include at least the following: (1) the name, address, date and place of birth, photograph and social security or taxpayer identification number of the applicant; (2) the name of the manufacturer, the caliber or gage, the model and the type, and the serial number of the firearm; and (3) the date, the place, and the name and address of the person from whom the firearm was obtained, the number of such person's certificate of registration of such firearm, if any, and, if such person is a licensed dealer, his license number. Directs any registrant of a firearm who sells such firearm, to, within five days of the sale, return to the Secretary his registration certificate noting on it the name and residence address of the transferee, and the date of delivery. Provides that whoever violates the registration or sales provisions of this Act shall be punished by imprisonment not to exceed five years, or by a fine not to exceed $5,000, or both. States that whoever knowingly falsifies any information required to be filed with the Secretary pursuant to this Act or forges or alters any certificate of registration or temporary evidence of registration, shall be punished by imprisonment not to exceed five years or a fine not to exceed $10,000 or both. Title II: General Provisions - Stipulates that, if the provisions of any part of this Act or any amendments made thereby or the application thereof to any person or circumstances be held invalid, the provisions of the other parts and their application to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. States that no provision of this Act shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to occupy the field in which such provisions operate to the exclusion of the law of a State or possession or political subdivision thereof, on the same subject matter, or to relieve any person of any obligation imposed by any law of any State, possession, or political subdivision thereof."
