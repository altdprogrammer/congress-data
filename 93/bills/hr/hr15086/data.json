Provides that the encouragement of exports is a secondary consideration and that the primary concerns of the United States are national security and possible harm to the American economy from unfair competition arising out of United States exports used in combination with slave and semislave labor within nonmarket economy countries. States that it is the policy of the United States to deal with world shortages of particular commodities, whenever feasible, through international cooperation with the major suppliers and consumers of such commodities, rather than by taking unilateral action. Provides for bipartisan consultation of specified congressional committees for determination of items the exportation of which is to be controlled, and the extent of such control."
