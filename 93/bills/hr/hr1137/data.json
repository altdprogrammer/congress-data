Provides that an individual shall be qualified to receive a retirement payment for any month if on the first day of such month: (1) such individual is 60 years of age or over, or is 16 years of age or over and is blind, or is 18 years of age or over and is permanently and totally disabled; (2) he has filed an application for payments under this title and such application is valide with respect to such months, or (3) his net income is less than the prevailing minimum wage determined pursuant to this title. States that the amount of the retirement payment to which an individual is entitled for any month shall be equal to the amount by which the prevailing monthly minimum wage exceeds his net income from all sources received in or attributable to such month. Provides that each individual making or renewing an application for payments under this title shall submit to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare a complete statement of any other net income derived or to be derived by him which would be attributable to such period. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this title."
