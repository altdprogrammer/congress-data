    "text": "Public School Improvement and Desegregation Act - Provides that no court of the United States shall issue an order requiring the transportation of students or the merger of school districts as a means of eliminating racial segregation in schools if: (1) the local educational agency affected has adopted a plan for its schools approved by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare under the Public School Improvement and Desegregation Act; (2) the court determines such plan provides for the assignment of students to schools on a racially nondiscriminatory basis and in a manner which will result in the elimination of segregation in such schools to the maximum extent feasible without requiring the transportation of students, or their attendance in the schools of another such agency, for that purpose; (3) the plan will so improve the quality of education in the schools of the agency that no student will suffer inequality of educational opportunity by reason of the school he attends; and (4) funds are or will be available to carry out the plan. Provides that where a court of the United States determines that a local educational agency must take action to eliminate segregation in its schools, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare may make a grant to such agency to assist it to carry out a plan for such action submitted to him by the local educational agency. Authorizes to be appropriated for making grants under this Act for fiscal year 1974, and each of the four succeeding fiscal years, the sum of $5,000,000,000."
