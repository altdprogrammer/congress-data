Allows such a person to demonstrate a knowledge of the fundamentals of history and the principles and forms of government of the United States in a language other than English. Waives the literacy requirement for those persons over the age of 60 years, who have resided in the United States for 20 years, who are illiterate, but who otherwise meet the qualifications for naturalization.
