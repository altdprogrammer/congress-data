    "text": "District of Columbia Federal Payment Act - Makes it the duty of the Commissioner of the District of Columbia to (1) develop intercommunity expenditure and revenue comparisons and (2) to identify elements of cost and benefits to the District of Columbia which result from the District's role as the Nation's Capital. Directs the results of such study to be made available to the Federal Office of Management and Budget for use in preparing recommendations for appropriations for the annual Federal payment to the District of Columbia. Enumerates the cost and benefit elements which the Commissioner should consider in such study, including (1) Revenues unobtainable because of the relative lack of taxable commercial and industrial property; (2) Potential revenues that would be realized if the specified exemptions from District taxes were eliminated; (3) Benefits of Federal grants-in-aid relative to aid given other States and local governments; (4) Higher than average sales tax revenue from tourist trade; and (5) Benefits from museums, parks, libraries, and cultural activities which are financed by the Federal Government. Directs the Federal Office of Management and Budget to determine and recommend to the Congress the amount of the appropriation for the annual Federal payment to the District of Columbia."
