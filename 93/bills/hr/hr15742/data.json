Requires the Secretary of the Interior, after making the study required by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, to submit such study to each Alaska Native Regional Corporation for review and comments. Directs the Secretary to make a study of: (1) changes in Alaska Native life style, health status and needs, income distribution and holdings, economic pursuits, housing, transportation, communication, and social and cultural patterns which may result from the implementation of the Settlement Act; and (2) all Federal programs designed to benefit Alaska Native people. Requires that the study shall include recommendations of the Secretary for the future management and operation of these Federal programs and any other Federal programs which may be required to serve the Alaska Native community during the remaining period of, and after the implementation of, the Settlement Act. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Secretary such sums as are necessary to conduct the study required by this Act."
