Authorizes the Attorney General to promulgate regulations establishing procedures to be followed by manufacturers in entering into such contracts, combinations or arrangements. Declares that the Attorney General shall not approve any such contract, combination or arrangement if the terms extend beyond December 31, 1975. Provides that information developed under such arrangements shall be made available upon request to any motor vehicle manufacturer not a party to such contract, combination or arrangement. States that this exemption shall not apply after December 31, 1975."
