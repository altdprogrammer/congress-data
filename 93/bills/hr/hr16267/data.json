Empowers the Secretary to assign Corps personnel to State health agencies, private health entities, local governments, and medical, dental or other appropriate health societies. Enumerates the requirements to be met prior to the making of any such assignments and for the continuing of expired assignments. Provides that Corps personnel shall be assigned on the basis of the extent of the population's need for health services and without regard to the ability of members of the population to pay for health services. Directs the Secretary, in making an assignment, to seek to match characteristics of the assignee and of the population in order to increase the likelihood of the assignee remaining to serve the population upon completion of his assignment period. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) provide technical assistance to all medically underserved populations to which are not assigned Corps personnel; (2) make arrangements to enable Corps personnel to utilize the health facilities of the areas in which the population resides; and (3) make grants, with specified limitations, for purposes of providing health services. States that the Secretary shall require as a condition to the approval of an application that the entity enter into an appropriate arrangement with the Secretary under which: (1) the entity shall be responsible for charging for health services by the Corps personnel to be assigned; (2) the entity shall take action for the collection of payments for such health services; and (3) the entity shall pay to the United States specified, calculated amounts. Directs the Secretary to conduct, at schools of the health professions and allied health professions, recruiting programs for the Corps. Directs the Secretary to adjust the monthly rate of pay of each physician and dentist member of the Corps who is directly engaged in the delivery of health services to a medically underserved population. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Congress and specifies the content of such reports.

Provides that each regional council shall conduct studies and other activities relevant to the various matters related to the postgraduate training of physicians within the region served by the regional council. Provides that the National Council and each regional council shall annually certify postgraduate training positions in entities, and associations of such entities, which directly provide such training. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to, and contract with, entities which directly provide, or have the capacity to provide directly, postgraduate training of physicians and which are certified to the Secretary by the National Council and a regional council as likely to receive an increased number of certified postgraduate positions subsequent to July 1, 1977, to allow such entities to develop new, and expand existing, postgraduate physician training programs. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1978-80 to carry out such program and make such grants. Directs the Secretary to contract for the conduct of a study to: (1) analyze the current and projected geographical distribution of physicians by specialty; and (2) examine, evaluate, and develop a reliable and appropriate methodology to establish the optimal distribution of physicians by specialty and by geographic area. Authorizes the appropriation of $10,000,000 for the conduct of such study. Authorizes the Secretary to make special project grants to schools, agencies, organizations and institutions for the improvement of health professions training.

Establishes in the United States Treasury a health service manpower loan guarantee fund to enable the Secretary to discharge his responsibilities with respect to loan guarantees and interest subsidies under this Act. Authorizes the appropriation to the fund of such amounts as may be required from time to time for the fund.
