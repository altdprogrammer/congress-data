    "text": "Open Beaches Act - Title I: - Provides that no one shall construct or maintain any barrier of any nature which interferes with the right of the public to enter, leave, cross or use as a common the public beaches. Permits the Attorney General to bring action in the Federal district courts to establish and protect the public right to beaches; determine the existing status of title, ownership and control; and condemn such easements as may reasonably be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Act. Provides that a showing in court that an area is a beach is prima facie evidence that there is imposed upon the beach a prescriptive right to use it as a common. Declares that nothing in this Act shall interfere with a State's right to protect, preserve and control beaches for the public good. Provides that all interest in land recovered under authority of the Act shall be treated as subject to State control as if the State had acted to recover such interest. Requires the States to put up 25 percent of the land value to recover such interest through condemnation. Title II: Encourages the States and the Federal Government to act in concert to protect the rights of the public in the use of beaches. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to place at the disposal of the States research facilities of the Federal Government to assist the States in protecting the public's right to beaches. Authorizes Federal funding of up to 75 percent of the cost of projects designed to secure the right of the public to beaches. Enables the Secretary of Transportation to provide financial assistance to the States for the development and maintenance of transportation facilities to the beaches. Title III: Defines \"beaches\" as the area along the sea affected by wave action, such area either being from discernible vegetation line to the sea, or, if no line is discernible, an area 200 feet in width."
