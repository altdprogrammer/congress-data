    "text": "Newsmen's Privilege Act - Provides that no person shall be required by any court, grand jury, agency, department or commission of the United States or by either House of or any committee of Congress to disclose any confidential information or the source thereof which is received or obtained by him in his capacity as a newsman. Makes exceptions to this privilege for any information which has at any time been published, broadcast, or otherwise made public by the person claiming the privilege. Makes further exceptions: (1) for the source of any allegedly defamatory information in any case where the defendant, in a civil action for defamation, asserts a defense based on the source of such information; and (2) for the source of any information concerning the details of any grand jury or other proceeding which was required to be secret under the laws of the United States. Makes provisions for applications in district courts for orders divesting this non-disclosure privilege by persons seeking the information. Provides that the order shall be granted if the court, after hearing the parties, determines there is substantial evidence that disclosure of the information is required to prevent a threat to human life, or espionage, or of foreign aggression."
