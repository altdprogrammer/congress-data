(Amends 21 U.S.C. 321) Prohibits the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare from classifying a food for special dietary use as a drug solely on the basis of levels of vitamin, mineral, protein, or other food ingredient present in such food. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit, or to authorize the Secretary to prohibit, the inclusion in labeling or advertising of any truthful statement concerning the composition, source, or quality of any food for special dietary use or any of its ingredients, whether or not a need for the food or any of its ingredients in human nutrition has been established. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit, or to authorize the Secretary to prohibit, any combination of vitamins, minerals, protein, or other food ingredients in foods for special dietary use (whether or not a need for such ingredients in human nutrition has been established) unless the Secretary determines by regulation that such combination in such foods would be injurious to health."
