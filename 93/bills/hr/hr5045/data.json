    "text": "Public Broadcasting Financing Act - States the Congressional finding that it is in the public interest to finance the growth and development of noncommercial educational radio and television broadcasting while affording such broadcasting maximum protection from extraneous interference and control, stimulating greater support from sources other than the Federal Government and enabling the establishment of financial stability while insuring that the Congress will fulfill its responsibility to supervise the proper utilization of Federal funds. Creates on the books of the United States Treasury a Public Broadcasting Fund to which appropriations are authorized under a schedule provided in this Act. Limits such appropriations to $60 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, and rising by $20 million each year thereafter until the fiscal year ending June 30, 1977, for which the limit is $140 million. Provides for the annual certification to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare of the amount of non-Federal support for public broadcasting. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to the Congress on the income, disbursements, and status of the Public Broadcasting Fund during each year."
