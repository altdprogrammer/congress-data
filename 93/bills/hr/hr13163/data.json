    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Consumer Protection Act - Establishes as an independent agency within the executive branch of the Government the Consumer Protection Agency. States that the Agency shall be headed by an Administrator who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Requires the Administrator to transmit to the Congress and the President in January of each year a report which shall include a comprehensive statement of the activities and accomplishments of the Agency during the preceding calendar year including a summary of consumer complaints received and actions taken thereon and such recommendations for additional legislation as he may determine to be necessary or desirable to protect the interests of consumers within the United States. Directs the Agency, in the performance of its functions, to advise the Congress and the President as to matters affecting the interests of consumers; and to protect and promote the interests of the people of the United States as consumers of goods and services made available to them through the trade and commerce of the United States. States that the functions of the Agency shall be to: (1) represent the interests of consumers before Federal agencies and courts to the extent authorized by this Act; (2) encourage and support research, studies, and testing leading to a better understanding of consumer products and improved products, services and consumer information; and (3) submit recommendations annually to the Congress and the President on measures to improve the operation of the Federal Government in the protection and promotion of the interests of consumers. Directs the Agency to receive, evaluate, develop, act on, and transmit complaints to the appropriate Federal or non-Federal entities concerning actions or practices which may be detrimental to the interests of consumers. Requires the Agency to maintain a public document room containing an up-to-date listing of all signed consumer complaints of any significance for public inspection and copying which the Agency has received, arranged in meaningful and useful categories, together with annotations of actions taken by it. Directs the Agency to investigate and report to Congress on the desirability and feasibility of establishing a National Consumer Information Foundation which would administer a voluntary, self-supporting, information tag program. Authorizes the Administration to propose to any Federal agency, for submission to specified persons, written interrogatories or requests for reports and other related information, within such agency's authority. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be required to carry out the provisions of this Act for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1975, June 30, 1976, and June 30, 1977, respectively. Provides that no person shall on the ground of sex be excluded from participation, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity carried on or receiving Federal assistance under this Act."
