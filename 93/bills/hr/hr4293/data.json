    "text": "National Public Employee Merit System and Representation Act - Declares that it is the policy of the United States that public employees be selected, promoted, and retained on the basis of merit and fitness without regard to sex, race, religion, or political or organizational affiliation, and that they be afforded the rights to which all employees working in a free, democratic society are entitled. States that each public employee has the right of self-organization and to engage in collective bargaining through representatives of his choice free from interference, restraint, or coercion, and the right to refrain from any or all activities. Requires each State, as a condition for eligibility to receive any funds from the Federal government which may be used to finance any program conducted in a State, to establish a public personnel system which shall be in effect and applicable to each public employer in such State. Requires each such personnel system, among other requirements, to: (1) provide, in the case of public employees, that permanent appointment, promotion, and retention in positions be made exclusively on the basis of merit, fitness, and efficiency, without regard to sex, race, religion, or political or organizational affiliation; (2) provide that the right of each public employee to freely join or not and be represented by an employee organization be guaranteed; and (3) provide that the right of an employee organization to represent its membership in determining terms and conditions of employment be recognized. Outlines those acts which shall constitute unfair labor practices by both a public employer and employee. Establishes a National Public Employee Relation Commission which shall be responsible for the enforcement of the provisions of this Act. Authorizes the commission to conduct hearings and investigations, and to issue subpenas in order to carry out the purposes of this Act. Extends immunity from prosecution to witnesses appearing at the commission hearings. States that any person who shall willfully resist, prevent, impede, or interfere with any member of the commission or any of its agents or agencies on the performance of duties pursuant to this Act shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $5,000 or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. Authorizes the Commission to promulgate such rules and regulations as it deems necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act. Requires the Commission, at the close of each fiscal year, to submit a report in writing to the Congress and to the President stating the cases it has heard, the decisions it has rendered, the names, salaries, and duties of all employees and other individuals under the supervision of the commission, and an account of all moneys disbursed. Authorizes necessary appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
