Provides that if such retired member is participating in the Survivor Benefit Plan established by Public Law 92-245, at the time of his resignation, to accept a State civil office, he may, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, continue to participate in the plan as if he had never resigned by depositing in the Treasury each month thereafter the sum of money that otherwise would have been deducted from his retired pay for the month under the plan, and if the said retired member should die while holding State civil office his beneficiary or beneficiaries under the plan shall be paid the annuity authorized thereunder as if the said member had died while in retired status."
