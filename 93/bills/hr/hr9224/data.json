Establishes the National Blood Bank program within the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to perform enumerated duties to assure an adequate supply of blood throughout the Nation. Establishes an Advisory Council to make recommendations to the Secretary regarding: (1) policy goals of the program; (2) motivation and recognition of blood donors; (3) reciprocal transactions between national blood bank systems; and (4) removal of blood purchasing costs from health insurance plan coverage. Declares that only class A blood banks may maintain blood deposit or pledge programs in advance of their needs. Provides criminal penalties for persons violating the provisions of this Act. States that a Federal or District of Columbia employee may be excused from duty without loss of pay or deduction from annual leave for the time necessary for him to donate in blood collection programs carried out under the national blood bank program."
