    "text": "Extends the coverage of the National Labor Relations Act to employees of nonprofit hospitals. Provides that a labor organization, before engaging in any picketing, striking, or other concerted refusal to work at any health care institution, shall, not less than ten days prior to such action, notify the institution in writing and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service of that intention. Provides, under the Labor Management Relations Act, that if a labor dispute between a health care institution and its employees or a threatened or actual strike or lockout is not settled under the National Labor Relations Act, and, in the judgment of an impartial committee, it threatens to interrupt the delivery of health care, a board of inquiry shall be created to investigate the issues involved in the dispute and report thereon with findings of fact together with recommendations, with the objective of achieving a prompt, peaceful, and just settlement of the dispute. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such provisions of this Act. Provides, under the National Labor Relations Act, that any employee of a health care institution who is a member of and adheres to established tenets of a bona fide religion, body, or sect which has historically held conscientious objection to joining or financially supporting labor organizations shall not be required to join or financially support any labor organization as a condition of employment; except that such employee may be required to pay sums equal to dues and initation fees to a nonreligious charitable fund chosen by such employee."
