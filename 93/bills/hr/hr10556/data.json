Requires the advisory committee to report to the Secretary, within one year after the date of enactment of this paragraph, the results of such study, together with such recommendations as it may deem appropriate.\" Directs the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe minimum standards governing the use of materials which are flammable, combustible, or when ignited produce toxic or irritating products of combustion in the interior of aircraft cabins designed for the carriage of passengers and governing the use of such materials in insulating such aircraft cabins including binders. Provides that initial standards issued under this Act shall become effective not later than the expiration of the two-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act."
