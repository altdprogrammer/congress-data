States that any mass transit system which violates this Act shall be liable for a civil penalty of $10,000 for each day such system is in violation, and such mass transportation system shall be liable to the United States for all amounts received in excess of the present fare. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary for the purpose of making grants to any mass transportation system which is so adversely affected by the provisions of this Act that such transportation system may be forced to curtail or shut down its operations as a result of such prohibition."
