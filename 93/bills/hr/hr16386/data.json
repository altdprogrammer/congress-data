Requires that the Postal Service shall furnish to the Commission information with respect to: (1) internal Postal Service management matters; (2) plans and policies of the Postal Service with respect to proposed changes in the nature of postal services; and (3) evaluations undertaken by or at the direction of the Postal Service with respect to the operation of the Postal Service. Provides that the terms of the Postmaster General and the Deputy Postmaster General shall be fixed by the Governors of the Board of Governors. Sets forth the requirements governing the annual authorization of appropriations. States that there shall be appropriated to the Postal Service, pursuant to annual authorizations enacted by the Congress, amounts equal to all revenues received by the Postal Service. Provides that the Postal Rate Commission shall have the authority to initiate reviews and hearings with respect to the activities of the Board of Governors and the Postal Service under this chapter. Enumerates the procedures governing such reviews and hearings. Requires that when the Postal Service determines that there should be a change in the nature of postal services which will not generally affect service on a nationwide or substantially nationwide basis, it shall post notice of such proposed change at any postal facility which will be substantially affected by such proposed change and at any other appropriate place or location. Requires that the Postal Rate Commission shall, on a regular basis, conduct regional hearings to afford interested parties with an opportunity to bring to the attention of the Commission problems, questions, and issues with respect to postal service and rates of postage."
