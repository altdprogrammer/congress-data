Provides that the district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction over actions brought to enforce the provisions of this Act, including but not limited to jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this Act. States that if any provision or application of the Act is judicially determined to be invalid, the remainder of the Act with regard to the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such determination."
