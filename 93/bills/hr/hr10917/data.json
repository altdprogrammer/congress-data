Permits any state with parts thereof in more than one time zone to by law exempt either the entire State as provided in this Act or to exempt the entire area of the State lying within any time zone. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to report to Congress at least six months before the end of the 2 year period made by the Act concerning the effects on the change in the period of daylight made by this Act."
