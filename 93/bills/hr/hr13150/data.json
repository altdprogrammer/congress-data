Authorizes the Administrator to take such action as may be necessary to insure the maximum increase in the production, transportation, and conversion of coal so long as the present energy crisis exists. Sets forth the powers and authority of the Administrator under the provisions of this Act, including the following: (1) to set goals for the production and conversion of coal into energy; (2) to encourage, assist, and take such steps as shall provide for increased production, transportation, and conversion of coal into energy; (3) to issue orders which shall constitute a prior claim upon producers of materials and supplies essential to the increased production, transportation, and conversion of coal into energy; and (4) to afford necessary, reasonable, and proper financial assistance to persons, firms, or corporations converting to the use of coal as a source of energy. Authorizes the Administrator to enter into contracts directly or for the account of any person, firm, or corporation engaged in the production, transportation, and conversion of coal upon terms he deems fair and reasonable for any equipment or parts or other essential articles necessary to increase the production, transportation, and conversion of coal. States that the Administrator may engage in such research and development as he deems necessary, including, but not limited to, the construction and operation of pilot plants and projects relating to the production, transportation, and conversion of coal. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
