    "text": "Allows an income tax deduction to persons who construct or subsequently own certified housing facilities for agricultural workers. Bases such deduction on the amortization of the adjusted basis of such facility on a 60-month period. Prescribes procedures for electing and discontinuing such deduction. Allows such deduction to be discontinued if the Secretary of Agriculture finds noncompliance with this Act. Sets forth requirements for \"certified housing,\" including satisfaction of the Secretary that: (1) it is decent, safe, and sanitary; and (2) rental charges shall not exceed the means of the occupants. Computes, in the case of property held by one person for life with remainder to another person, the amortization deduction as if the life tenant were the absolute owner of the property and shall be allowed to the life tenant. Prohbits a deduction with respect to a certified housing facility for agricultural workers for any month during any part of which: (1) if the taxpayer is an individual (other than an estate or trust), such facility is occupied by the taxpayer or by the spouse, any dependent, or any member of the household of the taxpayer; (2) if the taxpayer is an estate or trust, such facility is occupied by a beneficiary of the estate or trust; or (3) if the taxpayer is a corporation, such facility is occupied by any stockholder or officer of the corporation or by any employee of the corporation who is not an agricultural worker."
