    "text": "States that the purpose of this title is to authorize and provide for the construction and operation of deepwater port facilities. Prohibits any person from constructing or operating to such a facility without a license. Authorizes the Deepwater Port Facilities Licensing Commission to issue such licenses if: (1) applicants are financially able and willing to comply with applicable requirements; (2) the facility will not unreasonably interfere with international navigation; and (3) the facility will be constructed and operated to minimize or prevent any adverse significant environmental effects. Provides that licenses may be issued for 30 years with right to renew. Prohibits granting of a license over objection by a governor of an adjacent State. Exempts such licenses from antitrust laws. Establishes the Deepwater Port Facilities Licensing Commission and lists its members. Provides that license applications must meet all requirements of law. Requires the Commission to notify, upon license application, governors of adjacent States, Federal agencies, and interest persons and groups. Provides for public hearings concerning licenses. Establishes methods of appeal from a license application decision made by the Commission. Establishes penalties for license violators and violators of this title. Permits States to fix reasonable fees, tolls, and charges for the use of adjacent deepwater port facilities."
