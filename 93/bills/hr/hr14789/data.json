Requires that any retail dealer who engages in interstate commerce shall: (1) assemble fully, prior to the purchaser's taking possession of, any bicycle sold by such dealer; and (2) disclose, prior to such sale, to any such purchaser the requirement of this Act in a manner to be determined by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Provides that any retail dealer who fails to comply with the provisions of this Act shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $500 for each such failure. Directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission, established by the Consumer Product Safety Act, to prescribe rules for the administration and the enforcement of this Act no later than six months after the date of the enactment of this Act."
