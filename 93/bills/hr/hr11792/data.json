    "text": "National Energy Emergency Act - Title I: Statement of Findings and Purposes - Sets forth the determination of Congress that there is currently an energy shortage in the United States and enumerates the purposes of this Act. Title II: Emergency Fuel Shortage Contingency Programs - Declares that current and imminent fuel shortages have created a nationwide energy emergency. Authorizes the President, for the duration of the energy emergency, to enter into appropriate agreements with foreign states, foreign nationals, or international organizations to adjust and allocate imports of fossil fuels. Provides that any such formal agreement shall not become final until the Senate has had fifteen days to disapprove of such agreement. Provides that the declared nationwide energy emergency and the authority granted by this Act shall terminate one year after the date of enactment of this Act unless extended by Congress. Sets forth limitations for the export of domestically mined coal during the term of any energy emergency declared by or under this Act. Revises the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act by directing the President to provide for an ordering of priorities among users of crude oil, residual fuel oil, or any refined petroleum product and to assign to such users rights entitling them to obtain any such oil or product in precedence to other users not similarly entitled, if the President finds that such action is necessary. Authorizes the President to require adjustments in the production rates of refineries in the United States whenever he finds that such adjustments are necessary to assure the production of residual fuel oil and refined petroleum products in such proportions necessary to meet the priorities for use of such products established under the Energency Petroleum Allocation Act. Directs the President to propose one or more energy conservation plans within thirty days of enactment of this Act which will result in a reduction of energy consumption to a level which can be supplied by available energy resources."
