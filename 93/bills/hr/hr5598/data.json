    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1973-03-14", 
    "text": "District of Columbia Rent Control Act - States that Congress finds a serious emergency exists in the District of Columbia by reason of a shortage of leased or rental residences. Creates a temporary District of Columbia Housing Rent Commission for the District of Columbia composed of 9 members, one designated as chairman, to be appointed by the D.C. Commissioner with the advice and consent of the City Council, in such a manner that at least 2 members shall represent the landlords of the District and at least 2 members shall represent tenants. Requires all members of the Commission to be residents of the District and limits the term of office to 2 years. Empowers the Commission to adopt necessary rules, regulations and orders to carry out the purpose of this Act, and to employ necessary personnel or consultants. Makes it unlawful for any person to demand rent for the use of a residence at a rent greater than the rent which exceeds the highest monthly rent previously charged prior to January 11, 1973, for the same residence, provided that the residence shall have met all the regulations of the D.C. Housing Regulations, plus: (1) 2.5 per cent thereof to each consecutive 12-month period beginning at the end of the preceding period of occupancy, (2) the actual amount of any increase in tax, fee or service charge levied by the D.C. or U.S. Government after the beginning of the preceding period of occupancy and not previously charged to any lessee and allocable to that residence, and (3) a sum equal to 1.5 percent per month or its prorated equivalent for other rent payment intervals of that part of the costs of any capital improvement completed on or after January 11, 1973, provided that sum does not exceed 7.5 percent of the base rent and in no event if the expenditure was made in order to comply with the D. C. Housing Regulations. Allows exceptions to be made to this Act where the foregoing regulations would cause serious financial hardship to a landlord, but requires exeptions to be within guidelines which have been set down pursuant to public hearings and approved by the City Council. Requires notice of hearings and proceedings under the \"contested case\" treatment of the D.C. Administrative Procedures Act. Sets rent at the fair market value for comparable facilities for residences not leased for occupancy at any time during a 24-month-period immediately preceding the entering of a lease. Makes it the duty of a landlord to refund the difference and to adjust the rental rate when rent paid is in excess of the amount specified in this Act. Forbids a landlord to take retaliatory action against any tenant who exercises his rights under this Act, or to reduce any service customarily provided to his tenants. Provides for remedies for aggrieved persons and criminal penalties of fines of not more than $5,000 for each violation. Terminates the Commission 2 years from the date of enactment unless it is decided by a majority of members of the City Council after a public hearing that the findings of fact set forth in this Act continue to exist."
