Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe rules and regulations to carry out the purposes of this Act, and rules and regulations for the destruction of dairy products refused admission into the United States. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out the administration and supervision of the provisions of this Act. Imposes criminal penalties for violations of this Act."
