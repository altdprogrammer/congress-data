Prescribes the State share of compensation to be one-half of all medical and hospital expenses which directly result from an act which is a criminal offense. States that the Federal share shall equal one-half of all such medical and hospital expenses. Excludes from these expenses those amounts for which the victim is compensated by insurance. Provides that no victim whose earned income at the time of the crime equalled or exceeded $15,000 per year shall receive any compensation, except in the case of total disability of the victim."
