Provides that no more than two such members at any one time shall hold or have held membership in the United States Olympic Committee or in any national athletic association or federation.

Requires a final report of the Commission's findings and recommendations to be submitted to the President and the Congress not later than August 1, 1974. Provides for the compensation of Commission members. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.
