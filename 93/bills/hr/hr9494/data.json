    "text": "Independent Oil Marketers Supply Act - Provides that no refiner who during the period October 1, 1971 to September 30, 1972, was in the business of furnishing any petroleum product to controlled marketers for resale or sale to the public shall fail to offer to supply that product to independent marketers and/or users who purchase in wholesale quantities at reasonable prices in reasonable quantities, so long as he continues to furnish that product to controlled marketers. States that violations of this Act shall be deemed to be an unfair act or practice in commerce under the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Requires the Federal Trade Commission to report to the Congress within six months after the date of enactment of this Act on whether any additional legislation is required to prevent acts or practices in commerce which adversely affected any independent marketers as defined in this Act."
