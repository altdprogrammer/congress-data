Requires that such ground propulsion systems must meet or better all air quality standards set by or under the National Emission Standards Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Air Quality Act of 1967, while substantially reducing per mile energy comsumption. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act not to exceed $30,000,000 in the aggregate for the fiscal years 1974 through 1977."
