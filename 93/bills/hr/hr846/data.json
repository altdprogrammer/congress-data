    "text": "Immigration and Nationality Act - Establishes a five-member Board of Visa Appeals as an independent office within the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs of the Department of State, with members to be appointed by the Secretary of State. Gives the Board jurisdiction to review the denial revocation of an immigrant visa of a resident alien, upon the petition of such citizen or alien. Makes the Board's decision final. Gives parents of permanent resident aliens second preference status (currently covered by this preference are spouses and unmarried sons or unmarried daughters of such aliens). Removes refugees from seventh preference status and makes available to the following requiring labor certification, some 10,200 immigrant visas annually on a first-come-first-served basis: (1) those who are engaged solely or principally by a religious denomination and seek admission to the United States to perform duties to carry out the objectives of such denomination; and (2) retired persons; (3) private investors; and (4) fiancees of U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens (such aliens currently enter the United States on a nonpreference basis). Establishes a new provision for the admission of refugees from all over the world. Defines refugee as one who has fled from a Communist-dominated country or area, or has fled from any country and is unwilling to return \"due to well-founded fear of persecution, or danger to his life or civil liberties\"; or has been uprooted by natural calamity or military operations and is unable to return to his usual abode. Provides 12,000 immigrant visas annually to qualified refugees throughout the world, notwithstanding any numerical limitations of current law. Authorizes the Attorney General to parole alien refugees into the United States if such action is deemed to be in the public interest of the United States. Provides a permanent authority to adjust the status of refugee parolees to that of permanent residence. Provides adjustment of status, in cases of exceptional hardship, for natives of Western Hemisphere countries. Establishes a new statute of limitations which prevents the deportation: (1) of aliens lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence solely by reason of any conduct or conditions which occurred or existed ten years prior to the institution of deportation proceedings; (2) of aliens lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence if such aliens entered the U.S. prior to age fourteen and have resided in the U.S. for a period of at least twenty years immediately preceding the institution of deportation proceedings against him. Facilitates the naturalization of: (1) persons over fifty years who have been living in the U.S. for at least twenty years; (2) permanent resident aliens employed overseas by an accredited American philanthropic organization; and (4) permanent resident aliens serving with the armed forces during hostilities in Vietnam. Permits the derivative acquisition of citizenship by a minor child, through his parents' naturalization, at eighteen years of age instead of sixteen as currently provided. Provides that final hearings upon petitions for naturalization can be held as late as thirty days before a pending general election. Eliminates the question of \"country of former nationality\" from the naturalization certificate. Establishes a Select Commission on Nationality and Naturalization to make full and complete study and investigation all matters relating to the policy and operation of title III of the Immigration and Nationality Act; including, but not limited to, the effect of Federal judicial decisions in recent years on any of the provisions of such title and an analysis and evaluation of the fairness of the naturalization policy of the United States. Provides that the Commission shall be composed of nine members--three from the Senate, three from the House and three apointed by the President, and shall file its final report one year following enactment of this act."
