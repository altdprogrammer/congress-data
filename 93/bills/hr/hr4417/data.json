    "text": "Provides that no license granted for the operation of a broadcasting station under the Communications Act of 1934 shall be for a longer term than five years. Provides for renewal of such license where the Federal Communications Commission finds that the public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served. Provides that an applicant for renewal who is legally, financially and technically qualified shall be awarded the license if such applicant shows that its broadcast service during the preceding license period has reflected a good-faith effort to serve the needs and interests of its area as represented in its immediately preceding and pending license renewal application and if it has not demonstrated a callous disregard for law or the Commission's regulations."
