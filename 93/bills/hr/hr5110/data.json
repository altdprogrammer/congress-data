Provides that payment may be made under this Act for qualified drugs only when such drugs are dispensed by a licensed pharmacy which is a provider of services for purposes of the Act. Establishes in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare a Formulary Committee. Provides that the Committee shall compile, publish, make available, and periodically revise a Formulary of the United States. Provides that the Formulary shall alphabetacally arrange a listing, by established name, of those drugs and biologicals that shall be deemed qualified drugs for purposes of the benefits provided under this Act. Provides that the Committee, prior to making a final determination to remove from the listing in the Formulary any drug which would otherwise be included therein, shall afford a reasonable opportunity for a hearing on the matter to any person engaged in manufacturing, preparing, propagating, compounding, or processing the product who shows reasonable grounds for such a hearing. Provides that any person adversely affected by the final decision of the Committee may obtain judicial review thereof in accordance with the procedures specified in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Provides standards for determining the maximum allowable cost for qualified drugs. Defines the term \"qualified drug\".
