Directs the Commissioner to approve any such State plan if he determines that such plan: (1) sets forth such policies and procedures as will provide satisfactory assurance that funds paid to the State under this Act will be expended by the State to initiate, expand, or improve programs and projects which are designed to meet the educational needs of handicapped children throughout the States; (2) provides for the identification of all handicapped children in the State; (3) includes a proposal for the study of the State's present procedures for the institutionalization of handicapped children; (4) provides for the reduction of the number of handicapped children in the State who are institutionalized; (5) provides for the establishment of procedures for the classification of a child as a handicapped child; (6) provides satisfactory assurance that provision will be made for participation of children not enrolled in public schools in special educational programs and services provided to handicapped children by the State or by local educational agencies; (7) provides for procedures and objective measurements for evaluating at least annually the effectiveness of special educational programs and services in meeting the educational needs of handicapped children; (8) provides for making annual reports to enable the Commissioner to carry out his functions under this Act; (9) provides for keeping such records as the Commissioner may find necessary to assure the correctness and verification of reports and proper disbursement of funds under this Act and meets other specific provisions; and (10) provides for the establishment of a State Advisory Committee on Education for all Handicapped Children. Directs the Commissioner to disapprove a State plan or modification thereof only after reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing to such State. Establishes a formula for the distribution of funds under this Act among the States. Directs the Commissioner to report to the Congress not later than January 1, 1974, his recommendations with respect to changes which may be necessary in the amount and entitlement of grants under this Act.
