States that the difference between the tax actually paid under this Act on the transfer of the estate and the tax which would have been paid on that transfer had the interest in a family farming operation not given rise to a deduction shall be a deficiency in the payment of the tax assessed on that estate unless for at least five years after the decedent's death: (1) the interest which gave rise to the deduction is retained by the individual or individuals to whom such interest passed, and (2) the individual or any of the individuals to whom the interest passed resides on such farm, and (3) such farm continues to qualify as a family farming operation."
