Provides that the spouse and children of any such alien, if accompanying or following to join him, may be issued special immigrant visas notwithstanding such numerical limitation. Requires visas issued under this Act to be issued only to residents of Northern Ireland who are listed on their United Kingdom passport as citizenship British, and who are seeking admission to the United States to avoid the consequences of war, armed conflict or civil disorder, or persecution, whether such persecution is evidenced by overt acts or by laws or governmental regulations that discriminate against such alien, or any group to which he belongs, because of his religious faith, political convictions, ethnic or cultural associations, or economic position."
