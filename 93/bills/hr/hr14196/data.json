States that it shall be the duty of the Corps to provide opportunities for young Americans to participate in programs which provide training and practical work experience in the allied health field. Provides that such programs shall include career counseling, exposure to various health-related occupations, and training and work experience in clinical settings. Stipulates that the Corps shall be composed of volunteers selected by the Administrator in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board. States that the Administrator, in accordance with policies and procedures prescribed by the Board, may provide to any volunteer who has completed his period of enlistment: (1) a scholarship of $3,000 if such volunteer is a full-time student at a junior college, college, or university; or (2) a bonus of $3,000, if such volunteer works for one year in an area which (as determined by the Administrator) has a critical shortage of trained professional personnel in the allied health field.
