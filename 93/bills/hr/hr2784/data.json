    "text": "Noise Abatement and Control Act - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish within the Agency an Office of Noise Abatement and Control, pursuant to the Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1970. Directs the Office to coordinate the efforts of the Federal Government that relate to noise control, abatement, and prevention. Requires all instrumentalities, agencies, and departments of the Federal Government to furnish the Office with such information as it may require to this end. Directs each such entity of the Federal Government to carry out the program within its control in accordance with the purposes of this Act. Prescribes that, in any case where a level of Federal Government is carrying out or sponsoring an activity resulting in noise which the head of the office determines amounts to a public nuisance or is otherwise objectionable, such Federal entity must consult with the head of the Office to determine possible means of abating the offending noise. Requires the Office to compile and publish a regular report as to the efforts and activities of the Federal Government and its instrumentalities, agencies, and departments in regard to noise. Directs the Office to submit to the Congress, in July of each year, a report concerning its activities. Authorizes the Office to make grants to States, counties, municipalities, and regional governmental bodies, commissions, and councils for the purposes of developing, establishing, and carrying out programs of noise control and for research into the causes and effects of noise and new techniques of controlling, preventing, and abating noise. Authorizes to be appropriated for these grants $5 million for fiscal year ending June 30, 1973; $10 million for fiscal year 1974; $15 million for fiscal year 1975; $20 million for fiscal year 1976; and $25 million for fiscal year 1977. Authorizes the head of the Office to make grants to any public or nonprofit private agency, organization, or institution, or engage by contract the services of any such agency, organization, institution, or of any individual to conduct research into noise pollution; to provide training of professional and technical personnel in noise control techniques, methods, and approaches; and to establish and conduct demonstration projects relating to noise control. Authorizes to be appropriated for these grants $5 million for fiscal year 1973; $7 million for fiscal year 1974; $10 million for fiscal year 1975; $12 million for fiscal year 1976 and fiscal year 1977. Establishes, for the purpose of advising the head of the Office on matters bearing on his responsibilities under this title, a Noise Control Advisory Council of nine individuals skilled in fields relating to the matters to be considered by the Office. Requires the Council, once each fiscal year, to submit to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and to the Congress a report containing full and complete information on its work. Directs the Office of Noise Abatement and Control to prescribe standards for any machine, or class of machinery, which he determines contributes to, or may contribute to, noise which endangers, or contributes to endangering, the public health and welfare, and sets forth enforcement powers. Authorizes suits by private citizens or groups against the noise polluter and the head of the Office, if the head of the Office fails to take action against a violator within 60 days. Provides that such suits may be brought without regard to the amount in controversy or citizenship of the parties."
