    "text": "National Fuels and Energy Conservation Act - Establishes in the Department of the Interior the Office of Energy Conservation which shall have a Director appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Provides that the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Office, shall: (1) work with the Council on Environmental Quality in developing new energy conservation initiatives for the Federal Government; (2) cooperate with private conservation programs in industry; and (3) provide assistance to State governments in developing State energy conservation programs. Directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration to use equipment, construction methods and management policies which make the maximum efficient use of energy in design, construction and operation of Federal buildings. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to develop improved design, lighting, and insulation standards to promote efficient energy use in residential, commercial and industrial buildings. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish and publish standards of efficiency for electrical appliances and equipment. Directs the Federal Trade Commission to promulgate standards for labeling major electrical appliances and equipment so that shoppers may compare the efficiency of energy usage of such appliances and equipment. Prohibits manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers of electrical appliances and equipment from: (1) selling in interstate commerce any electrical appliance or equipment which is not labeled according to the FTC standard; and (2) from advertising any electrical appliance or equipment unless the advertisement contains a statement in accord with the labeling standard. Establishes a $5,000 civil penalty for each violation of such selling and advertising requirements. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to prepare proposed minimum standards for average degree of fuel use for motor vehicles, and such standards shall be designed to achieve a substantial increase in degree of fuel use by motor vehicles not in compliance with such standards within three years from the enactment of such standards by Congress, with all motor vehicles being required to meet such standards within five years. Requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to conduct tests and make such reports as the Secretary may require for the purpose of establishing such standards. Requires that all motor vehicles sold or manufactured in the United States shall bear a label stating in nontechnical language the degree of fuel use, and prohibits advertisement of such vehicles unless the advertisement states the degree of fuel use. Establishes a $1,000 civil penalty for offering an improperly labeled vehicle for sale and a $50,000 penalty for each advertisement not disclosing degree of fuel use. Directs the Federal Power Commission to promulgate regulations requiring electric and gas public utilities to submit to the Commission annual reports on energy conservation policies. Directs each agency of the Federal Government engaged in the sale of electrical energy to submit to the Congress a study of the impact of the rate structure of such agency on the consumption and conservation of energy. Requires the Federal Trade Commission to promulgate regulations for advertising and promotion of energy and fuels which: (1) shall be designed to prohibit advertising or promotional energy or fuels by any person or corporation when such person or corporation is unwilling or unable to meet customers' requirements for energy or fuel and; (2) which shall generally prohibit advertising and promotion which are calculated or likely to result in unnecessary energy consumption. Establishes a $50,000 civil penalty for each violation of such advertising and promotion regulations. Directs the Council on Environmental Quality to submit to the Congress: (1) a report evaluating the impact on fuel consumption of national and regional systems of freight transportation and; (2) a study of the relationships between motor vehicle sizes, the needs of motor vehicle users, and the public interest. Authorizes for each fiscal year such additional sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act."
