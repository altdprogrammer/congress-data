Directs that any evaluation of environmental impact for any project involving flood control, navigation, upstream soil conservation, or beach erosion abatement shall include in its analysis a positive accounting for specified factors including: (1) the abatement of flooding hazards to life and property; and (2) providing potable water supply for any community which has at the time of evaluation or can be expected to have within ten years in the absence of the project an inadequate supply for potable water. Presents the finding of the Congress that the study and review process employed by the Corps of Engineers of the United States Army and by other departments and agencies of government, in the process of interagency review of projects involving flood control, navigation, beach erosion abatement, and related purposes, presently is consuming an inordinately long period of time. Directs that the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, shall eliminate all unnecessary forms and procedures, reduce the amount of paperwork and delay involved, and expedite to the maximum extend practicable procedures of study and review to the end that the timelag presently experienced shall be measurably shortened. Directs the Secretary of the Army to report to the Congress no later than June 30, 1974, his accomplishments in carrying out this mandate, together with any recommendations which may further the intent of this Act."
