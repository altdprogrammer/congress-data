Provides that a State which permits the sale of wine within the State shall permit the transportation or importation of wine of like kind produced outside the State, or from materials originating outside the State, into said State for sale therein upon terms and conditions equally applicable to all wine of like kind sold in the State. Asserts that each State retains the right to engage in the purchase, sale, or distribution of wine and the right to exercise business discretion in the selection and listing of any wines purchased, sold, listed, or distributed by the State. Provides that whenever any person has reason to believe that any State has violated any of the provisions of this Act, such person may file in a district court of the United States of competent jurisdiction, a civil action to enjoin the enforcement thereof. Gives such court jurisdiction to hear and determine such action, and to enter therein such preliminary and permanent orders, decrees, and judgments as it shall determine to be required to prevent any such violation."
