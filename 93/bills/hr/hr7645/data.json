Requires that each person appointed by the President as ambassador or minister shall, at the time of his nomination, file with the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives a report of contributions, made by such person and by members of his immediate family during the period beginning on the first day of the fourth calendar year preceding the calendar year of his nomination, which report shall be verified by the oath or affirmation of such person. Establishes, within the Department of State, a Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, headed by an Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. Provides that the Secretary shall establish, with the advice of the Board of Foreign Service, selection boards to evaluate the performance of Foreign Service officers; and upon the basis of their findings, which except for career ambassadors and career ministers, shall be submitted to the Secretary in rank order by class or in rank order by specialization within a class, the Secretary shall make recommendations in accordance with the findings to the President for the promotion of Foreign Service officers. Provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, on or after August 15, 1973, no funds heretofore or hereafter appropriated may be obligated or expended to finance the involvement of United States military forces in hostilities in or over or from off the shores of North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia, unless specifically authorized hereafter by the Congress; and that notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon enactment of this Act, no funds heretofore or hereafter appropriated may be obligated or expended for the purpose of providing assistance of any kind, directly or indirectly, to or on behalf of North Vietnam, unless specifically authorized hereafter by the Congress."
