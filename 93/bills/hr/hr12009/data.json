    "text": "Railroad Continuance Act - States that the Interstate Commerce Commission shall not consider the request of any common carrier by railroad for a certificate authorizing the abandonment of all or any portion of a line of railroad until after a five-year period following the date of such request to the Commission. Provides that in determining whether the public convenience and necessity permits the granting of such request, the Commission shall give thorough consideration to the economic importance of such line to all areas which it serves. Requires the Commission to notify the Secretary of Transportation of the receipt of any request for a certificate of abandonment pursuant to this Act and to give priority to any proceedings initiated to continue or restore rail operations on an abandoned railroad line."
