    "text": "Alaskan Petroleum Transmission Act - Finds that, since energy sources are in short supply, the Congress should act to hasten recovery of underground petroleum on the North Slope of Alaska. Declares it to be the national policy that no decision be made for recovery of petroleum from the North Slope of Alaska until Congress has opportunity to review such plans. Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a thorough study of the two principal alternative routes for recovering petroleum reserves from the North Slope of Alaska. Outlines such routes as: (1) a trans-Alaska pipeline from the North Slope to Valdez, Alaska, and then by ocean-going oil tanker taken to the west coast of the United States; and (2) an overland pipeland from the North Slope across northeastern Alaska and through Canada to the midwest section of the United States. Directs the comptroller to report his findings and conclusions to the Congress no later than January 1, 1974. Specifies the considerations to be used in making the study. Authorizes the Comptroller to enter into contracts with the National Academy of Sciences in conducting the study, and to secure information from any Federal department, agency or instrumentality. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior and other appropriate Federal officials to enter into negotiations with Canada to determine the feasibility of a right-of-way across Canadian territory for petroleum transmission facilities from the North Slope of Alaska. Directs the Secretary to report the results of their negotiations to the Congress and the Comptroller no later than December 1, 1973. Requires all reports to the Congress under this Act be filed with the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate. Prohibits any order or rule of the Secretary of the Interior , or any other Federal agency or officer of the United States, granting a right-of-way, easement, or special land use permit on any Federal land for the construction and operation of a pipeline for the transmission of petroleum from the North Slope in Alaska from taking effect until the 60-day period beginning on the date the Comptroller files his final report. Allows the Secretary to grant such right-of-way or easements after the 60-day period as he deems necessary for construction of a petroleum transmission system along a route determined by the Comptroller to be the better of two principal alternative routes, unless Congress has disapproved such a route by concurrent resolution. Allows such rights-of-way or easements be granted for such width as the Secretary determines necessary without regard to the National Environmental Policy Act. Provides that action of the Secretary under this section shall not be reviewable by any court of the United States or in any State court. Outlines the congressional procedure in making a concurrent resolution concerning the proposed route and in referring the matter to committee. Limits debate on the resolution to no more than 10 hours. Authorizes necessary funds to carry out the Act."
