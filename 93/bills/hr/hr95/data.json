    "text": "Prohibits a judge, including each Supreme Court Justice, in regular active service from accepting compensation of any kind, whether in the form of loans, gifts, gratuities, honoraria, or otherwise, for services performed by him except that provided by law for the performance of his judicial duties. Permits the acceptance of compensation for the performance of services determined by the judicial council of the circuit to be in the public interest or to be justified by exceptional circumstances. Requires each judge to file annually with the Judicial Conference of the United States a statement of his investment, assets, and income, including gifts and bequests, from any source identifying the source, and a statement of liabilities. Prescribes a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, for violations of this Act. (Adds 18 U.S.C. 225)."
