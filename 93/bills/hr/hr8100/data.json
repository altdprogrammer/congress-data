    "text": "National Farm Labor Relations Act - Declares that the Act's purpose is the protection of a comprehensive plan for the protection of agricultural employees and employers in their relations affecting commerce. Provides that a 3 member Farm Labor Relations Board will be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Provides for a Board General Counsel who will have the final authority with respect to investigations and the issuance of complaints. Grants agricultural employees the rights to self organization, to form or join labor organizations, to bargain collectively through chosen representatives and to engage in other concerted activities. Specifies the type of activity which would be considered an unfair labor practice on the part of an employer: restraint of employees in the exercise of their guaranteed rights; interference with the information or administration of any labor organization; discrimination in hiring and tenure for the discouraging of union membership by employees; the refusal to bargain collectively with a representative of employees; discrimination against an employee who files charges or gives testimony under this Act; and the recognition of an organization as a representative of employees before that organization has been certified. Designates specified activities on the part of a labor organization as unfair labor practices. Makes representatives selected for the purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the agricultural employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes the exclusive representative of such employees. Empowers the Board to decide the unit appropriate for collective bargaining purposes when petitions are filed by either employees or employers regarding representation. Permits the Board in making such a decision to hold a hearing and to direct an election by secret ballot. Empowers the Board to prevent unfair labor practices through the filing of complaints against the perpetrator of such practices, the holding of a hearing, and the issuance of an order directing cessation of the practice. Provides for review of such orders in any United States Circuit Court of Appeals. Permits the Board upon issuance of a complaint, to petition the appropriate United States District Court for temporary relief from the unfair labor practice. Grants the Board certain investigatory powers, including access to evidence relating to the matter in question, the power to issue subpoenas, etc. Directs the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to furnish assistance to parties in labor disputes involving agricultural employers and employees and their representatives. Provides that in order to prevent or minimize interruptions of the free flow of commerce growing out of labor disputes, agricultural employers and employees and their representatives shall: (1) exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and working conditions, including provision for adequate notice of any proposed change in the terms of such agreements; (2) whenever a dispute arises over the terms or application of a collective-bargaining agreement and a conference is requested by a party or prospective party thereto, arrange promptly for such a conference to be held and endeavor to settle such dispute expeditiously; and (3) in case such dispute is not settled by conference, participate fully and promptly in such meetings as may be undertaken by the Service for the purpose of aiding in a settlement of the dispute. Provides that the Board may order the parties to refrain from making any changes in terms of employment, except by agreement, at any time after certification of a labor organization and prior to execution of a collective bargaining agreement or at any time after notice of a complaint has been given."
