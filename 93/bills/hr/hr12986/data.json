Provides that no individual who is eligible under applicable international or applicable reasonable national amateur athletic rules and regulations may be directly or indirectly denied his right to attempt to qualify for selection, or his right (if he so qualifies) to participate, as an athlete, coach, trainer, administrator, manager, or other official representing the United States in any international amateur athletic competition, if such competition involves any sport included on the Olympic games or pan-American games program during the Olympiad time period concurrent with such attempt to qualify or such participation. Provides that any national amateur sports organization may seek recognition as a governing body under such Act if it establishes, among other requirements, that: (1) it provides, at the time of arbitration under such Act, and in comparison with the governing body, if any, more effective national competition (for individuals at all levels of athletic ability) in the sport for which it claims recognition as the governing body, so that such competition will result in a higher quality of United States athletes in all international amateur athletic competition for such sport; (2) it provides (without regard to race, creed, color, religion, or sex) equal opportunity, for competition in the sport for which it claims recognition as the governing body, to all individuals who are eligible under applicable international or applicable reasonable national amateur athletic rules and regulations; and it applies international rules and regulations concerning athletic competition without discrimination to all such individuals; and (3) it has a reasonable number of amateur athletes who represented the United States in any international amateur athletic competition in the sport for which the organization claims recognition, and which is included on the Olympic games or Pan-American games during the Olympiad time period concurrent with or immediately preceding such claim."
