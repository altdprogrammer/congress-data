    "text": "States that a person connected with or employed by the news media or press, or who is independently engaged in gathering information for publication or broadcast, shall not be required to disclose before the Congress or any Federal court, grand jury, or administrative entity any information, or written, oral, or pictorial material or the source of that information or material procured for publication or broadcast. Permits a person seeking information or the source thereof protected under this Act to apply to the United States district court for an order divesting such protection. Stipulates that the application shall be granted only if the court after hearing the parties determines that the person seeking the information: (1) has shown by clear and convincing evidence that there is probable cause to believe that the person from whom the information is sought has information which is clearly relevant to a specific probable violation of law; (2) has no alternative means; and (3) has demonstrated a compelling and overriding national interest in the information."
