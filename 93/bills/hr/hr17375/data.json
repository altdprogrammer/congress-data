    "text": "National Policy and Priorities for Science and Technology Act - Declares that it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal Government to take appropriate measures directed toward achieving various goals, including: (1) a continuing Federal investment in science and technology adequate to the needs of the Nation; and (2) the strengthening of national capabilities for technological planning and policy formulation. Declares it to be the purpose of this Act to promote the effective application of science and technology to the furtherance of national goals by: (1) establishing a Council of Advisers on Science and Technology in the Executive Office of the President to provide a source of scientific and technological analysis and judgment to the President; (2) establishing an Intergovernmental Science and Technology Advisory Committee to foster the application of science and technology to State and regional needs; (3) establishing an Interagency Federal Coordinating Committee on Science and Technology to coordinate agency research and development efforts; and (4) having the President submit an annual Science and Technology Report to the Congress. Title I: Council of Advisors on Science and Technology - Establishes in the Executive Office of the President a Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Directs the Council to annually appraise progress in science and technology in relation to the needs of the Nation and, taking account of the state of the economy through consultation with the Council of Economic Advisers, to determine the desired level of Federal investment in science and technology for the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year in which such determination is made, and make appropriate recommendations to the President and Congress. States that the Council shall serve as a source of scientific and technological analysis and judgment for the President with respect to major policies, plans, and programs of science and technology of the Federal Government. Requires the President to transmit annually to the Congress, beginning October 15, 1975, a Science and Technology Report which shall set forth: (1) a review of development of national significance in science and technology; (2) the significant effects of current and foreseeable trends in science and technology on the social, economic, and other requirements of the Nation; (3) a review and appraisal of selected science and technology-related programs, policies, and activities of the Federal Government; (4) an inventory and projection of critical and emerging national problems the resolution of which might be substantially assisted by the application of science and technology; (5) the identification and assessment of scientific and technological measures that can contribute to the resolution of such problems, in light of the related social, economic, political, and institutional considerations; (6) the existing and projected scientific and technological resources, including specialized manpower, that could contribute to the resolution of such problems; (7) recommendations for legislation on science and technology-related programs and policies that will contribute to the resolution of such problems; and (8) recommendations with regard to Federal investment level and priorities in science and technology, as made by the Council pursuant to this Act. Title II: Federal Coordinating Committee for Science and Technology - Establishes the Federal Coordinating Committee for Science and Technology. States that the Committee shall consider problems and developments in the fields of science and technology and related activities affecting more than one Federal agency, and shall recommend policies and other measures: (1) to provide more effective planning and administration of Federal scientific and technological programs; (2) to identify research needs including areas of research requiring additional emphasis; (3) to achieve more effective utilization of the scientific and technological resources and facilities of Federal agencies, including the elimination of unnecessary duplication; and (4) to further international cooperation in science and technology. Abolishes the Federal Council for Science and Technology. Title III: National Science Foundation - Directs the National Science Foundation to recommend and encourage the pursuit of national policies designed to foster research and education in science and engineering, and the application of scientific and technical knowledge to the solution of national problems. Requires the Foundation to initiate an educational program of continuing education in science and engineering in order to enable scientists and engineers who have been engaged in their careers for at least five years to pursue courses of study designed to: (1) provide them with new knowledge, techniques, and skills in their special fields; or (2) acquire new knowledge, techniques, and skills in other fields which will enable them to render more valuable contributions to the Nation. Title IV: State and Regional Science and Technology Programs - Establishes, within the National Science Foundation, an Intergovernmental Science and Technology Advisory Committee. Provides that the Committee shall advise and assist the Foundation in: (1) identifying and defining civilian problems at the State, regional, and local levels and the environment in which solution to these problems ought to be provided; (2) identifying areas of highest priority for study, assessment, and development of policy alternatives by the Foundation under this title; and (3) identifying and fostering ways to facilitate the transfer and utilization of results of civilian research and development activities so as to maximize the application of science and technology to civilian needs. Authorizes the Director of the National Science Foundation to make grants not to exceed $100,000 to any State to pay a part of the cost of establishing an Office of State Science and Technology. Title V: General Provisions - Authorizes appropriations to carry out the various provisions and titles of this Act."
