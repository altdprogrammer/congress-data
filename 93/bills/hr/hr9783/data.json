    "text": "States that no criminal data bank shall collect, maintain, or disseminate any information identifiable to an individual, unless such information is data which: (1) is recorded by an officer or employee of a criminal justice agency in the performance of official duty; (2) is, under the laws of the State of its origin, open to public inspection; and (3) arises directly from the apprehension, adjudication, confinement, or rehabilitation of a person charged with or convicted of a criminal offense. Sets forth procedures for updating and removing outdated data from criminal data banks. Provides that no criminal data bank shall release any data to any person who is not an official of a criminal justice agency who seeks such data in the course of official business. Requires each criminal data bank to provide for the inspection and challenge by any person of data contained in such criminal data bank and identifiable to that person. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations of the standards set forth under this Act."
