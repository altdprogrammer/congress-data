Provides that contracts shall be designed to assist farm, ranch, or other landowners or operators to make, in orderly progression over a period of years, changes in their cropping systems and land uses which are needed to control erosion and sediment on farms, ranches, and other lands and to install the soil and water conservation measures needed to control erosion, sedimentation, and other pollutants. Authorizes to be appropriated, without fiscal year limitations, such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act."
