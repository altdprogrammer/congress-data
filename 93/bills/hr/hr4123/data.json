Stipulates that the amount which would be payable but for this provision shall be paid to the veteran in a lump sum, except that no payment of a lump sum shall be made to a veteran until after the expiration of six months following a finding of competency and that in the event of the veteran's death before payment of a lump sum, no part thereof shall be payable."
