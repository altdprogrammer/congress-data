    "text": "Provides, under the Freedom of Information Act, that whenever either House of Congress, any committee or subcommittee thereof, any joint committee of Congress, or the Comptroller General of the United States requests an agency or the President of the United States to make available information within its possession or under its control, the head of such agency or the President shall make the information available as soon as practicable, but not later than thirty days from the date of request, unless the information is ordered withheld by the President in a signed statement that the information will be withheld and such statement sets forth the grounds upon which such withholding is based. Provides that whenever such a request for information has been denied and the same requesting body determines that the information requested is needed for the exercise of a valid legislative or investigative function under the Constitution and that the national interest outweighs any possible jeopardy to the need of the President or agency head to obtain candid and forthright advice, the House, committee, or joint committee may pass a resolution empowering the committee counsel or other designated counsel to file a civil suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to compel the agency head, the President, or the witness to supply the requested information or testimony. Grants exclusive jurisdiction to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia of any complaint filed by either House of Congress, any committee thereof, or any joint committee of the Congress pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for the retention of counsel by either House of Congress, any committee thereof, or any joint committee of Congress for purposes of this Act. Provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, of any other law, or of any Executive order, no officer or employee of the executive branch may withhold any information from either House of Congress or any committee or subcommittee thereof if the information requested is relevant to any proceeding connected with the impeachment or subsequent trial of the President, Vice President, or any other civil officer of the United States. Provides penalties for willfully and knowingly distorting or concealing information properly subject to disclosure under this Act."
