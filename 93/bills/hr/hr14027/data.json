Prescribes the procedures for payment of juror travel allowances, toll charges, parking fees, and travel in other than the contiguous States of the United States. Provides that a fixed subsistence allowance covering meals and loging shall be established by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, except that such allowance shall not exceed allowances for supporting court personnel in travel status, and such claims shall not require itemization. States that whenever a jury is ordered to be kept together and not to separate, the actual cost of subsistence during such period shall be paid by the United States marshal upon the order of the court in lieu of subsistence allowances payable."
