Provides that, upon completion of these recommendations and with approval of the Commission, the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Office of Coal Research, is authorized to make grants to nonprofit organizations to construct and operate one pilot plant to demonstrate the gasification process recommended and one pilot plant to demonstrate the liquification process recommended, both of which shall be constructed within the Appalachian region.
