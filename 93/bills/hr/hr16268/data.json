    "text": "Community Mental Health Centers Amendments Act - Enumerates the comprehensive mental health services which shall be provided through a community mental health center. Directs that the provision of comprehensive mental health services through a center shall be coordinated with the provision of services by other health and social service agencies in the center's area. Sets forth the elements to be included in applications for Federal grants to community mental health centers, including assurance that the center will provide an adequate reporting system, provide services responsive to the needs of the local population, develop a plan for adequate financing when assistance under this Act is reduced or terminated, and provide a reasonable volume of services for persons unable to pay for them. Sets forth additional criteria for approval of the application by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to public and nonprofit private community mental health centers to assist them in meeting their costs of operation during the first five years after their establishment. Authorizes the Secretary to make annual grants to any community mental health center for the costs of providing the consultation and education services described in this Act if the center received a staffing grant under this Act or other grants as provided by this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to public and nonprofit private entities to carry out projects to develop community mental health center programs for areas designated by the Secretary as urban or rural poverty areas. Lists authorized appropriations for grants provided under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to make financial distress grants for the operation of community mental health centers. Sets forth criteria for such grants. Authorizes the appropriation of $10,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975 and $10,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976 for such grants. Directs the Secretary to pay the Federal share of projects for: (1) the acquisition and/or remodeling of facilities for community mental health centers; (2) the leasing of facilities for such centers; (3) the construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities for community mental health centers; and (4) the initial equipment of a facility receiving financial assistance through these methods. Sets forth the method of computation of the Federal share. Directs the Secretary, for each fiscal year, to make allotments from the sums appropriated under this Act to the States on the basis of: (1) population; (2) the extent of the need for community mental health centers; and (3) the financial need of the respective States. Provides that such allotment may not be made to a State unless the State has submitted an approved State plan to the Secretary for community mental health centers. Sets forth the necessary elements to be contained in State plans. Provides for judicial review of any disapproval by the Secretary of projects under State plans. Provides for the recovery by the United States of any community mental health center facility remodeled, constructed, or acquired with funds provided under this Act, at any time within twenty years after completion, if such facility: (1) is transferred to any person or entity not qualified to file an application under this Act; or (2) ceases to be used by a community mental health center."
