    "text": "Expresses the finding of Congress that it is in the national interest to encourage the construction and improvement of highways on the Federal-aid system (other than the Interstate System) providing access to rural areas where mining and extraction of mineral resources, including power production activities, to meet the Nation's growing energy needs have been accelerated and thereby have created new transportation demands exceeding existing highway capabilities. Authorizes the making of grants to States for the construction and improvement of such highways. Directs each State highway department to designate substantial energy mining impact areas in the State. Authorizes to be appropriated out of the Highway Trust Fund $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1976, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1977."
