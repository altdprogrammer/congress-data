    "text": "Metric Conversion Act - Declares that the policy of the United States shall be: (1) to facilitate and encourage the substitution of metric measurement units for customary measurement units; (2) to facilitate and encourage the development as rapidly as practicable of new or revised engineering standards based on metric measurement units in those specific fields or areas in the United States where such standards will result in rationalization or simplification of relationships, improvements of design, or increases in economy; (3) to facilitate and encourage the retention in new metric language standards of those United States engineering designs, practices, and conventions that are internationally accepted or embody superior technology; (4) to cooperate with foreign governments and public and private international organizations which are or become concerned with the encouragement and coordination of increased use of metric measurement units or engineering standards based on such units; and (5) to assist the public through specified information and educational programs to become familiar with the meaning and applicability of metric terms and measures in daily life. Establishes a National Metric Conversion Board, consisting of 25 members not more 21 of whom shall be appointed by the President because they are broadly representative of American society. Provides that 2 members of the Board shall be Members of the House of Representatives appointed by the Speaker, and 2 members shall be Members of the Senate appointed by the President of the Senate. Requires the Board, within 12 months after funding, to submit to the President and the Congress a comprehensive plan to accomplish a changeover to the metric system of measurement in the United States, together with legislative recommendations. Authorizes the Board in carrying out its duties to enter into contracts for research, hold hearings, and establish advisory committees. Provides the the Board shall cease to exist no later than ten years after submission of its comprehensive plan. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act."
