    "text": "Provides that when any pay adjustment is prepared and transmitted to Congress by the President and such pay adjustment proposes two or more rates in any of the stautory pay systems which exceed the then current rates of basic pay of level V of the Executive Schedule, and Civil Service Commission shall, immediately before such pay adjustment becomes effective, prescribe the then current rate of basic pay for level V as the rate which, in fact, will be paid to positions of the highest pay standing in the highest grade, class, or pay level in such statutory pay system and shall prescribe lesser rates in descending order of amounts for any positions of lesser pay standing in such highest grade, class, or salary level. Provides that for all positions in each lower grade, class, or pay level for which rates have been proposed in excess of the then current level V rate, the Commission shall prescribe, in the same manner pay rates in descending order of amounts based on relative pay standing within that grade, class, or pay level. Directs the Commission to establish rates of pay which appropriately preserve pay relationships within and between positions, grades, classes, and pay levels in decending order of amounts based on the then current basic pay rate for level V."
