    "text": "Public Documents Act - Provides that all books, correspondence, documents, papers, pamphlets, models, pictures, photographs, plats, maps, films, motion pictures, sound recordings, and other objects or materials which are prepared for or originated by any elected official of the United States in connection with the transaction of public business during any period when such official holds elective office, and which would not have been prepared if such official had not held such office shall be retained by such official for transmission and preservation pursuant to the provisions of this Act. Directs the elected official to transmit any objects or materials which the Administrator of General Services determines to be public documents to the Administrator within one hundred and eighty days after such official ceases to hold his office. Requires the Administrator to deposit the documents in the National Archives, or donate all or any portion of such documents to any educational institution designated by the elected official. States that a decision by the Administrator of General Services that any object or material is a public document of an elected official of the United States within the meaning of this Act shall be a final agency decision. Provides that, not withstanding any other provision of law or any agreement or understanding, the Administrator of General Services shall obtain or retain, as the case may be, complete possession and control of all public documents prepared for or originated by the President of the United States during the period beginning January 20, 1969, and ending August 9, 1974. Directs the Administrator to prescribe regulations governing public access to the documents of former elected officials. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
