Requires that executive privilege shall be invoked only by the President in a signed written statement in which the factual circumstances justifying the invocation of the claim are described, and only in those instances in which (a) the requested testimony or documents contain policy recommendations made directly to the President or agency head, and (b) disclosure of such information would seriously jeopardize the national interest and his ability or that of the agency head to obtain candid and forthright advice."
