Provides that such broadcast time shall be used only for presentations which consist primarily of a substantial live appearance by candidates in a format intended to promote rational political discussion, clarify major campaign issues, or provide insights into the abilities and personal qualities of the candidates. Provides for payment for such broadcasting time by the United States after a broadcast licensee has filed a statement of time, rate, and total amount due with the Comptroller General. Exempts such expenditures from campaign spending limitations. Provides that the Federal Communications Commission shall make regulations to insure cooperation by broadcasters."
