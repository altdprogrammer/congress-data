    "text": "Requires the U.S. Postal Service to establish and assure, to all postal patrons, service standards which include but are not limited to: (1) next-day delivery of mail deposited for delivery within a five-hundred mile radius; (2) delivery within not more than 3 consecutive days of mail deposited for delivery within the U.S. outside a five-hundred mile radius; (3) carrier service, including parcel post delivery, on a six-day-a-week basis; (4) post office window service on a six-day-a-week basis; (5) second-attempt delivery of parcel post. Provides for this payment out of the general fund of the Treasury of public service costs for providing a maximum degree of effective postal service nationwide in communities where post offices may not be deemed self-sustaining, and in complying with the standards set forth under this Act. Requires the Postal Service annually, in requesting authorizations, to present to the appropriate legislative and appropriations committees of the Congress a comprehensive statement of its compliance with the public service cost policy established under this Act. Requires those committees, in addition, to annually conduct a comprehensive review of the administrative and managerial practices used by the Postal Service to implement the service standards set forth in this Act. (Amends 39 U.S.C. 101(b), 2401 (b), (c); Repeals 39 U.S.C. 3627)"
