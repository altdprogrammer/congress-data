    "text": "Arctic Oil and Natural Gas Act - Sets forth the findings of Congress and a declaration of policy. Authorizes the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a thorough study of an overland pipeline route from the North Slope across northeastern Alaska and through Canada to the midwest section of the United States for recovering and delivering to the continental United States petroleum reserves located on the North Slope of Alaska. Directs the Comptroller to make an objective comparison study of the trans-Canada pipeline route with the trans-Alaska pipeline route, including marine transport to the Continental United States. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into negotiations with the Government of Canada to determine the feasibility and availability of a right-of-way across Canadian territory for the construction and operation of transmission facilities for the petroleum reserves on the North Slope of Alaska. Delays granting a right-of-way, easement, or special land use permit for pipeline construction until after January 1, 1974 or until after the end of the 180 day period beginning on the date of enactment whichever is later. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to grant special land use permits for pipeline construction unless the Congress adopts a concurrent resolution disapproving the route."
