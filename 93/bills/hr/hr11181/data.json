Defines the terms used in this Act. Directs the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to initiate, support and carry out basic and applied research and development in solar heating and cooling technologies. Provides for the installation of solar heating systems in residential dwellings under the monitoring of the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the National Bureau of Standards and in consultation with the Secretaries of Housing and Urban Development and Defense. Provides that such residential dwellings shall be located in a sufficient number of different geographic areas (not less than three) in the United States to assure a realistic and effective demonstration of solar heating and cooling systems involved. Directs the Director of the National Science Foundation to initiate, support and fund basic and applied research activities related to solar energy in support of the objectives of this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of up to $50,000,000 to carry out this Act."
