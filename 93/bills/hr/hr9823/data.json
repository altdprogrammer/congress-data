Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Treasury to determine the amount of revenues they anticipate will be received from the sale of Federal migratory bird hunting stamps, and to determine whether such revenues will be sufficient, together with other revenues in the migratory bird conservation fund, to pay the principal of and interest on any obligations issued under this Act and the premium, if any, upon redemption. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
