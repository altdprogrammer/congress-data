Authorizes grants to institutions of higher education for the tuition and fees of grantees. Provides a basis for the allocation of funds for sabbatical leave grants among the several States. Renders ineligible for such grants study at schools of divinity. Prohibits Federal control over the educational institutions involved in the program. Authorizes $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1974, and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years thereafter to carryout the provisions of this Act."
