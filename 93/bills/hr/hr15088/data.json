Provides for the distribution to food stores of coupons in denominations under fifty cents in order to eliminate use of non-transferable change slips in connection with such Act. Prohibits the amounts determined by the Secretary of Agriculture as necessary to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet from being less than the amount which the Agricultural Research Service determines to be necessary to permit a comparable household to purchase the kinds and amounts of food specified in the middle cost food plan of such service. Prohibits a charge to recipients of more than 20 percent (now 30 percent) of cost of food stamp coupons."
