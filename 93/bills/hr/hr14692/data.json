    "text": "District of Columbia Urban Homestead Act - Sets forth the findings of Congress and defines the terms used in this Act. Establishes the District of Columbia Homesteading Commission composed of nine members appointed by the Commissioner of the District of Columbia with the advice and consent of the District of Columbia Council. Requires that members appointed be representative of various interest groups in the District of Columbia. Requires the assessor of the District of Columbia to maintain a list of single-family dwellings which are eligible for sale under the provisions of D. C. law that pertain to the sale of property for unpaid taxes. Declares that the Commissioner shall offer the dwellings on the list for sale to the record owner and to any recorded lien holder for six months before all right, title, and interest, in the dwelling or land shall be transferred to the Commission with all right of redemption, foreclosure, or claim being extinguished in all persons. Provides that the Commission shall convey the dwellings or land transferred to it under this Act to qualified low-income and moderate-income applicants, with a lottery conducted if more than one qualified applicant applies for the same dwelling or land. Requires the applicant to pay $1 and to enter into an agreement stating that he will (1) construct or rehabilitate and reside in the dwelling as his principal residence for a period of at least five years; (2) maintain the dwelling so as to satisfy all the requirements of applicable District of Columbia law; (3) pay the amounts agreed upon between the owner-applicant and a financial institution; (4) carry adequate fire and liability insurance on the dwelling at all times; (5) permit inspections of the dwelling to be made at reasonable times by agents of the Commission to determine the progress of the rehabilitation; and (6) comply with reasonable terms imposed by the Commission. Declares that Bolling Air Force Base and the Anacostia Naval Air Station, except land approved for development by the Department of Defense shall be among the lands eligible to be conveyed by the Commission. Authorizes to be appropriated not more than $2,500,000 to carry out the purposes of this Act."
