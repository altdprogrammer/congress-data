Authorizes to be appropriated the sum of $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 1974 and for each of the next five fiscal years for the purposes of this Act. Provides that the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration shall make a study of the needs and efficiency of the local police force of each consenting unit of general local government which has a population in excess of 10,000 in descending order of each such unit's crime problem. Outlines provisions to be included in such a study and the methodology to be followed in the conduct of the study. Authorizes the Administration to make grants to units of local government with respect to which a study has been made, in order to enable that unit to make additions to its police force, consistent with the findings and recommendations of the study. Provides that no grant shall be used to diminish the level of local efforts and resources allocated to police manpower purposes. Provides for direct emergency aid to units of local government when the level of narcotic addict-related crime in their jurisdictions reaches emergency proportions. Authorizes the Administration to make grants to units of local government in order to enable such units to implement plans for a broad range of medically sound programs for the treatment of addicts. Defines the terms used in this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1974, and such sums thereafter as may be necessary, for narcotic addict treatment and rehabilitation programs under this Act."
