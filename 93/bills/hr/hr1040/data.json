    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1973-01-03", 
    "text": "Tax Equity Act - Title I: Capital Gains and Losses - Disallows the alternative tax on capital gains. Excludes from gross income so much of the gain on the sale or exchange of property held for more than twelve months as does not exceed the smaller of: (1) an amount equal to one-third of one percent of the adjusted basis of such property times the number of full months the property was held after the date it was held for twelve months; or (2) an amount equal to sixty percent of such adjusted basis of the property. States that capital losses with respect to a corporation shall be allowed only to the extent of gains for the taxable year from the sale or exchange of capital assets and property used in the trade or business. Provides that capital losses in the case of other taxpayers shall be allowed only to the extent of gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets and property used in a trade or business plus the taxable income of the taxpayer or $1000 ($500 in the case of a separate return of a married individual), whichever is smaller. Establishes criteria for determining capital loss carrybacks and carryovers. Defines the terms \"capital gain\", \"capital loss\", \"net capital gain\", and \"net capital loss\". Provides that if carryover basis property is acquired from a decedent dying after June 30, 1973, then the basis of such property in the hands of the person so acquiring it shall be the adjusted basis of the property immediately before the death of the decedent. Creates methods for adjusting such basis. Requires every executor to furnish information to the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate regarding: (1) the name and last address of the decedent; (2) the name and address of each person acquiring property from the decedent; and (3) the adjusted basis of each such item in the hands of the decedent immediately before his death. States that amounts received by a seller as transferor of a patent shall be treated as royalties from such patent and not as gain from the sale or exchange of property. Title II: Income Derived from Extraction of Minerals - Terminates the depletion allowance for minerals effective after the taxable year ending December 31, 1973. Allows a taxpayer a deduction for income expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year for the exploration or development of any mineral property. Removes the imposition of a maximum tax relating to the sale of oil or gas properties. Establishes criteria for determining income from mineral properties located outside the United States. Title III: Reform Measures Affecting Primarily Individuals - Imposes a fifty percent maximum tax rate on the income of individuals whose income exceeds $44,000. Allows a twenty-four percent tax credit for personal exemptions and nonbusiness deduction. Permits the President to adjust this percentage if he deems it to be in the public interest. Provides that income received during the taxable year by a child from a trust or dividends, interest, and royalties shall be included in the gross income of the parent and not the child of the parent who claims the child as an exemption. Eliminates the $100 dividend exclusion. Reduces from $25,000 to $5,000 the limitation on the deduction of interest on investment indebtedness. Disallows deductions in specified instances for expenses incurred while attending conventions outside the United States. Limits deductions for an individual engaged in farming. Provides that, in computing dividends, a distribution by a common parent corporation of a controlled group of corporations, the earnings and profits of the common parent corporation for the taxable year shall not be less than its share of the earnings and profits of the controlled group computed on a consolidated basis. Repeals the provision granting an exemption for earned income from foreign sources. Title IV: Reform Measures Affecting Primarily Corporations - Provides that the reasonable allowance for depreciation shall be computed on the basis of the expected useful life of property in the hands of the taxpayers. States that the depreciation deduction is not to exceed book depreciation and is to be limited to the amount recorded on books. Establishes criteria for computing limitations on dividends received deductions. Denies tax-free exchanges in the case of investment companies. Requires shareholders of any corporation to hold at least twenty percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the surviving, controlling, or acquiring corporation in order for the transaction to qualify as a reorganization. Provides that if a foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation for an uninterrupted period of thirty days or more during any taxable year, every person who is s United States shareholder of such corporation who owns stock in such corporation on the last day in such year on which such corporation is a controlled foreign corporation shall include in his gross income, for his taxable year in which or with which such taxable year of the corporation ends, his pro rata share of the corporation's earnings and profits for such year. Title V: Reforms Affecting Individuals and Corporations - Imposes, generally, in addition to other taxes, with respect to the income of every person, a tax of 10 percent of the amount (if any) by which the sum of the items of tax preference exceeds $12,000. Disallows, in the case of depreciable realty, the deduction for depreciation to the extent it would reduce the adjusted basis of the property at the end of the year below an amount equal to any mortgage indebtedness at the end of the year on the property minus the adjusted basis of the land allocable to such property. Makes provision for the treatment of charitable gifts of appreciated property and capital expenditures incurred in planting and developing fruit and nut groves. Repeals the tax exemption for ships under foreign flag. Title VI: Estate Tax Amendments - Imposes a tax on the transfer of the taxable estate of every decedent who was a citizen or resident of the United States at the time of his death. Provides that in the case of an estate of a decedent who made taxable gifts before death, a tax shall be imposed in an amount equal to the excess of: (1) a tax computed in accordance with the rate schedule set forth on the amount of the taxable estate increased by the amount of the adjusted inter vivos gifts; (2) a tax computed in accordance with such rate schedule on the amount of such adjusted inter vivos gifts as if the taxable estate were equal to such amount. Includes life insurance policies in the gross estate of a decedent. Title VII: State and Local Obligations - Repeals the exemption for interest on issues of State and local banks occurring after December 31, 1973. Provides that the United States shall pay fifty percent of the interest yield on each issue of State and local banks occurring after December 31, 1973."
