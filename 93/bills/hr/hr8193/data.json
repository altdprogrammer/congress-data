Requires that the quantity of oil to be carried in United States flag commercial vessels be 25 percent after June 30, 1975, and 30 percent after June 30, 1977. Amends 46 U.S.C. 1241 Provides that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to refineries whose total refinery capacity (including the refinery capacity of any person who controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such refiner) does not exceed 30,000 barrels per day. Provides that, with respect to the percentage of petroleum and petroleum products required to be imported on United States flag commercial vessels, the Secretary of Commerce may by rule establish reasonable classifications of persons and imports subject thereto, and persons in the same classification shall be treated in substantially the same manner. Provides that any person alleging that he is incorrectly classified under such rule, or that there is no reasonable basis in fact for such classification, or that he is by any agency action treated differently from other persons in the same classification, may obtain agency review of such incorrect classification or agency action, with review to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Sets forth regulations with respect to license fees payable pursuant to Presidential proclamation for imports of crude oil, residual fuel oil, and residual oil. Provides that not less than 10 percent of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the foreign trade requirements of the United States pursuant to the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 shall be allocated for the foreign trade requirements of the Atlantic, Gulf, Great Lakes, and Pacific ports."
