    "text": "Declares the finding of the Congress that sex discrimination in education is detrimental to the welfare of the Nation since it limits the potential of all citizens and that women in particular are prevented by the existence of such practice from realizing their full potential. Requires, under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, that applicants for funds provide assurances that Federal funds made available under such Act for any fiscal year shall be used, on a priority basis and where possible, in the acquisition of non-sex-biased library resources, textbooks, and other instructional materials. Authorizes funds under such Act for demonstration projects designed to promote new approaches to expand educational opportunities for women, including the provision of comprehensive physical education programs and sports activities for women. Sets minimal requirements under such Act for percentages of funds of grants made thereunder to be used in programs or projects designed to meet special educational needs of female children."
