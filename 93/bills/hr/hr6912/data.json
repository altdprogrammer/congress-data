Provides for the repeal of those provisions in the Gold Reserve Act relating to the titles and acquisition of gold. States that no provision of any law in effect on the date of enactment of this Act, and no rule, regulation, or order under authority of any such law, may be construed to prohibit any person from purchasing, holding, selling, or otherwise dealing with gold. States that this Act shall take effect when the President finds and reports to the Congress that international monetary reform shall have proceeded to the point where elimination of regulations on private ownership of gold will not adversely affect the United States international monetary position. States that the Congress finds that: (1) mobile capital can have a significant impact on the proper functioning of the international monetary system; and (2) it is important to have complete data on the nature of these capital flows, including transactions by large United States business enterprises and their foreign affiliates. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to require reports and foreign currency transactions that will provide such data on foreign currency for those who fail to submit such data. Provides a civil penalty of $10,000 and authorizes the Secretary to seek injunctive relief for violations of this Act."
