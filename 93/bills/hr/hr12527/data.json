Defines \"inflation allowance\" as such portion of any gain upon the sale or exchange of property as has resulted from monetary inflation, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. Prescribes how the inflation allowance shall be calculated. States that, for purposes of this Act, the destruction, theft, seizure, requisition, or condemnation of property shall be treated as the sale of such property."
