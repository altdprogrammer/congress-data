Stipulates that, subject to the approval to the county committee, the amount of any loan isured under this Act shall be determined by the lender, but in no case shall such amount exceed $250,000. Sets forth requirements pertaining to the insurance of loans and to the rate of interest payments to be made. Establishes the Livestock Feeders Insurance Fund, which shall be used by the Secretary as a revolving fund for the discharge of obligations of the Secretary under the provisions of this Act. Directs the Secretary to utilize the fund: (1) to make loans which can be insured under this Act whenever he has reasonable assurance that they can be sold without undue delay, and he may sell and insure such loans; (2) to pay amounts to which the holder of insured notes is entitled on loans accruing between the date of any payments by the borrower and the date of transmittal of any such payments to the holder; and/or (3) to pay to the holder of insured notes any defaulted installment, or upon assignment of the note to the Secretary at the Secretary's request, the entire balance due on the loan."
