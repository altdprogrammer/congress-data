States that, after notice has been filed as specified under this chapter by any person entitled to a lien under this chapter, the owner shall return out of any subsequent payments becoming due to the original contractor a sufficient amount to satisfy any indebtedness due from such original contractor to such person secured by such lien, otherwise such person shall be entitled to enforce a lien to the extent of the amount so accruing to the original contractor notwithstanding any other provision of this Act. States that the proceeding to enforce the lien hereby given shall be a bill in equity. Establishes a penalty for any contractor or subcontractor who misappropriates any funds paid by the owner of the premises, pursuant to a contract, to any such contractor or subcontractor."
