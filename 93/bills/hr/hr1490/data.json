Provides that such agreement shall not prevent the stevedore or any person who supplies work of the ship's service from contributing to a settlement of any third-party suit brought under the Act. States that, upon payment of any judgment or settlement paid in satisfaction of any third-party suit brought because of injury of any employee in work of the ship's service, the vessel may sue any other person who may have caused or contributed in whole or in part to the vessel's liability for such injury to the employee. Provides that, in any such suit, damages shall be apportioned between the vessel and any other person who shall have caused or contributed to the vessel's liability. Provides that nothing in this Act shall reduce any rights of any injured person under the doctrime of warranty of seaworthiness, negligence, comparative negligence, General Maritime Law, or other compensation law which existed prior to the enactment of Public Law 92-576 or subject to any injured party to any apportionment.
