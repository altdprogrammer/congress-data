Provides that the maximum amount of coverage which may purchased under this program is $30,000 for any Structure, and $5,000 for contents of any separate dwelling or business unit within any structure. Provides that one-third of the premium amount due under this program shall be paid by the Secretary from appropriated funds in the form of a subsidy to the insured. Establishes a fund in the Treasury to be used by the Secretary for his operating and capital expenses under this Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
