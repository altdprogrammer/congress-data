Sets forth the requirements under which the Secretary of the Interior shall approve applications for waivers, including: (1) that the mine has no more than five miners; (2) that the miners shall have knowingly elected to work underground in the mine; (3) that the mine is above the water table; and (4) that a substantial portion of the mined coal is consumed locally for space heating. Authorizes the Secretary to revoke a waiver for noncompliance with the mining requirements set forth in this Act."
