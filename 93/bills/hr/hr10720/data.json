    "text": "Establishes an eleven member United States Metric Conversion Coordinating Commission. Charges the Commission with the responsibility of implementing, with the voluntary participation of every interested sector and group in the United States, the recommendations of the United States metric study, undertaken pursuant to the Act approved August 9, 1968, including: (1) that the United States change to the international metric system deliberately and carefully; (2) that this be done through a coordinated national program; (3) that detailed plans and timetables be worked out, within the guiding framework established and from time to time revised by the Commission, by the various sectors and interests of the society themselves; (4) that priority be given to educational programs to be carried out in the Nation's elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher learning, as well as with the public at large, which shall be designed to enable all Americans to think and work in metric terms; (5) that the appropriate representatives of American enterprise participate in international standards activities; (6) that in order to encourage efficiency and minimize the overall costs to society, the general rule should be that any changeover costs shall lie where they fall; (7) that the Commission establish such committees and advisory panels as it deems necessary to work with the various sectors of the American economy and governmental agencies in the implementation of the international metric system; and (8) that the target date for full conversion shall be January 1, 1994. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
