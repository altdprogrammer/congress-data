Provides that such priority primary routes selected shall be improved to geometric and construction standards for the Interstate system, or to such other standards as may be developed cooperatively by the Secretary and the State highway departments in the same manner as are standards developed for the Interstate system. Authorizes appropriations out of the Highway Trust Fund of $300,000,000 annually for fiscal years 1974-1975 to carry out the purposes of this Act. (Adds 23 U.S.C. 145)"
