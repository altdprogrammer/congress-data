    "text": "Special Unemployment Compensation Act - Declares it to be the purpose of this Act to establish a Federal unemployment law providing a temporary program of supplemental unemployment assistance to workers affected by adverse economic conditions in areas of aggravated unemployment. Provides that each State which enters into an agreement with the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to which it makes payments of special unemployment assistance, shall be paid by the the United States in such amounts as are deemed necessary by the Secretary to carry out the provisions of this Act in the State. Provides that a State shall not be eligible to enter into such an agreement with the Secretary for any week in which specified conditions exist. States that an individual shall be eligible to receive a payment of special assistance or waiting period credit with respect to a week of unemployment occuring during and subsequent to a special unemployment period in accordance with the provisions of this Act if the individual meets the specified requirements, including the exhaustion of all rights to compensation under all State unemployment compensation and other laws. Provides for the periods of time to be covered for special unemployment assistance under this Act. States that a special unemployment assistance period shall commence in an area designated by the Secretary with the third week after the first week for which there is an \"on\" indicator for such area, and shall terminate with the third week after the first week for which there is an \"off\" indicator for such area. Provides that no special unemployment assistance period shall have a duration of less than 13 weeks. Sets forth the criteria for establishing \"on\" and \"off\" indicators. Prescribes the calculations to be followed in determining the weekly amount of special unemployment benefits and sets maximum benefit amounts. Stipulates that no payment of assistance under this Act shall be made with respect to any week of unemployment ending after March 31, 1976."
