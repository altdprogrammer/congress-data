    "text": "Energy Emergency Employment Act - Expresses the findings of Congress that it is the purpose of this Act to detect unemployment and underemployment as a result of the \"energy crisis\", to provide workers with assistance, to return workers to employment, and to provide areas with particularly heavy energy related joblessness special employment assistance. Title I: Energy Emergency Employment Board - Establishes within the Department of Labor an Energy Emergency Employment Board, consisting of five private members appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and two \"ex officio\" members: the Director of the Federal Energy Office and the Secretary of Labor, who will also serve as Chairman. Enumerates the functions of the Board, including to: (1) oversee the implementation of the energy emergency employment programs authorized in this Act; (2) recommend programs that will return persons unemployed or underemployed, as a result of the energy emergency, to productive full-time employment as rapidly as possible; (3) develop an early energy unemployment warning system; and (4) undertake manpower planning projects to estimate long and short term energy emergency related employment trends. Requires the Board to make reports to the Congress and the President. Title II: Energy Emergency Employment Opportunity Program - Directs the Secretary of Labor to enter into arrangements with public service employers in order to make financial assistance available for the purpose of providing employment opportunities, particularly for persons who are unemployed or underemployed as a result of the energy emergency, in jobs providing needed public services. Sets forth the procedures and requirements to be met by applications for financial assistance for the purpose of carrying out a public service employment program under this Act. Provides that the amounts appropriated pursuant to this Act for any fiscal year shall be allocated by the Secretary in such a manner as prescribed by the Board. Provides that 80 percent of such amount shall be apportioned among the States in that proportion which the total number of persons underemployed or unemployed in each such State bears to such total number of such persons, respectively, in the United States, and the remainder shall be available to carry out a special Energy Emergency Area Employment Assistance Program. States that the Secretary shall not provide financial assistance for any program or activity under this Act unless he determines that specified criteria are met, including that the program: (1) will result in an increase in employment opportunities over those which would otherwise be available; (2) will not result in the displacement of currently employed workers; (3) will not impair existing contracts for services or result in the substitution of Federal or other funds in connection with work that would otherwise be performed; and (4) will not substitute public service jobs for existing federally assisted jobs. Authorizes appropriations for such purposes. Directs the Secretary to develop and carry out a program of incentives to private industry to hire, and train if necessary, persons unemployed or underemployed as a result of the energy emergency. Authorizes to be appropriated such funds as may be necessary to carry out this title. Title III: Energy Emergency Employment Assistance - Provides that any person unemployed or underemployed as a result of the energy emergency may file an application with the Secretary for economic adjustment assistance provided under this title. States that economic adjustment assistance under this title consists of: (1) readjustment allowances; (2) training and counseling benefits; (3) relocation allowances; and (4) health benefits. Prescribes the requirements to be met by an adversely affected worker before readjustment allowances will be paid. Provides that payment or readjustment allowances shall not be made for more than twenty-six weeks, unless upon application to the Secretary for extension, that proof of a good faith effort to attain employment has been made, in which case one additional 26 week extension shall be allowed. Sets forth the qualifying requirements for relocation allowances and health benefits. Authorizes to be appropriated such funds as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this title. Title IV: Definitions - Defines the terms used in this Act, including \"adversely affected worker\" and \"unemployed\" or \"underemployed person.\""
