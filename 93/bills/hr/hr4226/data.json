    "text": "District of Columbia Freeway Airspace Utilization Act - Authorizes the Commissioner of the District of Columbia to permit the use of airspace in the District of Columbia for any municipal purpose; to enter into contracts with the United States for the use of airspace; to agree to grant to the United States easements to use airspace for the purpose of building Federal public buildings; and to enter into leases of, or grant revocable permits for, the use of airspace in the District. Lists the following priorities for the use of such airspace: (1) municipal purposes; (2) low income housing; (3) United States buildings; (4) private and public low and moderate income housing; (5) nonprofit groups for the construction of buildings; and (6) business purposes. Allows the District to call for bids on, or negotiate for, housing for low and moderate income families and for use by nonprofit organizations or for business purposes. Provides that airspace and buildings in that airspace are taxable as real property except that the airspace and buildings of the Federal government are not taxable. Provides that provisions of law applicable to special assessments for public improvements, sanitary sewer charges and water service charges will apply to airspace and structures therein. Provides that prior to any lease, the District of Columbia Zoning Commission, after public hearing, shall issue regulations pertaining to structures therein. Requires the leasee to submit plans and models of proposed structures. Directs the Commissioner to insure that all necessary precautions are taken to protect the environment. Provides for review of plans for construction in airspace by the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts. Directs that costs of relocating public and private facilities because of construction of a building in airspace shall not be borne by the District unless it is construction by the District. Requires that collections received by the District under this Act be deposited in a trust fund in the United States Treasury. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the purposes of this Act."
