States that no license granted for the operation of a station other than a broadcasting station shall be for a longer term than five years. Permits the renewal of any limited term license from time to time for a term not to exceed five years, if the Federal Communications Commission finds that public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served thereby. Authorizes the Commission to prescribe by rule the period for which licenses shall be granted and renewed for particular classes of stations (other than broadcast stations). (Amends 47 U.S.C. 307(d))"
