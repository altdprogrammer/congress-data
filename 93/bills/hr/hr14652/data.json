Allows the excess medical expense for any taxable year to be a medical expense carryback to the 5 preceding taxable years and a carryover to the 5 succeeding taxable years. States that no portion of the excess medical expenses attributable to a taxable year preceding a taxable year in which the taxpayer's tax is determined with regard to the standard deduction may be carried to any suceeding taxable year."
