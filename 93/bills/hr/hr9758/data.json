    "text": "Mid-Air Collision Avoidance Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to require the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to expedite the evaluation and selection of a national standard for a collision avoidance system; proceed to develop plans for operating rules and regulations integrating this system into a ground based air traffic control system; and require the installation of a collision avoidance system of all classes of aircraft by certain dates. States that the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, in cooperation with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Secretary of Defense acting through the Interdepartmental Group on Collision Avoidance and Pilot Warning, shall complete the flight test and evaluation of currently competing airborne collision avoidance systems, as defined in the Federal Aviation Act, and not later than one year thereafter shall select a national standard for such system. Provides that, upon selection of a national standard, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall publish implementation rules and regulations to describe compatible use and operating procedures between CAS systems and the existing air traffic control system. Sets forth minimum standards regarding collision avoidance systems and the specified dates upon which there must be compliance with such standards."
