Authorizes the Secretary to make loans to fish farmers, who have fee title or legal control of the land for the term of the loan, for stocking, practices, facilities, equipment, and other measures necessary for the production, harvesting, and marketing of farm-raised fish under this Act. Provides that for the purpose and objective of consolidating and unifying research for carrying out the fish farming program, there shall be transferred to the Secretary of Agriculture: (1) the programs, facilities, and personnel presently engaged in research into aspects of fish farming for commercial purposes, in the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife in the Department of the Interior; and (2) the programs, facilities, and personnel engaged in research into harvesting, processing, improved gear and equipment design, marketing, and all other related aspects of farm-raised fish for commercial purposes, in the Department of Commerce.
