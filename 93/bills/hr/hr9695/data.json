Establishes an Energy Research Management Project to be composed of specified officials, including the Director of the National Science Foundation, who shall serve as Chairman. Provides that the Management Project shall have an Administrator who shall also serve as the Staff Director. Directs the Management Project to: (1) formulate a comprehensive energy research and development strategy for the Federal Government; (2) utilize the funds authorized by this Act to advance the energy research and development strategy through specified means; (3) identify opportunities to accelerate the commercial application of new energy technologies; and (4) establish procedures for periodic consultation with representatives of science, industry, and environmental organizations, who have special expertise in the areas of energy research. Prescribes the priorities which the Management Project shall follow in evaluating and undertaking research. Provides that where a participant in an energy research and development project holds background patents, trade secrets, or proprietary information which will be employed in and are requisite to the proposed research and development project, the Management Project shall enter into an agreement which will provide equitable protection to the participants' rights. Authorizes the Director of the National Science Foundation to fund basic and applied research related to energy in support of the objectives of this Act. Directs the Administrator to keep the Congress fully and currently informed of all of the Management Project's activities and submit to the Congress an annual report. Authorizes to be appropriated $10,000,000 annually for the administrative expenses of the Management Project. Authorizes to be appropriated not to exceed $800,000,000 for fiscal year 1974, and, subject to annual congressional authorizations, $800,000,000 for each of the four following fiscal years to carry out the provisions of this Act relating to the advancement of energy research and development. Title II: Declares that it is the policy of the Federal Government to bring the resources of technology to commercial development by establishing a Government-industry corporation jointly managed and funded to work in conjunction with the Energy Research Management Project created by title I of this Act. Establishes the Energy Research Management Project Corporation. Provides for a Board of Directors and President of such Corporation. Makes it the function of the Corporation, on the basis of the research programs established by the Energy Research Management Project, to construct demonstration-type facilities in order to determine the environmental, economical, and technical feasibility thereof. States that energy produced by such commercial facilities shall be disposed of in such manner and under such terms and conditions as the Corporation shall prescribe. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Corporation, for fiscal year 1974, $6,000,000, and for each of the next nine succeeding fiscal years such sums as may be necessary."
