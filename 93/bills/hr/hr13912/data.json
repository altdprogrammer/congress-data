Requires a District Court to give adequate and reasonable notice upon the impanelment of the grand jury concerning specified information, including: the grand jury's duty to inquire into offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, which have been committed within that district; its authority to make independent inquiry; its right to question witnesses; its right to request production of documents; its rights with respect to an independent inquiry and such other duties and rights as the court deems advisable. Permits an impaneled grand jury to inquire of its own initiative about offenses against the United States. Outlines the term of service of the grand jury. Authorizes the court appointment of a special attorney to assist the grand jury if so requested. Specifies that such attorney shall have the exclusive authority to assist the grand jury, and shall sign any indictment returned by such jury. Outlines special rights of grand jury witnesses with regard to subpoena, testimony, counsel, scope of investigation and self-incrimination. Permits immunity from prosecution in specified circumstances for any witness who is compelled to produce or testify before the grand jury. Specifies those instances in which a U.S. District Court may issue an order compelling a witness to testify. Sets forth the general rules governing immunity of witnesses. Requires the Attorney General to annually report to the Congress and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts specified information concerning grand jury investigations."
