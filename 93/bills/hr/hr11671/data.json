Title III: Mortgage Corporations - Allows, under the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act, the purchase of a conventional mortgage with the outstanding balance exceeding 80 percent of value when the excess over 80 percent is insured by a qualified private insurer. Provides that national banks, state-chartered banks which are members of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal Saving and Loan Associations, and Federal credit unions have statutory power to purchase mortgages, obligations or other securitites which are sold or ever have been sold by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation without regard to limitations which might be otherwise applicable to purchase of such mortgages, obligations or other securities. Increases, under the National Housing Act, the maximum mortgage purchase limit for the Government National Mortgage Association from $22,000 to $33,000.
