    "text": "Deepwater Pool Facilities Act. Provides that no citizen of the United States may construct or operate or make any significant addition to a deepwater port facility without first receiving a license from the Secretary of the Interior. Authorizes the Secretary to issue to any citizen of the United States a license to construct or operate a deepwater port facility if he first determines that: (1) the applicant is financially responsible and has demonstrated his ability and willingness to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and license conditions; (2) the construction and operation of the proposed deepwater port facility will not unreasonably interfere with international navigation or other reasonable uses of the high seas, and is consistent with the international obligations of the United States; and (3) the facility will be located, constructed, or operated in a manner which will minimize or prevent any adverse significant environmental effects. Directs the Secretary not to issue a license in any case where the President determines that it would be contrary to the national security of the United States. Authorizes the Secretary to issue reasonable rules and regulations governing application for and issuance of licenses and the construction and operation of deepwater port facilities under this Act. Declares that an application filed with the Secretary for a license under this Act shall constitute an application for all Federal authorizations required for construction and operation of a deepwater port facility. States that any person adversely affected by an order of the Secretary granting or denying a license may within sixty days after such order is issued seek judicial review thereof in the United States court of appeals for the circuit nearest to wich the facility is sought to be located. Directs the Secretary to prescribe by regulation the procedures, including appropriate charges, for the submission and consideration of applications for licenses. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Provides that whenever a licensee fails to comply with any provision of this Act or any rule, regulation, restriction, or condition made or imposed by the Secretary under the authority of this Act or fails to pay any civil penalty assessed by the Secretary except where a proceeding for judicial review of such assessment is pending, the Secretary may file an appropriate action in a United States district court to (1) suspend operations under the license or (2) if such failure is knowing and continues for a period of thirty days after the Secretary mails notice of such failure by registered letter to the licensee at his post office address, revoke such license."
