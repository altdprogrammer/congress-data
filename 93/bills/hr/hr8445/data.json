States that the readjustment allowance payable to an employee for a week of unemployment shall be an amount equal to seventy-five percent of his average weekly wage, reduced by fifty percent of the amount of his remuneration for services performed during such week. Limits payment of readjustment allowances to a period not to exceed fifty-two weeks. Requires employees who apply for a readjustment allowance to also apply for counseling, training, and placement assistance. Provides for the payment of training and relocation allowances. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
