    "text": "Nondiscriminatory Education Act - Asserts that the right of elementary and secondary education students to attend their neighborhood schools shall not be abridged by any Federal authority based upon the race, creed, color, religion, or national origin of the student. Provides that each local nondiscriminatory system shall have the right to determine their own attendance zones without interference from Federal authority as long as they are reasonably drawn to serve the needs of the community and no effort is made by drawing such attendance zones to force a student to attend a particular school because of his race, creed, religion, or national origin. Makes the following acts illegal: (1) the operation of any school system receiving public support other than a nondiscriminatory-school system; (2) the forced closing of any school for the purpose of forcing any student or group of students into a different school for the purpose of altering the racial or ethnic makeup of the student body; (3) the pairing of schools; and (4) forcing a child to leave his neighborhood school to attend another more distant because of his race, color, creed, religion, or national origin. States that any person who violates the provisions of the Act shall be subject to imprisonment for not more than one year or fined not more than $1,000, or both."
