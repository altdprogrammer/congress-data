Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, by regulation and after a hearing, to disallow such deduction with respect to any solid waste material if the Administrator finds that such deduction is not required to alleviate the depletion of any virgin natural resource. Allows every taxpayer, at his election in lieu of any depreciation deduction, to deduct the amortized basis of any solid waste recycling facility based on a period of 60 months. Provides that the taxpayer may, at any time after making such election, discontinue the amortization deduction with respect to the remainder of the amortization. (Adds 26 U.S.C. 189, 190)"
