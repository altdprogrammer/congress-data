    "text": "Federal Election Campaign Reform Act - Prescribes a formula for determining how much candidates for Federal elective office may spend in elections for all purposes, for communication media, and for broadcast media. Requires expenditures in excess of $100 on behalf of Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates to be approved by a representative of the party national committee. States that no authorized committee may accept contributions from other than individuals or political party organizations. Sets a $25,000 limit which such contributions may not exceed for a Presidential election and $5,000 for other Federal offices. Limits cash contributions to $100. Requires that contributions go only to the authorized committee of a candidate. Limits the purposes for which contributions may be expended. Provides that violators of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 shall be ineligible to hold any Federal office."
