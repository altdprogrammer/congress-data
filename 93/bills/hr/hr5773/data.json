Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire lands, waters, and interests therein by donation, purchase, transfer, or exchange. Requires the Secretary to cooperate with the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to assure that land donated by NASA is not used so as to interfere with the space program. Allows private landowners within the Seashore to retain rights of use and occupancy in their land for noncommercial residential purposes for 25 years. Grants condemnation authority to the Secretary to acquire clear and marketable title to land within the Seashore. Directs the Secretary to allow hunting, fishing, and trapping on lands and waters within the Seashore, except that he may designate zones where these activities are not allowed. Requires that the principal visitor center in the Seashore be named the \"Spessard L. Holland Visitor Center.\" Creates the Canaveral National Seashore Advisory Council to consult with and advise the Secretary on matters pertaining to the Seashore. States that those portions of the John F. Kennedy Space Center falling within the Seashore shall become a part of such Seashore. Authorizes necessary appropriations, but not more than $7,941,000, for acquisition of lands."
