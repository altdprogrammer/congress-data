    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1973-05-30", 
    "text": "Interstate Recycling Expansion Act - States the finding of the Congress that existing practices and procedures are preventing, impeding, and adversely affecting the reclamation, recycling, and reuse of materials from solid waste, unnecessarily increasing the problems and costs of solid waste disposal, and contributing to the depletion of precious natural resources. Sets forth the purposes and definitions of this Act. Title I: Establishment of Nondiscriminatory Rates and Charges for the Transportation of Recyclable and Recycled Solid Waste Materials in Interstate and Foreign Commerce - Directs the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Maritime Commission to investigate all freight rate discriminations against recyclable commodities and within two years to issue appropriate orders terminiating such unreasonable discrimination in transportation charges. Requires such Commissions to annually file reports with the President and the Congress regarding their respective investigations and actions under this title. Title II: Expansion of Recycling through Federal Procurement - Directs all Federal procurement agencies to work closely with the Environmental Protection Agency in the establishment of new rules and procedures to maximize the procurement of recyclable materials and products which contain recycled materials. Title III: Modification of Other Federal Impediments to Expanded Recycling in Commerce - Directs that labels under the Wool Products Labeling Act shall use the term recycled rather than reused or reprocessed. Title IV: Protection of Domestic Resources - Requires the Secretary of Commerce to issue regulations limiting the exportation of raw materials, both natural and recycled, where his investigation shows such exportation will cause: (1) a domestic shortage which deprives United States industry of its raw materials; or (2) where the effect of such exportation is inflationary. Title V: Miscellaneous - Provides that the provisions of this Act shall become effective on the date of enactment of this Act."
