    "text": "Protective Services and Adoption Information Exchange Amendment - Requires the provision of certain protective services under State plans for aid to families with dependent children and for child welfare services. States (1) that the State agency will provide protective services as necessary to aid the prevention, identification, and treatment of child neglect and abuse, and wherever possible make the home suitable for the child to live in, and (2) that where the State agency has reason to believe that the home in which a relative and child receiving aid reside is unsuitable because of the neglect, abuse, or exploitation of such child it shall bring such condition to the attention of the appropriate court or law enforcement agencies in the State, providing such data with respect to the situation as it may have. Authorizes the Secretary to provide information, utilizing computers and modern data processing methods, through a national adoption information exchange system to aid in the placement of children awaiting adoption and in location of children for persons who wish to adopt children, including cooperative efforts with any similar programs. Authorizes appropriations of 1,000,000 for fiscal year 1973 and such sums as may be necessary for succeeding fiscal years to carry out the purposes of this Act."
