Limits such credit, in the case of taxpayers other than corporations, to the lesser of 20 percent of the taxpayers total tax or $100. Places such limit at 10 percent of a corporation's total tax or $5,000 whichever is less. Bars treatment of a contribution as both a tax deduction and a tax credit and specifies that the credit is not to result in a tax refund."
