    "text": "Medical Records Privacy Act - Title I: The Federal Medical Privacy Board - Establishes an independent executive agency to be known as the Federal Medical Privacy Board. Grants subpena powers to the Board to acquire testimony and records. Title II: Federal Agency Medical Privacy Requirements - Requires the Board to establish by regulation medical privacy requirements designed to protect, to the maximum extent feasible, the confidentiality of the medical information contained in personal medical records maintained by Federal agencies, such requirements to include limitations on agencies on the acquiring, maintenance, dissemination, and review of such records. Requires opportunity for subjects of such records to inspect and correct them. Requires the Board to establish regulations on medical records access applicable to agencies which have access to non-Federal personal medical records. Empowers the Board to investigate noncompliance by agencies with this Act, and to institute adjudicatory and judicial proceedings, where necessary, to insure compliance. Permits subjects of medical records to require compliance with this Act by agencies, and to seek judicial relief where the Board fails to achieve agency compliance. Title III: State Medical Privacy Programs - Authorizes the Board to make grants to States for medical privacy programs, where such programs are certified under this title. Sets forth requirements, similar to those imposed on Federal agencies, to be met by States in order to be certified."
