    "text": "States that if an Indian tribe or community, after consultations with the Secretary of the Interior, requests that it be given the control or operation of a program or service administered by the Secretary, the Secretary shall, within one hundred and twenty days from such request or such later date as may be agreed to by the Secretary and the organization, transfer such control or operation to the Indian tribal organization. Provides that no such transfer may be made unless the Secretary has determined that the tribes or communities involved have obtained general public liability insurance, motor vehicle insurance, and other appropriate insurance which shall provide coverage to the tribes or communities in amounts which shall be comparable to the minimum insurance coverage carried by other persons or organizations in the same general areas. Provides that for each fiscal year during which an Indian tribal organization engages in an activity pursuant to any program or service transferred to it under this Act, the Indian tribal organization shall submit a report to the Secretary including an accounting of the amounts and purposes for which Federal funds were expended. Establishes procedures for the reassumption of any program or service which was assumed by an Indian tribal organization under this Act."
