    "text": "Congressional Right to Information Act - Provides, under the Legislative Reorganization Act, that the head of every Federal agency shall keep each committee of the Congress and the subcommittees thereof fully and currently informed with respect to all matters relating to that agency which are within the jurisdiction of such committee or subcommittee. Requires the head of a Federal agency, on request of a committee of the Congress or a subcommittee thereof or on request of two-fifths of the members thereof, to submit any information requested of such agency head relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee or subcommittee. States that when an officer or employee of the United States is summoned to testify or to produce information, records, documents, or other material before either House of Congress or a committee of the Congress, that officer shall appear at the time and place specified and shall answer all questions and produce all information sought unless the President formally and expressly instructs the officer or employee in writing to withhold the information requested. Provides that if a House of Congress or a committee of Congress determines upon consideration of the Presidential instruction that the information requested is needed to enable it to exercise a legislative function under the Constitution, it shall prepare a written report setting forth such determination. Authorizes the issuance of subpoenas to compel attendance in such cases. Sets forth the procedures to be followed if there is a failure to comply with this Act, including introduction of a resolution or concurrent resolution citing such failure. Prescribes the procedure for motions to proceed to the consideration of the resolution or concurrent resolution, motions to postpone and appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to application of rules to the procedures. Provides for judicial review in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia of actions brought pursuant to this Act. States that each House of Congress and the standing committees and the joint committees shall take appropriate measures to insure the confidentiality of any information which requires protection against disclosure which would endanger personal privacy or the conduct of the national defense, foreign policy, or law enforcement activities."
