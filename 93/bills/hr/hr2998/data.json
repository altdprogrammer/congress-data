Provides that this Act shall not apply to records that are: (1) specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of the national security; (2) investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes; and (3) interagency or intraagency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency possessing such memoranda or letters in litigation with such agency. Provides that any employee of the United States who under the color of agency authority knowingly and willfully violates a provision of this Act, or permits such a violation, shall be fined $1,000. Establishes a Federal Privacy Board to aid in the administration of this Act."
