    "text": "Revises the Internal Revenue Code by excluding from gross income, in the case of a physician who practices medicine in a physician shortage area, the adjusted gross income from such practice in such area to the extent of: (1) $15,000 during the first taxable year of such practice; (2) $12,500 during the second taxable year of such practice; (3) $10,000 during the third taxable year of such practice; (4) $7,500 during the fourth taxable year of such practice; and (5) $5,000 during the fifth taxable year of such practice. States that such exclusion shall apply to a physician with respect to practice in a physician shortage area only if he continuously engages in such practice for at least 2 years, commencing with the day on which he first engages in such practice. Provides that the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare shall, on or before November 1 of each year (beginning with 1972), certify the physician shortage areas (if any) in each State for the following calendar year."
