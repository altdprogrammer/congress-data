Provides under the Communications Act that the Federal Communications Commission in acting upon the applications for renewal of broadcast licenses may not consider the application of any other person for the facilities for which renewal is sought if the Commissioner finds that the public interest, convenience and necessity would be served by granting the renewal application to the present operator. Provides that if the Commissioner determines that the renewal applicant would not be in the public interest it may deny such application and accept other applications."
