Sets forth a formula to determine the amount of reimbursement to which any eligible candidate for the office of President, Vice President, Senator, or Representative shall be entitled. Establishes in the Treasury of the United States a special fund to be known as the Federal Election Campaign Finance Fund. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided by appropriation Acts, to transfer to the Fund such sums as the Congress may appropriate to insure that moneys in the Fund will be adequate to meet entitlements of eligible candidates. Entitles any eligible candidate to receive reimbursements from the Fund by transmitting to the appropriate supervisory officer receipts of expenditures of any such candidate in connection with any primary election or general election for Federal office. Establishes limitations on contributions by individuals to any candidate for Federal office."
