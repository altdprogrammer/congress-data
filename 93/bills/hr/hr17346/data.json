Sets additional requirements on the State grant programs administered under such Act. Changes the maximum share of the State portion of the fund which may be allocated to any one State from 7 percent to 10 percent. Requires that elected officials of local governmental units and representatives of multi-jurisdictional planning entities be consulted in the preparation of State-wide outdoor recreation plans under the Act. Sets up an annual reporting program in which each State is required to report to the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation an evaluation of the accomplishments of its program under the fund. Directs the Bureau to forward a summary of such reports to the Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs of the United States Congress. Prohibits the making of grants under the terms of the Act for the acquisition or development of any recreation site or facility at which a discriminatory charge is made based on the State of residence of the user. =Title II:= Establishes the historic preservation fund in the Treasury. Provides that during the period commencing July 1, 1975, and ending June 30, 1989, there shall be covered into such fund $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1976; $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1977; and $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1978 through September 30, 1989, from revenues due to the United States under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the provisions of Federal law providing for the sale of oil and gas from Naval Petroleum Reserves."
