Provides for grants to such carriers to cover such reductions on a showing by the carrier that it suffered an economic loss solely because of the provisions of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to provide financial assistance under the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to States and local public bodies and agencies which adopt specially reduced rates during nonrush hours for elderly persons."
