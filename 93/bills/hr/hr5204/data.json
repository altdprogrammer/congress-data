Title II: Design and Demonstration of Civil Science Systems - Civil Science Systems Act - Establishes, within the National Science Foundation, the Civil Science Systems Administration and the Science Research and Education Administration. Prohibits the transfer of funds between these two Administrations. Establishes a Civil Science Systems Advisory Council to advise the Director of the Civil Science Systems Administration with respect to the discharge of his responsibilities under this Act. Authorizes the Director to conduct planning studies, to transfer funds to other departments and agencies of the Federal Government, and to make grants to, or to enter into contracts with, academic institutions, nonprofit institutes and organizations, State, regional, and local governmental agencies, and private business firms, for the conduct of the following programs: (1) planning studies for the design and demonstration of civil science systems capable of providing improved civil services; (2) applied social research into the economic, sociological, political, legal, administrative, and psychological aspects of civil science systems capable of providing improved public services; (3) research with respect to civil science systems capable of providing improved public services in areas such as health care, public safety, sanitation and utilities, pollution control, productivity, unemployment, education, housing, transportation, nutrition, communications, and energy resources; (4) testing and evaluating civil science systems which make use of advanced science and technology; (5) establishment of a computerized Civil Science System Information Service to collect and integrate the scientific, technical, and social information pertaining to civil science systems resulting from programs under this title, and to provide such information to interested organizations in Federal, State, and local government, industry, academic institutions, and the nonprofit sector, upon request from such organizations, in accordance with such administrative procedures as are established by the Director; and (6) construction and public exhibition of civil science systems demonstration projects, which illustrate the functioning and associated benefits of alternative, effective civil science systems resulting from research and design activities conducted or assisted under this title. Authorizes appropriations for the various programs established under this title of $120,000,000 for fiscal year 1974; $315,000,000 for fiscal year 1975; and $435,000,000 for fiscal year 1976. Title III: Transition of Technical manpower to Civilian Programs - Technical Manpower Transition Act - Authorizes the Foundation to make grants to, or enter into contracts with, academic institutions, nonprofit institutes and organizations, public agencies, and private business firms, for the purpose of: (1) researching the social, economic research and engineering activities to civilian-oriented research and engineering activities; (2) conducting programs at the State, local, or regional level, which are designed to facilitate the transition of scientific and technical activities to civilian programs within the particular State, local, or geographic area; (3) planning or operating training programs for officers and employees of Federal, State, and local government who will be responsible for, or participate in, determining or administering government assisted or conducted programs for civilian, socially oriented research and engineering activities; (4) paying the travel and subsistence expenses of government employees incurred in connection with their participation in training programs carried out under the previous programs; (5) establishing community conversion corporations; (6) enabling private corporations to hire scientists, engineers, and technicians for work on projects for which they are not yet fully qualified; (7) awarding career transition fellowships and awards to technicians to enable them to pursue a course of study through which they can acquire specialized technical knowledge and skills in fields other than the ones in which they are already proficient; (8) entering into contracts with scientific, professional, technical, and business associations and labor unions in order to establish and operate placement programs for unemployed or underemployed scientists, engineers, and technicians; and (9) planning, developing, strengthening, or carrying out education programs which design courses and curriculums intended to prepare students for careers in civilian, socially oriented research and engineering activities.
