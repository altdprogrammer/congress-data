Provides that the term of such patent shall expire earlier than the time specified by law, by a period equal to the delay between the time the application becomes abandoned or a patent lapsed for failure to pay the fee and the time late payment is accepted after enactment of this Act. Requires Senate confirmation only of the Commissioner of Patents, the deputy commissioner and the two assistant commissioners, and eliminates such confirmation for the position of Examiner in Chief of the Patent Office. Provides for the appointment of an Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Patents and Trademarks by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. (Amends 35 U.S.C. 3, 35 U.S.C. 151)"
