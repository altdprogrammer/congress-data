    "text": "Earthquake Prediction Act - Provides that it shall be the function and duty of the Director of the Geological Survey to develop and carry out an earthquake prediction program which shall include: (1) heavy instrumentation of the San Andreas fault and closely related faults of California and Nevada to obtain detailed records of data useful in developing an earthquake prediction capability; (2) establishment of facilities for the collection and computerized reduction, analysis, and interpretation of the data flow from such instruments; (3) supporting field, laboratory, and field-testing of additional instruments which are useful in connection with the development and implementation of this program. States that the Director shall utilize the services of research personnel in institutions of higher education and public entities or organizations and private entities or organizations concerned with seismic research. Establishes an advisory committee for the earthquake prediction program which shall consist of not less than seven nor more than fifteen members who shall be appointed by the Director from among individuals recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. States that it shall be the function of the advisory committee to advise and assist the Director in developing and carrying out the earthquake prediction program. Authorizes the Director of the office of Emergency Preparedness to establish and carry out a program to review and assess the current state of knowledge on earthquake prediction and warning systems, to identify key problem areas for further research and evaluation, and to determine what additional steps are needed to reduce primary and secondary losses from earthquakes. Provides that information developed under this Act shall be made available to the Office of Science and Technology, the Congress, Governors in States of high seismic risk and other concerned Government and private organizations. Authorizes to be appropriated for the purpose of developing an earthquake prediction program the sum of $12,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, and for each of the next following four fiscal years. Authorizes to be appropriated for the other provisions of this Act the sum of $200,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974, and for each of the next following four fiscal years."
