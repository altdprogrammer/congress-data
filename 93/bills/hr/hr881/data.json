    "text": "Farm Workers' Bill of Rights - Title I: Collective Bargaining - Farm Workers Collective Bargaining Act - Includes agricultural employees within the scope of the National Labor Relations Act. Exempts farm labor organizations from restrictions on certain activities which are listed as unfair labor practices by the above Act. Restricts the employers from employing in any workplace during the existence of a strike or lockout any individual who is not domiciled in the United States unless such individual was employed immediately prior to the beginning of such strike or lockout. Allows farm labor organizations to picket or threaten to picket any employer when the purpose thereof is to force the employer to bargain with such organizations. States that it shall not be an unfair labor practice when a labor agreement between an employer and a farm labor organization requires membership in such organization as a condition of employment. Title II: Workmen's Compensation - Farm Workers Compensation Act - Provides that the provisions of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act shall be applicable in respect to any injury, illness, disability or death to any agricultural employee, arising out of the course of his employment, or arising out of any unsafe, defective, or unhealthful condition or inadequate sanitation facility of housing provided as an incident to his employment in agriculture. Gives the employee, or his legal representative in the case of death, the right to maintain an action at law for damages on account of such employee's injury or death resulting from the gross negligence of the employer. States that if the use of an economic poison in the manner prescribed on the label results in the disability or death of an agricultural employee from personal injury the Secretary of Labor shall furnish benefits to such employee and his survivors. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to refer any application received by him to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for his assistance, comments, and advice as to any determination required under this title. Title III: Manpower Services for Farm Workers - Farm Worker Manpower Services Act - Provides that the Secretary shall make available to farm workers manpower services, including, but not limited to, skills training, placement, pre-placement and postplacement guidance and counseling, basic education and communications skills, job development and supportive services. Provides that no State employment agency cooperating with the United States Employment Service under this Act shall refer any person to employment in agriculture: (1) where the position to which he is referred is vacant due to a strike, lockout or other labor dispute; (2) where housing for the employee is to be provided by the employer unless the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has determined that such housing meets minimum standards of privacy, shelter and sanitation which he shall prescribe; and (3) where the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare has determined that adequate public health care will be available in the community and that adequate educational opportunities will be available for his children. Title IV: Farm Worker's Labor Standards - Farm Workers' Labor Standards Act - Includes hand harvest laborers within the definition of \"employee\" under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Provides that children employed in agriculture between the ages of fourteen and sixteen shall be classed as \"oppressive child labor\". Repeals the minimum wage provision for agricultural employees. Removes agricultural employees from the list of exemptions to the minimum wage and hours provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to adjust the minimum wage rate of employees in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to conform with amendments made by this title. Title V: Unemployment Compensation - Includes \"agricultural labor\" within the definition of employment for unemployment compensation. Title VI: National Advisory Council on Agricultural Labor - National Farm Workers' Advisory Council Act - Establishes a Council to be known as the National Advisory Council on Farm Labor which shall be composed of twelve members appointed by the President. Provides that it shall be the duty of the Council to advise the Congress and the President with respect to the operation of Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, programs, and policies which relate to agricultural labor. Authorizes the Council to study the problems of agricultural labor and devise plans and make recommendations for the establishment of policies and programs to meet such problems effectively. Requires the Council to submit a report to the Secretary, the President, and the Congress not later than October 1 of each year."
