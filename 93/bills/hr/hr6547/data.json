Entitles each survivor to an annuity that is not less than the smallest primary insurance amount (including any cost-of-living increase in benefits) authorized to be paid under the Social Security Act except that the minimum annuity payable to each surviving child of a Federal employee, Member of Congress, or annuitant may not exceed three times the smallest primary insurance amount divided by the number of children, so long as the survivor is not entitled to a higher annuity under any provision of law. States that an annuity payable from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund to a former employee or Member, which is based on a separation occurring prior to October 20, 1969, shall be increased by $300 ($165 in the case of the surviving spouse of an employee, Member, or annuitant).
