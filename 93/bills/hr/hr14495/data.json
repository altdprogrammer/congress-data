Authorizes the Corporation to design, construct, operate, and maintain, for such methods demonstrated, a full-scale, commercial-size facility to produce a syncrude from oil shale by such method. Requires all research, development, demonstration, or projects contracted for, sponsored, or cosponsored by the Corporation pursuant to this Act, to require as a condition of Federal participation that all information resulting in whole or in part from federally assisted research shall be made available at the earliest possible date to the general public. Directs that on or before the expiration of ten years following the date of the enactment of this section, the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall take such action as may be necessary to dissolve the Corporation.
