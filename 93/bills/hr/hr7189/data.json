Authorizes an employer, labor organization, or executive official of Hawaii and such United States Pacific islands to petition any United States district court having jurisdiction to issue an injunction or temporary restraining order to enforce this provision. Provides that employees working during this 160 day period shall receive, in addition to regular wages, if strike or lockout is resolved, wages at a rate equal to the difference between the wage provided under the agreement which resolves the dispute and the wage received prior to resolution of the dispute."
