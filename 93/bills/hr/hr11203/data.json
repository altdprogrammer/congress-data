Prohibits the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from: (1) limiting the potency, number, combination, amount, or variety of any synthetic or natural vitamin, mineral, substance, or ingredient of any food supplement unless such article is intrinsically injurious to health in the recommended dosage; or (2) requiring a warning label on any food supplement unless such article is intrinsically injurious to health in the recommended dosage. Requires the Secretary to transmit a report to Congress no later than January 31 of each year setting forth all rules and regulations, with respect to food supplements, which have been promulgated under this Act during the preceding calendar year, and which have been proposed for implementation during the ensuing calendar year."
