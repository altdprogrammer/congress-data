Provides that any such sale or transfer shall be made only if the Secretary of Commerce (1) approves the transferee's plan for preparation and utilization of the surplus property for economic development purposes, and (2) determines that transfer of the property at fair market value would discourage reuse of the property for economically productive purposes."
