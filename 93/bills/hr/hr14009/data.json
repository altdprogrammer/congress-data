    "text": "Food and Drug Administration Act - Title I: Food and Drug Administration - Creates a Food and Drug Administration within the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Provides that the function of such Administration shall be to promote the public health, safety and welfare. Directs the President to appoint, with the advice and consent of the Senate, a Commissioner of the Administration. Directs the Commissioner to: (1) attempt to eliminate products presenting unreasonable risk of disease, injury, or death; (2) establish a capability within the Commission to engage in risk-based analysis; (3) establish an interdisciplinary epidemiology capability and undertake investigations in coordination with the Food and Drug Administration Information Clearinghouse to facilitate regulation-making and to assist in risk-based analysis; (4) establish a scientific capability within the Administration to assist in hazard detection, test method development, and quality control requirements; and (5) utilize field operations to conduct product evaluation, facilitate detection of conditions associated with products subject to his jurisdiction which might lead to disease, injury, or death, to monitor compliance with required levels of safety performance, to report violations, and to assist the Commissioner in any enforcement action taken by him. Title II: Food Amendments - Requires food processors to include on the label, in such form as to be readily understandable by the consumer, the date recommended for sale and for use. States that food shall be considered to be misbranded if its nutritional additives as stated on the label are not in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Expresses the intent of Congress to supercede all State and local food labeling laws that are different from this Act. Provides for food establishment registration. Requires, every other year, persons owning or operating food processing establishments to register with the Secretary. Prohibits the importation of food from establishments not so registered. Provides for food inspection at critical control points. Provides that, in the case of establishments manufacturing, processing, preparing, packaging, or holding food, inspection shall extend to critical control point records bearing upon whether a food may be adulterated, if the Secretary has reason to believe that any such food may be so adulterated and that the public health and safety requires access to such records. Requires that, within one hundred and eighty days after enactment, any person who owns or operates any establishment in which food is processed shall, unless exempted by regulations promulgated by the Secretary, develop a critical control points system for such establishment set out in a written document in such manner and form as the Secretary may require. States that critical control points are limited to those processing factors bearing upon whether a food may be adulterated. Provides that whenever the Secretary finds that a food (or class of food) is being processed in a significant number of establishments in such a manner as to present an unreasonable risk of adulteration, he may promulgate regulations establishing a critical control points standard for such processing of such food to reduce or eliminate such risk. Prescribes what such standard must designate, including: (1) those points in a particular food process which are critical to prevent the food from being adulterated; (2) the contaminants, properties, unsanitary practices, or other factors intended to be detected and reduced or eliminated; (3) the sampling methods and methods of examinations to be conducted at such critical control points; and (4) the circumstances under which reports of such examinations and test results shall be submitted to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to refer such a proposed critical control points standard which has been published in the Federal Register to an advisory committee of experts for a report and recommendation with respect to any matter involved in such proposal which requires the exercise of scientific or technical judgment, on the petition (within sixty days after the publication of a proposed standard) of any person who may be adversely affected if such proposal were to be placed in effect. Allows the Secretary to revoke any standard when the need no longer exists and to immediately modify a standard if he finds a threat to the public health. Requires persons who must comply with a critical control points standard to maintain records as the Secretary may require. Title III: Cosmetics - Cosmetic Amendments - Requires the registration of cosmetic processors and cosmetic formulas. Requires manufacturers and distributors of cosmetics to substantiate the safety of their products before beginning commercial distribution of any cosmetic products. Sets standards for cosmetic labeling under this Act."
