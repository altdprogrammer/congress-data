Limits such educational assistance to 90 percent of tuition and fees for such programs. Requires that: (1) such recipients possess a valid private pilot's license; and (2) the flight school courses are approved by the Federal Aviation Administration and the appropriate State agency as conditions to receipt of such assistance. Repeals the requirement of disapproval by the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs of education loans to eligible veterans enrolled in a sales or management course which does not provide specialized training within a specific vocational field."
