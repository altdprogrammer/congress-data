Requires such department or agency to promptly inform the public when it initiates consideration of any project subject to this subsection. Provides that any such report which the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce makes shall be based on written findings of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or both, concerning: (1) the direct and indirect effects attributable to the project on wildlife resources; and (2) the means and measures that should be adopted, including, but not limited to, project modifications or abandonment, to prevent or minimize loss of, or damage to, wildlife resources and provide for the full mitigation and, where possible, enhancement of such resources. Requires the appropriate Federal department and agency to give full consideration to any such report of the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, and the State agencies and shall not carry out, finance, or authorize, in any manner, any project until such department or agency has been advised in writing by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, as appropriate, that they are satisfied that each recommendation on means and measures to prevent or minimize wildlife losses or damages resulting from the project, and to mitigate such losses, is adequately provided for prior to, or concurrently with, project development."
