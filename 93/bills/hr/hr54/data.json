Provides that such amounts may include costs of tuition, books, transportation, and food and lodging. Prohibits deductions for food and lodging from being greater than the minimum amount charged for such services at such institution. Provides that, in the event such institution does not provide such services, the deduction for food and lodging shall not exceed $400 for each calendar year nor more than $200 for each school semester during which the dependent is in actual attendance at such institution. (Amends 26 U.S.C. 218)"
