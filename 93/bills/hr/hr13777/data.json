    "text": "National No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act - Provides that every person suffering loss from injury arising out of maintenance or use of a motor vehicle has a right to basic reparation benefits if the accident causing injury occurs in any State. Defines those persons and their survivors who shall have such right where the accident causing injury occurs outside any State. Provides that basic reparation benefits shall be paid without regard to fault. Provides for a priority of applicability of security for payment of basic reparation benefits. Abolishes tort liability related to motor vehicle accidents arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle except as otherwise enumerated in this Act. Sets forth requirements for a minimum tort liability insurance and territorial coverage. Limits the basic reparation benefits payable for work loss, survivor's economic loss, replacement services loss, and survivor's replacement services loss arising from injury to one person and attributable to the calendar week during which the accident causing injury occurs and to each calendar week thereafter to a maximum of $200. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations for the adjustment or apportionment of such benefits where the injured person's earnings or work is seasonal or irregular. Authorizes optional deductibles and exclusions at appropriately reduced premium rates for any basic reparation insurance policy offered under the provisions of this Act. Permits basic reparation insurers to offer optional added reparation coverages. Provides for the establishment in each State of an assigned claims bureau. Sets forth procedures for the assignment of claims. Permits the awarding of a reasonable sum for attorney's fees for a claim against a reparation obligor. Provides that no part of the fee for representing claimants shall consist of a charge against benefits otherwise due the claimant. Provides an exception where the claim is fraudulent. Makes provisions for lump-sum and installment settlements, and requires court approval if the net loss exceeds $2500. Establishes a statute of limitations of two years from the time when injury or loss is known, or four years after the accident, whichever is earlier. Provides for an extended statute of limitations in cases where death results from the accident. Prohibits assignments of right to benefits except in specified circumstances, and provides that benefits are exempt from garnishment, attachment, execution, and any other claim. Permits the reparation obligor to file a petition for a mental or physical examination where appropriate. Sets forth requirements concerning disclosure of facts about an injured person by his employer, his physician or hospital, and the claimant himself. Makes the reparation obligor responsible for the cost of rehabilitation treatment and occupational training where this is necessary for the injured person. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to establish in each State a plan assuring liability and motor vehicle insurance coverage to all applicants who cannot conveniently obtain insurance through ordinary methods. Prohibits termination or modification of insurance by an insurer other than in specified manners and circumstances. Prescribes criminal and civil penalties for violations of this Act. Makes provisions for proportionate reimbursement from other reparation obligors to obligors and to owners suffering uninsured physical damage to their motor vehicles. Establishes methods, rules, and limitations for such reimbursement. Continues State authority to make and regulate insurance rates. Sets forth effective dates for the provisions of this Act."
