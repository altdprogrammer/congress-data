    "text": "Voluntary Military Manpower Procurement Act - States that no person shall be inducted for training and service in the Armed Forces of the United States under the Military Selective Service Act after June 30, 1973. Requires the President, in the event that he determines that a voluntary system is inadequate and that conscription is necessary for the national security, to notify the Congress of such determination, and to submit such legislative recommendations as necessary to provide for the involuntary induction of persons into the Armed Forces. Authorizes the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretaries of the military departments to provide for the military manpower needs of the Nation through a voluntary program of enlistments, utilizing bonuses and inducements designed to upgrade the conditions of military service and the status of military personnel generally. Provides for the continued registration of all persons in the United States between the ages of eighteen and twenty-six years so that the involuntary induction of persons may be effected should the President deem such action necessary."
