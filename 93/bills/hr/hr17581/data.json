Provides that pursuant to an application by a small business concern the head of any executive agency may terminate for the convenience of the Government any fixed-price contract between that agency and such small business concern upon a finding that specified cost difficulties are shown. Requires enumerated pieces of documentation to support any such request for relief by a small business concern, including a history of performance under the contract, statements of costs and profits, and balance sheets."
