    "date": "1973-04-16", 
    "text": "States that no provision of any contract entered into by the United States, or administrative determination concerning a dispute about a question of fact arising under, or growing out of the performance of, such contract shall serve to limit in any manner any judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction relating to said dispute. Provides that in a trial de novo, a rebuttable presumption of correctness shall attach to any such administrative decision, which presumption may be overcome by a preponderance of evidence received in court, the contractor challenging such decision having the burden of proof. Gives the contractor the right, notwithstanding any contract provision, to proceed directly to court and to be entitled to a trial de novo without exhausting any administrative procedures, provided he has acted on a claim founded on a contract with the United States. Makes provisions upon such election for notice to the administrative agency, and for the time of commencing suit. (Amends 41 U.S.C. 321)"
