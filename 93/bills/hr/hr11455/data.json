    "text": "Federal Computer Subject Privacy Act - Provides that no disclosure shall be made of data identifiable with, or traceable to, specific individuals, including statistical disclosures, whose records are included in any statistical reporting or research system except to authorized persons formally employed in such research or reporting system and for such purposes as can be reasonably anticipated by the data subject. Provides that persons so authorized may not be compelled in any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings to identify such individuals. Provides that the data subject and data custodian may refuse to disclose, or, by legal process enforceable in the appropriate Federal district court, may prevent another person from disclosing such data sought by legal process. Defines the term \"data subject\" as including individuals whose names or identities are added to or maintained on an automated personal data system or a statistical-reporting or research system. Defines the term \"statistical disclosure\" as meaning disclosure of the identity of an individual as a result of the disclosure of a class of data that can be traced by a reasonable person to that individual or individuals. Defines the term \"statistical reporting or research system\" as meaning a computerized or noncomputerized file or data base that maintains data about individuals exclusively for statistical reporting or research and is not intended to affect any individual directly, and which is either maintained by a Federal agency or by an individual or organization receiving Federal assistance, or which conducts business which may affect interstate commerce."
