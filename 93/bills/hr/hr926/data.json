Specifies that the Armed Forces may act to: (1) repel a sudden attack of the United States; (2) repel an attack against the Armed Forces on the high seas or while lawfully stationed in a foreign territory; (3) protect United States nationals abroad; and (4) comply with a national commitment resulting from a treaty or other legislative instrumentality intended to give effect to such commitment. Provides for the cut-off of military hostilities after 30 days unless such hostilities are sustained by legislative enactment or by a declaration of war. Excludes from coverage under this Act military hostilities undertaken before the effective date of the Act."
