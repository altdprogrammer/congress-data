Sets forth collective bargaining, notice, mediation, and agreement procedures to govern employees of a health care institution, as well as procedures to be followed for conciliation of labor disputes in the health care industry. Exempts employees with religious convictions against joining or financially supporting a labor union or organization from doing so as a condition of employment, except that such employee may be required to contribute the equivalent of periodic dues and initiation fees to a nonreligious charitable fund exempt from taxation."
