    "text": "States that a patent application or application for trademark registration shall be considered as having been filed in the Patent Office on the date that it would have been received by the Patent Office except for any delay caused by a substantial interruption of the postal service in a significant part of the United States, due to work stoppage, national emergency, or other unforeseen circumstances, which has been determined by the Commissioner of Patents to have interfered with the transmission of mail to the Patent Office, if a claim is made for the benefit of an earlier filing date in accordance with procedures specified in this Act. Provides that no patent or trademark application shall be entitled to an earlier filing date unless a verified statement by the applicant or owner of record or by his attorney or agent claiming the earlier filing date is filed in the Patent Office within three months after the publication in the Federal Register of the date on which the interruption is deemed to have ended. (Adds 35 U.S.C. 27)"
