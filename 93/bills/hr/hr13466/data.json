Defines the terms used in this Act, including those of \"pension manager\" and \"security.\" Imposes on each pension manager a tax of 5 percent of the amount of each investment made by him during his taxable year in violation of the provisions relating to limitations on pension trust asset investment. Distinguishes venture capital from pension trust assets for purposes of this Act. Provides for a graduated taxation of capital gain and revises the treatment of capital losses. Provides that in the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, a percentage of the gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 12 months shall be excluded from gross income.
