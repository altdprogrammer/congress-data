States that a special dietary food shall be deemed to be misbranded if the Secretary finds, after giving due notice and an opportunity to interested parties for a public hearing, that a therapeutic or preventive claim made for such food product is not supported by substantial evidence: (1) unless advertising for the product is not false or misleading in any particular; (2) unless all advertising for such product contains the name and address of the place of business, where the information required above can be obtained, provided that such information is presented in such terms as to render it likely to be read in the case of visual ads and heard in the case of ads with oral content, and understood by the ordinary individual; and (3) unless the label, labeling, or advertising contains no untrue nutritional, health, or other statement."
