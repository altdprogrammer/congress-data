    "text": "Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to grant to the President temporary authority to deal with a national energy crisis involving extraordinary shortages of crude oil and petroleum products or dislocations in their national distribution system. Sets forth the objectives to be achieved by the President in implementing the authority granted under this Act. Provides that the President may delegate all or any portion of the authority granted under this Act to the Secretary of the Interior or to the head of any other Federal agency he deems appropriate. Terminates the authority under this Act on March 1, 1975. Establishes an Office of Emergency Fuel Allocation to receive complaints from officers of State and local governmental units who cannot obtain supplies of gasoline. Provides that the provisions of this Act shall take precedence over any program for the emergency allocation of crude oil or petroleum products established by a State or local government. Provides that within thirty days of the date of enactment of this Act, the President shall cause to be prepared and published priority schedules, plans, and regulations for the allocation or distribution of crude oil and any refined petroleum product which is or may be in short supply nationally or in any region of the United States in accordance with the objectives of this Act. Authorizes the President to allocate pursuant to the schedules, plans, and regulations required by this Act, any liquid fuel, whether crude or processed, and whether imported or domestically produced, currently or prospectively in extraordinarily short supply nationally or in any region of the United States. Directs the President to assure that no petroleum refinery in the United States is involuntarily required to operate at less than normal full capacity because of unavailability of suitable crude oil. Establishes a formula for allocation of crude oil from major producers and importers to small independent refiners, and for allocation of petroleum products from major refiners to independent dealers and resellers. Requires the President to submit a quarterly report to the Congress including a summary and description of all actions taken under the authority of this Act. Fair Marketing of Petroleum Products Act - Prohibits a petroleum refiner or distributor from: (1) delivering to retailers a smaller quantity of petroleum products than the quantity delivered during a specified quarter in the base period, with stated exceptions; and (2) not selling, at a specified price, petroleum products to a nonfranchised distributor or retailer. Sets forth the modes of remedy and procedures for such remedy for violations of prescribed prohibited conduct. Sets forth protections for franchised dealers. Directs Federal, State and local governmental agencies to take action to reduce highway speeds to conserve gasoline supplies. States that no provision of this Act shall be deemed to convey to any individual, corporation or business organization immunity from civil or criminal liability or to create defenses to actions under antitrust laws. Requires the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to monitor the actions taken pursuant to this Act and persons subject to its provisions. Provides that the President shall: (1) develop a National Voluntary Energy Conservation Program, and (2) call upon the public, by means of television, radio and newspaper, to cooperate in such program. Directs the President to take action to promote Government use of economy limousines, and to promote carpools. Requires the governor of each State to establish a State Office of Fuels and Energy Conservation to encourage voluntary conservation of fuels. Expresses the finding of Congress that prices of crude oil and petroleum products are increasing and urges the President to take further action to stabilize such prices."
