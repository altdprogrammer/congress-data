    "text": "Nationally Chronicare Demonstration Center Act - States the finding of the Congress that: (1) long-term care has always been neglected in the development of the Nation's health care delivery system; (2) present programs, such as medicare and medicaid, have neglected to provide adequate coverage for long-term care; (3) any program of national health insurance must address the critical need for coverage of long-term care; (4) most Americans lack direct access to nonhospital health care; (5) society has been largely unwilling to deal with the problems of persons who are unproductive over extended periods because of poor health; (6) outmoded laws or policies limit the realistic use of paramedical personnel, resulting in increased health care costs; and (7) the nursing home industry has been the one health specialty which has accepted the responsibility for developing long-term care through the years. States that it is the purpose of this Act to establish demonstration programs to study and evaluate: (1) the effect of diagnostic services in the detection of chronic conditions; (2) the breakdown of costs and expenditures by acute and chronic conditions; and (3) the breakdown of services required by age, chronic condition, and impairment. Authorizes to be appropriated $11,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974, $9,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and $8,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976 to enable the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to any public or private entity to cover all or any part of the cost of two projects, in areas of the country representative of metropolitan populations, for the development or demonstration of programs designed to provide rehabilitative, habilitative, personal support, residential, medical, dental, and mental health services for the chronically ill residents of such area through community chronicare health centers. Authorizes to be appropriated $4,500,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974, $4,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and $3,500,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976, to enable the Secretary to make grants to any public or private entity to cover all or any part of the cost of a project which will operate in conjunction with an existing health maintenance organization which is not currently providing long-term health care and which will develop or demonstrate programs designed to provide rehabilitative, habilitative, personal support, residential, medical, dental, and mental health services for the chronically ill residents of an identified population area through a community chronicare health center. Authorizes to be appropriated $6,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974, $5,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and $4,5000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976, to enable the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to any public or private entity to cover all or any part of the cost of a project, in an area of the country representative of a rural population, for the development or demonstration of programs designed to provide rehabilitative, habilitative, personal support, residential, medical, dental, and mental health services for the chronically ill residents of such area through a community chronicare health center. Authorizes to be appropriated $10,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974, $8,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and $7,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976, to enable the Secretary to make grants to any public or private entity to cover all or any part of the cost of two projects, in areas of the country representative of suburban populations, for the development or demonstration of programs designed to provide rehabilitative, habilitative, personal support, residential, medical, dental, and mental health services for the chronically ill residents of such area through community chronicare health centers. Authorizes to be appropriated $14,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974, $11,500,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and $9,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976, to enable the Secretary to make grants to any public or private entity to cover all or any part of the cost of two projects, for the development or demonstration of programs designed to provide rehabilitative, habilitative, personal support, residential, medical, dental, and mental health services for the chronically ill residents of an identified population area through community chronicare health centers, a State chronicare commission, and a State chronicare data center. Provides that each of the two projects assisted under this Act shall be located in the same State and one of the projects shall be located in a rural area. Provides that each community chronicare center utilized under a project assisted under this section shall serve an area with a population of no less than twenty-four thousand. Provides that five of the community chronicare centers utilized under a project assisted under this section shall serve a population area that is underserved by long-term health resources. Provides that in order to be eligible for a grant under this Act, an applicant must give satisfactory assurances of its capability of providing: (1) diagnostic service (as described in this Act); (2) inpatient care; (3) day care; (4) rehabilitation service (on both an inpatient and outpatient basis); and (5) outreach service. Requires each community chronicare health center assisted under this Act to maintain a therapeutic service team which shall be responsible: (1) for establishing and maintaining a total patient care plan following initial screening; (2) for assessment of patient health status on a continuing basis; and (3) for the involvement of additional ancillary service professionals for provision of required services. Requires the Secretary to make a report to the President for transmission to the Congress within two years after the date of enactment of this Act stating the progress under this Act and making recommendations for further action if needed."
