    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) National School Lunch and Child Nutrition Act Amendments - Increases to 10 cents per lunch (presently 8 cents) the national average payment established under the National School Lunch Act. Provides that in any fiscal year in which the national average payment per lunch is increased above the previous fiscal year, the maximum Federal food-cost contribution rate, for the type of lunch served, shall be increased by a like amount. Requires that each State educational agency shall receive special-assistance payments in an amount equal to the sum of the product obtained by multiplying the number of lunches served free to eligible children by the special-assistance factor for free lunches prescribed by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and the product obtained by multiplying the number of lunches served at a reduced price to eligible children by the special-assistance factor for reduced-price lunches prescribed by the Secretary for such fiscal year. Provides for semi-annual adjustments in rates for changes in the cost of operating school lunch and breakfast programs, as indicated by the change in the series for food away from home of the Consumer Price Index. Establishes minimum national average payments for all breakfasts served to eligible children under the Child Nutrition Act. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to make an estimate of the value of agricultural commodities and other foods that will be delivered during that fiscal year to States for school food service programs and if such value is less than 90 percent of the value of such deliveries initially programmed for that fiscal year, the Secretary shall pay a calculated sum to State educational agencies. Extends for one year to June 30, 1975, the special supplemental food program of the Child Nutrition Act. Expands the eligibility for special milk programs to include school or nonprofit child care institutions. Increases the size of the National Advisory Council under the National School Lunch Act from thirteen to fifteen. Provides income guidelines for reduced price lunches. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out a study to determine if the benefits of programs carried out under the National School Lunch Act and Child Nutrition Act are accruing to the maximum extent possible to all of the nation's school children."
