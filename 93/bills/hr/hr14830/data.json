    "text": "Public Energy Statistics Act - Directs the Director of the Bureau of Economic Analysis to be responsible for insuring that adequate statistical information concerning energy supply and demand conditions within the United States is available to the public. Requires that this responsibility shall be met through publication of: (1) a monthly report on energy supply and demand conditions within the United States, which shall include such statistics relating to production, consumption, exports, imports, interstate movements, inventories, reserves, prices, and shortages of energy products as the Director deems appropriate; and (2) such additional statistical reports, documents, tables, pamphlets, or other publications bearing on energy supply and demand conditions in the United States as are necessary to keep the public adequately informed. Authorizes the Director, whenever he considers it advisable, to call up any other department, agency, or establishment of the Federal Government, or the municipal government of the District of Columbia, for information necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act and such agencies, if and to the extent they possess such information, shall furnish it to the Director. Provides that the Director shall not, unless otherwise authorized, have access to financial information contained in individual income tax returns filed with the Internal Revenue Service, nor census information. Specifies that neither the Director, nor any other officer or employee of the Bureau, may: (1) use the information furnished them under this Act for any purpose other than the statistical purposes for which it is supplied; or (2) make any publication under authority of this Act whereby the data relating to any particular establishment or individual can be identified; or (3) permit anyone other than the sworn officers and employees of the Bureau to examine any data relating to any particular establishment or individual acquired under authority of this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Department of Commerce such amounts as may be requisite to full and efficient performance of the duties imposed upon the Bureau and the Director by this Act."
