    "text": "Day Laborer Protection Act - Provides that it shall be unlawful to operate a temporary help service unless a license is obtained from the Secretary of Labor. Authorizes the Secretary to set standards, to license temporary help services meeting the standards and to enforce compliance with the provisions of this Act. Requires that in order to obtain a license all employees of a temporary help service be covered by Social Security and the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, an adequate workmen's compensation plan, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Labor-Management Relation Act of 1947. Prohibits temporary help services from restricting the right of an employee to accept a permanent position with a client to whom he is referred for temporary work or to restrict the right of a client to offer such a position. Prohibits the use of temporary employees as strike breakers. Requires the Secretary to report on the implementation of this Act to Congress within one year, including his recommendations for extending unemployment benefits to employees of temporary help services. Allows an individual injured by a violation of this Act to bring an action for damages. Allows the Secretary to investigate any temporary help service. Directs such services to maintain such records as the Secretary may require."
