    "text": "Establishes a National Commission on International Trade and the Environment. Requires the Commission to undertake a comprehensive study and investigation to determine: (1) what antipollution measures and recommendations relating to industrial pollution are being proposed by the United Nations, its related organizations, and any other international agencies; (2) the effect which compliance by major United States industries with antipollution statutes and ordinances has had, or will have, with respect to increased costs which must be charged for the goods produced by such industries; (3) if any competitive advantage is, or will be, given to foreign producers by reason of the enforcement of, or compliance with, such antipollution measures; (4) what antipollution measures are applied, or are being considered for application, in the industrialized countries of the world and what effect, if any, such measures will have on the cost of goods from those countries in the international market; (5) ways and means by which the United States Government, in the course of providing domestic safeguards against environmental pollution, can prevent a situation whereby United States industry is priced out of world markets; (6) what equitable standards of environmental protection should be proposed by the United States, in United Nations forums, to the industrialized countries of the world; and (7) what methods of enforcing these standards in such a way as to assure adequate oceanic and atmospheric protection, without placing any one nation at an unjust trade disadvantage, might be proposed by the United States in United Nations forums. Provides that the Commission shall make a final report of its findings, recommendations (including any proposals for legislative or administrative action it deems appropriate), and conclusions to the President and to the Congress one year from the date on which the Commission members first take office. Requires the Commission to make an interim report with respect to its findings to: (1) the President and Congress; and (2) the United Nations Conference on Problems in the Human Environment scheduled to convene in June 1972 at Stockholm, Sweden. Authorizes the Commission, or any number of members thereof as authorized by the Commission, to conduct hearings anywhere in the United States or abroad or otherwise secure data and expressions of opinion pertinent to its duties. Authorizes the Commission by majority vote to administer oaths and to pay witnesses the same fees and mileage as are paid in like circumstances in the courts of the United States. Authorizes the Commission to require directly from the head of any Federal executive department or independent agency available information which the Commission deems useful in the discharge of its duties. Provides that all departments and independent agencies of the Government shall cooperate with the Commission and furnish all information requested by the Commission to the extent permitted by law. Authorizes the appropriation of $400,000 to carry out the provisions of this Act. Provides that the Commission shall cease to exist one year from the date upon which the commissioners first take office."
