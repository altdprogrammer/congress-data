Directs the Administrator to make recommendations to enable the Secret Service to perform its protective functions of the President or Vice President with respect to any private or other property not in Government ownership or control. Requires that the President or Vice President, as the case may be, shall bear all cost to carry out the recommendations of the Administrator. Provides that, with the exceptions stated in this Act, no funds appropriated under any Act may be available on or after the date of enactment of this Act for any expenditure with respect to any private or other property not in Government ownership or control which is used as a residence, temporary or otherwise, by the President or Vice President or their respective families. States that possession of any article or object by the President or Vice President purchased pursuant to this Act which is not permanently affixed to the properties shall revert to the United States after either person leaves such office, unless the Administrator determines that such article is necessary to enable the Secret Service to perform its protective functions. Directs the Administrator to send a report to the Congress within ninety days after the President or Vice President leaves office which specifies the property which he determines should not revert to the United States and his reasons therefor."
