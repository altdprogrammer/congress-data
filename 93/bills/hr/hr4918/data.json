Authorizes the Secretary to pay to each adversely affected worker who meets the requirements of this Act, and who files an application therefor, the retirement pay or the benefits under the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance provisions of the Social Security Act, in the same amounts, and subject to the same terms and conditions, as the adversely affected worker will receive when he becomes entitled to receive such retirement pay or benefits.
