Limits the tax credit to 50 percent of the tuition paid by the taxpayer or $200, whichever is less. Provides that any payment which is taken into account in determining the tax credit shall not be treated as an amount paid by the taxpayer for purposes of determining entitlement to a tax deduction. Allows any U.S. taxpayer to commence a proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, within the three month period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, to determine whether the provisions of this Act are valid legislation under the U.S. Constitution. (Amends 26 U.S.C. 42)"
