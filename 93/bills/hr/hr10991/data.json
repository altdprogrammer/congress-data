    "text": "National Educational Opportunities Act - Title I: Local Rights and Responsibilities - Allows any public school student to transfer from a school in which his race is in a majority to one in which he is in a minority. Requires the local educational agency to provide transportation for such transfer. Requires local educational agencies to insure that where minority children are concentrated in schools that they are not denied equal educational opportunities. States that unequal educational opportunity include: overcrowding, fewer and less qualified teachers, and less adequate services and facilities. Prohibits the separation of children on the basis of race. Allows equitable relief for violations of this title. Title II: State Responsibilities - Requires each State to submit to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare a plan to carry out this Act. Directs that the Virginia and Maryland plans shall take account of the neighboring areas of the District of Columbia. Requires each such plan to provide for establishment of a State advisory council to advise on the development of and policy matters concerning such plan. Requires such plans to provide for similarly functioning local advisory committees. Sets a January 30, 1975, deadline for submission of such plans to the Secretary. States that each plan must provide for implementing the purpose of this Act by 1985, by such particular means as: (1) drawing children from core city schools into suburban schools; (2) providing remedial and other services to meet the needs of underachieving children; and (3) decentralization and diversification of public schools. Requires such plans to specify how States can financially assist local areas undergoing desegregation pursuant to court order, to specify how federally funded educational programs fit into such plan, and to specify how to involve children in nonprofit private schools in programs funded under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for carrying out this title of $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 and $500,000,000 for fiscal year 1976 and each fiscal year thereafter. States that 80 percent of such funds must be dispersed among the States. Prohibits the use of such funds to supplant State or local expenditures. Authorizes the Secretary to discontinue all Federal grants to States whose plans are are in noncompliance with this Act. Title III: General Provision - Establishes a National Advisory Council on Educational Opportunities appointed by the President to advise the Secretary on the operation of States plans."
