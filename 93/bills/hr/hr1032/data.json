Extends the date of completion of certain highways under title 23 of the United States Code from June 30, 1976, to June 30, 1979. Directs the Secretary and all other heads of Federal agencies involved in the construction of the Federal aid highway system to encourage the minimization of paperwork and unnecessary delays in the administration of the program. Extends from July 1, 1975, to July 1, 1977, the deadline for States to submit plans, specifications, and estimates for the construction of its segment of the Interstate Highway System. Provides that the Secretary shall apportion one-third of the annual appropriations for the Federal-aid highway system to each State in the ratio system to each state in the ratio which the rural population of such State bears to the total rural population of all the States. Stipulates that no State shall receive less than one-half of one percent of each annual apportionment. Provides that an agreement between the Secretary and a State highway department for the reimbursement of the cost of acquiring rights-of-way under the Federal-Aid Highway Act shall provide for the actual construction of a road on such rights-of-way within a period not exceeding ten years following the fiscal year in which the request is made. Provides that after July 1, 1973, the State highway department shall not erect on any project where actual construction is in progress and visible to highway users any informational signs other than official traffic control devices conforming with standards developed by the Secretary of Transportation. Establishes a procedure whereby the Secretary may discharge any of his responsibilities under this Act relative to Federal-aid systems, except the Interstate System, by accepting a certification by any State highway department that it has met certain requirements. Provides that when any toll road which the Secretary has approved as a part of the Interstate System is made a toll-free facility, Federal-aid highway funds may be expended for the construction, reconstruction, or improvement of that road to meet the standards adopted for the improvement of projects located on the Interstate System.

Provides that just compensation shall be paid upon the removal of any outdoor advertising sign, display, or device (as required by this act) lawfully erected under State law.

States that in order to encourage the development, improvement, and use of public mass transportation systems operating motor vehicles (other than on rail) on Federal-aid highways for the transportation of passengers, so as to increase the traffic capacity of the Federal-aid systems for the movement of persons, the Secretary may approve as a project on any Federal-aid system the construction of exclusive or preferential bus lanes, highway traffic control devices, bus passenger loading areas and facilities (including shelters), and fringe and transportation corridor parking facilities to serve bus and other public mass transportation passengers. Provides that in any case where sufficient land exists within the publicly acquired rights-of-way of any Federal-aid highway to accommodate needed rail or nonhighway public mass transit programs and where this can be accomplished without impairing automotive safety or future highway improvements, the Administrator may authorize a State to make such lands and rights-of-way available without charge to a publicly owned mass transit authority for such purposes wherever he may deem that the public interest will be served thereby. Appropriates out of the Highway Trust Fund, $100,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974, and $100,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, for the construction of highways connected to the Interstate System in portions of urbanized areas with high traffic density. Provides that the Secretary shall develop guidelines and standards for the designation of routes and the allocation of funds for this purpose. States that high traffic sections of highways on the Federal-aid primary system which connect to the Interstate System shall be selected by each State highway department, in consultation with appropriate local officals, subject to approval by the Secretary, for priority of improvement as supplementary routes to extend and supplement the service provided by the Interstate System by furnishing needed adequate traffic collector and distributor facilities as well as extensions. Provides that a total of not more than 10,000 miles shall be selected under this section.

Directs that all Federal-aid highway funds expended for certain sections of Route 101 in New Hampshire must be repaid before any tolls may be collected thereon. Authorizes the Secretary to make available Federal-aid highway funds to any State which changes any interstate toll bridge to a free bridge on or before January 1, 1974.
