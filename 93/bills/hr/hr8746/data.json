Sets forth the definitions of terms used in this Act. Provides that no secondary medical record shall be admissible as evidence before any court in the District of Columbia, or before any proceeding of any commission, board, or agency of the government of the District of Columbia, and shall not be subject to a subpena issued by such court, commission, board, or agency. States that no member of a medical utilization committee, a peer review committee, a medical staff committee, or a tissue committee, operating in the District of Columbia, shall be liable for damages to any person for action taken within the scope of the functions of such committee if the committee member has a reasonable belief that such action is warranted."
