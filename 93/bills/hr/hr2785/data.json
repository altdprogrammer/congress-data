    "text": "Noise Disclosure Act - Forbids manufacturers to transport in, sell in, or introduce in interstate commerce or to import any new machinery unless disclosure of such machine's operational noise level is made or such machinery is exempted. Permits the Administrator to prescribe regulations exempting machinery whose operational noise level is negligible; which is incorporated in machinery already subject to disclosure; and which is newly imported and disclosure will be made prior to sale. Requires any new machinery to which is not exempted to have permanently affixed to the outside thereof a plate or label which discloses the operational noise level of such machinery; and to have affixed to any container in which it is sold a label disclosing such noise level. Requires the Administrator to prescribe regulations establishing standard procedures for measuring the operational noise level of each class of machinery. Permits reasonable inspection of the areas of a factory of or warehouse where the operational noise level of machinery is measured. Prescribes civil and criminal penalties for violation of this Act. Permits any person to commence a civil action against an alleged violation of this Act or against the Administrator for failure to perform any act or duty."
