    "text": "Declares that all wild free-roaming horses and burros are under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior for the purpose of management and protection. Directs the Secretary to designate specific ranges on public lands as sanctutaries for their protection and preservation. Provides that if an area is overpopulated, the Secretary may order the humane destruction of old, sick or lame animals and may order the capture of other excess animals for removal to private maintenance. Prohibits the destruction of these animals by anyone other than agents of the Secretary. Provides that if animals stray onto private property, the agents of the Secretary shall be notified by the owner and they shall remove the horses and burros. Authorizes the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture to appoint a Joint Advisory Board of not more than nine members to advise them on any matter relating to wild free-roaming horses and burros and their management and protection. Provides that anyone who kills, harms, sells or steals a wild horse or burro shall be subject to a fine of not more than $2,000, or imprisonment for not more than one year or both. Prohibits the Secretary from relocating these animals to areas of the public lands where they do not presently exist. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the administration of the act every two years, including a summary of enforcement actions, costs and recommendations for legislative action."
