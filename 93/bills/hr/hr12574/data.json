    "text": "Criminal Justice Information Systems Act - States that the exchange of criminal justice information between Federal and State criminal justice agencies or between criminal justice agencies located in different States is a useful and proper aid to law enforcement. Provides that exchanges and handling of such information must be accomplished in a manner which safeguards the interests of the individuals to whom the information refers. States that this Act applies to any criminal justice information system which is: (1) operated by the Federal Government; (2) operated by a State or local government and funded in whole or in part by the Federal Government; (3) an interstate system; or (4) operated by a State or local government and is engaged in the exchange of criminal justice information with a system covered by paragraphs (1), (2), or (3). Provides that criminal intelligence information may be used for a purpose not related to criminal justice if the Attorney General determines, with regard to the particular case or class of cases, that such use is necessary because of reasons of national defense or foreign policy. Requires any agency operating a criminal justice information system subject to this Act to maintain records with regard to requests from any other agency or person for criminal justice information and the source of criminal offender record information. States that any individual who complies with applicable regulations shall be entitled to review criminal offender record information regarding himself contained in any criminal justice information system subject to this Act. Requires each Federal agency which operates a criminal justice information system and each State to adopt regulations to implement this section. Provides that if, after review of such information, the individual disputes its accuracy or completeness, he may apply for correction or revision to the agency responsible for original entry of the allegedly incomplete or inaccurate information. Prohibits information relating to an arrest from being disseminated without the inclusion of the final disposition of the charges if a disposition has been reported. Provides that criminal offender record information concerning the arrest of an individual may not be disseminated or used for a non-criminal justice purpose if: (1) the individual is acquitted of the charge for which he was arrested; (2) the charge is dismissed; (3) a determination to abandon prosecution of the charge is made by the prosecuting attorney; or (4) an interval of one year has elapsed from the date of the arrest and no final disposition of the charge has resulted and no active prosecution of the charge is pending. States that nothing in this Act is to be construed to diminish greater rights of privacy or protection provided by a State law or regulation governing use, updating, or sealing of records in that State's criminal justice information system. Requires the security of information in a criminal justice information system subject to this Act shall be assured by management control by a criminal justice agency. Requires all criminal justice information systems subject to this Act to meet security standards promulgated by the Attorney General. Authorizes an individual with respect to whom criminal justice information has been maintained, disseminated, or used in violation of this Act or implementing regulations may bring a civil action against the individual or agency responsible for the alleged violation. States that any person who disseminates or uses criminal justice information knowing such dissemination or use to be in violation of this Act or any applicable regulations shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. Authorizes to be appropriated such funds as may be necessary for the Attorney General to implement this Act."
