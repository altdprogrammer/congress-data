Empowers the Office to compel delivery of any information in the possession of the National Laboratories which the Office deems necessary for conducting its study. Specifies that all Government agencies shall cooperate to the fullest extent with the Office. States that the recommendations of the study shall employ a cost benefit analysis of the safety and environmental hazards associated with the entire fuel cycle, the long-term economic effect of a commitment to nuclear fission powerplants, and the central question of proliferation of nuclear fission powerplants in relation to the possible alternatives. Specifies topics to be included in the comprehensive study of the office of Technology Assessment, in addition to those previously stated. Authorizes to be appropriated $100,000 for each of five fiscal years to carry out the study authorized by this Act."
