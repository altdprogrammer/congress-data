    "text": "Directs all Federal agencies to include in every recommendation or report on proposals for environmental quality, a detailed statement on: (1) the environmental impact of the proposed action; (2) adverse enviornmental effects which cannot be avoided; (3) alternative proposals; (4) the relationship between local short-term uses of man's environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long term productivity; and (5) any irreversible commitments of resources involved in implementation of any proposed action. Provides that copies should go to the Council on Environmental Quality, the public, and other interested Federal agencies. Directs the Council on Environmental Quality, upon learning about agency plans which would affect the environment, to require a written statement from the agency setting forth nature of the proposal and to issue orders halting the project to give the Council time to analyze the statement. Allows the Council to return these statements for revision and to continue the halt on the project until analysis of the improved statement is complete."
