States that any prohibition imposed by the President under the provisions this Act shall continue until the President determines that: (1) the plan to reduce the amount of crude oil or refined petroleum products exported to the United States has been completely abandoned, or (2) the property nationalized or expropriated has been returned in full to the company from which it was taken, or until such company has been fully compensated for such property. Directs the President to keep the Congress currently informed of all actions taken under this Act."
