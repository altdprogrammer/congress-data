Continues the insurance policy of a member of the Retired Reserve until such time as the member receives the first increment of retirement annuity, or the member's sixty-first birthday, whichever occurs earlier. Makes provisions for the conversion of Servicemen's Group Life Insurance following termination to a policy with a participating life insurance company. Provides for the payment of premiums by a deduction from the pay of a member of the reserve or Ready Reserve. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Air Force, as the case may be, to allow a member of the National Guard who is not on active duty to make allotments from his pay for the payment of premiums under a group life insurance program sponsored by the military department of the State in which such member holds his national guard membership or by the national guard association of such State.
