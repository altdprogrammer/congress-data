Provides that the Director shall establish and administer a program to facilitate the transfer of federally developed technology to other governmental units and private organizations. Directs that for the purposes of carrying out that program, the Director shall: (1) provide by grant or contract for conducting research and development with respect to technology transfer; (2) establish regional science and technology centers to obtain information as to the needs of potential users of federally developed technology, and how to more effectively disseminate such technology; and (3) establish, by grant to or contract with public or nonprofit private agencies, national laboratories to conduct all or part of the research and development activities described above. Transfers to the Director certain technology functions of the following officers and agencies: Secretary of Commerce, Commissioner of Patents, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Atomic Energy Commission, National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, and the Small Business Administration. Allows the President, for 3 years after enactment of this Act, to transfer to the Director any functions of any other department or agency which relate primarily to the functions of the Director."
