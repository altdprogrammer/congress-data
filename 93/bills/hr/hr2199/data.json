    "text": "Provides that the United States district court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction of civil actions to adjudicate disputed titles to lands in which the United States claims an interest. Provides that the United States shall not be disturbed in possession or control of any real property involved in any action under this Act pending a final judgment or decree and the conclusion of any appeal therefrom. Provides that if the final determination is adverse to the United States, it may nevertheless retain such possession or control of the real property upon payment of just compensation to the person entitled thereto. Provides for a six-year statute of limitations for any civil action brought under this Act. Provides that a civil action against the United States under this Act shall be tried by the court without a jury. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to permit suits against the United States based upon adverse possession."
