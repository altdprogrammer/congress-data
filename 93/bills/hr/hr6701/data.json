    "text": "Gives parents of U.S. citizens second preference status under the Immigration and Nationality Act. (Currently covered by this preference are spouses and unmarried sons or unmarried daughters of such aliens). Provides that such citizens must be at least 21 years of age. Provides that the number of aliens, exclusive of special immigrants, who may be issued immigrant visas shall not in any fiscal year exceed a total of 250,000. Provides that the number of immigrant visas made available to natives of any single foreign state shall not exceed 25,000 in any fiscal year. Increases from 1 percent to 3 percent the maximum number of immigrant visas available to a foreign state or the number of immigrants chargeable to a colony of a foreign state. Sets forth the method for allotting visas to aliens who are subject to numerical limitations. Provides that no more than two petitions for preference status may be approved for one petitioner in behalf of a child unless necessary to prevent the separation of brothers and sisters and no petition shall be approved if the alien has previously been accorded special immigrant or preference status as the spouse of a citizen of the United States or the spouse of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, by reason of a marriage determined by the Attorney General to have been entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws. (Amends 8 U.S.C. 1154) Provides that the Attorney General may in his discretion admit to the United States any immigrant inadmissible solely because he was not entitled to the visa classification exempting him from the numerical limitation on visa issuance or the preference classification specified in the immigrant visa presented at the time of application for admission, or because he was not charged to the proper foreign state in such visa, if the Attorney General is satisfied that such inadmissibility was not known to and could not have been ascertained by the exercise or reasonable diligence by such immigrant prior to his departure for the U.S. (Adds 8 U.S.C. 1181(c))"
