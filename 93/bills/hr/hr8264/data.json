    "text": "Prisoner Rights Act - Prohibits the inhumane treatment of any person held under authority of any enactment of Congress. Requires the immediate discharge of any officer or employee of the United States who knowingly and willfully engages in such treatment. Defines the term \"inhumane treatment\" as meaning: (1) striking, whipping, or otherwise imposing physical pain upon a prisoner as a measure of punishment; (2) any use of physical force by an employee except that which may be necessary for self-defense, to prevent or stop assault by one prisoner upon another person, and for prevention of riot or escape; (3) sexual or other assaults; (4) any punitive or restrictive measure taken in retaliation for the assertion of rights; (5) any measure intended to degrade such person, including insults and verbal abuse; and (6) any invidiously discriminatory treatment based upon race, religion, nationality, or political beliefs. Sets forth restrictions upon the use of solitary confinement in facilities covered by this Act. Directs the Attorney General to establish a grievance procedure to which all persons covered by this Act shall have access. Directs the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to establish rules permitting attorneys of record, relatives, and friends to visit and talk in private with any person covered by this Act. Authorizes civil actions against the authorities of any penal institution or facility who prevent visits permitted under this Act. Provides that any penal institution or facility may be visited at any time by any Member of Congress or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to Congress. (Adds 18 U.S.C. 4012, 4013)"
