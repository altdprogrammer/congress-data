    "text": "Coal Research Laboratory and Energy Research Fellowship Act - Title I: University Coal Research Laboratories - Authorizes the Director of the National Science Foundation, after consultation with the National Academy of Engineering, to designate five institutions of higher education at which university coal research laboratories will be established and operated. States that, in making designations under this Act, the Director shall consider the following criteria: (1) the institution of higher education shall be located in a State with abundant coal reserves; (2) the institution of higher education shall have experience in coal research, expertise in several areas of coal research, and currently active, outstanding programs in coal research; and (3) the institution of higher education has the capacity to establish and operate the coal laboratories to be assisted under this title. Provides that not more than one coal laboratory established pursuant to this title shall be located in a single State. Specifies information to be included in applications by institutions of higher education desiring to be designated under this title. Authorizes the Director to make grants to any designated institution of higher education to pay the Federal share of the cost of establishing and maintaining a coal laboratory. States that no institution of higher education may receive more than $4,000,000 for the construction of its coal research laboratory, including initially installed fixed equipment, nor may it receive more than $1,500,000 for initially installed movable equipment, nor may it receive more than $500,000 for new program startup expenses. Provides that no institution of higher education may receive more than $1,500,000 per year from the Federal Government for operating expenses. Establishes an Advisory Council on Coal Research. Stipulates that the Advisory Council shall advise the Director with respect to the general administration of this title, and furnish such additional advice as he may request. Authorizes appropriations of not to exceed $30,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975 (including the cost of construction, equipment, and startup expenses) and $7,500,000 beginning with the fiscal year 1976 and for each fiscal year thereafter through the fiscal year ending June 30, 1980, to carry out the provisions of this title. Title II: Energy Resource Graduate Fellowships - Authorizes the Director to award under the provisions of this title not to exceed one thousand five hundred fellowships for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and each of the five succeeding fiscal years. States that fellowships shall be awarded under the provisions of this title for graduate study and research in those areas of applied science and engineering that are related to the production, conservation, and utilization of fuels and energy. Provides that fellowships shall be awarded to students in programs leading to master's degrees. States that such fellowships may be awarded for graduate study and research at any institution of higher education, library, archive, or any other research center approved by the Director after consultation with the Commissoner of Education. Provides that recipients of fellowships under this title shall be: (1) persons who have been accepted by an institution of higher education for graduate study leading to an advanced degree or for a professional degree; and (2) persons who plan a career in the field of energy resources, production, or utilization. States that each person awarded a fellowship under this title shall receive a stipend of $4,000 for each academic year of study, and an additional amount of $500 for each such calendar year of study shall be paid to such person on account of each of his dependents. Authorizes appropriations of $11,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and for each of the five succeeding fiscal years."
