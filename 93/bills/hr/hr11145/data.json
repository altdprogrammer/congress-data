Requires that, within thirty days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Chief Judge shall appoint a Special Prosecutor. Makes it the duty of the Special Prosecutor to investigate and prosecute any offense against the United States arising out of: (1) the unauthorized entry into the National Committee headquarters at the Watergate, (2) any campaign activity with respect to the election in 1972 for the office of President, and (3) any activity of any member of the White House staff, any Presidential appointee, or any person acting on behalf of the President. Permits the Special Prosecutor to undertake any act he deems necessary to carry out his duties under this Act. Provides that the authority granted to the Special Prosecutor, and to the Chief Judge, under this Act shall remain effective until such time as the Special Prosecutor certifies to such Chief Judge and to both Houses of Congress that all investigations and prosecutions conducted pursuant to this Act have been completed. The certification shall be accompanied by a full and complete report of all activities conducted by the Special Prosecutor. Authorizes appropriation such of necessary sums to carry out the purposes of this Act."
