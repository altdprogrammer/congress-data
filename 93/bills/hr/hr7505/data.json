    "text": "National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Authorization Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to conduct investigations of motor vehicle crashes to gather information to identify design defects relating to motor vehicle safety, and to assist in the preparation of Federal motor vehicle safety standards for new and used motor vehicles. Requires the Secretary to cooperate with State and local officials while conducting his investigations. Authorizes officers or employees duly designated by the Secretary: (1) to enter, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, any premises where a motor vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment involved in a motor accident is located; (2) to impound temporarily for a period not to exceed 72 hours such motor vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment; and (3) to inspect such motor vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment. Requires that whenever an inspection and/or impounding of a vehicle by the Secretary results in the denial of the use of the vehicle to its owner or reduction in value of the vehicle, the Secretary shall pay reasonable compensation to the vehicle owner. Authorizes the Secretary to obtain a copy of an autopsy report prepared by State and local officials concerning a person who dies in or as a result of a motor vehicle crash. Provides that no portion of any statement or information furnished the Secretary by an individual and no portion of any report of the Secretary relating to a motor vehicle crash or the investigation thereof shall be admissable in any subsequent criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding. Permits the Secretary to seek an injunction against the sale, offer for sale, or the introduction or delivery for introduction in interstate commerce, or the importation into the United States, of any motor vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment that contains a defect which relates to motor vehicle safety. Requires the Secretary, whenever practicable, to give notice to any person against whom injunctive relief is contemplated, and afford such person an opportunity to present his views and to remedy the defect. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct such inspection and investigation as may be necessary to enforce the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and any rules and regulations issued thereunder. Requires that dealers and distributors of motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment furnish the Secretary with such information and data as he may require to carry out his enforcement responsibilities. Provides that a manufacturer, pursuant to the Secretary's determination of noncompliance with applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards or the existence of defects, shall send a notice to purchasers containing a clear description of the noncompliance or defect, an evaluation of the risk to traffic safety, and a statement of the measures taken to remedy such defect or failure. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) plan, design, and construct new facilities; (2) alter existing facilities; (3) lease facilities; and (4) acquire or lease real property for use as sites for new facilities or the alteration of existing facilities, suitable to conduct research and other testing in traffic, including highway safety and motor vehicle safety."
