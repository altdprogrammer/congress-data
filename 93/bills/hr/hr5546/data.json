    "text": "Provides that licenses for the operation of a broadcast station shall be issued for a term of five years and that any renewal of such license which may be granted from time to time for no longer than an additional five years. Authorizes the Federal Communications Commission to grant a renewal of a broadcasting license to any applicant who is legally, financially, and technically qualified to hold such a license and who demonstrates in its program service and broadcast operation a good faith effort to afford reasonable opportunities for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance. Requires the Commission, not to consider any predetermined performance criteria, catergories, quotas, percentages or formats in respect to the extent, nature, or content of broadcast programming but only the overall pattern of programming. Sets forth the procedure to be followed in the event that an application for the renewal of a broadcasting license is challenged by a petition to deny or by a competing application for the same broadcast service. (Amends 47 U.S.C. 307)"
