States that if the amount of back pay received by an individual during the taxable exceeds 15 percent of individual's gross income, the part of the tax attributable to the inclusion of such back pay in gross income shall not be greater than the aggregate of the increases in the taxes which would have resulted from the inclusion of the respective portions of such back pay in gross income for the taxable years to which such portions are respectively attributable. Allows similar income tax averaging over the period of years involved with respect to compensatory damages received for patent infringement, damages for injuries under the antitrust laws.
