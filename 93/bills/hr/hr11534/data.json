    "text": "Provides that the Secretary of Labor shall with respect to the applicability of standards established under the Occupational Safety and Health Act to small business concerns consider: (1) the distinction between small and large business concerns; (2) the applicability of each such standard on an industry-by-industry basis; and (3) where feasible and appropriate on the basis of the type of activity in each such industry, exceptions for business concerns. Requires the Secretary to establish simplified requirements for small business concerns designed to eliminate unnecessary and duplicative recordkeeping and reporting. Requires the Secretary to make an annual report to the Select Committee on Small Business of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the steps taken to assure that small business concerns are not unintentionally injured economically as a result of standards imposed under such Act. Authorizes the Secretary to visit the workplace of any small employer with 25 or fewer employees in order to afford consultation and advice to such employer. Requires such a visit to be made only upon a valid request. Requires the Secretary, upon discovering violations while on a visit, to issue written notice of such violation to the employer to make corrections within a reasonable time."
