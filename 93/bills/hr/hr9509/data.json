    "text": "National Mobile Home and Recreational Vehicle Safety Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to establish by order appropriate nonoperational Federal mobile home and recreational vehicle safety standards. Provides that, in prescribing standards under this Act, the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall: (1) consider relevant available mobile home safety data; (2) consult with such State or interstate agencies (including legislative committees) as he deems appropriate; (3) consider whether any such proposed standard is reasonable, practicable, and appropriate for the particular type of mobile home or recreational vehicle for which it is prescribed; (4) consider whether any such standard will result in a substantial increase in the retail price of mobile homes or recreational vehicles; and (5) consider the extent to which any such standard will contribute to carrying out the purpose of this title. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue initial Federal recreational vehicle and mobile home safety standards upon the expiration of a two hundred and seventy day period which begins on the date of enactment of this Act. Provides that the Secretary shall issue new and revised Federal recreational vehicle and mobile home safety standards under this title upon the expiration of the five hundred and forty-day period which begins on the date of enactment of this Act. Establishes both a National Mobile Home Safety Advisory Council, and a National Recreational Vehicle Safety Advisory Council, a majority of each of which shall be representatives of the general public, including representatives of State and local governments, and the remainder shall include mobile home or recreational vehicle manufacturers, dealers, representatives of insurers, and nationally recognized standards-producing organizations. Provides that the Secretary shall consult with the appropriate Advisory Council before establishing or revoking any mobile home or recreational vehicle safety standard pursuant to this title. Directs the Secretary to conduct research, testing, development and training necessary to carry out the purposes of this title. Provides that no person shall: (1) manufacture for sale, sell, offer for sale, or introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce, or import into the United States, any mobile home or recreational vehicle manufactured on or after the date any applicable Federal mobile home or recreational vehicle safety standard takes effect under this title unless it is in conformity with such standard; (2) fail or refuse access to or copying of records, or fail to make reports or provide information, or fail or refuse to permit entry or inspection, as required under this Act; (3) fail to issue a certificate required by this Act, or issure a certificate to the effect that a mobile home or recreational vehicle conforms to all applicable Federal mobile home or recreational vehicle safety standards, unless such person in the exercise of due care has reason to know that such certificate is false or misleading in a material respect; or (4) fail to furnish notification of any defect as required by this Act. Provides for civil penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct such inspection and investigation as may be necessary to enforce Federal mobile home and recreational vehicles safety standards established under this Act. Provides that every manufacturer, distributor, and dealer of mobile homes and recreational vehicles shall maintain such records, make such reports, and provide such performance and technical data to the Secretary as may be required to carry out the purposes of this Act. Establishes a National Mobile Home and Recreational Vehicle Safety Institute in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Provides that such Institute shall be headed by a Director appointed by the Secretary. Authorizes such Institute to : (1) develop, establish, and forward to the Secretary of Transportation recommended mobile home and recreational vehicle nonoperational safety standards; (2) conduct research, testing, development, and training as authorized by this title; (3) prepare the annual report to the Congress required by this title; and (4) perform all other functions of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under this Act. Requires the Secretary to submit to the President an annual report on the activities of the Department of Transportation under this Title. States that nothing in this Act shall prevent any State agency or court from asserting or continuing jurisdiction under State law over any aspect of mobile home or recreational vehicle safety with respect to which no standards have been established pursuant to this title. Provides that any State may assume responsibility for enforcement of any Federal standards which have been established under this Act upon approval by the Secretary under specified conditions. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States which have been delegated enforcement responsibility to assist them in identifying their needs and responsibilities in the area of safety standards enforcement or in developing enforcement plans. Provides that the Federal share of each such grant shall not exceed 90percent of the total cost. Authorizes Federal participation under the Home Owner's Loan Act of 1933 in any loan made for the purchase of a recreational vehicle or mobile home which meets or exceeds the safety standards established under this Act. Provides for Federal participation in loans made to veterans purchasing mobile homes and recreational vehicles which meet such standards."
