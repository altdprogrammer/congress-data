Title III: Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to gather information, develop a comprehensive program, and report to Congress no later than December 31, 1974, on the problems and needs of transient youth in the United States and on the causes of and possible methods of dealing with the runaway youth phenomenon. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress not later than December 31, 1974, on the desirability of current procedures and of new programs to deal with the problems and needs of transient youth in the United States.
