    "text": "Senior Citizens Community Centers and Services Act - Title I: Construction of Multipurpose Community Centers For Senior Citizens - Authorizes appropriations for grants for the construction of public community centers for senior citizens, in the amount of $70,000,000 for fiscal year 1974; $140,000,000 for fiscal year 1975; and $200,000,000 for fiscal year 1976. Authorizes allotments by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, to the States on the basis of: (1) the population of senior citizens in each State; (2) need for such community centers, and (3) the financial need of each State. Provides for regulations by the Secretary within six months after enactment concerning construction, selection, and kinds of community centers needed. Requires that State plans designate a single State agency for the administration of the plan, provide for a State advisory council to assist in the plan, specify the need and methods of administration of such a plan, and submit timely reports to the Secretary. Requires applications for each construction project through the State agency, setting forth plans and specifications of the project, certification of the federal share for the project, State approval, and assurances of State financial support. Provides for withholding of federal payments where there has been a failure to comply with the provisions and regulations of this Act. Title II: Initial Staffing of Multipurpose Community Centers for Senior Citizens - States the Congressional intention that senior citizens staff the community centers as volunteer or part-time employees, as far as possible. Authorizes appropriations of $40,000,000 for fiscal year 1973, and for each of the two succeeding years, for grants to help compensate professional and technical personnel during the initial operation of the community center (75 percent of the costs the first year, 66 2/3 percent the second year, and 50 percent the third year). Requires that the applicant owning or operating the center be a public or nonprofit private agency or organization. Limits such appropriations as are necessary after June 30, 1975, to community centers which have previously received grants. Title III: Programs and Services of the Multipurpose Community Centers - States the Congressional intention that senior citizens be involved in the planning of programs. Provides for the amending of State plans under Title III of the Older Americans Act of 1966 to assure that programs for senior citizens be conducted, whereever possible, in the multipurpose community centers. Authorizes an appropriation for this Title of $60,000,000 for fiscal year 1973, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1974, and $150,000,000 for fiscal year 1975; with the Secretary to establish the Federal share to assist the State plan under this title. Title IV: General Provisions - Defines \"multipurpose community center for senior citizens\" as a facility providing social, recreational, educational, cultural, informational, counseling, health, and legal services to senior citizens. Provides that the Federal share of the cost of construction projects shall be determined by the State plan (not less than 50 percent nor more than 90 percent of the cost of the construction of any project), and approved and promulgated by the Secretary. Provides for payment of installments to the State or directly to the applicant where required, upon inspection and certification to the Secretary by the State agency; or in advance if so determined by the Secretary. Provides for the judicial review by the State if the Secretary refuses to approve any application for a project. Provides that if within twenty years of completion the facility or center is sold, transferred, or ceases to be a public or other non-profit community center, the United States shall be entitled to recover from either the transferrer or the transferee an amount bearing the same ratio to the then value of the center as the amount of the Federal share borne to the cost of the construction of such project."
