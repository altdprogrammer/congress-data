    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to establish an organization unit under the Assistant Secretary for Child Support. Directs such Assistant Secretary to: (1) establish such standards for State programs for locating absent parents, establishing paternity, and obtaining child support as he determines to be necessary to assure that such programs will be effective; (2) evaluate the implementation of State programs established pursuant to this Act; and (3) provide technical assistance to the States to help them establish effective systems for collecting child support and establishing paternity. Establishes a revolving fund to pay the States for child support programs as provided in this Act. Authorizes appropriations to such fund. Establishes a Parent Locator Service under the direction of the Assistant Secretary for Child Support which shall be used to obtain and transmit to any authorized person (as defined in this Act) information as to the whereabouts of any absent parent when such information is to be used to locate such parent for the purpose of enforcing support obligations against such parent. Sets limits on disclosure of such information. Sets forth requirements for State child support plans in order to qualify for assistance under this Act. Authorizes quarterly payments to the States of 75 percent of their expenditures under their plans. Prescribes the distribution of amounts collected by States as child support. Allows garnishment of Federal salaries for child support purposes. Directs the Secretary, after appropriate consultation and study of the use of blood typing as evidence in judicial proceedings to establish paternity, to establish, or arrange for the establishment or designation of, in each region of the United States, a laboratory which he determines to be qualified to provide services in analyzing and classifying blood for the purpose of determining paternity, and which is prepared to provide such services to courts and public agencies. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to assess and collect, if necessary, child support obligations. States that no court of the United States, whether established under article I or article III of the Constitution, shall have jurisdiction of any action, whether legal or equitable, brought to restrain or review the assessment and collection of such amounts by the Secretary or his delegate, nor shall any such assessment and collection be subject to review by the Secretary or his delegate in any proceeding. Requires child support aid recipients to cooperate with the State in establishing the paternity of a child born out of wedlock with respect to whom aid is claimed, and in obtaining support payments for such applicant and for a child with respect to whom such aid is claimed, or in obtaining any other payments or property due such applicant or such child. Prescribes sanctions against States not cooperating with the provisions of this Act. Authorizes appropriations necessary to plan and prepare for implementation of this Act."
