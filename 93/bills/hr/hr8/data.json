Provides that the Secretary shall share up to 50 percent of the cost of forest practices on non-Federal public lands and small nonindustrial private lands. Provides that no private forest landowner shall receive cost sharing under this Act in excess of $2,500 in any one fiscal year. Requires the Secretary to cooperate with local associations or groups of nonindustrial forest owners, and to pay up to 50 percent of the cost of manpower, equipment, planting stock and other materials required to carry out essential forest management practices. Authorizes the Secretary to utilize the services of State and local committees established under the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act. Sets forth factors to consider prior to the distribution of funds under this Act. Provides that Federal funds may be allocated for cost sharing on a bid basis with priority accorded landowners contracting to carry out approved forestry practices for the smallest Federal cost share. States that the Secretary shall consult with the State forester or other appropriate official of each State in the conduct of the forestry incentives program provided for in this Act. Provides that the Secretary shall coordinate the administration of this Act with other related programs. Authorizes to be appropriated not to exceed $25,000,000 to carry out the provisions of this Act."
