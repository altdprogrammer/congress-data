    "text": "Provides that the Secretary of Agriculture, pursuant to arrangements between the United States and Mexico, is authorized to recruit agricultural workers from the Republic of Mexico to assist in the production of such agricultural commodities and products as the Secretary deems necessary. Authorizes the Secretary to establish wage standards, provide emergency medical care, and set forth conditions of employment. States that no workers shall be recruited under this Act unless the Secretary has determined that: (1) sufficient domestic workers are not available; (2) the employment of such workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of domestic agricultural workers similarly employed; and (3) reasonable efforts have been made to attract domestic workers for such employment at wages, standard hours of work, and working conditions comparable to those afforded to foreign workers. States that workers recruited under this Act shall be admitted to the United States subject to the immigration laws for such time and under such conditions as may be specified by the Attorney General. Provides that no penalty bond shall be required which imposes liability upon any person for the failure of any such worker to depart from the United States upon termination of employment. Provides that no workers will be made available under this Act for employment after December 31, 1976."
