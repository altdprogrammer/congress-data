    "text": "South Atlantic Basin Environmental Conservation Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into contracts of not to exceed ten years with landowners and operators in the South Atlantic Basin determined by him to have control for the contract period of the farms, ranches, or other lands covered thereby. Provides that such contracts shall be designed to assist farm, ranch, or other landowners or operators to make, in orderly progression over a period of years, changes in their cropping systems and land uses which are needed to control erosion and sediment on farms, ranches, and other lands and to install soil and water conservation measures needed to control erosion, sedimentation, and other pollutants. Provides that the South Atlantic Basin area consists of the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Requires the landowner or operator to furnish to the Secretary a plan of farming operations prepared with the assistance of the Soil Conservation Service. Provides for conditions under which landowners shall be eligible for contract participation under this Act. Authorizes the appropriation, without fiscal year limitation, of such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act."
