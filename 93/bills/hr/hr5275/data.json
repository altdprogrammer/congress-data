Authorizes appropriations out of the highway trust fund for: (1) the Federal-aid primary system in rural areas; (2) the Federal-Aid urban system; (3) forest highways; (4) public lands highways; and (5) Indian reservation roads and bridges. Provides for authorizations for landscapping and scenic enhancement and for the administrative expenses of the beautification program. States that the primary system shall consist of an adequate system of arterial routes in rural areas important to interstate, statewide, or regional travel. Provides that each State designate such a system subject to the approval of the Secretary of Transportation. States that the secondary system shall consist of major collection routes in rural area and designated by each State and appropriate local officials in cooperation with each other subject to the Secretary's approval. Provides that at any time prior to July 1, 1974, upon the joint request of a State and the local governments concerned, the Secretary can withdraw his approval of any controversial interstate segment if he determines it is not essential to the completion of a unified and connected interstate system. Provides that the Secretary must receive assurances that the State does not intend to construct a toll road in the traffic corridor which the removed segment would have served. Requires the Secretary to remove interstate segments from designation as a part of the interstate system where a State has not established a construction schedule within the period of availability of funds authorized to be appropriated for completion of the interstate system and where the secretary has received no assurances that such schedule will be met. Substitutes the total population outside of urbanized areas for the general population in the Federal-aid primary apportionment formula. Provides that no less than 10 percent nor more than 30 percent of the funds apportioned to a State for the primary system will be available to the State for the secondary system. Provides that, in improving Federal-aid urban system projects, traffic operations improvement programs and fringe and corridor parking will be given full consideration in selecting projects on the urban system. Extends from 7 to 10 years the allowable time period within which highway construction must begin following the advance purchase of rights-of-way. Requires the Secretary to make a final inspection of projects completed after the issuance of a certification of State capability and requires an adequate report of the estimated and actual cost of construction. Permits specified ferries to travel in international waters when operating between the islands which comprise Hawaii and when operating solely between Alaska and Washington. Authorizes the Secretary to remove outdoor advertising not in compliance with State law no later than five years after the signs become nonconforming. Authorizes the Secretary to provide standards for the erection along the interstate system of signs providing specific information. Requires the Secretary to cooperate with the States in the development of transportation plans and programs which are formulated with due consideration to their probable effect on the future development of urbanized areas. Extends authorization for the highway construction training program. Authorizes the use of funds apportioned to each State for the Federal-aid urban system to finance the Federal share of the costs of public mass transportation projects. Defines the acceptable types of mass transportation.
