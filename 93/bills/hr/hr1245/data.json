    "text": "National Primary Election Act - Provides that each State holding a presidential primary election shall hold such election on: (1) the first Tuesday after the first Monday in April; (2) the third Tuesday in May; or (3) the last Tuesday in June. Provides that each political party shall be eligible for a separate ballot in each State's primary if the elections for candidates for President and Vice President for such party received an aggregate number of votes equal to at least 10 percent of the total number of votes cast throughout the United States for all electors for candidates for President and Vice President in the last presidential election preceding such primary. Prescribes eligibility requirements for voters in such elections. Provides that if no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the total number of votes cast for candidates of a given party in a State primary, the total number of that State's delegate votes at such party's national nominating convention shall, on that convention's first ballot, be allocated among all candidates of that party who received at least 10 percent of the total number of votes cast in such party primary in such State. Establishes a National Presidential Candidates Designation Committee to prepare a list which shall include the name of each person who meets the constitutional qualifications for the President and has general recognition, in the judgment of the committee, as a candidate for the presidential nomination of the party of his affiliation. Provides that any person not designated for placement on primary ballots of such person's party may gain placement on such ballots if that person qualifies in all those States holding primaries on the same day by filing with the appropriate office in each such State."
