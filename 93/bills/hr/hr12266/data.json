States that except where a person who is a member of a labor union and works at a plant or site subject to a strike or lockout has less than $1,500 in liquid assets, proper negotiations have been conducted between the employer and the union, and a Federal arbitrator has certified that the union has made every honest attempt at fair collective bargaining, refusal to work at such plant or site for the duration of such strike or lockout shall be deemed to be a refusal to accept employment.
