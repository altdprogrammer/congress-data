    "text": "Comprehensive Health Insurance Act - Title I: National Health Care Benefits Program - States that the purpose of this title is to provide adequate protection against costs by requiring all employers to offer health care plans to their employees; and to assist the States in making similar plans available to individuals in need of such protection. Requires, under the Social Security Act, that every employer provide to each of his employees under the age of 65 a reasonable opportunity, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, to obtain coverage for himself and the members of his family under the age 65 at the option of the employee: (1) an employee health care insurance plan approved under this title or an assisted health care insurance plan obtained by the employer, (2) a group practice prepaid health care plan approved under this title, or (3) an individual practice prepaid health care plan approved under this title. States that the employer shall provide an amount equal to at least 75 percent of the cost of that coverage. Prohibits discrimination against an individual with respect to the opportunity for employment, or the compensation, terms, condition, or privileges of employment, because of the individual's health status or the health status of his dependents, except when directly related to the capacity of the individual to perform his duties as an employee. Directs the Secretary to make grants for health care programs to States which have submitted approved plans for the provision of health care benefits to individuals under the age of 65 who are otherwise unable to obtain such benefits. Authorizes appropriations for each fiscal year of sums necessary to carry out this purpose. Requires that employee health care insurance plans provide for the following services for each covered individual: (1) inpatient hospital services; (2) physicians' services; (3) medical and other health services; (4) home health services; (5) post-hospital extended care services; (6) outpatient drugs and biologicals; (7) routine dental services for individuals under the age of 13: (8) developmental vision care services, as defined in regulations prescribed by the Secretary as routine eye and vision examinations, and eyeglasses, for individuals under the age of 13; and (9) hearing aids and examinations therefor, for individuals under the age of 13. Sets forth limits for employee health care insurance plans, including the following: (1) post-hospital extended care services shall be limited to 100 days per calendar year; (2) home health services must be limited to 100 visits per calendar year; and (3) inpatient hospital services for the treatment of mental illness shall be limited to 30 days per calendar year, with each day of partial hospitalization, as defined in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, counting as one-half day of inpatient services. Enumerates the requirements for meeting the provisions of this Act. States that a group practice pre-paid health care plan must: (1) provide physicians' services (other than infrequently used services, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) through physicians who are employees or partners of the organization, or through arrangements with one or more groups of physicians engaged in the coordinated practice of their profession for the organization; and (2) meet such requirements concerning its organizational structure and financial arrangements as the Secretary may, by regulation, prescribe. Provides that the Secretary may, by regulation, make such modifications in the requirements imposed by this section as he determines are appropriate with respect to group practice prepaid health care plans offered to employees whose place of employment is outside the United States. Sets forth requirements for approval of individual practice prepaid health care plans, approval of special employee health care programs, and requirement for certification of providers. States that any State dissatisfied with a determination of the Secretary with respect to whether the State is meeting the provisions of this Act may file a petition for review of such determination with the United States court of appeals to the circuit in which such state is located. Stipulates that the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Secretary, or to set it aside, in whole or in part. Sets forth judicial remedies and criminal sanctions for noncompliance. Title II: General Provisions - States that if a provision of this Act is held invalid, all other provisions so enacted shall remain in effect."
