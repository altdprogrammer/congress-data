    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Federal Noxious Weed Act - Permits the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate such quarantines and regulations requiring inspection of products and articles of any character whatsoever as he deems necessary to prevent the dissemination into the United States of any noxious weeds. Prohibits the movement or sale of any noxious weed identified in a regulation into or through the United States unless authorized under permit from the Secretary. Allows the Secretary, in order to prevent the dissemination of any noxious weed, to destroy, or otherwise dispose of, any product or article of any character whatsoever which he has reason to believe is infested by or contains any such noxious weed, if there is no less drastic action which would be adequate to prevent the dissemination of noxious weeds into the United States or interstate. Enables the owner of any article destroyed to bring an action against the United States in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia within one year after such destruction. Permits any authorized inspector, without a warrant, to stop any persons or means of conveyance moving into or through the United States, and to inspect any noxious weeds and any products and articles of any character whatsoever carried thereby, to determine whether such persons or means of conveyance are moving any noxious weeds contrary to this Act. Allows the entry with a warrant into any premises in the United States for inspections or other actions necessary under this Act. Provides a fine not exceeding $5000 or imprisonment not exceeding 1 year or both, for violation of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to cooperate with agencies and other organizations to control the spread of any noxious weed. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as Congress from time to time may determine to be necessary to carry out this Act."
