    "date": "1973-10-12", 
    "text": "Psychotropic Substances Act - Requires the Secretary of State, upon notification from the Secretary General of the United Nations that the World Health Organization has been given information pursuant to the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, that may justify adding a substance to the schedules of the Convention, transferring a substance to another schedule, or deleting it from schedules, to notify the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, who shall prepare for submission to the World Health Organization evaluations regarding proposed actions. Directs the Secretary, upon such notification to confer with the Attorney General and determine if existing legal controls meet the requirements of the schedule specified in such notification. Allows the Secretary to propose more stringent controls, even if requirements are being met, to propose scheduling of substances to meet requirements of the Convention, or to follow procedures to remain in at least temporary noncompliance with such requirements. Requires the Attorney General to assure that minimal United States obligations to the Convention are met if procedures of noncompliance will take more than a time specified by the Convention. Requires the Attorney General to comply with the scheduling requirements if a review of such requirements, requested under the noncompliance procedures, by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations results in support of such requirements. Requires manufacturers of psychotropic substances subject to the Convention to report to the Attorney General periodically. States that no international agreements on psychotropic substances shall be construed to: (1) require specific punishments for psychotropic substances offenses or to limit education and rehabilitation as alternatives to conviction or punishment; (2) limit protection of confidentiality of patient records of research subjects; (3) modify the authority of practitioners and registered establishments to use and dispense narcotic controlled substances; or (4) prevent drug price communications to consumers."
