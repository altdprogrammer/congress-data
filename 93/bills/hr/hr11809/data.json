Declares that the baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea shall be established in accordance with the provisions of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone and, where applicable, the method of straight baselines shall be employed in drawing the baseline pursuant to such convention. Provides that, within the two-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the baseline for the purpose of charting the contiguous fisheries zone shall be marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the United States. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
