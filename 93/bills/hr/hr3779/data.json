Establishes the position of Commission General Counsel, who will have final authority with respect to the investigation of complaints.

Provides for an annual review and study of the operation of these provisions. Establishes a United States Court of Military Grievances, to consist of 3 judges appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.
