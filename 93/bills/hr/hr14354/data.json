Requires the Secretary to use the funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation to purchase agricultural commodities and their products to maintain the programs specified above. Provices that for the fiscal year 1975, and subsequent fiscal years, the national average value of donated foods, or cash payments in lieu thereof under the National School Lunch Act, shall not be less than 10 percent per lunch. Provides that that amount shall be adjusted on an annual basis each fiscal year after June 30, 1975, to reflect changes in the series for food away from home of the Consumer Price Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor. Provides that such adjustment shall be computed to the nearest one-fourth cent. Provides that among those commodities delivered under this Act the Secretary of Agriculture shall give special emphasis to high protein foods, meat, and meat alternates. Increases the authorized appropriations under such Act for nonfood assistance. Increases the authorized appropriations under such Act for the special supplemental food program."
