Increases penalties for violations of this Act to a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than 3 years, or both. Provides for civil actions by private parties under this Act. Provides that any person aggrieved by the violation of any provision of this Act may file suit in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties. Provides a course of legal action and penalties for discrimination against any farm worker who has, with just cause, filed any complaint or instituted any proceeding under or related to this Act.
