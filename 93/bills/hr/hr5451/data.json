Defines the term \"instantaneous rate of discharge of oil content\" as meaning the rate of discharge of oil in liters per hour at any instant divided by the speed of the ship in knots at the same instant. Transfers the duties of the Secretary of Transportation under the Act to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. Defines the meaning of distance from the nearest land for purposes of actions in the vicinity of Australia. Prohibits the discharge of oil or oily mixture from a ship unless; (1) the ship is proceeding en route; (2) the rate of discharge of oil content does not exceed sixty liters per mile; and (3) the oil content, for a ship other than a tanker, is less than 100 parts per one million parts and the discharge is made as for as practicable from the nearest land. Sets forth construction standards and deadlines for compliance with the Act for tankers. Requires certification of tankers complying with standards by the Secretary. Prescribes civil and criminal penalties for the willful discharging of oil in violation of the Act. Requires that the oil recordbook be completed on each occasion, on a tank-to-tank basis, whenever specified operations on a tanker or other ship take place. Prescribes the effective dates of the various provisions of this Act. Amends 33 U.S.C. 1001-15"
