    "text": "Parole Reorganization Act - Title I: Federal Parole System - Establishes, as an independent establishment in the executive branch, a Board of Parole to consist of a National Board and five Regional Boards, to be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Provides that the National Board shall have the power to: (1) conduct appellate review of determinations of the Regional Boards; (2) request probation officers and other individuals, organizations, and public or private agencies to perform such duties with respect to any parolee as the National Board deems necessary for maintaining proper supervision of and assistance to such parolees; and (3) issue subpenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnessess and the production of any evidence that relates to any matter with respect to which the National Board or any Regional Board is empowered to make a determination under this Act. Provides that, upon the request of the National Board, each Federal agency is authorized and directed to make its services, equipment, personnel, facilities, and information available to the greatest practicable extent to the Board of Parole in the performance of its functions. Provides that, whenever confined and serving a definite term or terms of over one hundred and eighty days, a prisoner shall be eligible for release on parole after serving ten years of a life sentence or of a sentence of over thirty years. Provides that the Regional Board shall release a prisoner whose record shows that he has substantially observed the rules of the institution in which he is confined on the date of his eligibility for parole, unless the Board determines that he should not be released on such date for one or more of the following reasons: (1) there is a reasonable probability that such prisoner will not live and remain at liberty without violating any criminal law; or (2) there is a reasonable probability that such release would be incompatible with the welfare of society. Provides that when it appears to the Regional Board that a prisoner not yet eligible for parole will live and remain at liberty without violating any criminal law, and that his immediate release is not incompatible with the welfare of society, the Board in its discretion may apply to the court imposing sentence for a modification of his sentence in order to make him so eligible. Sets forth the factors to be taken into account by the Board in considering a person's eligibility for parole. Sets forth the procedures and requirements of a parole hearing. Authorizes the Board to impose such conditions of parole as it deems reasonably necessary to ensure that the parolee will lead a law-abiding life or to assist him in doing so. Provides that the jurisdiction of the Board of Parole over the parolee shall terminate not later than the date of the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced. Provides that the Board shall allow each parolee whose record of conduct sjuhows that he has substantially observed the conditions of his parole a deduction from his parole. Sets forth a formula for determining such deduction. Provides that when an alien prisoner subject to deportation become eligible for parole, the Regional Board may authorize his release on condition that he be deported and remain outside the United States. Sets forth conditions for the modification or revocation of the parole of any parolee at any time prior to the termination of the jurisdiction of the Board of Parolee over the parolee. Provides that a prisoner who is denied release on parole or whose parole has been revoked, or a parolee whose parole good time has been forfeited or withheld, may appeal such action by submitting a notice of appeal not later than fifteen days after receiving written notice of such action and by submitting appeal papers not later forty-five days aftee being so informed. Authorizes the court having jurisdiction to impose sentence to fix the time at which a person may be eligible for parole, notwithstanding other provisions of this Act. Provides that the National Board shall: (1) systematically collect and disseminate the data obtained from studies, research, and the emperial experience of public and private agencies concerning the parole process and parolees; (2) carry out programs of research to develop effective classification systems through which to describe the various types of offenders who require different styles of supervision and the types of parole officers who can provide them; and (3) devise and conduct, in various geographical locations, seminars and workshops providing continuing studies for persons engaged in working directly with parolees. Title II: Grants to States - Provides, under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, that grants may be made to State correctional institutions and facilities that provide satisfactory emphasis on the development and operation of community-oriented programs for the supervision of and assistance to parolees and provides satisfactory assurances that the State parole system shall include: (1) employment programs designed to encourage the proper reintegration of offenders into the community; and (2) procedures designed to ensure equitable and expeditious disposition of parole hearings.
