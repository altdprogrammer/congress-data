Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop and test new building designs and construction methods which involve the utilization of solar energy equipment; and (2) prescribe standards and specifications for such building designs and construction methods. States that in determining the maximum dollar amount of a mortgage which may be insured under the National Housing Act, with respect to any dwelling or residence which involves a building design or construction methods which meet the standards prescribed by the Secretary, he may increase the maximum amount of a mortgage which may be insured with respect to such dwelling or residence by the amount by which the cost of using such building design or construction methods exceeds the cost of using conventional building design and construction methods."
