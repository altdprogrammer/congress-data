    "text": "Requires the Federal Communications Commission to prescribe regulations: (1) establishing the telephone number 911 as the number for emergency telephone calls made anywhere in the United States, (2) requiring every telephone company to establish a system for connecting any emergency telephone call made using such number to an appropriate agency, and (3) defining the term 'emergency telephone call'. Makes it unlawful for any person to willfully make any telephone call using the number 911 if he knows that such telephone call is not an emergency telephone call."
