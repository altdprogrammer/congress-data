    "text": "Senior Citizens Skill and Talent Utilization Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to establish a senior citizens skill and talent utilization program for unemployed citizens 55 years of age or older. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with agencies, organizations or States to further the purposes and goals of such program and to develop projects to implement such program. Provides that such agreements may include provisions for the payment of project costs in order to make the program effective. Provides that various conditions must be met by projects under such agreements before payment will be authorized. Directs the Secretary to consult with States and their political subdivisions in regard to: (1) the localities in which projects of the type authorized by this Act are established and (2) potential projects and the number or percentage of eligible individuals in the local population. Provides that the Secretary shall encourage participating agencies or organizations eligible for payment under this Act to coordinate their activities with agencies and organizations which are conducting existing programs of a related nature. Provides that eligible individuals who are employed in any project funded under this Act shall not be considered to be Federal employees as a result of such employment. Asserts that no contract shall be entered into under this Act with a contractor who is, or whose employees are, under State law, exempted from operation of the State workmen's compensation or unemployment compensation laws generally applicable to employees, unless the contractor shall undertake to provide either through insurance by a recognized carrier, or by self-insurance, as allowed by State law, that the persons employed under the contract shall enjoy workmen's compensation and unemployment compensation coverage equal to that provided by law for covered unemployment. Authorizes appropriations of $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1973, $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1974, and $125,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 for purposes of this Act."
