Revises the Public Health Service Act by providing that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall promulgate regulations providing for mandatory allocation of chlorine, activated carbon, lime, ammonia, soda ash, or other chemical or substance used in the treatment of drinking water or waste water, such regulations to only apply to chlorine unless the other chemicals are also found to be in short supply. Authorizes the Administrator to hold such hearings and receive such evidence as he deems necessary to carry out this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to gather such information from and make such inspections of producers and importers of chlorine or other allocated chemicals as are necessary to carry out this Act. Provides penalties for failure to comply with regulations promulgated under this Act. Provides that no provision of this Act shall be deemed to convey to any person subject to the Act immunity from civil or criminal liability, or to create defenses to actions, under the antitrust laws. Sets forth exceptious to the antitrust provisions of this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of such funds as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
