(Adds 26 U.S.C. 401 (a)(11)) Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to receive amounts which are transferred to him from a qualified trust in settlement of an individual's rights when such individual is separated from employment covered by the plan before the time prescribed for payments under the plan to such individual as his beneficiaries. Establishes a special fund to receive these amounts. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to provide technical assistance to employers trade unions, and administrators of pension funds in their efforts to provide greates retirement protection for individuals who are separated from employment covered under private pension plans."
