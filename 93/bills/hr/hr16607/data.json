Authorizes to be appropriated for the fiscal year 1975, $4,000,000,000 to carry out the provisions of this Act. States that such sums shall be used to provide unemployed persons with transitional employment in jobs providing needed public services, and, wherever feasible, related training and manpower services to enable such persons to move into employment or training not supported under this Act whenever: (1) the average rate of national unemployment for any three consecutive months exceeds 6 percent, or (2) the President determines, with the agreement of the Congress by concurrent resolution, after reviewing forecasts of anticipated levels of economic activity, that specified amounts shall be obligated in order to diminish expected levels of unemployment. Provides for the filing of a report with Congress on the implementation of this Act."
