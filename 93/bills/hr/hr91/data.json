Provides for Federal action in the absence of a State land use program when the Federal Government's action will affect the use of non-Federal lands. Requires the Secretary to provide advice upon request to States concerning the designation of areas of critical environmental concern to the Nation, and appropriate Federal agencies shall make their data and expertise available to States for use in the preparation of land use programs.
