    "text": "Provides under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (prohibiting discrimination under Federally assisted programs on grounds of race, color, or national origin) that nothing in the title shall be construed so as to permit the curtailment or delay of Federal financial assistance to any local educational agency which operates its system of free public education on an exclusively open enrollment basis. Defines the term \"open enrollment basis\" to mean a plan which is executed in good faith to provide that each student has an equal opportunity to exercise a completely free choice (to be exercised either by the student, if age eighteen or above, or by such student's parent or guardian) of attending, without having to bear any increased cost by reason of differences in distances from such student's home to the school of choice, any school offering an educational program geared to the age of the student and operated by the relevant local educational agency. (Adds 42 U.S.C. 2000d-7)"
