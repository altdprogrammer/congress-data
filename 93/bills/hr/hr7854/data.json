Directs the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to encourage the use of illustrations, models, manuals, films, and other alternative methods to live experimentation in the furtherance of stimulating medical and scientific interest in elementary and secondary schools. Prohibits Federal assistance to local educational agencies which permit elementary and secondary school children to experiment with live animals. Authorizes to carry out this Act $100,000 for the fiscal year in which this Act is enacted, and $100,000 for each of the next four fiscal years thereafter."
