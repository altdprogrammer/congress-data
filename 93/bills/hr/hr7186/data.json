Excludes scholarships and fellowship grants, and educational assistance benefits paid by the Veterans' Administration, from such expenses paid for education purposes under this Act. Limits the eligibility for tax credit. Provides that the credit allowed to the taxpayer during the taxable year shall not exceed an amount equal to the sum of: (1) 100 percent of so much of the education expenses as does not exceed $200; (2) 75 percent of so much of such expenses as exceeds $200 but does not exceed $500; and (3) 25 percent of so much of such expenses as exceeds $500 but does not exceed $1,500. Reduces the credit allowable under this Act by an amount equal to 1 percent of the amount by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income under the code exceeds $19,000."
