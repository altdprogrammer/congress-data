Provides that whoever, being an officer, agent, or employee of the United States or any department or agency thereof willfully: (1) searches any private dwelling used and occupied as a dwelling without a warrant directing such search or maliciously and without reasonable cause searches any other building or property without a search warrant; (2) procures or inspects the records of telephone calls, bank, credit, medical, or other business or private transactions of any individual without a search warrant or the consent of the individual; (3) opens any foreign or domestic mail not directed to him without a search warrant directing such opening or without the consent of the sender or addressee of such mail; or (4) intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any other person to intercept any wire or oral communication except as authorized by law; shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both. Requires that within 30 days after the date of an order authorizing or approving the interception of a wire or oral communication (or each extension thereof) entered under authority of law, or the denial of an order approving an interception, the person seeking such order shall report to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and to the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and House of Representatives: (1) the fact that an order or extension was applied for; (2) the kind of order or extension applied for; (3) the fact that the order or extension was granted as applied for, was modified, or was denied; (4) the period of interceptions authorized by the order, and the number and duration of any extensions of the order; (5) the names of all parties to the intercepted communications; (6) the offense specified in the order or application; (7) the identity of the investigative or law enforcement officer and agency making the application and the person authorizing the application to be made; (8) a copy of the court order authorizing, approving, or denying such interception; and (9) the nature of the facilities from which or the place where communications were intercepted. Specifies that reports be made within 90 days after the date of an order approving the interception of a wire or oral communication on the disposition of all records of any such interception and the identity of and action taken by all individuals who had access to any such interception. Sets forth reporting requirements in the case of warrants issued authorizing the opening of mail."
