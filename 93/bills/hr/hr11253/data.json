Authorizes to be appropriated $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 for such grants. Allows the Secretary to make grants to cities with populations exceeding ten thousand to pay 75 percent of the annual salaries of urban foresters. Authorizes to be appropriated $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 for such grants. Provides that no grant may be made under this Act unless an application therefor has been submitted to, and approved by, the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance to cities to assist such cities in planning, developing, and administering forestry programs."
