Excludes from the audit reports of examination of banks or any material revealing information which in the opinion of the Board would have a seriously adverse effect on the conduct of monetary policy or on relations with a foreign government or foreign central bank. Extends the authority of Federal Reserve banks to purchase United States obligations directly from the Treasury until October 31, 1975. Authorizes $140,000,000 (now $60,000,000) for the construction of Federal Reserve branch bank buildings."
