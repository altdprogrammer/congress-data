    "text": "Small Boat Operators Licensing Act - Requires every person wishing to operate a vessel required to be numbered under the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 on any waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and on the high seas beyond the territorial seas for vessels owned in the United States, to first secure a license for such operation in the State where he is a resident, in accordance with a State licensing system approved by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, or if no such licensing system has been approved by the Secretary for such State, such person shall secure a license in accordance with this Act. Provides that the Secretary shall approve for the purposes of this Act any State system for licensing vessel operators which meets the following standards: (1) the applicant must pass an examination on boating safety fundamentals meeting at a minimum those requirements established by the Secretary for a license under this Act; (2) the applicant must pass an examination on the rules of the road meeting at a minimum those requirements established by the Secretary for a license under this Act; (3) the license shall be subject to suspension or revocation for, at a minimum, those grounds established by the Secretary for suspension or revocation of a license under this Act; (4) the license shall be periodically renewable without examination; and (5) the State may charge fees in connection with the securing or renewal of a license under its system of licensing. Provides that no person shall operate or navigate any vessel required to be numbered under the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 on any waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and, in the case of a vessel owned in the United States, on the high seas, if such person is not duly licensed by a State or the Secretary in accordance with this Act. Provides that whoever operates or navigates any vessel on any of the waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and, in the case of a vessel owned in the United States, on the high seas, in violation of this Act shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500."
