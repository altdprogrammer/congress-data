    "text": "Federal Boxing Control Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to establish a Federal Boxing Commission with adequate authority to exercise continuing surveillance over professional boxing matches which are broadcast by televsion or radio (otherwise than as part of bona fide news broadcasts) or which are disseminated by wire in interstate or foreign commerce either to be received on home receivers or in theaters, arenas, or other places of assembly, whether such broadcast or dissemination involves on-the-spot coverage or delayed coverage by means of film, tape, or some other means of recording. Authorizes the Commission to issue licenses authorizing participation in covered boxing matches or the coverage thereof in such capacities as are required to be licensed under this Act or regulations issued pursuant to this Act. Provides that, in issuing any such license, the Commission shall give due regard to character, conduct, background, reputation, experience, and such other factors as the Commission deems relevant in determining the fitness of any person to act in the capacity for which the license is to be issued. Stipulates that any such license shall be effective for such period not exceeding one year as the Commission may determine by regulation or otherwise at the time of issuance, unless sooner revoked or suspended in accordance with this Act. Specifies that no person may participate in any covered boxing match or the coverage thereof in any of the following capacities unless such person holds a currently effective license therefor: (1) as a boxer, (2) as a boxing promoter, (3) as an agent of a boxer, (4) as a fight manager, (5) as a matchmaker, (6) as a referee, (7) as a judge, (8) as a person providing coverage in any capacity which is specified in the regulations of the Commission, except that a license shall not be required under this paragraph for any person licensed under the Communications Act of 1934, and (9) in any other capacity which the Commission by regulation prescribes. Stipulates that the Commission may, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, by order prohibit the holding or coverage or both of any proposed covered boxing match if it finds that such prohibition is in the public interest. Authorizes the Commission to make investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate any provision of this Act or any rule or regulation thereunder. Sets forth criminal penalties for violation of the provisions of this Act."
