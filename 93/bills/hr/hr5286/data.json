    "text": "Dangerous Drug Tracer and Law Enforcement Information Act - Makes it unlawful under the Controlled Substance Act to manufacutre or distribute Schedule II or Schedule III depressant and stimulant substances unless they contain tracer ingredients. Authorizes the Attorney General to require tracers in other substances as may be necessary to maintain effective control against diversion of such substances into other than legitimate channels. Requires the Attorney General, after consultation with the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare and others knowledgeable in the manufacture, distribution and monitoring of controlled substances, to determine appropriate methods for incorporating tracers in depressants and stimulant controlled substances. Provides that the Attorney General shall conduct programs to implement the tracer program, develop rapid field and laboratory tracer identification techniques, train local, State and Federal law enforcement personnel regarding the identification of tracer elements and investigation of diversion, and establish standards to evaluate diversion and tracer control of other controlled substances. Requires the Attorney General to establish regulations to obtain comprehensive information from State and local law enforcement agencies in order to assess the nature and extent of diversion and the impact of efforts to curb diversion. Sets forth additional methods by which the Attorney General shall obtain information on the diversion of controlled substances. Requires the Attorney General to submit an annual report to the Congress on the nature and extent of controlled substances diversion, the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts to curb diversion of controlled substances, and the effectiveness of the tracer system. Provides that abandonment or failure to maintain effective controls against diversion or failure to provide a standard of control consistent with the public health or safety are grounds for suspension or revocation of the registration required to manufacture, distribute or dispense controlled substances under the Act. Authorizes to be appropriated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974, and for each of the next five fiscal years, such sums as may be necessary for carrying out this Act."
