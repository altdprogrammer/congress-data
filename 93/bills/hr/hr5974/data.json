    "text": "National Environmental Policy Act Amendments - Finds that the national public interest in the environment requires the clarification of the National Environment Policy Act of 1969: (1) to more precisely define procedural requirements placed upon Federal departments and agencies pursuant to the Act; and (2) to weigh environmental value with other policy interests and values. Requires an Environmental Impact Statement for decisionmaking in connection with any proposed Federal legislation or major Federal action. Outlines criteria to be considered in such statement as to proposed legislation or action, including: (1) the environmental impact of such legislation or action; (2) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided compared to any benefits that may accrue from such legislation; (3) alternatives to such legislation; (4) the relationship between local short-term uses of man's environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity; and (5) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources involved in such legislation. Requires any responsible Federal offical to consult with and to obtain comments from any other Federal department or agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact statement. Requires copies of environmental impact statements and comments and views of the appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies to be made to the President, the Council of Environmental Quality and to the public for reports to Congress taking action on such proposed legislation; and prior to any major Federal action. Outlines conditions for alternatives to the proposed action considered in the environmental impact statement. Requires an assessment of the environmental empact for every application or request for a Federal license, permit, certificate or other authorization for a proposed action. Directs the responsible Federal official having primary jurisdiction over proposed action to make decisions as to whether such action is a major Federal action affecting human environment. Outlines the action to be taken after his decision, and specifies criteria for alternatives to the proposed action, as well as exemptions and modifications in making detailed statements. Allows a petition for review or restraint of any action of any official, department or agency of the United States based on an environmental impact statement or decision."
