    "text": "Occupational Safety and Health Amendments - Defines \"employer\", under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, to mean a person engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees, but does not include the United States, any State or political subdivision of a State, any nonagricultural employer who employed no more than twenty-five employees at any time during the preceding calendar year, or a small farmer. Requires the evaluation of specified existing standards in order to determine the applicability of each such standard to each class of business concern within each industry. Provides that any employer who is issued a citation and who believes that he maintains work conditions which would meet the required criteria for a variance may apply to the Secretary for such a variance. Sets forth the procedure for enforcement for correction of violations for which citations are issued. Provides that no person shall discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because he has filed any complaint under this Act. Directs the Secretary to visit the workplaces of employers having one hundred or fewer employees for the purpose of affording consultation and advice to such employers."
