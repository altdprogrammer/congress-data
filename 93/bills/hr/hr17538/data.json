    "text": "Fusion Energy Act - Expresses the findings of Congress that the general welfare of the United States would be enhanced through the development of various applications of controlled fusion energy, commonly known as thermonuclear energy. Establishes the Advisory Committee on Thermonuclear Energy, to develop proposals to expand and accelerate the research and development of experimental and prototype fusion systems to be used for electrical power production, space propulsion, and resource element production. Requires the Committee to submit a report of such proposals to the Energy Resources Council within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. Provides that the Committee shall cease to exist 30 days after submitting its report. Establishes the Advisory Committee for Fusion Systems Development, which shall advise and consult with the Energy Resources Council with respect to the implementation of the proposals set forth in the report of the Advisory Committee on Thermonuclear Energy and the experimental and demonstration fusion systems under current development. Establishes the Advisory Committee for International Coordination of Fusion Energy Development, to consult with the Energy Resources Council with respect to the coordination of joint programs with other nations in the area of fusion systems for energy, propulsion and resource materials. Provides that these two committees shall cease to exist two years after the submission of the report of the Advisory Committee on Thermonuclear Energy, or upon the termination of the Energy Resources Council, whichever occurs first. Prescribes the membership and compensation of the three advisory committees, and their powers and responsibilities. Defines the terms used in this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
