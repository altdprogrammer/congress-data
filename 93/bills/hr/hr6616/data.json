Makes it unlawful for two or more persons to conspire to obstruct the enforcement of the criminal laws of a State or political subdivision thereof with the intent to facilitate the illegal distribution of specified narcotic drugs. Provides that whoever violates this section shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than five and not more than ten years.
