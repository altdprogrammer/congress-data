Makes any contract provision contrary to the provisions of this Act unenforcable. States that any person who deprives, or conspires with any other person to deprive, an individual of his rights under this Act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be fined not more than $50,000, imprisoned for not more than one year, or both."
