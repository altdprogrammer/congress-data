    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Provides for the preservation of historical and archeological data. Extends coverage to all Federal and federally assisted or licensed programs which alter the terrain and potentially cause loss of scientific, prehistorical, historical or archeological data. Directs Federal agencies to notify the Secretary of the Interior if in their operations archeological or other scientific data is revealed or threatened. Provides that whenever any Federal agency finds or is made aware by a responsible authority that its operations in connection with any Federal, federally assisted, or federally licensed activity or program adversely affects or may adversely affect significant scientific, prehistorical, historical, or archeological data, such agency may request the Secretary to undertake protection measures, or may itself expend program or activity funds for the recovery, protection, and preservation of such data (including preliminary survey, analysis, and publication) and shall provide the Secretary with appropriate information concerning the project and the investigation. Provides that if the Secretary is notified by a competent authority that historical, archeological, or paleontological resources are being or may be irrevocably lost at a Federal, federally assisted or licensed project or under a Federal program and that the loss would be significant then he must (1) notify the agency involved of this fact and (2) effect a survey of the area and recover any data which he determines should be preserved in the public interest. Permits the Secretary and the agency involved to reach a mutual understanding with respect to the date of termination of the salvage program. States that any Federal agency responsible for a construction project may assist the Secretary and/or it may transfer to him such funds as may be agreed upon, but not more than 1 percent of the total amount authorized to be appropriated for such project, except that the 1 percent limitation shall not apply in the event that the project involves $50,000 or less. States that the costs of such survey, recovery, analysis, and publication, shall be considered nonreimbursable project costs. Authorizes the Secretary, where Federal loan or grant programs are involved, to seek appropriations totaling $6,000,000 for fiscal years 1974-1978 to undertake survey and salvage operations directly.! Authorizes, where Federal construction is involved, $13,000,000 to be appropriated in annual installments for fiscal years 1974-1978."
