Provides a method for establishing the entitlement of each State for Federal aid to the immigrant population. Provides that the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare shall make grants to each State on such terms as he shall establish. Provides further that the Secretary shall, in his discretion, make grants to cities with large immigrant populations. Designates such cities as \"gateway cities\". Prohibits any person from being denied food stamps because such person is an immigrant. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants of up to $250 to each immigrant seeking employment, and to each member of his family for the purpose of changing residence from any gateway city to any State other than that in which such gateway city is located."
