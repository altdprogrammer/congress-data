Requires the Commission, with the assistance of the Comptroller General, to promptly conduct a thorough review of the promulgated schedules and the criteria and procedures followed by the Secretary in developing such schedules for the purpose of determining their reasonableness and adequacy and their consistency with applicable requirements of law and regulations. Provides that, upon completion of such review, the Commission shall issue a decision as to each project, approving the schedules or recommending modifications to the Secretary. States that each such decision shall be made on the record after an opportunity for public hearing pursuant to the Federal Power Act. Requires the Secretary to promptly publish proposed regulations providing for opportunity for an adequate public hearing and written decision on the record concerning any electric power rate increase hereinafter proposed by the Secretary."
