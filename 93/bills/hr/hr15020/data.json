Requires that each program for which money is authorized to be appropriated for three years or more shall be reviewed annually by the legislative committee which had jurisdiction over the subject matter of such program, or by the General Accounting Office at the direction of such committee, and it shall be the duty of such committee to report as to the effectiveness of such program or project, and any recommendations. Provides that, at the beginning of the session of each odd numbered year, there shall be elected by each House a standing Committee on the Executive Office to oversee the functions of the White House and related executive office agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget. States that, on or before November 30 of each even-numbered year, each of the standing committees of the House shall submit to the Speaker and the minority leader a summary of its proposed oversight priorities for the succeeding Congress, from which the leadership shall present an oversight agenda which shall include a list of the program review priorities for each standing committee. Directs the General Accounting Office to establish procedures for categorization of constituent and other requests so that this information may be tabulated to permit an overall assessment regarding the pattern of problems that are affecting persons seeking the assistance of Members of Congress in the area of casework. Sets forth the effect of this Act on the House and Senate rulemaking powers."
