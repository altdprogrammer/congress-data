    "text": "Public Documents Act - Establishes a commission to be known as the National Study Commission on Federal Records and Documents of Federal Officials. States that it shall be the duty of the Commission to study problems and questions with respect to the control, disposition, and preservation of records and documents produced by or on behalf of individuals holding Federal office and officers of the Federal Government, with a view toward the development of appropriate legislative recommendations and other appropriate rules and procedures with respect to such control, disposition, and preservation. Sets forth items to be considered by the study, including: (1) whether the historical practice of regarding the records and documents produced by or on behalf of Presidents of the United States should be rejected or accepted and whether such policy should be made applicable with respect to individuals holding Federal office and of officers of the Federal Government, including Members of the Congress and members of the Federal judiciary; (2) the recordkeeping procedures of the White House Office, with a view toward establishing means to determine which papers and documents are produced by or on behalf of the President of the United States; (3) the nature of rules and procedures which should apply to the control, disposition, and preservation of papers and documents produced by Presidential task forces, commissions, and boards; and (4) criteria which may be used generally in determining the scope of materials which should be considered to be the papers and documents of individuals holding Federal office. Directs the Administrator of General Services to provide the Commission on a reimbursable basis such administrative support services and assistance as the Commission may request. Authorizes the Librarian of Congress and the Archivist of the United States to provide to the Commission on a reimbursable basis such technical and expert advice, consultation, and support assistance as the Commission may request. Requires the Commission to transmit to the President and to each House of Congress a report not later than December 31, 1975. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
