Provides that any person aggrieved by an action of the Attorney General may bring a civil action in the appropriate district court to contest the constitutionality of the appointment and continuance in office of the Attorney General. Gives the United States district courts exclusive jurisdiction, without regard to the value of the matter in controversy, to determine the validity of such appointment and continuance in office."
