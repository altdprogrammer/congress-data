    "text": "National Energy Research and Development Policy Act - Declares that it is the purpose of this Act to initiate the development within ten years of the option and the capability for the United States to become energy self-sufficient through the use of domestic energy resources by environmentally acceptable means. Declares it to be the policy of the Congress to initiate the establishment of a national program of basic and applied research and development, including demonstrations of practical applications, with respect to all energy sources and utilization technologies. Establishes an Energy Research Study Committee which shall be composed of: (1) one Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior who shall be designated by the Secretary of the Interior; (2) one Commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission who shall be designated by the Chairman of the Commission; (3) one Commissioner of the Federal Power Commission who shall be designated by the Chairman of the Commission; (4) the Director of the National Science Foundation; (5) one Assistant Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who shall be designated by the Administrator of the Agency; (6) one Assistant Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who shall be designated by the Administrator; (7) the Director of the National Bureau of Standards; and (8) such appropriate representatives of other executive agencies which the President finds have a significant and continuing role in energy research and development. Requires the Study Committee to: (1) review the full range of Federal activities in and financial support of research and development pertaining to energy sources and utilization technologies and related matters, giving consideration to research and development being conducted by industry and other non-Federal entities, to determine the capability of ongoing research efforts to contribute to the policy of this Act and other relevant Federal policies, particularly the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; (2) initiate the formulation of a comprehensive, cohesive national research and development program to effectuate the policy of this Act; (3) consult with representatives of science, industry, labor, conservation organizations, Federal, State, and local agencies and other groups, as it deems advisable from time to time; and (4) cooperate with the Federal Energy Research and Development Agency, as provided in this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Chairman of the Study Group such funds as may be necessary for expenses in administering and carrying out the functions provided for in this Act."
