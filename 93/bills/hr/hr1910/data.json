Permits the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to furnish such medical care and treatment as is deemed medically indicated for the rehabilitation of any eligible ex-serviceman whose disability is caused by or has resulted from drug abuse or drug dependency. Permits the Administrator to terminate further medical care and treatment to any eligible ex-serviceman who refuses to cooperate with the terms and conditions of the medical care and treatment which may be prescribed, or where it is determined that the care and treatment which could otherwise be provided will serve no further benefit to the eligible ex-serviceman. Authorizes the treatment of members of the Armed Forces for drug addiction in Veterans Administration facilities. Authorizes the treatment of Veterans and ex-servicemen who are committed by the courts for drug abuse or drug dependency in Veterans administration facilities."
