Provides that the President shall advise the United States Senate and the House of Representatives of his recommendations with respect to the designation as a wild area of each area submitted. Provides that each recommendation of the President for such designation shall become effective only if so provided by an Act of Congress. Directs the Secretary to administer units of the wild area system in accord with the following provisions: (1) primitive, natural, and wild conditions will be restored, maintained and protected to provide for public use and enjoyment for recreation, scientific, and educational purposes in a natural setting free from the activities and highly developed works of man, wherein natural attractions prevail in an atmosphere of spacious solitude; (2) public use shall be permitted consistent with the ability of the area to support such use and retain its primitive, natural, and wild chareacteristics; (3) subject to existing private rights, the use of motorized equipment or aircraft shall be limited to the minimum necessary to meet administrative requirements of the Act, including measures required in emergencies involving the health and safety of persons using the area, and the control of fire, insects, and diseases, subject to such conditions as the Secretary deems desirable; and (4) timber harvesting shall not be permitted. Establishes the Sipsey Wild Area within the Bankhead National Forest, State of Alabama."
