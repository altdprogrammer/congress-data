    "date": "1973-11-15", 
    "text": "Public Health and National Health Service Corps Scholarship Training Program Amendments - Extends the Public Health and National Health Service Corps Scholarship Training Program to obtain health related specialists not only for the National Health Service Corps but for such other uniformed or civilian Federal health service as the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare may determine is appropriate. Adds to the criteria for participation in the Program by broadening eligibility to include those selected for civilian service in the National Health Service Corps or in such other uniformed or civilian Federal health service as the Secretary may determine is appropriate and eliminates as criteria for participation in the Program the requirement that each applicant must be eligible for, or hold, an appointment as a commissioned officer in the Regular or Reserve Corps of the Service. Eliminates, as a requirement for participation in the Program, written agreement to serve in the Commissioned Corps of the Service while revising the written agreement requirement to include such other uniformed or civilian Federal health service as the Secretary may determine is appropriate. Alters the active duty obligations of participants in the Program by eliminating the alternative of serving as a commissioned officer in the Service and adding the alternative of serving in such other uniformed or civilian Federal health service as the Secretary may determine is appropriate. Eliminates the requirement that at least one-half of the active duty obligation must be spent providing health care and services in specific areas. Provides that periods of internship or residency shall not be creditable in satisfying an active duty service obligation unless the internship or residency is served in a Federal health facility, thus eliminating the restriction that internship or residency are only creditable when served in a facility of the Public Health Service or other facility of the National Health Service Corps. Eliminates the authorization to appropriate $3,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974, and authorizes appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the program. Provides that this Act shall be effective with respect to appropriations for fiscal years ending after June 30, 1973."
