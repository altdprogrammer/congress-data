    "text": "Amateur Athletics Act - Declares it to be the finding of Congress that the division of authority over amateur athletics among organizations in the United States has resulted in a lack of coordination which handicaps the individual athelete in international competition. Establishes the United States Amateur Sports Board, to be appointed by the President. Provides that one member shall be an amateur athelete who has recently distinguished himself in international competition. Sets forth additional requirements for Board membership, and terms of appointment of Board members. Authorizes the Board to issue a charter to a corporation, designating it a United States Sports Association for not more than three sports which are part of the the Olympic or Pan American James. Empowers the Board to: (1) promulgate rules governing charter applications; (2) take action to insure compliance with granted charters; and (3) revoke charters. Provides that the following are causes for charter revokation: (1) to deny an amateur athelete the right to compete in competition which the Association has sanctioned because he is not a member of that Association; and (2) to deny any amateur athelete who is a member of that Association the right to compete in competitions sanctioned by any other United States Sports Association. Sets forth the requirements for eligibility to receive a charter as a United States Sports Association. Provides that, with specified exceptions, no unrestricted international amateur athletic competition shall be conducted within the United States more than two years after enactment of this Act, unless such meet is sanctioned by a United States Sports Association. States that in the event of a dispute involving a United States Sports Association and another Association, an athelete, or a sports organization, the Board shall, with the consent of the parties, act as a final mediator. Directs the Board to appoint a United States Olympic Commission to review the participation of the United States in the Olympic games. Provides that if participation in the games should be continued, the Commission shall recommend the form of organization by means of which the United States should participate. Sets forth elements to be considered in the formulation of such recommendation. Sets forth additional administrative powers of the Board. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary for the period ending June 30, 1977."
