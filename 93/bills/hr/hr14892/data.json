    "text": "National Energy Research and Development Act - Expresses the findings of Congress and declares it to be the policy of the Congress to establish and vigorously conduct a National program of research and energy development. Directs the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to: (1) formulate a 10-year national energy research and development program; (2) conduct a study on the personnel necessary to carry out energy research and development; and (3) submit such program and study to appropriate congressional committees. Describes the scope of research and development to be conducted by Administrator in carrying out his responsibilities under the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, including the desirability of advancing technologies in recycling, magnetohydrodynamics, inertial energy storage, systems approaches to energy use, and solar energy sytems. States that, in the conduct of activities under the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, the forms of Federal assistance and participation may include: (1) joint Federal-industry corporations; (2) Federal purchases or guaranteed price of the products of demonstration plants; and (3) Federal loans under contractural arrangements for demonstration projects. Details the guidelines to be met by the joint Federal-industry model corporations. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1975 and 1976 for carrying out the purposes of this Act, setting limitations on the extent of appropriations in connection with any demonstration project in excess of $10,000,000 and any Federal arrangement for guaranteed price of products or loans in excess of $5,000,000."
