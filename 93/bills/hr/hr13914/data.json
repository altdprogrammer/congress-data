Establishes within the Government of the District of Columbia a committee to be known as the District of Columbia Elections and Ethics Commission Nominating Committee whose function is nominating individuals for appointment as members of the District of Columbia Elections and Ethics Commission.

Provides that the Committee shall be composed of five members: one member shall be the Comptroller General of the United States, or his designee; two members shall be appointed by the Mayor, at least one of whom shall be a lawyer; and two members shall be appointed by the Chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia with the approval of the Council. States that members of the Committee shall be appointed not later than June 30, 1975. Establishes as an independent agency of the District of Columbia a Commission to be known as the District of Columbia Elections and Ethics Commission, consisting of seven members serving for terms of six years each.

States that of the members first appointed, three shall be appointed by the Commissioner of the District of Columbia, three shall be appointed by the Chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia with the approval of the Council, and one shall be appointed by the Comptroller General. Requires the Commission to meet at least monthly during any calendar year in which there is an election and at least quarterly in nonelection years.
