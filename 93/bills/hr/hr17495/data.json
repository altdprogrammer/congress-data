Requires that within 30 days after the date of an order authorizing or approving the interception of a wire or oral communication (or each extension thereof) entered under authority of law, or the denial of an order approving an interception, the person seeking such order shall report to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and to the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and House of Representatives: (1) the fact that an order or extension was applied for; (2) the kind of order or extension applied for; (3) the fact that the order or extension was granted as applied for, was modified, or was denied; (4) the period of interceptions authorized by the order, and the number and duration of any extensions of the order; (5) the names of all parties to the intercepted communications; (6) the offense specified in the order or application; (7) the identity of the investigative or law enforcement officer and agency making the application and the person authorizing the application to be made; (8) a copy of the court order authorizing, approving, or denying such interception; and (9) the nature of the facilities from which or the place where communications were intercepted. Specifies that reports be made within 90 days after the date of an order approving the interception of a wire or oral communication on the disposition of all records of any such interception and the identity of and action taken by all individuals who had access to any such interception. Sets forth reporting requirements in the case of warrants issued authorizing the opening of mail."
