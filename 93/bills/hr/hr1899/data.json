    "text": "Federal Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals Act - Title I: Establishment of Commission - Establishes the Federal Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. Provides for the membership, terms of office, pay, and travel expenses of the Commission. Stipulates that the Commission may for the purpose of carrying out this Act hold such hearings, sit and act at such times and places, take such testimony, and receive such evidence as the Commission may deem advisable. Title II: Accreditation - States that the Commission shall by regulation establish accreditation standards for hospitals. Provides that the Commission shall establish procedures: (1) for determining if a hospital is in compliance with such standards; (2) for accreditation of those hospitals determined to be in compliance with such standards; and (3) for termination of accreditation of a hospital found to be in noncompliance with such standards. Directs the Commission to conduct surveys and accreditation programs which will encourage members of the health professions and hospitals to voluntarily promote high quality patient care, effective standards of physical plant safety and maintenance, and coordination of staffs and governing bodies of facilities. Provides that any hospital served with a notice of noncompliance with the regulations provided for under this Act shall have ninety days within which to comply with such standards. States that any Federal hospital which fails to meet such accreditation standards within the ninety day period shall terminate its operation until such time as the Commission accredits the hospital. Provides that no Federal Financial assistance may be paid to any public or private hospital failing to meet such accreditation standards within the ninety day period, nor shall such hospital be eligible to provide services under title XVIII (Health Insurance for the Aged) or title XIX (Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs) of the Social Security Act, until such time as the Commission accredits the hospital."
