    "text": "Provides that any person who knowingly commits an act in violation of any motor carrier safety requirement, rule, regulation, or order promulgated by the Secretary of Transportation under the Interstate Commerce Act (Part II) relating to qualifications and maximum hours of service employees and safety of operation and equipment shall be fined not less than $250 nor more $1,000 for the first offense and not less than $500 nor more than $2,000 for any subsequent offense. Provides that each day of such violation shall constitute a separate offense. Extends the application of such penalties to all violations of the motor carrier safety regulations (including violations by motor carriers, private carriers and carriers of migrant workers by motor vehicle). Provides that the Secretary of Transportation may, without notice, order for a period of up to sixty days any common, contract, or private carrier to cease and desist from operating motor vehicles in interstate commerce where he, for good cause, finds that the carrier's operations will create an unreasonable risk of accident, injury, or death to persons or damage to property. (Amends 49 U.S.C. 322)"
