Authorizes the President to appoint an Alaskan Oil Pipeline Task Force, consisting of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Defense, and others to conduct a complete study of the availability of a right-of-way across Canadian territory for the construction and operation of transmission facilities for the petroleum reserves of the North Slope of Alaska. Provides for this task force to report to Congress any prohibitive obstacles by October 1, 1973. Directs the Secretary of State to enter into negotiations with the Canadian Government regarding the availability of the necessary rights-of-way across Canada and requires him to report to Congress by October 1, 1973. Allows the Secretary of the Interior to issue rights-of-way and special land use permits notwithstanding section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, and any decision of any court, effective November 1, 1973, provided the task force does not report any prohibitive obstacles."
