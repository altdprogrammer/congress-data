Declares it to be the duty of the Commission to: (1) examine the common law and statutes relating to the District of Columbia, the ordinances and regulations of the District of Columbia Council, and all relevant judicial decisions for the purpose of discovering defects and anachronisms in the law relating to the District of Columbia and recommending needed reforms; (2) receive and consider proposed changes in the law recommended by the American Law Institute, the Commissioners for the Promotion of Uniformity of Legislation in the United States, any bar association or other learned bodies; (3) receive and consider suggestions from judges, justices, public officials, lawyers, and the public generally as to defects and anachronisms in the law relating to the District of Columbia; and (4) recommend, from time to time, to the Congress, and where appropriate to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Council, such changes in the law relating to the District of Columbia as it deems necessary to modify or eliminate antiquated and inequitable rules of law, and to bring the law relating to the District of Columbia, both civil and criminal, into harmony with modern conditions. Requires the Commission to make annual reports; and states that the Commission shall cease to exist upon the filing of the annual report at the end of the fourth year after the date of enactment, unless extended by Congress."
