    "text": "Title I: Airline Passenger Right to Travel Act - Provides for the implementation of the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. Authorizes the President to suspend air service to any foreign nation which he determines is encouraging aircraft hijacking by acting in a manner inconsistent with the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, or which he determines is used as a base of operations or training or as a sanctuary for terrorist organizations using the illegal seizure of aircraft as an instrument of policy. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to revoke, with the approval of the Secretary of State, the operating authority of foreign air carriers who fail to meet the minimum standards set by the Convention to effectively maintain the security measures relating to the transportation of persons in foreign air transportation covered by the Convention. Title II: Air Transportation Security Act - Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to prescribe regulations requiring that all passengers and property intended to be carried in the aircraft cabin be screened by weapon-detecting devices operated by the air carrier's employees. Requires the Administrator to acquire and furnish for the use by air carriers sufficient devices necessary for the purpose of this Act. Requires the Administrator to establish and maintain an air transportation security force of sufficient size to provide a law enforcement presence and capability at airports in the United States adequate to insure safety from criminal violence and air piracy of persons traveling in air transportation. Sets forth criminal penalties for carrying a weapon aboard an aircraft. Sets forth penalties for the willful and malicious imparting or conveying of false information concerning an attempt to carry out any prohibited act contained in the provisions of this Act."
