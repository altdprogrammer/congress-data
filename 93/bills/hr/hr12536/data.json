    "text": "Declares that it is the purpose of Congress to: (1) establish a national transportation rate policy for all recovered materials; and (2) eliminate discriminatory transportation rates charged by regulated carriers for the movement in commerce of recovered waste and recycled or recyclable materials. Directs the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Maritime Commission to effect such lawful changes in the rate structure of the country as will promote the freedom of movement by common carriers of recovered materials at the lowest possible lawful rates compatible with the maintenance of adequate transportation service. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to take such steps as are necessary to insure that the directives of this Act are carried out as expeditiously as possible, including the initiation of, and intervention in, proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Maritime Commission. Directs the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Maritime Commission to undertake studies to be completed within two years of the enactment of this Act of the feasibility of establishing a transportation rate policy for all recoverable materials. Specifies areas to be covered in such study and requires that it be submitted to Congress. Directs the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Maritime Commission, and the Federal Railroad Administration to establish a transportation research and demonstration program coordinated by the Secretary of Transportation with the objective of facilitating the most efficient movement of recycled materials in commerce. Prohibits any railroad, common carrier by water, or motor carrier in interstate or foreign commerce from charging, demanding or collecting any rate for the transportation of recovered materials which is unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory. Describes procedures for complaints with respect to such alleged discrimination. Provides civil penalties for violation of this Act."
