Authorizes the Secretary of each military department to enter into agreements with such system to provide transportation and other services in emergency conditions. Requires applications for planning grants to demonstrate the need of the area for an emergency medical service system, and to contain assurances that the applicant is qualified for plan. Authorizes appropriations for such program of $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1973, and $10,000,000,000 for fiscal year 1974. Sets conditions for grants for the establishment and initial operation of such systems, and authorizes to be appropriated a total of $190,000,000 for fiscal years 1973, 1974, and 1975. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to schools of medicine, dentistry and osteopathy and to other educational institutions for research and training programs in the techniques and methods of medical emergency care and treatment. Authorizes to be appropriated for such grants $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1973 and $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1974. Provides that the Secretary shall establish an Interagency Technical Committee on Emergency Medical Services to evaluate the adequacy of all Federal programs and activities which relate to emergency medical services, and to assist in coordinating such programs."
