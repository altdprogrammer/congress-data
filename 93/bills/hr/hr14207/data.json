Requires the Secretary of Commerce to formulate the questions and type of information, subject to the approval of the appropriate committees of Congress, to be compiled in the decennial census and the mid-decade sample surveys not less than three years before the date of such census or survey. Allows the Secretary to submit, when circumstances necessitate, new questions during the remaining period before the decennial census or mid-decade sample survey. States that the geographic scope of each sample survey shall be the same as that of each decennial census. Allows the Secretary to obtain information from other Federal departments and agencies, and from States, counties, cities and other units of government, in order to carry out the purposes of this Act, provided, however, no information contained in any individual tax return filed with the Internal Revenue Service shall be accessible to the Secretary."
