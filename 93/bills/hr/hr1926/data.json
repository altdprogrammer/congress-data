Declares it to be the policy of the United States to encourage school systems to adopt programs permitting any student who attends a school in which persons of his race, color, or national origin constitute a majority of the students to transfer, if he desires to do so, to the nearest appropriate school in which persons of his race, color, or national origin constitute a minority of the students."
