States that loans insured under this Act must be expended for the purpose of financing the normal operations of buying, raising, and selling beef cattle by the borrower whose loan is being insured. Sets forth the terms and conditions of such insured loans. Creates the Cattleman's Insurance Fund to be used by the Secretary as a revolving fund for the discharge of obligations under this Act. Empowers the Secretary to transfer assets from the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund, to the fund if he determines that such transfer is necessary to establish the insurance program. Directs the Secretary to make and issue notes to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of obtaining funds necessary for discharging obligations under this Act. Outlines the purposes for which the Secretary shall utilize the fund. Provides that the aggregate amount of the obligations insured under this Act and outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $3,000,000,000."
