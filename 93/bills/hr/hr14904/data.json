    "text": "National Science Policy and Priorities Act - States the Congressional declaration that the total Federal investment in science and technology must be raised to an expenditure level which is adequate to the human needs of the nation; and that Federal programs for civilian research and engineering must be focused in such priority problem areas as health care, poverty, public safety, pollution, unemployment, productivity, housing, education, transportation, nutrition, communications, and energy resources. Title I: Science Policy and Priorities for Civilian Research and Engineering - Science policy Act - Requires the National Science Foundation to identify, research, and report on priority areas of civilian research and engineering likely to contribute to the resolution of such national problem areas as stated above. Authorizes appropriations totalling $50,000,000 for fiscal years 1974-1976 for such purposes. Title II: Design and Demonstration of Civil Science Systems - Civil Science Systems Act - Authorizes the Foundation to initiate and support programs which use science, technology, and advanced analythical techniques, such as systems analysis, to design civil science systems which are capable of providing improved public services in such areas as health care delivery, public safety, public sanitation, pollution control, housing, transportation, public utilities, communications, and education. Establishes, within the NSF, the Civil Science Systems Administration to administer programs carried out under this title. Establishes the Civil Science Systems Advisory Council, composed of 31 members, 18 of whom shall serve for terms of 3 years and be chosen from the following areas: business, labor, engineers, social and behavioral scientists, environmental and other community groups, and consumers. Authorizes the Director of the Administration to conduct and contract for planning studies for the design and demonstration of civil science systems capable of providing improved public services. Authorizes contracts: (1) for the conduct of applied social research into the economic, sociological, political, legal, administrative, and psychological aspects of the design, development, and implementation of such civil science systems; and (2) for research, testing, and evaluation of such civil science systems which make use of advanced science and technology. Authorizes the Director to establish a computerized Civil Science Systems Information Service, which shall collect the information pertaining to civil science systems resulting from programs under this title, and shall provide such information to interested Government, educational, and private organizations. Requires the Director, in conducting programs under this title, to maintain coordination with appropriate Federal, State, regional, and local governmental agencies. Authorizes appropriations for this title of $200,000,000 for fiscal year 1974, $490,000,000 for 1975, and $600,000,000 for 1976. Title III: Transition of Technical Manpower to Civilian Programs - Technical Manpower Transition Act - Authorizes the Foundation to plan and assist in the transition of scientific and technical manpower research and engineering programs which have been terminated or significantly reduced to other civilian-oriented research and engineering activities. Establishes an Advisory Panel on Transition of Scientific and Technical Manpower to Civilian Programs, to be composed of 31 members, 18 of whom shall serve for terms of 3 years and be chosen from the following categories: engineering and natural sciences, economic and social sciences, industry, labor, public affairs and manpower training, and unemployed scientists, engineers, and technicians. Authorizes the Foundation to make grants: (1) for the conduct of research designed to study and appraise the social, economic, and managerial aspects of transition from defense research and engineering activities to civilian-oriented research and engineering activities; (2) for programs designed to facilitate the transition of scientific and technical activities to civilian programs at the State, local, or regional level; (3) for training programs for officers and employees of Federal, State, and local government who will be responsible for administering Government-assisted programs for civilian, socially oriented research and engineering activities; (4) for establishing community conversion corporations which shall conduct civilian-oriented research and development activities focusing on the particular problems of the community where the corporation is located; (5) for job transition programs involving the hiring of unemployed scientists, engineers, and technicians to work on civilian-oriented projects for which they are not yet fully qualified; (6) for career transition fellowships to unemployed scientists, engineers, and technicians to enable them to pursue a course of study through which they can acquire specialized technical knowledge and skills in fields other than the ones in which they are already proficient; (7) for placement programs for unemployed or underemployed scientists, engineers, and technicians; and (8) for education programs which design courses and curriculums intended to prepare students for careers in civilian, socially oriented research and engineering activities, in areas such as pollution control, mass transit, solid waste disposal systems, public utilities, public safety systems, and health care technology. Authorizes to be appropriated to carry out this title, $152,000,000 for fiscal year 1974, $203,000,000 for fiscal year 1975, and $205,000,000 for fiscal year 1976. Title IV: Protection of Pension Rights of Scientists and Engineers - Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation to develop a recommendation for modifications of Federal procurement regulations to insure that scientists, engineers, and those employed under Federal procurement, construction, or research contracts or grants shall be protected against forfeiture of pension or retirement benefits as a consequence of job transfers or loss of employment resulting from terminations or modifications of Federal contracts or procurement policies. Title V: General Provisions - Defines the terms used in this Act. Authorizes the Director to appoint additional personnel and advisory committees, and use the services of Federal, State, and local government organizations to carry out the purposes of this Act. Makes provisions for the payment and withholding of funds under this Act. Requires records to be kept of costs by recipients of assistance under this Act. Provides for an audit of records of recipients of assistance. Requires provisions in grants or contracts under this Act governing the disposition of inventions produced thereunder in a manner calculated to protect the public interest and the equities of the individual or organization with which the grant or contract is executed. Prohibits any Foundation employee from retaining or transferring any rights, under the patent laws of the United States, in any invention which he may produce in connection with performing his assigned activities and which is directly related to the subject matter thereof."
