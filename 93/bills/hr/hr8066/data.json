    "text": "Defense Emergency Procedure Act - Establishes the Joint Committee on National Security. Directs the President to consult with the committee before the introduction of the Armed Forces of the United States in hostilities or in situations in which hostilities may be imminent. Requires the President to continue such consultation until United States Armed Forces are no longer engaged in hostilities. Requires the President, absent a declaration of war by Congress, to submit to the Committee, within 48 hours, a report whenever he: (1) introduces the Armed Forces in hostilities outside the territory of the United States; (2) introduces the Armed Forces equipped for combat into the territory, airspace, or waters of a foreign nation; or (3) substantially enlarges the Armed Forces equipped for combat already located in a foreign nation. Sets forth the information to be included in such report. Directs the President to terminate the use of the Armed Forces within 90 calendar days after a report is submitted unless Congress enacts a declaration of war or authorizes their use. Sets forth Congressional priority procedures for bills or joint resolutions introduced pursuant to the termination of the 90-day period. Provides that this Act does not represent congressional acceptance of the proposition that Executive action alone can satisfy the constitutional process requirement contained in the provisions of mutual security treaties to which the United States is party."
