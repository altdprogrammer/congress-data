    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1973-01-11", 
    "text": "Armed Forces Drug Dependency Treatment and Rehabilitation Act - Provides that the Secretary of Defense: (1) may prescribe regulations requiring each member of the armed forces on active duty to be examined for drug dependency; and (2) shall prescribe policies encouraging members who are drug dependent to identify themselves and to seek treatment and rehabilitation services voluntarily. Provides that treatment and rehabilitation services may include hospital treatment, inpatient and outpatient services, educational, social, psychological, and vocational services, corrective and preventive guidance and treatment, and other rehabilitative services. Provides that the Secretary may prescribe regulations authorizing treatment and rehabilitative services to a drug dependent member without his consent and that the Secretary may retain a drug dependent member on active duty without his consent, for a period of not more than thirty days beyond the end of this term of service or date of separation, for the purpose of such treatment and rehabilitation. Provides that a member found to be drug dependent shall not be subject to disciplinary proceedings or other legal consequences solely because of his drug dependency. Provides that whether time spent undergoing treatment and rehabilitative services shall be counted as lost time and subject to forfeiture of pay shall be determined by uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Provides that a member undergoing treatment and rehabilitative services for drug dependency shall be excluded in computing the authorized strength of the armed forces. (Adds 10 U.S.C. 1061-1064)."
