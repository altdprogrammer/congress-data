Requires recipients of such assistance to assure that rates charged elderly and handicapped persons during nonpeak hours for transportation will be one-half of general rates. Requires recipients to submit to the Secretary a comprehensive plan for improvement of mass transportation in their areas. Sets forth a formula for distribution of such assistance among the States based on population and rate of use of mass transportation. Authorizes appropriation of $400,000,000 for fiscal 1974 and $400,000,000 for fiscal 1975 for such assistance. Provides that grants for development and improvement of urban mass transportation systems shall be 80 percent of the net project cost. Prohibits assistance to transit systems which charge on basis of distance traveled, except under a zone system. Allows assistance for the establishment and organization of public and quasi-public transit corridor development corporations or entities. Prohibits assistance if a transportation system transports school children. Requires the Secretary to study rural and small city transportation needs. Requires the Secretary to investigate unsafe conditions in transportation systems and to withhold assistance unless they are corrected."
