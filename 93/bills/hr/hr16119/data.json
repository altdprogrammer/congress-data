    "text": "Executive Personnel System Act - Requires the Civil Service Commission to file annual reports with Congress on: (1) the Executive Personnel System; and (2) the position (and authority for) and rate of pay of each employee of an executive agency whose rate of basic pay exceeds the sixth rate of grade GS-15. Extablishes an Executive Personnel System to insure that the executive management of the Government is responsive to the Nation and of the highest quality. Enumerates the objectives of such system. Defines the terms used in this Act, including the agencies to which this Act does and does not apply. Requires each agency to examine its annual employment-of-executive needs and submit to the Commission a request to fulfill such needs. States that the number of executive appointments and the percentages authorized in any agency may be adjusted by the Commission during the fiscal year in which they are effective only for emergency needs that were not anticipated when the initial authorizations were made. Sets forth provisions governing the general authority to appoint executives and the characteristics of career, noncareer, and limited appointments. Directs the Commission to establish qualifications boards to review the qualifications of candidates for career appointment in the Executive Personnel System and the scope of the recruitment effort made to locate candidates. States that the Commission shall, in collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget, establish for each fiscal year a figure within the minimum and maximum pay limitations for executives. Sets forth additional provisions governing rates of pay. Provides for pay-fixing authority for specified agencies and for executive management outside the Executive Personnel Systems."
