    "text": "Wheat Export Marketing Control Act - Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, to carry out this Act. Title I: Wheat Export Marketing Stamps - Provides that all persons exporting wheat from the United States (except as otherwise provided under this Act) shall, prior to such export, obtain export marketing stamps from the Commodity Credit Corporation based upon the number of bushels to be exported and the price paid by the exporter for such bushels. Directs that the Commodity Credit Corporation shall issue export marketing stamps without payment if the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of State jointly determine that (1) the exports are to a developing country with a serious balance-of-payments deficit; (2) such action would be in the best interests of the foreign relations of the United States; and (3) such action would not adversely affect the regulatory program provided for under this title. Provides that the Secretary of Agriculture may exempt from the requirements of this Act wheat exported for donations abroad and other noncommercial exports of wheat. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to provide for the issuance of wheat export marketing stamps for wheat and end products. Authorizes the Secretary to promulgate such rules as he considers necessary or appropriate to carry out this Act. Establishes in the Treasury of the United States the Wheat Export Marketing Trust Fund, to consist of moneys collected by the Commodity Credit Corporation from the sale of export marketing stamps under this Act. Prescribes procedures for administration of the Fund. Title II: National Wheat Council - Establishes a nonprofit organization to be known as the National Wheat Council, which shall not be an agency or establishment of the United States, to be composed of twelve members. Sets forth the procedure and criteria for appointment of Council members. Provides that it shall be the responsibility of the Council to be informed of prices, income and population, and demand for farm products, use of resources in agriculture, statistics for analyses of supply and demand for farm products in foreign countries and their effect on prospects for United States exports. Provides that any organization or agency, public or private, may submit plans to the Council which would (1) promote research and production of wheat; (2) improve quality and yield of wheat; (3) promote distribution and use of wheat; (4) disseminate existing and new product knowledge, uses, and values in nutrition of wheat and end products; or (5) promote our foreign wheat markets or help develop foreign wheat markets and increase our share of such markets. Authorizes the Council to approve and fund any such plan."
