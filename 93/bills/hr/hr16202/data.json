    "text": "Housing Enforcement Assistance Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to establish within his department a housing enforcement assistance program under which he will make grants as provided in this act to cities and other municipalities to assist them in the more effective enforcement of local housing codes, including: (1) the training, employment, and compensation of housing inspectors and related or supporting personnel; (2) the establishment and operation of housing courts to provide a forum for the resolution of controversies involving building violations, rent strikes, evictions, and other matters relating to landlord-tenant relations and housing code enforcement; (3) the development and improvement of housing codes; (4) emergency repairs to eliminate conditions which endanger the health and safety of tenants; and (5) such other actions to deal with aspects of housing code enforcement as in the judgment of the Secretary will significantly help in carrying out the purpose of this Act. Stipulates that the Secretary shall allocate the funds appropriated to the various cities and municipities in the United States in accordance with a formula appropriately refelecting their need for assistance in the enforcement of housing codes. States that such formula, which shall be published in the Federal Register in advance of such allocation, shall take into account with respect to each of such cities and municipalities its size, the amount and average age of its housing which is threatened with loss from blight or deterioration but could be preserved by more effective enforcement of housing codes, its financial need, and such other factors as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate and in furtherance of the objectives of this Act. Authorizes appropriations of $40,000,000 to carry out the purposes of this Act. Provides that grants for and on behalf of a city or municipality may be made to an agency of State government in any case where cities or municipalities within the State involved are prevented by State law from receiving such grants or from expending them for their intended purpose."
