    "text": "Urban Transport Data Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to provide for the identification, collection, analysis, and reporting of comprehensive, comparable, objective, and reliable data and information about the current status and changing trends of mobility in urban areas, and the operating and financial conditions of urban passenger and freight properties and carriers. Establishes within the Department of Transportation an Urban Transport Data Board consisting of three members appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Sets forth the purposes of the Board as to assist Federal, State, and local governments to: (1) determine adequate quality, safety, and quantity of all urban transport systems and services in urban areas; (2) support Federal, State, and local evaluations of the efficient performance of urban transport operations and services; (3) provide information by which urban transport properties can comparatively analyze and evaluate their own properties and procedures; and (4) provide factual information to assist governments in deciding allocations of public funds for assisting urban transport systems and services. Authorizes the Board to establish such rules, regulations, and procedures as are necessary to the exercise of its functions and to carry out the purposes for which it is created. Provides that the Board shall have the same powers as are vested in the Secretary of Transportation to hold hearings, assign and issue subpoenas, administer oaths, examine witnesses, and receive testimony at any place in the United States it may designate. Authorizes the appropriation each year, without fiscal year limitation, an amount not to exceed the higher of: (1) $8,000,000, or (2) one-quarter of 1 per cent of the total Federal funds committed during the preceding year for assistance to all forms of urban transportation."
