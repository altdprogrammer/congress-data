Entitles the spouse and children of such an immigrant to special immigrant status derivatively if accompanying or following to join him. Provides that special immigrants shall be admitted without regard to the numerical limitations in the Act.

Provides that no person shall receive any perference in the issuance of an immigrant visa except as provided by statute. Specifies the number of visas to be granted in any fiscal year to various categories of immigrants and in what order. Provides that any citizen of the United States claiming that an alien is entitled to special immigrant status or to a preference status or any alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence claiming that an alien is entitled to a preference may file a petition with the Attorney General for such alien. Allocates 25,000 visa numbers to refugees. Provides that aliens seeking to enter the United States for the purpose of performing skilled or unskilled labor in occupations for which the Secretary of Labor has determined and certified to the Secretary of State and to the Attorney General that: (1) there is not a shortage of qualified workers in the United States at the time of application for a visa, or (2) the employment of such aliens would be inconsistent with United States manpower policies and programs, shall be excluded. Provides that if the Secretary finds that it is in the national interest that refugees, as defined, be paroled into the United States, he may recommend to the Attorney General that such aliens be so paroled, and provides for means by which such refugees may apply for admission."
