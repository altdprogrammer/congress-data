Directs the Special Prosecutor to investigate, as he deems appropriate, and prosecute: (1) offenses arising out of the 1972 Presidential election; and (2) offenses alleged to have been committed by the President, Presidential appointees, or members of the White House staff. Grants the Special Prosecutor full power and authority to: (1) review all documentary evidence available from any source: (2) determine whether or not to contest the assertion of executive privilege or any other testimonial privilege: and (3) receive appropriate national security clearance and review all evidence sought to be withheld on grounds of national security and if necessary contest in court, any claim of privilege or attempt to withhold evidence on grounds of national security. Requires the Special Prosecutor to carry out his duties under this Act within two years, except as necessary to complete trial or appellate action on pending indictments. Empowers the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to dismiss the Special Prosecutor or the Deputy Special Prosecutor, if the district court in its discretion determines that the Special Prosecutor or the Deputy Special Prosecutor has willfully violated the provisions of this Act or committed other extraordinary improprieties, and for no other reason. Provides that the Special Prosecutor solely shall exercise the powers and perform the duties specified in this Act; and that neither the district court, nor the President of the United States, nor any other officer of the United States shall have any authority to direct, countermand, or interfere with any action taken by the Special Prosecutor pursuant to this Act. States that neither the President of the United States, nor any other officer of the United States, shall have any authority to remove the Special Prosecutor from office. Authorizes appropriations necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
