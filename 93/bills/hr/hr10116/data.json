    "text": "National Workers' Compensation Standards Act - States that commencing on January 1, 1975, and during each three-calendar-year period thereafter, unless the workers' compensation law of a State has been determined by the Secretary of Labor during the calendar year preceding such three-year period to meet the minimum standards prescribed in or pursuant to this Act during such three-year period, the provisions of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act shall apply in accordance with the provisions of this Act within such State. Sets forth the minimum standards which each State workers' compensation law shall meet in order to satisfy the requirements of this Act. States that during any period when the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act is applicable within a State pursuant to this Act: (1) it shall apply to all employers within the State with respect to the injury or death of any employee of such employer irrespective of the place where the injury or death occurred, and (2) if any of the minimum standards specified in this Act would require higher compensation or death benefits to be paid than would be required under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act then such standard shall apply within such State during such period. Directs, within ninety days of enactment of this Act, the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register and furnish to the Governor of each State detailed criteria required in the application for State plans for workers' compensation programs. Sets forth the criteria for qualified plans. Provides that whenever a State is subject to the provisions of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act as prescribed in this Act, the Secretary, in administering that Act, shall endeavor to enter into an agreement with the State workers' compensation agency under which the administration of that Act within such State may be carried out by the State workers' compensation agency under the general supervision and direction of the Secretary in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Secretary may prescribe. Sets forth the manner through which the Secretary may by rule promulgate any new or improved minimum workers' compensation standard. Provides that any State, any employer or association of employers in a State, or any employee or organization employees within a State, may obtain judicial review of decisions by the Secretary under this Act by filing in the United States court of appeals in the circuit in which the State is located within thirty days following receipt of notice of the Secretary's decision a petition to review in whole or in part the decision of the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974, and the two succeeding fiscal years, to make grants to the States which have designated a State agency under this Act to assist them: (1) in identifying their needs and responsibilities in the area of workers' compensation; (2) in developing State plans under this Act or (3) in developing plans for, establishing systems for the collection of information concerning workers' compensation; increasing the expertise and enforcement capabilities of their personnel engaged in workers' compensation programs; or otherwise improving the administration and enforcement of State workers' compensation laws, consistent with the objectives of this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated during fiscal year 1974 and each of the next two fiscal years the sum of $15,000,000 for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act which shall remain available until expended. Establishes the Federal Workers' Compensation Advisory Commission, to be composed of five members, appointed by the President by and with the advice of the Senate. Sets forth the duties and functions of such a commission. States that the Commission shall transmit to the President and to the Congress, not later than February 1 of each year, a report of its activities, together with such recommendations as it deems advisable in the field of workers' compensation programs. Provides that in order to further the purposes of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, shall develop and maintain an effective program of collection, compilation and analysis of work's' compensation statistics. Authorizes to be appropriated to carry out this Act for each fiscal year such sums as the Congress shall deem necessary."
