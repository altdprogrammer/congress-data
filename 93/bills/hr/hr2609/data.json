Provides that, upon the enactment of this Act, the Board of Directors of the Bank shall open books for subscription to the capital stock of the Bank. Declares that the capital stock shall be divided into shares of par value $100 each. Directs that the minimum capital stock shall be issued at par and stock issued thereafter shall be isseud at such price not less than par as may be fixed by the Board of Directors. Provides that each credit union which is chartered after enactment of this Act and which is accepted for membership in the Bank within one year from the date it is chartered shall pay $25 in cash to be credited to its purchase of stock in the Bank. Asserts that at the expiration of one year from the date of its charges, the newly organized credit union shall subscribe for stock in the Bank in an amount equal to 1 percent of its total assets on this date. Provides that every credit union insured by the Administrator and which is not prohibited by the Administration and which is not prohibited by the laws under which it is organized to become a shareholder in the Bank shall apply for membership in the Bank within three months of the effective date of this Act. Directs that any other State credit union may apply for membership in the Bank. Provides that the Bank shall act on applications for membership, and, upon approval, shall require such applicants to subscribe to capital stock of the Bank in an amount equal to 1 percent of the subscriber's total assets. Grants the bank the necessary powers and authority in order to carry out its operations. Provides for auditing of the Bank's records by the General Accounting Office. Provides that the Bank, its property, its franchise, capital, reserves, surplus, security holdings, and other funds, and its income shall be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States or by any State or local taxing authority, except that: (1) any real property and tangible personal property of the Bank shall be subject to Federal, State, and local taxation to the same extent according to its value as other such property is taxed; and (2) any and all obligations issued by the Bank shall be subjected both as to principal and interest to Federal, State, and local taxation to the same extent that the obligations of private corporations are taxed."
