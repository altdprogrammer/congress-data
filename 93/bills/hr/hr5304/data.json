(Amends P.L. 92-268). Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President shall take all appropriate action to expedite realization of the international monetary reform noted at the Smithsonian on December 18, 1971; and that the executive branch shall not intervene in the foreign exchange market to artificially prop up the dollar to deal with fundamental misalignments in the U.S. payments position."
