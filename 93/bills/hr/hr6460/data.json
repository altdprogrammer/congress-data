    "text": "Land Use Policy Act - Title I: Findings, Policy and Purpose - States that it is the purpose of this Act to establish a national policy to encourage and assist the several States to more effectively exercise their constitutional responsibilities for the planning and management of their land base through the development and implementation of State land use programs designed to achieve economically and environmentally sound uses of the Nation's land resources. Title II: Administration of Land Use Policy - Establishes, in the Department of the Interior, the Office of Land Use Policy Administration to maintain a continuing study of the land resources of the United States and their use and to develop and maintain a Federal Land Use Information and Data Center. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a National Advisory Board on Land Use Policy to provide the Secretary with information and advice concerning the relationship of policies, programs, and activities established or performed pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the States to coordinate land use planning, policies, and programs with appropriate interstate entities. Title III: Program of Assistance to the States - Authorizes the Secretary to make annual grants to each State to assist in developing and administering a State land use program meeting the requirements set forth in this Act. Establishes requirements for the continuing eligibility of State land use planning programs for grants provided for under this Act. Provides that in the event that the Secretary determines that a State is ineligible for grants pursuant to this Act he shall notify the President, who shall order the establishment of an ad hoc hearing board. Requires the Secretary to specify in detail, in writing, to the hearing board his reasons for considering a State ineligible, or for withdrawing the eligibility of a State for grants pursuant to this Act. Directs the hearing board to hold such hearings as it deems necessary to determining whether a finding of ineligibility would be reasonable. Provides that Federal projects and activities significantly and primarily affecting the use of other Federal land including but not limited to grant, loan, or guaranteed programs shall be consistent with State land use programs. Stipulates that no Federal agency shall approve any proposed activity which it determines to be consistent with a State land use program. Title IV: Federal-State Coordination and Cooperation in the Planning and Management of Federal and Adjacent Non-Federal Lands - Authorizes the Secretary, at his discretion, to establish an Ad Hoc Federal-State Joint Committee or Committees to review and make recommendations concerning general and specific problems relating to jurisdictional conflicts and inconsistencies resulting from the various policies and legal requirements governing the planning and management of Federal lands and of adjacent non-Federal lands. Requires the Secretary to report biennially to the President and the Congress concerning problems in and methods for coordination of planning and management of adjacent non-Federal lands, together with recommendations to improve such coordination. Title V: General - Requires the Executive Office of the President to issue guidelines to the Federal agencies and the States to assist in carrying out the requirements of this Act. Directs the Secretary, with the assistance of the Office and the Board to report biennially to the President and the Congress on land resources, uses of land, and emerging problems of land use. States that annual grants to States found eligible for financial assistance pursuant to this Act shall be made in amounts not to exceed 90 percent of the estimated cost of developing State land use programs for the five complete fiscal year periods occurring immediately after the date of enactment of this Act. Establishes methods of computing and paying amounts to eligible States pursuant to this Act. Provides that for each of the eight complete fiscal years occurring immediately after the date of enactment of this Act, there are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for grants to the States not more than $1,000,000,000 annually to carry out the purposes of this Act. States that for each of the five complete fiscal years occurring immediately after the date of enactment of this Act, there are authorized to be appropriated $10,000,000 to the Secretary to be used exclusively for the administration of this Act. Title VI: Second Home and Subdivision Regulation - Second Home and Regulation Act - States that by the end of the third complete fiscal year occurring after the date of enactment of the Land Use Policy and Planning Assistance Act, each State shall, in order to be eligible for further grants pursuant to this Act, establish a permit program to regulate the subdivision of land. Sets forth the requirements of such programs. Provides that any person proposing a development, after the date of establishment of the permit program, shall file an application for a permit with the State land use planning agency and the permit authority, if the State land use planning agency is not so designated, and with all local governments in whose jurisdiction or within five miles of whose jurisdiction any part of the development will occur. Requires each to contain, in addition to appropriate administrative information: (1) a comprehensive map of the development setting forth the proposed lot lines and the proposed improvements in the development; (2) a schedule of completion of all improvements and sales; (3) a comprehensive statement of the potential effects of the proposed development upon the environment and public services; and (4) such other information as the State land use planning agency and the permit authority, if different, may require. Sets forth standards for the review and enforcement of such permits."
