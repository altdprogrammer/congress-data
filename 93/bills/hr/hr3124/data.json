    "text": "Provides that all meetings of any Government agency at which any official action is considered or discussed shall be open to the public. Provides that the above provision shall not apply to that portion of any meeting in which the action or proposed action to be taken, considered, or discussed by an agency: (1) relates to a matter affecting the national security; (2) relates solely to the internal management of such agency; (3) might tend to reflect adversely on the character or reputation of any individual who is subject to any proposed or potential sanction by such agency; or (4) might divulge matters required to be kept confidential under specific statutory provisions. Requires each agency subject to the requirements of this Act to establish, through publication in the Federal Register, procedures for providing public notice of meetings required by this Act to be open to the public. Revises the Legislative Reorganization Act to bring the procedures of the Congress into substantial conformity with the above standards. (Amends 2 U.S.C. 190a). Provides that the district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction of actions to render declaratory judgments or to enforce, by injunction or otherwise, the provisions of this Act."
