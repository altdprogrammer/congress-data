States that the quantity required so to be carried in United States-flag commercial vessels shall be at least 25 percent after June 30, 1975; and at least 30 percent after June 30, 1977, if the Secretary of Commerce shall, on December 31 preceding each such date, determine that United States tonnage existing or on order and scheduled to be delivered by such date would be adequate to carry such quantity."
