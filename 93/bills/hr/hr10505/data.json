    "text": "Senior Citizens' Transportation Services Act - Requires State plans for urban mass transportation assistance to provide for specially reduced rates during non-rush hours for any elderly person using federally financed facilities. Allows air carriers to grant reduced-rate transportation to youths, elderly persons, handicapped persons, and military personnel on a space-available basis. Defines such persons for purposes of this provision. Provides for mandatory half fare rates on common carriers during nonpeak periods of travel for elderly persons. Allows federal subsidies to common carriers showing economic loss because of this provision. Makes it unlawful and provides penalties for any person engaged in the business of insuring motor vehicles who denies or refuses to sell insurance to any individual on account of his age if that individual possesses a valid driver's license. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation in consultation with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, to prescribe such standards for mass transportation facilities design as are necessary to insure that elderly and physically and mentally handicapped persons will have ready access to, and use of, the buildings. Makes provisions for grants for transportation research and demonstration projects for the elderly totalling $7,500,000 for fiscal years 1974-1975."
