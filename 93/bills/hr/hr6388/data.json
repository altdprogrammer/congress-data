    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Airport Development Acceleration Act - Expands the definition of \"airport development\" contained in the Airport and Airway Development Act to provide that security equipment required of an airport sponsor by the Secretary of Transportation for the safety and security of persons and property on the airport is a part of airport development and, as such, eligible for Federal matching grants. Increases from $840 million to $1.4 billion the limitation on the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to incur obligations to make airport development grants under the Act, which authority extends until June 30, 1975. Provides that not more than $1.12 billion in such obligations can be liquidated before June 30, 1974, and not more than $1.4 billion in such obligations can be liquidated before June 30, 1975. Permits the Secretary of Transportation to approve an airport development project submitted by a public agency if the United States or an agency thereof holds good title to the landing areas of the airport, or gives assurances that good title will be acquired. Provides that the Federal share of allowable project costs incurred under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 shall be: (1) fifty percent for sponsors whose airports enplane not less than 1.00 percent of the total annual passengers enplaned by air carriers certificated by the Board; and (2) seventy-five percent for sponsors whose airports enplane less than 1.00 percent of such passengers. Provides that to the extent that the project cost of an approved project for airport development represents the cost of safety equipment required under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 the United States share shall be 82 percent of the allowable cost thereof with respect to airport development project grant agreements entered into after May 10, 1971. States that, to the extent that the project cost of an approved project for airport development represents the cost of security equipment required by the Secretary by rule or regulation, the United States share shall be 82 percent of the allowable cost thereof with respect to airport development project grant agreements entered into after September 28, 1971. Provides that the Secretary shall prepare and publish within three years after May 30, 1970, and thereafter to review and revise as necessary, a national airport system plan for the development of public airports in the United States. Provides that no State shall levy or collect a tax, fee, head charge, or other charge, directly or indirectly, on persons traveling in air transportation or on the carriage of persons in air transportation, or on the gross receipts derived therefrom."
