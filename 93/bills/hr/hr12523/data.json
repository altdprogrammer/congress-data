Provides that lenders of such loans may take into account the prospective borrower's total financial situation, including that of his family, and may counsel him regarding a prospective loan. Extends for one year the Secretary's authority to pay a special allowance of up to 3 percent beyond the seven per cent interest rate to lenders under the Emergency Insured Student Loan Fund Act."
