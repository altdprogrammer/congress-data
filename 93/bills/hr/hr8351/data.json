    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Expands, under the Rail Passenger Service Act, the definition of \"intercity passenger service\". Adds the definition of \"auto-ferry service.\" Restructures the Board of Directors of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (AMTRAK). Removes the exemption for the currently operating Auto-Train Corporation from the requirement that competitive auto-ferrys petition the Interstate Commerce Commission in order to function. Extends the right of eminent domain to AMTRAK, except for property owned by a railroad or government entity. Establishes the right of eminent domain to AMTRAK, except for property owned by a railroad or government entity. Establishes criteria which the Interstate Commerce Commission must use in determining what is just and reasonable compensation which AMTRAK pays to railroads providing services. Establishes procedures for AMTRAK to apply to the ICC for an order directing railroads to convey properties to AMTRAK. Establishes AMTRAK passenger train preference over freight trains, and provides for procedures for AMTRAK to operate its trains at accelerated speeds. Requires AMTRAK to initiate at least one experimental train per year to be operated for not less than two years. Freezes the basic AMTRAK system for one year. Authorizes appropriations to AMTRAK from the Federal Government for fiscal year 1974. Increases the amount of Federal guarantee authority from $200 million to $250 million. Authorizes the Commission to prescribe regulations to assure that the quality of service and accommodations is adequate. States that the Commission may not prescribe regulations applicable to the Corporation that relate to the scheduling of service, the number or type of cars in a train, or that conflict with the service characteristics established by the Secretary for the basic system."
