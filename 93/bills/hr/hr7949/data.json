Declares that an application for financial assistance for a public service employment program under said Act shall include additional provisions setting forth: (1) assurances that the jobs in each job category in no way infringe upon the promotional opportunities which would otherwise be available to persons currently employed in public service jobs not subsidized under said Act, and assurances that no job will be filled in other than an entry level position until applicable personnel procedures and collective bargaining agreements have been complied with; and (2) assurances that jobs funded under this Act are in addition to those that would be funded by the sponsor in the absence of assistance under said Act."
