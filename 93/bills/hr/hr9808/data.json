    "text": "Expresses the findings of Congress that procedures and standards should be established with respect to the operation of all blood banks in the United States. Establishes in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare a National Blood Bank program. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to perform specified functions in order to assure an adequate supply of safe blood in the Nation, including to: (1) promulgate regulations for licensing and inspection of blood banks; (2) classify blood banks as either class A blood banks or class B blood banks; (3) take such action as he considers necessary to assure that the distribution and allocation of blood among the different regions of the United States will be accomplished in as efficient a manner as possible; and (4) develop new procedures, materials, and techniques to inform the public of the need to donate blood voluntarily. Requires the Secretary to maintain a registry of all persons who give blood after January 1, 1974, to a licensed blood bank and identify donors on such registry who may have been implicated in the transmission of hepatitis or who should otherwise be disqualified as blood donors. Establishes an Advisory Council to be composed of nine members appointed by the President, which shall make recommendations to the Secretary with respect to (1) long-term policy goals of this Act; (2) the encouragement of blood donation and the motivation, recruitment, and recognition of blood donors; (3) reciprocal transactions between national blood bank systems; and (4) the removal of the cost for purchasing blood from coverage under health insurance plans. Provides that no person other than a blood bank which is classified as a class A blood bank may maintain any program in which individuals deposit blood in advance of their need for blood or pledge to give blood upon request. States that no agency or other instrumentality of the Government of the United States shall contract for or pay for the provision of blood from any person other than a class A blood bank. Provides that any person who willfully violates any provision of this Act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, on conviction thereof, be subject to imprisonment for not more than one year, or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
