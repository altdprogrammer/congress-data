    "text": "District of Columbia Policemen and Firemen's Retirement and Disability Fund Act - Establishes a Policemen and Firemen's Retirement and Disability Fund. Provides that, except as provided for in this Act, appropriations to the retirement fund are available solely for the payment of refunds and retirement and death benefits to officers and members of the Metropolitan Police force and of the Fire Department of the District of Columbia and their eligible survivors. Sets forth the duties and functions of a Board of Trustees of the Fund. Provides for the membership of such Board. Provides for employee contributions to the Fund. Requires the District government to include in its annual budget payments to the fund which, when considered in addition to employee contributions made pursuant to this Act, shall be sufficient to assure funding on a normal cost standard basis for all benefits accruing on or after July 1, 1975. Provides that a component of the amount included in the District of Columbia budget with respect to the funding of such benefits shall be a \"normal cost contribution.\" Provides that, on the basis of regular interest and of such mortality and other actuarial assumptions as shall be adopted by the Board of Trustees, the actuary shall determine a \"normal cost\" for each employee which is equal to the amount of annual contribution which is necessary to provide his benefit if such contributions in additon to employee contributions as defined under this Act had been made annually from his date of employment to his date of retirement. Aurthorizes appropriations of up to $25,000,000 a year over thirty years for the Federal share of the unfunded liability payment under this Act. Sets requirements for the types of investments to be made in the management of the Fund. Directs the Board of Trustees to publish annually a report accounting the operation of the fund showing the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, as determined by the actuary, and a statement of receipts and disbursements and of the condition of the retirement fund created by this Act. States that the Board shall submit said report to the Mayor and shall furnish copies to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Comptroller General of the United States, participating employees and any other concerned parties when requested. Directs the Board of Trustees to prepare and publish annually a report comprehensive in coverage and written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average participant describing the conditions and operation of the fund which shall be made available to all participating employees and beneficiaries. Provides that additional copies shall be made available to the public upon request."
