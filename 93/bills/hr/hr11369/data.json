Requires the Attorney General to give thirty days' notice in writing to the Congress of his intention to remove the Special Prosecutor, setting forth in detail the reasons for such removal. States that all materials, tapes, documents, files, work in process, information, and all other property of whatever kind and description relevant to the duties enumerated in this Act, tangible or intangible, collected by, developed by, or in the possession of the former Special Prosecutor or his staff established pursuant to regulation by the Attorney General (28 C.F.R. 0.37, rescinded October 24, 1973), shall be delivered into the possession of the Special Prosecutor appointed under this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
