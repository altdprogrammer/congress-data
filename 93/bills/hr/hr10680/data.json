Provides that Federal-aid highway funds apportioned on or after January 1, 1976, to any State which has not fully implemented the requirements of the uniform standards promulgated by the Secretary under this section on or before December 31, 1973, or, with respect to standards revised or promulgated after December 31, 1973, has not fully implemented the requirements of such standards within two years after their revision or promulgation, shall be reduced by amounts equal to 20 percent of the amounts which would otherwise be apportioned to such State until such time as such State is fully implementing such standards.
