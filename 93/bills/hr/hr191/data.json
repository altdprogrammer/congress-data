    "text": "Metric Conversion Act - Declares that the policy of the United States shall be: (1) to facilitate and encourage the substitution of metric measurement units for customary measurement units; (2) to facilitate and encourage the development as rapidly as practicable of new or revised engineering standards based on metric measurement units in those specific fields or areas in the United States where such standards will result in rationalization or simplification of relationships, improvements of design, or increases in economy; (3) to facilitate and encourage the retention in new metric language standards of those United States engineering designs, practices, and conventions that are internationally accepted or embody superior technology; (4) to cooperate with foreign governments and public and private international organizations which are or become concerned with the encouragement and coordination of increased use of metric measurement units or engineering standards based on each units; (5) to assist the public through specified information and educational programs to become familiar with the meaning and applicability of metric terms and measures in daily life; (6) to accomplish a changeover to the greatest practical extent within ten years by Federal agencies to the metric system of measurement pursuant to the comprehensive plan developed by the Conversion Board; and (7) to utilize Federal procurement activities to encourage the general use of the metric system of measurement. Establishes a National Metric Conversion Board, consisting of 11 members, 9 of whom shall be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate from the following areas: business, labor, education, consumer protection, science, and technology. Provides that one member of the Board shall be a Member of the House of Representatives appointed by the Speaker and one member shall be a Member of the Senate appointed by the President of the Senate. Requires the Board, within 18 months after funding, to submit to the President and the Congress a comprehensive plan to accomplish a changeover to the metric system of measurement in the United States, together with legislative recommendations. Authorizes the Board in carrying out its duties to enter into contracts for research, hold hearings, and establish advisory committees. Provides that the Board shall cease to exist ten years after submission of its comprehensive plan. Authorizes to be appropriated a total of $14,500,000 for fiscal years 1972-1976 for the purposes of this Act."
