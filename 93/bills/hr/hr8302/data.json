Directs the Commissioner of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, to develop and carry out a program of public education to inform the public of such conversion and to assist the public in learning to utilize the Metric System. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make grants to individuals, not exceeding $2,000 to each individual, to defray non-reimbursable expenses incurred for purposes of acquiring tools or instruments which are required as a result of the conversion to the metric system in their trade or business."
