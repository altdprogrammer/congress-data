Increases to $10,000 the aggregate liability per dwelling unit for any contents related to such unit. Increases to $100,000 the aggregate liability in the case of business properties which are owned, leased, and operated by small business concerns. Increases, in the case of any other properties which may become eligible for flood insurance coverage under the Act, to $100,000 the aggregate liability per unit for any contents related to such unit. Provides that no Federal office or agency shall approve any financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes after the expiration of 60 days following the enactment of this Act for use in any area that has been identified by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as an area having special flood hazards and in which the sale of flood insurance is authorized under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 unless the building or mobile home and any personal property to which such financial assistance relates is, during the anticipated economic or useful life of the project, covered by flood insurance in an amount at least equal to its development or project cost or to the maximum limit of coverage authorized for the particular type of property under the National Flood Insurance Act, whichever is less. Removes the limit of outstanding notes and obligations that may be issued for purposes of financing the provisions of the Act. Amends 42 U.S.C. 4016 Permits judicial appeal of the Secretary's determination by any owner or lessee of real property. =Title II: Disaster Mitigation Requirements= - Provides that no Federal officer or agency shall approve any financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes on and after July 1, 1975, for use in any area that has been identified by the Secretary as an area having special flood hazards unless the community in which such area is situated is then participating in the national flood insurance program. Provides that each Federal instrumentality responsible for the supervision, approval, regulation, or insuring of banks, savings and loan associations, or similar institutions shall by regulation prohibit such institutions on and after July 1, 1975, from making, increasing, extending, or renewing any loan secured by improved real estate or a mobile home located or to be located in an area that has been identified by the Secretary as an area having special flood hazards, unless the community in which such area is situated is then participating in the national flood insurance program. Repeals the disaster assistance penalty provision of the Act. Authorizes the Secretary to issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures for consulting with appropriate local officials. States that such consultation shall include, but not be limited to, fully informing local officials at the commencement of any study of the nature of the study, the areas involved, and the use to be made of data."
