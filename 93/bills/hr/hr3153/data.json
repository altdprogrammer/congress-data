Makes Supplemental Security Income recipients eligible for food stamps. Establishes a national adoption information exchange system. Directs the Secretary to establish, within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, a separate organizational unit, under the direction of the Assistant Secretary for Child Support, who shall report directly to the Secretary and who shall among other things: (1) establish such standards for State programs for locating absent parents, establishing paternity, and obtaining child support as he determines to be necessary to assure that such programs will be effective; (2) establish minimum organizational and staffing requirements for State units engaged in carrying out such programs under plans approved under this part; (3) review and approve State plans for such programs; and (4) evaluate the implementation of State programs established pursuant to such plan, conduct such audits of State programs established under the plan approved under this part as may be necessary to assure their conformity with the requirements of this part, and, not less often than annually, conduct a complete audit of the programs established under such plan in each State. Directs the Secretary to establish and conduct a Parent Locator Service under the direction of the Assistant Secretary for Child Support which shall be used to obtain and transmit to any authorized person information as to the whereabouts of any absent parent when such information is to be used to locate such parent for the purpose of enforcing support obligations against such parent. Authorizes civil actions to enforce child support obligations, and authorizes a study to establish paternity through the analysis and classification of blood. Increases benefits to recipients of aid to families with dependent children under the Social Security Act. Sets forth standards for entitlement to payment under Medicaid to Health Maintenance Organizations.

Establishes within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, a Medicare Formulary Committee to compile, publish, and make available a Medicare Formulary.

Extends coverage under Medicare for the disabled spouse of an individual who is covered under Medicare by reason of disability. Provides that none of the funds provided under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act may be used for the performance of abortions. Provides that during any period during which any foreign country prohibits or limits the export of crude oil or refined petroleum products from such country to the United States, there shall be no export of articles, materials, and supplies used in the exploration for crude oil, the extraction or refining of crude oil, or the transportation of crude oil or refined petroleum products, from the United States to: (1) such country, or (2) any other foreign country which is exporting such articles, materials, or supplies to such country."
