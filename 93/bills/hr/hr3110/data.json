Provides that the Director shall develop a program for the assignment of scientists who qualify under this Act to Federal laboratories having available space and facilities. Requires the Director to investigate the possibilities for a program, which he may develop, for the assignment of qualified scientists to non-Federal laboratories which volunteer to make space and facilities available on a reimbursable basis. Provides that applications for the use of available Federal Laboratory space and facilities shall be submitted to the Director in such form and containing such information as the Director shall prescribe. Specifies criteria which an applicant must meet to be qualified for assignment under this Act. States that an applicant selected by the Director shall be assigned available space in a participating laboratory in accordance with the applicant's field of study and available facilities. Provides that such an applicant shall receive a grant to conduct a program of research for not to exceed three years at a designated laboratory. States that the grantee shall receive a stipend of not more than $700 per month, as determined by the Director on the basis of the grantee's need, experience and background. Authorizes the grantee to apply through the agency or other authority in charge of the laboratory, for a United States patent as a result of any research or investigation carried out under such a grant. States that the grantee shall assign any such patent granted by the United States to the United States, but such grantee shall be entitled to 1/2 of any royalties as a result of such patent. Provides that any foreign patents granted shall be the property of the grantee."
