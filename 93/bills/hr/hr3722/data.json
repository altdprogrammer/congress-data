Gives the President sole authority to deploy such Armed Forces: (1) when he finds that U.S. territory is under attack or imminent threat of attack; (2) when he finds that such deployment fulfills a U.S. treaty obligation; or (3) pursuant to a declaration of war by Congress except that such deployment may be only in countries authorized in such declaration unless the President finds that the safety of U.S. or allied troops require such deployment in other countries. Requires the President to notify Congress within 24 hours after any finding listed above of any action taken pursuant to such finding."
