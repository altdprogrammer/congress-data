    "text": "Disabled Veterans Employment Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to break down hindrances and remove obstacles to the employment of partially disabled persons honorably discharged from the Armed Forces following service in war by making an equitable adjustment of the liability under the workmen's compensation laws which an employer must assume in hiring disabled veterans. Establishes a Fund for Encouraging the Employment of Disabled Veterans to make the payments required by this Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to make payments to the States for amounts expended for veterans by a State's special or subsequent injury fund or equivalent arrangement to encourage the employment or reemployment of disabled veterans. Requires a State plan seeking approval under this Act to provide for payment of workmen's compensation benefits for a veteran's disability or death, and for reimbursement to the employer for that additional compensation which is due to the veteran's preexisting physical impairment. Provides that the State plan shall designate the State workmen's compensation agency as the sole agency responsible for filing claims under this Act, and for administering the disbursement of funds under this Act throughout the State. Provides for a hearing and judicial review of the Secretary's final decisions on State plans under this Act. Requires the State agency to furnish the Secretary with such information as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Makes provisions for an audit of State plans. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out studies utilizing to the maximum extent practicable the existing Services of other Federal departments, State and local government agencies, and any other organizations, with respect to the adequacy of State special or subsequent injury funds or equivalent arrangements, and to develop comprehensive criteria to encourage the adoption of adequate State measures to assist the employment of disabled veterans. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the purposes of this Act."
