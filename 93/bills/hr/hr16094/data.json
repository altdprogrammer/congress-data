Sets forth regulations governing the erection and maintenance along the Interstate and primary highway systems of outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices which are more than six hundred and sixty feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way, located outside of cities and villages, visible from the main traveled way of the system, and erected with the purpose of their message being read from such main traveled way. States that such signs shall be limited to: (1) directional and official signs and notices, which signs and notices may include, but not be limited to, signs and notices pertaining to information in the specific interest of the traveling public, such as, but not limited to, signs and notices pertaining to rest stops, camping grounds, food services, gas and automotive services, and lodging, and shall include signs and notices pertaining to natural wonders, scenic and historical attractions, which are required or authorized by law, which shall conform to national standards hereby authorized to be promulgated by the Secretary hereunder, which standards shall contain provisions concerning lighting, size, number, and spacing of signs, and such other requirements as may be appropriate to implement this section; (2) signs, displays, and devices advertising the sale or lease of property upon which they are located; and (3) signs, displays, and devices advertising activities conducted on the property on which they are located. Specifies that the Secretary of Transportation, during the implementation of State laws enacted to comply with the Federal-Aid Highway Act, shall encourage and assist the States to develop sign controls and programs which will assure that necessary directional information about facilities providing goods and services in the interest of the traveling public will continue to be available to motorists. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States for projects for the construction, reconstruction, and improvement of any off-system road (including, but not limited to, the replacement of bridges, the elimination of high hazard locations, and roadside obstacles.) Sets forth the formula to be followed by the Secretary in alloting the sums authorized to be appropriated among the various States. Directs the Secretary to carry out various specified demonstration projects. Authorizes the Secretary to construct or reconstruct access highways to public recreation areas on lakes in order to accommodate present and projected traffic density."
