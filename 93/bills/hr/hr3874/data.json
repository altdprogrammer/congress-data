    "text": "Provides that, except with the express approval of an elected board of education having jurisdiction, no student shall be assigned or compelled to attend any school on account of race, creed, color, or national origin, or for the purpose of achieving equality in attendance or increased attendance or reduced attendance, at any school, or persons of one or more particular races, creeds, colors, or national origins. States that no school district, school zone or attendance unit, by whatever name known, shall be established, reorganized or maintained for any such purpose, provided that nothing contained in this Act shall prevent the assignment of a pupil in the manner requested or authorized by his parents or guardian, and further provided that nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect, in any way, the right of a religious or denominational educational institution to select its pupils exclusively or primarily from members of such religion or demonination or from giving preference to such selection to such members or to make such selection to its pupils as is calculated to promote the religious principle for which it is established."
