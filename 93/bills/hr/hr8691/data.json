Declares it to be the purpose of this Act to remedy the inadequacy of such resources. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to make grants to, and enter into contracts with, public and private nonprofit agencies for (1) the development of new curriculums to educate consumers on the nutritional and economic aspects of commodities; (2) community consumers' agricultural commodity education programs; and (3) for mass media materials dealing with consumer education of commodities. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of this Act for fiscal year 1973 and each succeeding fiscal year."
