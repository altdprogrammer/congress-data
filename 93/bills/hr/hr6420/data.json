Sets forth the definitions of the terms used in this Act, including \"child abuse\", which has such meaning as given under State laws; except that in any case it shall include the physical or mental injury, severe abuse, or maltreatment of a child under the age of eighteen by a person who is responsible for the child's household, occurring under circumstances which indicate that the child's health or welfare is harmed or threatened. Authorizes appropriations of $20,000,000 for each fiscal year, l974 through l976. Specifies the requirements a State child abuse prevention plan must meet to qualify for assistance under this Act, including: (1) that such plan is in effect throughout the State; (2) that a designated State agency shall make reports to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare; and (3) that the State has adequate child abuse laws or is initiating a legislative program of such laws. Sets forth the procedures a State must meet for the reporting of child abuse or neglect cases by doctors, schoolteachers, social and welfare workers. Provides that specified actions shall be taken when such report is submitted to the police, social service administration or judical authority, including the forwarding of the report to the appropriate State agency and to the Social and Rehabilitative Service in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare."
