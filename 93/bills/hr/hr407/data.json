    "text": "Prohibits the expenditure of funds, subject to the provisions of this Act, heretofore or hereafter appropriated for longer than thirty days after enactment of this Act to support the deployment of United States Armed Forces or any other military or paramilitary personnel under the control of the United States in the conduct of military or paramilitary operations in or over the Republic of Vietnam, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos. Provides that funds appropriated may not be expended after the date of enactment of this Act to conduct offshore naval bombardment of, or to bomb (including the use of napalm, other incendiary devices, or chemical agents), rocket, or otherwise attack by air, from any type aircraft, any target whatsoever within Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, or the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Provides that funds appropriated may not be expended after the date of enactment of this Act to conduct offshore naval bombardment of, or to bomb (including the use of napalm, other incendiary devices, or chemical agents), rocket, or otherwise attack by air, from any type aircraft, any target whatsoever within the Republic of Vietnam unless the President determines any such bombardment of air operation clearly is necessary to provide for the immediate safety of United States Armed Forces during their withdrawal from the Republic of Vietnam, and submits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House for immediate transmission to the respective bodies of the Congress, within forty-eight hours of each such bombardment or operation (or if the Congress is not in session, as soon thereafter as it may return), a written report setting forth the time, place, nature, and reasons for conducting such bombardment or operation. Provides that if, by twenty days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and other adversary forces in Indochina holding American prisoners of war have not made arrangements for the release and repatriation by such date of all such prisoners: (1) such date shall be extended for thirty days; and (2) the Congress may by joint resolution authorize such further action as is recommended by the President to secure the release and repatriation of American prisoners of war. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the authority of the President to arrange asylum or other means of protection for individuals who might be physically endangered by the withdrawal of United States military or paramilitary personnel from the Republic of Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos, or to arrange for the return of United States equipment or stores from the Republic of Vietnam."
