    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Extends the authorizations for the striking of medals in commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of the cable car in San Francisco and in commemoration of Jim Thorpe for two years, and extends for three months the authorization for medals to commemorate the International Exposition on Environment at Spokane, Washington. Provides that, except with respect to medals in commemoration of the bicentennial of the American Revolution, no national medals made for public sale under authority of any law of the United States shall contain any gold without the express, prior approval, by law, of the Congress. Imposes criminal penalties for violation of such prohibition. Adds to the powers of the Export-Import Bank the power to guarantee, insure, coinsure, and reinsure against political and credit risks of loss. Revises the Export-Import Bank to provide that the Bank may offer guarantees, insurance, and extensions of credit. Directs the Bank, in cooperation with comparable institutions of foreign governments, to minimize competition in Government-sponsored export financing. Directs the Bank to advise small businesses of opportunities offered by the Bank. Requires that if the Bank, under the authority of the President, extends credit or guarantees to a Communist country, the President shall separately determine for each transaction of $50,000,000 or over whether it serves the national interest. Grants the Congress an opportunity to disapprove Bank transactions exceeding $60,000,000. Requires affirmative congressional review and approval of all proposed Export-Import Bank loans and guarantees of $25,000,000 or more for fossil fuel energy projects in the U.S.S.R. Sets procedures for review by Congress. Allows 25 percent of the Bank's outstanding amounts to be guarantees and insurance against political and credit risks of loss. Changes the total allowable outstanding amount at any one time from $20,000,000,000 to $25,000,000,000. Terminates the Bank's functions on June 30, 1978. Describes the contents of reports the Bank must file with the Congress. Prohibits the extension of any loan, guarantee, insurance or credit by the Export-Import Bank of the United States to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics until such time as the Trade Reform Act becomes law. Removes the exclusion of receipts and expenditures of the Export-Import Bank from the Unified Budget totals effective July 1, 1976."
