    "text": "Declares the need for a national policy aimed at providing the elderly with low cost, nutritionally sound meals served in strategically located centers such as community centers, senior citizen centers, schools, and other public or private non-profit institutions suited to such use. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture under the Older Americans Act of 1965 to: (1) create a new division within the Food and Nutrition Service of the Department of Agriculture, under the Assistant Secretary for a Marketing and Consumer Services, for the administration of the program; (2) make full utitization of the existing services within the Department including but not limited to the Federal Extension Service under the Director of Science and Education; and (3) consult with the Administration on Aging, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Allows the Secretary to request the technical assistance and cooperation of the Department of Labor, the Office of Economic Opportunity, the Department of Transportation, and such other departments and agencies of the Federal Government as may be appropriate. Establishes a formula for the allotment of funds to States which shall be available for payment to such States for disbursement by the State agency in accordance with such agreements which are entered into by the Secretary and such State agency for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act. Requires any State which desires to receive allotments under this title to submit to the Secretary for approval a qualified plan. Requires the State to meet various nutritional and program requirements in order to receive assistance under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to withhold payments if there is a failure to comply with requirements of this Act. Allows an appeal by an aggrieved State to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which such State is located. Requires each recipient of a grant or contract to, insofar as practicable, utilize in its nutrition program commodities designated from time to time by the Secretary as being in abundance, either nationally or in the local area, or commodities donated by the Secretary."
