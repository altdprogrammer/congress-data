    "text": "Youth Opportunity and Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Amendments - States that the purpose of this part is to promote research into youth development and the causes of delinquent behavior, with particular emphasis on problems relating to juveniles who leave and remain away from home without parental permission; and to assist in demonstrating innovative approaches to youth development and the prevention and treatment of problems of juvenile delinquency and problems leading to juvenile delinquency, such as those relating to runaway children, of regional or national concern. Specifies requirements that an application to assist in the demonstration of a facility for the temporary shelter of runaway children shall meet. Provides for a comprehensive survey to define the major characteristics of the runaway youth population and to determine the areas of the country most affected. Repeals the provisions of the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention and Control Act of 1968 limiting assistance within the juvenile justice system, establishing construction authority and minimum state allotments, and requiring an annual report on all Federal activities in the fields of juvenile delinquency. Authorizes technical assistance for the treatment of delinquency. Eliminates the requirement of the inclusion of career training programs in projects authorized by such Act."
