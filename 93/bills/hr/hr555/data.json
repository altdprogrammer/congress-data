    "text": "National Institutional Grants Program - Sets forth the Congressional finding that support of scientific research and the education of scientists are essential to the security and welfare of the United States. Authorizes $400,000,000 for fiscal year 1970 and a sum equal to 20 percent for each fiscal year thereafter of the Federal funds allocated to institutions of higher education for support of academic science in the United States. Provides that thirty percent of the funds shall be allocated to accredited institutions of higher education in proportion to the ratio that the total number of advanced degrees (including both second and third level degrees) awarded by the institution during the immediately previous three years in the sciences and the teaching of science bears to the total number of such degrees awarded by all institutions of higher education within the United States. Provides that 40 percent of the funds shall go to the State and 30 percent shall go to other institutions of higher education. Provides for the program to be administered by the Director of the National Science Foundation. Sets forth administrative requirements for such program. Establishes the National Institutional Science Council composed of 21 members to advise and make recommendations to the Foundation with respect to the administration of this Act."
