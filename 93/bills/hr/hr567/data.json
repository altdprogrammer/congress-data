Provides penalties for any person, association, partnership, or corporation who: (1) knowingly violates these provisions, (2) in the exercise of due care should have known that such violation was being committed at the time, or (3) knowingly permits a violation of these provisions in any area controlled by such person, association, partnership or corporation. Increases the maximum penalty to a fine of not more than $5,000 or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both; and provides that the violator may be prohibited by order of the court from taking wild migratory game birds in the land or water area concerned for a period of time not to exceed five years."
