    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Establishes an independent establishment to be known as the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration to coordinate, to facilitate, and to aid in the scheduling of events, activities, and projects of local, State, National, and international significance sponsored by both governmental and nongovernmental entities in commemoration of the American Revolution Bicentennial. States that the Administration shall be headed by an Administrator who shall be nominated by the President within sixty days after the effective date of this Act and appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Sets forth the administrative functions of the Administrator. States that any property acquired by the Administration and which remains upon its termination shall be transferred to the Secretary of the Interior for use by him under this Act, or shall be disposed of by the Secretary as excess or surplus property as otherwise provided by law. Provides that whoever, except as authorized under rules and regulations issued by the Administrator, knowingly manufactures, reproduces, or uses any logos, symbols, or marks originated under authority of and certified by the Administrator for use in connection with the commemoration of the American Revolution Bicentennial, or any facsimile thereof, or holds out to the public objects in such a manner as to suggest any such logos, symbols, or marks not officially authorized by the Administrator, shall be fined not more than $250 or imprisoned not more than six months or both. Establishes an American Revolution Bicentennial Advisory Council to be composed of twenty-five members appointed by the President, no more than fifteen of whom shall be appointed from the same political party. Provides that the Administrator shall: (1) provide for the bicentennial master calendar or register of programs and projects, and in other ways provide a central clearinghouse for information and coordination regarding dates, events, places, documents, artifacts, and personalities of bicentennial historical and commemorative significance; (2) coordinate, facilitate, and aid in the scheduling of events, programs, and projects of States and private citizens, and national and international programs, which commemorate the bicentennial; and (3) develop standards for, and evaluate the feasibility, relevance, status, and desirability of various programs and projects associated with the bicentennial commemoration, acting in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget in cases where Federal department or agency activities are involved. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act. States that an annual report of the activities of the Administration, including an accounting of funds received and expended, shall be furnished by the Administrator to the Congress and a final report shall be made to the Congress no later than June 30, 1977. Provides that the Administration and the Board shall terminate on June 30, 1977, or on the date of the filing of the final report, whichever is sooner. Authorizes the Administrator to carry out a program of grants-in-aid in accordance with and in furtherance of the purposes of this Act. Provides that the Administrator may, subject to such regulations as he may prescribe: (1) make equal grants of appropriated funds in each fiscal year of not to exceed $25,000 to Bicentennial Commissions of each State, territory, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, upon application therefor; (2) make grants of nonappropriated funds to nonprofit entities, including States, territories, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (or subdivisions thereof), to assist in developing or supporting bicentennial programs or projects, such grants being up to 50 percent of the total cost of the program or project to be assisted. Establishes the American Revolution Bicentennial Board. Sets forth the membership of such Board. States that it shall be the duty of the Board to make a continuing study of the activities of the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration. Provides that the Board shall, from time to time, but not less than every six months, report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and to the Senate and the House of Representatives concerning the results of its studies, together with such recommendations as it may deem desirable. Makes conforming technical amendments consistent with this Act."
