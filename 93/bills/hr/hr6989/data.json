    "text": "Establishes a Joint Committee on National Security in order to enable the Congress to more effectively carry out its constitutional responsibility in the formulation of foreign, domestic, and military policies of the United States and in order to provide the Congress with an improved means for formulating legislation and providing for the integration of such policies which will further promote the security of the United States. States the functions of the joint committee to be: (1) to make a continuing study of the foreign, domestic, and military policies of the United States with a view to determining whether and the extent to which such policies are being appropriately integrated in furtherance of the national security; (2) to make a continuing study of the recommendations and activities of the National Security Council relating to such policies, with particular emphasis upon reviewing the goals, strategies, and alternatives of such foreign policy considered by the Council; and (3) to make a continuing study of Government practices and recommendations with respect to the classification and declassification of documents, and to recommend certain procedures to be implemented for the classification and declassification of such material. Requires the joint committee to make reports from time to time (but not less than once each year) to the Senate and House of Representatives with respect to its studies. Provides that the reports shall contain such findings, statements, and recommendations as the joint committee considers appropriate."
