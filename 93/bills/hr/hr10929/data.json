Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to designate as a job development and job training area, for the purpose of this Act, any geographic area wherein more than 25 percent of the families residing therein have incomes under $3,000 per year, or where the census shows a substantial loss of population because of migration due to lack of employment or other economic conditions. States that, upon application of a taxpayer, the Secretary may certify new industrial or commercial facilities as being qualified in area location, job-producing, and job-training characteristics for the purpose of this Act. Establishes an additional 7 percent investment tax credit under the Internal Revenue Code for such certified facilities. Provides for the allowance of an amortization deduction of certified facilities under the Internal Revenue Code."
