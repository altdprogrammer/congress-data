States that the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare may not classify a food for special dietary use as a drug within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act solely on the basis of levels of any vitamin, mineral, protein, or other food ingredient present in such food. Provides that such limitation shall not apply to vitamins A and D if the amount recommended to be consumed is determined by the Secretary, by regulation, to be injurious to health. States that nothing in this Act shall authorize the Secretary to establish limits on the amount of any vitamin, mineral, protein, or other food ingredient which may be contained in a food for special dietary use, unless the Secretary determines, by regulation, that such food would be injurious to health except for such limits."
