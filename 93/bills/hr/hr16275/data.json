Increases authorizations for primary and secondary highway systems, bridge replacement and reconstruction, and for projects to eliminate or reduce the hazards of high-accident sections of highways for fiscal years 1974, 1975, and 1976. Provides for a program to be administered at the county level with funds from the Highway Trust Fund to initiate an emergency bridge replacement program for non-Federal countryside roads and highways."
