    "text": "Open Government Act - Directs each legislative agent, within five days after making his final initial influence legislation, to file a notice of representation with the Comptroller General. Provides that such notice of representation shall be in such form and detail as the Comptroller General shall prescribe and shall include, but not be limited to, the following information: (1) an identification of the legislative agent filing such notice; (2) an identification of each person by whom such legislative agent is retained as a legislative agent; (3) an identification of each person on whose behalf such legislative agent is to perform services as a legislative agent; (4) the financial terms and conditions on which such legislative agent is retained; (5) each specific area of legislative activity with respect to which such legislative agent is retained; and (6) an identification of each person who makes a covered communication to influence legislation, acting for such legislative agent, in each specific area of legislative activity with respect to which such legislative agent is retained. Defines the class of persons required to maintain records. Prescribes that such records shall reflect the total income received in the filing period to make covered communications to influence legislation; including the name and addresses of, and amount received from, any person from whom income is received for such purpose in the filing period; and reflecting total expenditures made in the filing period, including an itemization of any expenditure of at least $50 in value. Provides that a person shall not be required to report the name and address of any person from whom income of less than $25 in value is received in the filing period to make covered communications to influence legislation and, in the case of a voluntary membership organization, such organization shall not be required to report the name and address of any member whose payments in the filing period for making covered communications to influence legislation did not exceed 5 percent of the total expenditures of the organization for such purposes. Provides for a waiver of such requirement, in the case of an individual whose payments exceed 5 percent and do not exceed 30 percent, if the Comptroller General determines that such waiver will not impede the purposes of this Act. Stipulates that compliance with the filing requirements of this Act shall not be taken into consideration, for the purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, in determining whether a substantial part of the activities of an organization is the carrying on of propaganda to influence legislation. Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) develop and prescribe forms and standards for the notices of representation and reports filed by persons required to maintain records; (2) compile information contained in notices of representation and reports filed, with respect to each filing period; (3) report such information to the Congress after the end of each filing period; (4) make available for public inspection at reasonable times in the General Accounting Office in the District of Columbia, for a period of six years following the date of filing, all notices of representation, amendments thereto, and reports filed by persons required to maintain records; (5) have each notice of representation and each amendment thereto which is filed by any legislative agent published in the Congressional Record within three days after each such notice is received by the Comptroller General; (6) ascertain whether any person required to maintain records has failed to file a report, or has filed an incomplete or inaccurate report, and promptly notify such person to file or amend such report in order to satisfy the requirements of this Act or regulations prescribed by the Comptroller General under this Act; and (7) prepare a special study and report upon the request of any Member of the House of Representatives or the Senate from information in the records of the Comptroller General. Provides that any person who knowingly and willfully violates specified provisions of this Act shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned for not more than 2 years or both (except for violations of filing notices of representation which shall be punished by a maximum fine of $5,000).
