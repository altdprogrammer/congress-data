    "text": "Extends through July 1, 1974, the provision of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 which allows a Federal agency to pay 100 percent of the first $25,000 of payments required to furnish real property incident to Federal assistance. (Amends 42 U.S.C. 4627) Provides that during the period from July 1, 1972, through June 30, 1973, the head of a Federal agency is authorized to advance to a State which is not in compliance with this Act such sums in excess of the first $25,000 of cost as may be necessary to make all payments and provide all assistance required by this Act. Requires all sums advanced to a State to be repaid by such State as soon as practicable in accordance with regulations adopted by the head of such Federal agency. Provides that whenever the acquisition of real property for a program or project to be undertaken by a person or nonprofit organization, or State agency furnished Federal financial assistance by a Federal agency pursuant to a grant, contract, or agreement, will result in the forced displacement of any person on or after the effective date of this Act, the head of the Federal agency furnishing such financial assistance shall provide: (1) fair and reasonable relocation payments and assistance to or for such displaced persons; (2) relocation assistance programs; and (3) decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings to such displaced persons."
