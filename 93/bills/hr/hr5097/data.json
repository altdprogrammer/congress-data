    "text": "Makes additional immigrant visas available for immigrants from any foreign State which had less than three-fourths of the average annual number of visas under the quota system during the ten-fiscal-year period beginning July 1, 1955. Directs that the additional number of visas be equal to the difference between the number of visas made to them and three-fourths of the average made to other immigrants under the quota system, but limits the total number of visas to any foreign State to 7,500 in any fiscal year. Directs the allocation of the additional visas. Provides that no alien shall be excused under the Act, nor have his status adjusted to that of a permanent resident after the expiration of the four-fiscal year period beginning with the first fiscal year commencing on or after the date of enactment of this Act. Provides for the granting of special visas equal to 25 percent of the fourth preference registration from a foreign State pending on July 1, 1964. Provides that these visas shall be issued each year based on estimates of the anticipated numbers of special visas. Provides that special visas not used will be assigned to other countries."
