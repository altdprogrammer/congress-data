    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1973-09-25", 
    "text": "Middle-Aged and Older Workers Employment and Community Service Act - Presents the finding of the Congress that middle-aged and older workers find it increasingly difficult to retain employment. Presents the finding that the Age Discrimination in employment Act of 1967 cannot reasonably be expected without supplementary legislation to cope adequately with age discrimination in employment and to provide employment apportunities for middle-aged and older workers. Declares it to be the purpose of this Act to establish and assist programs which will: (1) afford the middle-aged and older worker a range of real and reasonable opportunities for employment; (2) eliminate arbitrary discriminatory practices which deny work to qualified persons solely on account of age; (3) increase the availability of jobs by finding new work opportunities, including part-time employment to supplement income and to facilitate the transition to full retirement or the return to full-time work; (4) improve and extend existing programs designed to facilitate training and the matching of skills and jobs; (5) assist middle-aged and older workers, employers, labor unions, and educational institutions to prepare for and adjust to anticipated changes in technology in jobs, in educational requirements, and in personnel practices; and (6) stimulate innovative approaches to provide increased employment opportunities for middle-aged and older persons. Authorizes the appropriation of $14,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974, and $210,000,000 for fiscal year ending June 30, 1975 to carry out this title. Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish criteria designed to achieve an equitable distribution of assistance under this Act among the States and between urban and rural areas. Establishes a comprehensive mid-career development service program, to be administrated by the Manpower Administration in the Department of Labor. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to make loans and grants to public and private nonprofit agencies, institutions, and organizations and to individuals for training, including on-the-job, institutional, residential, and other training, designed to upgrade the work skills and capabilities of middle-aged and older persons who are at least forty-five years of age."
