Makes provisions and conditions for the issuance of an alter- nate wage order following review. Makes provisions for a special industry committee to recommend an alternative minimum wage rate for agricultural employees, not to exceed that specified above. Sets forth necessary conforming amendments. (Amends 29U.S.C. 206 (a) (1), (a) (5), (c)"
