Directs the Commission to make a detailed investigation and study of the energy requirements and fuel resources and policies of the United States with respect to the different types of fuels and energy. Requires the Commission to report to the President of the United States and to the Congress on: (1) the Nation's projected energy needs, broken down into regional areas, for the next two decades with particular reference to electric power; (2) the fuel resources available of which must be developed to meet those needs, including, as applicable, the programs for research, development, and demonstration necessary to provide those major technological advances which may greatly enhance the Nation's ability to efficiently and economically utilize its fuel resources; (3) the air, water, and other pollution created by energy requirements, including any programs to overcome promptly and efficiently any technological or economic barriers to the elimination of such pollution; and (4) the existing policies and programs of the Federal Government and of State and local governments, which have any significant impact on the availability or economic utilization of such fuel resources and on the ability to meet the Nation's energy needs and environmental requirements, including proposals, policies, and programs for reconciling the Nation's environmental quality requirements with energy needs."
