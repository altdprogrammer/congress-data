Provides that this Act shall not apply to records that are: (1) specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense and foreign policy; and (2) investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes. Requires the President to report to Congress before January 30 of each year on an agency-by-agency basis the number of records and the number of investigatory files which were exempted from the application of this Act. Provides that any employee of the United States who under the color of agency authority knowingly and willfully violates a provision of this Act, or permits such a violation, shall be fined $1,000. Establishes a Federal Privacy Board consisting of seven members appointed for a term of two years by the President, by and with the consent of the Senate, to aid in the administration of this Act.
