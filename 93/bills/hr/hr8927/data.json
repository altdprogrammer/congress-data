Requires the Civil Service Commission to establish standards for such programs; provide training for agency preretirement advisers, and study and publish guidelines about related work-life programs, such as phased retirement, trial retirement, new kinds of part-time work and sabbaticals. Permits the Commission to grant an exemption from providing a preretirement program to any agency which cannot practicably furnish one. Provides for interagency cooperation with regard to preretirement programs. Provides that the Commission shall make a study of existing and recommended practice both within and outside the Government of the United States, which relate to work-life and study programs. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
