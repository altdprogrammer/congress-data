Redefines 'lead-based paint' to mean any paint containing more than five-tenths of 1 per centum (formerly: more than 1 per centum) lead by weight in the total non-volatile content of liquid paints or in the dried film of paint already applied. States that this Act shall preempt state or local laws purporting to establish different standards relating to the lead content in paints. (Amends 42 U.S.C. 4821, 42 U.S.C. 4841(3))"
