States that if a dwelling which is used by the taxpayer as a personal residence (whether or not as his principal residence) is also used by him in an activity engaged in for profit, all expenses in connection with the maintenance, care, and use of such dwelling shall nevertheless be treated as personal, living, or family expenses. Exempts from such rule that portion of a dwelling: (1) which constitutes an office, shop, or other place of doing business utilized by patients, clients, or customers in meeting or dealing with the taxpayer in the normal course of his conduct of his trade or business; or (2) which the taxpayer operates as a hotel, rooming house, or similar establishment."
