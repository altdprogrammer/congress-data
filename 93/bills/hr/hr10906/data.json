Prohibits any Federal agency or employee, or any State or local government from obtaining copies of, access to, or the information contained in, the financial records of any customer from a financial institution unless the financial records are described with particularity and : (1) such customer has authorized such disclosure in accordance with this Act; (2) such financial records are disclosed in response to an administrative subpena or summons; (3) such financial records are disclosed in response to a court order; or (4) such financial records are disclosed in response to a judicial subpena. States that no financial institution may provide to a Federal agency or employee, or to any State or local government, copies of or the information contained in the financial records of any customer except in accordance with the requirements of this Act. Provides that a customer may authorize disclosure if he or those seeking disclosure furnish to the financial institution a signed and dated statement by which the customer: (1) authorizes such disclosure for a period not in excess of one year; (2) identifies the financial records which are authorized to be disclosed; and (3) specifies the purposes for which, and the agencies to which, such records may be disclosed. Requires the financial institution to keep a record of all examinations of the customer's financial records and to notify the customer that he has the right at any time to revoke any authorization of disclosure and to obtain a copy of the aforementioned record of examinations. Sets forth provisions governing customer authorization, administrative subpenas and summons, and judicial subpenas. Prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury from requiring an institution to maintain financial records or to transmit reports on customers, unless such records are required by a supervisory agency or the Internal Revenue Service. Prescribes civil and criminal penalties for violation of the provisions of this Act. Provides for injunctive relief for persons aggrieved by violation or threatened violation of this Act."
