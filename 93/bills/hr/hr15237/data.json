    "text": "Congressional Access to Information Act - States that either House of Congress, any joint committee of Congress, any committee of either House, or any subcommittee thereof, or the Comptroller General at the request thereof, may subpena or request any head of a department or establishment of the United States or any officer or employee of the United States to appear and give complete testimony, or to provide complete information pertinent to matters of legislative concern, or to pending legislation, or with respect to any congressionally authorized programs. Requires such department or establishment head to provide the requested testimony or information within thirty days of the receipt of the request, unless otherwise specified, and to affirm in writing that the testimony or information provided is complete. Provides that if the department or establishment head or officer or employee refuses to testify or provide information, fails to provide complete testimony or information within the specified time period, or fails to certify as to its completeness, the Comptroller General shall be notified by the congressional body or entity which made the request. Directs the Comptroller General, upon such notification, to take all necessary measures to withhold all Federal funds for the operation of the department or establishment or officer or employee involved until such time as the provisions of this Act are complied with. Provides that under certain specified circumstances the President may refuse to allow any information or testimony requested to be provided by the department or establishment head or officer. States that either House of Congress, joint committee of Congress, committee of either House, or subcommittee thereof may bring a civil action in the District Court for the District of Columbia to compel the President to provide complete testimony or information, if his refusal to provide information does not comply with the provisions of this Act."
