Authorizes the Secretary to acquire by purchase or condemnation after July 1, 1974, any land on which a strip mine operation has been or is being conducted without an approved plan or in violation of such plan. Authorizes the Secretary to restore strip mine land in accordance with the plan approved and to assess the owner for the cost of such restoration. Provides that land acquired shall be used for wildlife or recreation purposes in accordance with plans approved by the Secretary and the appropriate State official. Permits the Secretary to make such land available to the State if used for such purposes."
