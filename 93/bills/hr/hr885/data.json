Requires such agency to give public notice of meetings which shall be open to the public under the provisions of this Act. Provides that the term \"Government agency\" means each authority of the Government of the United States having more than one member, but does not include: (1) the Congress; (2) the courts of the United States; or (3) military authorities."
