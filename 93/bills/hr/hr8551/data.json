    "text": "Authorizes the President of the United States to call a White House Conference on Education in 1975 in order to stimulate a national assessment of the condition, needs, and goals of education and to obtain from a broadly representative group of citizens a report of findings and recommendations resulting form such assessment. Requires the Conference to include 5 areas of study in its agenda, as follows: (1) pre-school education, including child care and nutritional programs, and the needs of disadvantaged children; (2) the adequacy of primary education in teaching the skills of communication-reading, writing, and arithmetic; (3) the place of occupational education in helping to meet the nation's requirements for skilled workers; (4) higher education, including ways of providing adequate levels of institutional support and student help; and (5) the adequacy of education at all levels in meeting the special needs of individuals. Authorizes the President to appoint a 35-member National Conference Committee, twelve of the members of which would be educators, and the remainder representative of the public interest in education. Authorizes the Committee to describe the guidelines, organize the Conference, and make its final report before December 1, 1975. Authorizes grants ranging from a minimum of $25,000 to a maximum of $75,000 to each State to defray the expenses of the conferences."
