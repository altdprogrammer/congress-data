Authorizes the Civil Aeronautics Board to issue certificates to any carrier meeting the requirements established by the Act and promulgated by the Board thereunder. Provides that if any service authorized by a certificate to an air carrier to engage in commuter air transportation is not performed satisfactorily, the Board may, after notice and hearing, direct that the certificate cease to be effective.
