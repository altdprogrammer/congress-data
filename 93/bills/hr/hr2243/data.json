Increases the Federal share to 90 percent of the cost of lead-based paint poisoning prevention projects under such Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to State agencies for the purpose of establishing centralized laboratory facilities for analyzing biological and environmental lead specimens obtained from local lead-based paint poisoning detection programs. Provides that no grant may be made under the Act for a program for the detection and prevention of lead-based paint poisoning unless the Secretary determines that there is satisfactory assurance that the services to be provided will constitute an addition to, or a significant improvement in quality in, services that would otherwise be provided, and Federal funds made available for such programs for any period will be so used as to supplement, and, to the extent practical, increase the level of State, local, and other non-Federal funds that would in the absence of such Federal funds be made available for such programs, and will in no event supplant such State, local, and other non-Federal funds. Authorizes the audit of records of agencies and organizations receiving funds under such Act by the Comptroller General of the United States. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to develop and carry out a demonstration and research program to determine the nature and extent of the problem of lead-based paint poisoning in the United States. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to conduct appropriate research on multiple layers of dried paint film, containing the various lead compounds commonly used, in order to ascertain the safe level of lead in residential paint products. Authorizes to be appropriated to make grants for State programs of detection and treatment under the Act $45,000,000 for each fiscal year after fiscal year 1971. Authorizes to be appropriated for grants to States for the elimination of lead-based poisoning under the Act $50,000,000 for each fiscal year. Authorizes to be appropriated for Federal demonstration and research projects under the Act $5,000,000 for each fiscal year. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a National Childhood Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Advisory Board to advise the Secretary on policy relating to the Administration of the Act. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to establish procedures to minimize the hazards of lead-based paint poisoning with respect to any existing housing which may present such hazards and which is covered by an application for mortgage insurance or housing assistance payments under a program administered by the Secretary."
