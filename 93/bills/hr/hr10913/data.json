    "text": "Fire Safety and Education Act - States the findings of the Congress that there is a need for professional training and education primarily oriented toward improving the effectiveness of fire departments, developing leadership for fire prevention, and reducing firefighter injuries. States the finding of the Congress that there is a need for a national fire data collection, analysis, and dissemination system to establish priorities for research and action. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to undertake the following functions: (1) to develop and carry out a comprehensive national fire research and development program designed to determine the causes and nature of fires, their frequency of occurrence, and other pertinent factors, and develop more effective measures of protection against the hazards of death, injury, and damage to property resulting from fire; (2) to develop and carry out educational and training programs in fire safety, including public awareness efforts; and (3) to develop and carry out a comprehensive fire data and information program. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a program of basic and applied fire research for the purpose of arriving at an understanding of the fundamental processes underlying all aspects of fire. Authorizes the Secretary to operate a fire data program based on the collection, analysis, publication, and dissemination of fire information related to the prevention, occurrence, control, and results of fires of all types. Provides that the program shall be designed to provide an accurate national picture of the fire problem, identify major problem areas and assist in setting priorities, determine possible solutions to problems, and monitor progress of programs to reduce fire losses. Directs the Secretary to: (1) identify competing, overlapping, duplicative, or inefficient programs, and make recommendations to appropriate agency officials and to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget concerning the scope and funding of fire programs; (2) encourage Federal interagency transfer of fire technology; and (3) encourage existing and future fire development programs in the State and local government and in the academic and private industry sectors. Authorizes the Secretary, directly or by contract in cooperation and coordination with interested government agencies, fire services and industries, and appropriate fire service organizations to carry out a program to educate the public as to fire safety. Directs the Secretary to establish a Fire Safety Advisory Council which he may consult before taking any action under this Act. Provides that the Council shall be appointed by the Secretary and shall be composed of fifteen members. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
