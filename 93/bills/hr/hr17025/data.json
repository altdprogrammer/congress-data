Directs the elected official to transmit any objects or materials which the Administrator of General Services determines to be public documents to the Administrator within one hundred and eighty days after such official ceases to hold his office. Requires the Administrator to deposit the documents in the National Archives, or donate all or any portion of such documents to any educational institution designated by the elected official. States that a decision by the Administrator of General Services that any object or material is a public document of an elected official of the United States within the meaning of this Act shall be a final agency decision."
