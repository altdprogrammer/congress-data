Provides that benefits shall not be paid under this Act: (1) if the death was caused by the intentional misconduct of the public safety officer or by such officer's intention to bring about his death; (2) if voluntary intoxication of the public safety officer was the proximate cause of such officer's death; or (3) to any person who would otherwise be entitled to a benefit under this part if such person's actions were a substantial contributing factor to the death of the public safety officer. Authorizes necessary appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
