    "text": "Provides that a person may not procure or cause to be prepared an investigative consumer report on any consumer unless: (1) it is clearly and accurately disclosed to the consumer that a report including information as to his character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living, whichever are applicable, may be made; and (2) such required disclosures are made in a writing mailed to the consumer not later than 3 days after the date on which the report was first requested. Permits a consumer reporting agency to furnish a report to any third party only if such third party has, prior to requesting such report, obtained a statement signed by the consumer on whom the report is to be prepared allowing such third party to obtain such report. Prescribes civil liability for the negligent or malicious publication of any untrues statement by a consumer reporting agency, consisting of actual and punitive damages, and a reasonable attorney's fee. Authorizes the President to establish a seven member Board of Consumer Investigator Examiners to regulate the examining, licensing, and practices of individuals who investigate consumers for the purpose of preparing investigative consumer reports. Authorizes the Board to issue licenses, hold hearings, and suspend or revoke licenses issued under this Act. Provides for judicial review in a U.S. district court for any individual aggrieved by any final decision of the Board. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as necessary to carry out this section. (Amends 15 U.S.C. 1681d et seq.; 1601 et seq.)"
