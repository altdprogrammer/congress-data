Title II: Consumer Protection Agency - Establishes as an independent agency within the executive branch of the Government the Consumer Protection Agency, headed by an Administrator appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, to advise the Congress and the President as to matters concerning consumer interests and to protect the interest of consumers.
