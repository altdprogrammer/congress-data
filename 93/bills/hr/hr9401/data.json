    "date": "1973-07-19", 
    "text": "States that the intent of this Act is to insure that the Blue Plains sewage system operates within defined limits so as to help protect and upgrade the water quality of the Potomac River, so that its fullest recreational and esthetic potential shall be available for the enjoyment and welfare of the general public, and to insure that no user jurisdiction uses more than its allotted share of the sewage system's flow capacity. Provides that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall issue certificates to the operator of the Blue Plains sewage system and the user jurisdictions specifically defining the following requirements and provisions with which they shall comply in the operation and use of the Blue Plains sewage system: (1) allowable flow capacity; (2) allowable concentrations and quantities of various pollutants in the effluents discharged in the Potomac River; and (3) the time period over which the parameter limits given above are established. Requires each user jurisdiction to provide flow measuring meters and recording devices on collection and interceptor sewerlines at all locations where the user jurisdiction's lines interconnect with the interceptors of the Blue Plains sewage system. States that the Administrator shall be responsible for independently monitoring the performance of the operation of the Blue Plains sewage system and user jurisdictions to insure that they comply with all the requirements and provisions of the certificates governing the Blue Plains sewage system. Sets forth penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act."
