    "text": "Urban Forestry Act - States that the growth of trees and shrubs helps to improve the quality of the urban environment by preventing erosion, providing shade, and reducing noise and air pollution levels. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make grants to cities to pay up to 100 percent of the cost of trees and shrubs planted under the cities' and park districts' forestry programs, including programs of cities or park districts which provide for the planting of trees on privately owned land. Authorizes to be appropriated $1,000,000 for the fiscal year 1975 for grants under this section. Defines the term park district as meaning a single purpose unit of local government which is responsible for the planning, developing, or administration of a system of parks or other recreational areas. States that the Secretary may make grants to cities with populations exceeding ten thousand and park districts to pay 75 percent of the annual salaries of urban foresters. Authorizes to be appropriated $5,000,000 for the fiscal year 1975 for grants under this section. Directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance to cities and park districts to assist such cities in planning, developing, and administering forestry programs."
