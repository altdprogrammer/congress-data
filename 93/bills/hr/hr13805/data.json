States that beginning with motor vehicles manufactured for the 1976 model year, no new motor vehicle shall be sold or offered for sale in the United States unless the manufacturer has: (1) tested a motor vechicle which is in all respects substantially the same construction as such new vehicle; (2) submitted the results of such tests to the Secretary for publication in the Federal Register; and (3) published in the owners' manual of such new vehicle the lowest average octane rating of gasoline which can be used without knocking in such vehicle based upon such tests. Requires every major refiner to produce and market to the general public, in amounts determined by the Secretary, a gasoline the average octane rating of which is equal to the lowest average octane rating which can be used without knocking in the particular class of motor vehicles. States that such gasoline shall be produced and marketed after such period as the Secretary finds necessary to permit the development and application of the requisite technology. Sets forth penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act."
