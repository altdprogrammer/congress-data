    "text": "Contract Disputes Act - Provides, with special exceptions, that this Act applies to any contract entered into by an executive agency for the procurement of: (1) property other than real property in being, (2) services, or (3) construction, alteration, repair, or maintenance of real property. Authorizes any executive agency to settle claims relating to a contract entered into by it or another agency on its behalf, including claims initiated after award of a contract, based on mistake, misrepresentation, or other cause for contract modification or recission. Excludes claims for penalties or forfeitures prescribed by statute which another agency is specifically authorized to administer. Provides that when a claim is not resolved by mutual agreement, the contracting officer shall issue a decision in writing and furnish a copy of it to the contractor. Sets forth the required content of any such decision. Requires that a waivable conference be held to review the decision. Establishes in the executive branch of the Government a Small Claims Board of Contract Appeals. Sets forth the composition and compensation of Board members. Provides that the Small Claims Board shall have jurisdiction to decide any appeal from a final decision of a contracting officer on a claim or dispute where the amount involved is $25,000 or less. Empowers an agency head to establish within his agency a board of contract appeals when the volume of procurement by the agency justifies a full-time board of at least three members who will have no other duties. Provides that each agency board of contract appeals shall have jurisdiction to decide any appeal from a final decision of a contracting officer under specified circumstances. Sets forth the powers of members of the Small Claims Board of Contract Appeals and of an agency board of contract appeals. Provides that interest at the rate of 6 percent on the amount finally determined to be payable to a contractor under this Act shall be paid to the contractor. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act."
