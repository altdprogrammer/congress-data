    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to establish and maintain a registration system with respect to blood donors. Provides that no person shall accept blood from a donor who does not have an identification card issued under this Act. Provides that blood may be accepted from a donor without an identification card if either the donor has a short-supply blood (as defined by the Secretary) or if there is an immediate critical need (as defined by the Scretary) for his blood. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe such regulations as he deems necessary to insure that an adequate registration system is set up to reduce the risk that donors of blood for money are carriers of serum hepatitis. Provides that any person who accepts blood from a donor who does not have a registration card as required under this Act shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. Requires the Director of the Division of Biological Standards within the National Institutes of Health to establish and maintain a research program to discover a medical test which can detect serum hepatitis prior to transfusion and transmission of the disease."
