Prescribes the authorized personnel strength for each active duty component and of the Selected Reserve of each reserve component of the Armed Forces and the military training student loads. Establishes the Defense Manpower Commission, composed of seven members, to conduct a study of the manpower requirements of the Department of Defense on both a short-term and long-term basis, giving special consideration to enumerated factors, including: (1) the effectiveness with which civilian and active duty personnel are utilized, and (2) whether the pay structure, including fringe benefits, is adequate and equitable at all levels. Authorizes, within specified limitations, the Secretary of Defense to assist the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Department of Transportation in providing medical emergency helicopter transportation services to civilians. Empowers the Secretary of each military department to detail commissioned officers of the Armed Forces as students at accredited law schools. Limits such offers to 25 in any single fiscal year. Sets forth the eligibility requirements to be met by any officer and the competitive procedure for his selection. States that no agreement detailing any officer to an accredited law school may be made during periods when the President is authorized by law to induct persons into the armed forces involuntarily. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to take action to assure that specified hospitals of the Public Health Service continue in operation, continue to provide care for authorized persons and continue to conduct activities at January 1, 1973 levels."
