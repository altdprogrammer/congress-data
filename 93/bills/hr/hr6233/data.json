Provides that the Federal share of allowable project costs incurred under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 shall be: (1) fifty percent for sponsors whose airports enplane not less than 1 percent of the total annual passengers enplaned by air carriers certificated by the Board; and (2) seventy-five percent for sponsors whose airports enplane less than 1 percent of such passengers. Provides that to the extent that the project cost of an approved project for airport development represents the cost of safety equipment required under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 the United States share shall be 82 percent of the allowable cost thereof with respect to airport development project grant agreements entered into after May 10, 1971. States that, to the extent that the project cost of an approved project for airport development represents the cost of security equipment required by the Secretary by rule or regulation, the United States share shall be 82 percent of the allowable cost thereof with respect to airport development project grant agreements entered into after September 28, 1971. Extends until May 21, 1973, the due date for the Secretary's national airport system plan.
