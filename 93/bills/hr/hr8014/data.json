States that the provisions of such a contract may deviate from the cost-sharing arrangements prescribed and the types of health care authorized under title 10 of the United States Code when the Secretary of Defense determines that such a deviation would serve the purpose of that title. Provides that such a contract, however, may not provide for annual payments per beneficiary, by the Government and a beneficiary, of any amount greater than the estimated average annual cost for comparable amounts of care of similar quality provided under the cost-sharing arrangements prescribed in that title.
