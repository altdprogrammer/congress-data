Provides that the Secretary shall prescribe qualifications for drivers and the maximum hours of service and standards of equipment for motor carriers engaged in such activity. Provides that any person who knowingly commits an act in violation of any requirement, rule, regulation, or order promulgated by the Secretary shall be fined not less than $250 nor more than $1,000 for the first offense and not less than $500 nor more than $2,000 for any subsequent offense. States that the Secretary may order any motor carrier engaged in activity covered by this Act to cease and desist from engaging in such activity for not more than sixty days when the Secretary, for good cause, finds that the carriers operations will create an unreasonable risk of accident, injury, or death to persons or damage to property."
