Establishes the Relocation Benefits Commission and the Relocation Benefits Trust Fund. Provides that where such persons apply for benefits from any agency and are qualified, but the agency lacks funds, such Commission shall consider such persons for benefits under this Act by transferring funds from the Trust Fund to such agency. Authorizes appropriations to the Fund of an amount equal to the amount received by the United States from Japan pursuant to the agreement concerning the Ryukyu and Daito Islands, of June 19, 1970. Terminates such Commission when the Fund is depleted."
