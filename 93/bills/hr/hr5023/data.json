    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1973-03-01", 
    "text": "Removes the 30-day maximum credit for lump-sum leave payment purposes to allow a Federal employee to receive lump-sum payment during the year of his separation for leave earned during that year above the current maximum carryover limitations and for which leave was lost and subsequently restored under this Act. Allows an employee whose employment is not limited to less than 90 days to take earned leave during the first 90 days of employment. Allows crediting of leave in excess of current maximums if leave was lost unavoidably through administrative error, exigencies of public business, or illness. Stipulates that, in cases of administrative error, restitution would be retroactive to June 30, 1960. Allows an employee to whom excess leave has been erroneously credited to pay back the leave by lump sum, installment payments, or charge it against future earned leave. Provides that the retroactive feature for leave lost through administrative error will also apply to former employees provided that a claim is filed for or by the employee. Provides the same retroactive feature for present and former employees of the Postal Service if leave was lost after June 30, 1960 and prior to July 1, 1971. Allows civilian employees of the Federal Government who are missing in action to continue to accumulate leave over and above current statutory maximums."
