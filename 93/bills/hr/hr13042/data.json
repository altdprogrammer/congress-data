    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1974-02-26", 
    "text": "States that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may temporarily (until May 15, 1974) suspend any stationary source fuel or emission limitation as it applies to any person, if the Administrator finds that such person will be unable to comply with such limitation during such period solely because of unavailability of types or amounts of fuels. Provides that, after public notice and public hearing, the Administrator may, for any period beginning after May 15, 1974, and ending not later than June 30, 1979, temporarily suspend any stationary source fuel or emission limitation as it applies to any person if the Administrator finds: (1) that such person will be unable to comply with such limitation solely because of the unavailability of types and amounts of fuels, (2) that such suspension will not, after the application implementation plan deadline, result in or contribute to a level of air pollutants which is greater than that specified in a national primary ambient air quality standard, and (3) that such person has been placed on a schedule which provides for the use of methods which the Administrator determines will assure continuing compliance with a national primary ambient air quality standard as soon as practicable (but no later than June 30, 1979), which schedule shall include increments of progress toward compliance with such standard by such date. Provides for judicial review of a grant or denial of a suspension or of any interim requirement on which suspension is conditioned by filing a petition with the United States district court for any judicial district in which is located any stationary source to which the action of the Administrator applies. Sets forth requirements governing the issuance of suspensions by the Administrator. Requires the Administrator to report to Congress not later than March 31, 1974, with respect to: (1) the present and projected impact on the program under this Act of fuel shortages and of allocation and end-use allocation programs; (2) availability of scrubber technology (including projections respecting the time, cost, and number of units available) and the effects that scrubbers would have on the total environment and on supplies of fuel and electricity; (3) number of sources and locations which must use such technology based on projected fuel availability data; (4) priority schedule for implementation of scrubber technology, based on public health or air quality; (5) evaluation of availability of technology to burn municipal solid waste in these sources; (6) projections of air quality impact of fuel shortages and allocations; (7) evaluation of alternative control strategies for the attainment and maintenance of national ambient air quality standards for sulfur oxides within the time frames prescribed in the Act; (8) proposed allocations of scrubber technology for nonsolid waste producing systems to sources which are least able to handle solid waste byproduct, technologically, economically, and without hazard to public health, safety, and welfare; and (9) plans for monitoring or requiring variance-receiving sources to monitor impact of variances on concentration of sulfur dioxide in the ambient air. Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Clean Air Act to reflect the suspension provisions. Requires the Administrator, upon application by the Governor for any air quality control region for which transportation controls have been imposed in order to attain and maintain the national primary ambient air quality standards by June 1, 1977, to extend for two years the date required by any applicable implementation plan for attainment and maintenance of such standards, if the transportation controls for such region require a 20 percent (or greater) reduction in vehicle miles traveled by June 1, 1977, or if he otherwise finds that such controls are impracticable within such time. States that the Administrator may, upon application by the Governor of any such region, further extend the date for attainment and maintenance of such standard if he finds that imposition of additional transportation control requirements is impracticable within such time. Provides for revision of clean air standards with respect to motor vehicle emission standards. States that any allocation program provided for in this Act or in the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, shall, to the maximum extent practicable, include measures to assure that available low sulfur fuel will be distributed on a priority basis to those areas of the country designated by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency as requiring low sulfur fuel to avoid or minimize adverse impact on public health. Authorizes appropriations of $2,000,000 to conduct a study of the acute and chronic health effects among exposed population of emissions of sulfur oxides to the air resulting from any conversions to burning coal. Requires the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration to conduct a study on potential methods of energy conservation and, not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, to submit to Congress a report on the results of such study. Provides that, within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation, after consultation with the Federal Energy Administrator, shall submit to the Congress for appropriate action an \"Emergency Mass Transportation Assistance Plan\" for the purpose of conserving energy by expanding and improving public mass transportation systems and encouraging increased ridership as alternatives to automobile travel."
