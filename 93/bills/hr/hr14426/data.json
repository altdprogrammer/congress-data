Provides for the reimbursement of expenses incurred in travel to, attendance at, and travel from such a series of seminars to those eligible for the seminars. Authorizes each freshman Member to employ an interim staff during the period beginning on the day such freshman Member is declared elected and ending on the first day of the next regular session of the House of Congress to which such freshman Member was elected in the last general election prior to such session. States that the total salaries paid such interim staff during such period shall not exceed one-half the clerk hire allowance to which such freshman Member would be entitled by law if such Member were a Member of the Congress. Authorizes expenditures for stationery in the interim period up to one-tenth of the allowance for a regular session of the Congress."
