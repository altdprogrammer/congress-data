    "text": "National Energy Research and Development Policy Act - States that the purpose of this Act is the development within ten years of the option and the capability for the United States to become energy self-sufficient through the use of domestic energy resources by socially and environmentally acceptable means. Establishes an Energy Research Management Project headed by a Chairman who shall serve as the Staff Director. States that the Management Project shall review the full range of Federal activities in and financial support for fuels and energy research and development, giving consideration to research and development being conducted by industry and other non-Federal entities, to determine the capability of ongoing research efforts to carry out the policies established by this Act and other relevant Federal policies. Directs the Chairman, in consultation with the Management Project, to: (1) identify opportunities to accelerate the commercial applications of new energy technologies by providing Federal assistance for or participation in pilot plants demonstrating technological advances, field demonstrations of new methods and procedures, and demonstrations of prototype commercial applications for the exploration, development, production, transportation, conversion, and utilization of energy resource; and (2) conduct preliminary investigations and to explore potential cooperative agreements which may be entered into with non-Federal entities in order to develop recommendations for Federal participation or assistance in demonstrations of the technical feasibility and economic potential of energy technologies on a prototype or full-scale basis. States that in developing proposals pursuant to this Act, the Chairman shall consider various forms of Federal assistance and participation which may include but are not limited to: (1) joint Federal-industry corporations; (2) Federal assistance through contractual arrangements with non-Federal participants including corporations, consortia, universities, governmental entities, nonprofit institutions; (3) contracts for the construction and operation of Federally owned facilities; (4) Federal purchases or guaranteed price of the products of demonstration plants or activities; and (5) Federal loans to non-Federal entities conducting demonstrations of new technologies. Requires the Chairman within ninety days of enactment of this Act, to promulgate regulations establishing procedures for submitting proposals for the purposes of implementing this Act. Establishes standards for the joint Federal-industry corporations proposed under this Act and sets forth a formula for determining the Federal share of the cost of each such corporation. States that in evaluating proposed opportunities for particular research and development undertakings pursuant to this Act, the Chairman shall assign priority to those undertakings in which the urgency of public need for the potential results of the research, development, or demonstration effort is high, and it is unlikely that similar results would be achieved in a timely manner in the absence of Federal assistance. Provides that all research, development, or demonstration contracted for, sponsored, or cosponsored by the Government pursuant to this Act, shall require as a condition of Federal participation that all information resulting from Federally assisted research shall be made available at the earliest practicable date to the general public, including non-governmental United States interests capable of bringing about further development, utilization, and commercial applications of such results. Authorizes the appropriation of certain specified amounts for the fiscal years 1975 and 1976 to carry out the purposes of this Act."
