Provides that if an eligible individual has reduced income for the computation year and the amount of such income exceeds $3,000, then the tax imposed under the Internal Revenue Code for the computation year shall be the tax which would be imposed on 80 percent of the average base period income, minus five times the decrease in such tax which would result from subtracting 20 percent of reduced income from 80 percent of average base period income."
