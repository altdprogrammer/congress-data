    "text": "Emergency Fuels and Energy Allocation Act - Authorizes the President of the United States to allocate energy and fuels when he determines and declares that extraordinary shortages or dislocations in the distribution of energy and fuels exist or are imminent and that the public health, safety, or welfare is thereby jeopardized. Provides that such authority shall terminate on September 1, 1974. Provides for the delegation of such authority to the Secretary of the Interior or to the head of any other Federal agency. Authorizes the President to allocate or distribute fuels or any form of energy in short supply nationally or in a given region. Directs the Attorney General to investigate the marketing practices of oil companies which have annual gross revenues of more than $1,000,000,000 and to take such steps as may be necessary under any antitrust Acts to insure that the marketing practices of such oil companies are not detrimental to the maintenance of a viable competitive domestic petroleum industry, do not result in a foreclosure to independent marketers of supplies from such oil companies, and do not jeopardize the ability of State and local governments and other public agencies and authorities to obtain necessary supplies of gasoline and other petroleum products. Requires the President to report to the Congress under this Act."
