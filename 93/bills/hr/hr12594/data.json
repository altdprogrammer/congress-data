    "text": "Provides that, in any proceeding relating to licenses or the payment of compensation, awards or royalties under the Atomic Energy Act, the Atomic Energy Commission shall grant a hearing upon the request of any person whose interest may be affected by the proceeding, and shall admit any such person as a party to such proceeding. Provides that in connection with the application for a construction permit, the Commission may divide the proceeding in separate parts covering environmental matters and radiological safety. Enumerates the circumstances under which the Commission may issue an operating license or an amendment to a construction permit or an amendment to an operating license without a hearing, and the exceptions to those circumstances. Provides that the Commission may, upon determination that such action is necessary in the public interest to avoid unnecessary delay, issue an operating license or an amendment to a construction permit or an amendment to an operating license in advance of completion of the hearing involving radiological safety."
