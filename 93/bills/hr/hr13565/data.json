    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act - Declares it to be the policy of Congress to establish a national program of basic and applied research and development of all potentially beneficial energy sources and utilization technologies. Directs the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Agency (upon the creation of such agency) to perform specified duties, including to: (1) aggresively pursue research and development programs in a wide range of non-nuclear energy technologies; (2) develop the technology and information base necessary to support development of the widest possible range of options available for future energy policy decisions; (3) investigate the option of energy self-sufficiency for the United States; and (4) pursue the development of new energy sources in such a way as to encourage the fullest possible private participation. Provides that Federal involvement in energy research, development, and commercial application shall be limited to those areas where there is the least likelihood that the private sector will achieve the desired goal without Federal assistance. Sets forth the priorities to be followed in conducting Federal research and development programs. Provides that in developing proposals pursuant to this Act the Administrator may utilize various forms of Federal assistance and participation including: (1) joint Federal-industry experimental, demonstration, or commercial corporation; (2) contractual agreements or grants to non-Federal participants; (3) contracts for the construction and operation of federally owned facilities; (4) Federal purchases or guaranteed price of the products of demonstration plants or activities; (5) Federal loans to conduct demonstrations of new technologies and (6) incentives to individual inventors. Requires specific congressional approval of joint Federal-industry corporations formed under this Act. Sets forth regulations with respect to the operation of a joint Federal-industry corporation. Sets forth regulations for competitive systems of price supports proposed pursuant to this Act. Sets forth Congressional reporting requirements for the Administrator. Requires the Administrator to report to the President and the Congress within 6 months on his assessment of the impact of existing patent policies on Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) programs and his recommendations for additional legislation. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be deemed to convey to any individual, corporation, or other business organization immunity from civil or criminal liability, or to create defenses to actions, under the antitrust laws. Authorizes and directs the Council on Environmental Quality to carry out a continuing analysis of the conduct of research and development of energy technologies in regard to environmental quality evaluation. Directs the Water Resources Council to undertake assessments of water resource requirements and water supply availability for any energy technology and any probable combinations of energy technologies which are the subject of research and development efforts authorized by this Act. Authorizes the appropriation to the Administrator of such sums as the Congress may authorize for fiscal years 1976-1980. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary in each fiscal year for administration of this Act. Sets limits on the amount of authorized appropriations in connection with demonstration projects and Federal loans under this Act and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974."
