    "text": "Authorizes the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to purchase from one or more life insurance companies a policy or policies of mortgage protection life insurance on a group basis for veterans unable to obtain commercial life insurance at a substandard rate because of a service-connected disability. Sets forth the maximum amount of insurance under a policy provided under this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to deduct insurance premiums from any compensation or other cash benefits payable to veterans by the Veterans' Administration, and to pay such premiums to the insurers. Provides that the United States shall bear all of the cost of the insurance provided under this Act, except the amount of premium rates. States that any amount of insurance in force under this Act on the date of death of an insured veteran shall be paid only to the holder of the mortgage loan on the veteran's home as a credit toward loan indebtedness. Requires each policy purchased under this Act to provide for the following: (1) reinsurance with other insurers which meet the Administrator's criteria; (2) that the Administrator may discontinue a whole policy, or exclude from coverage loans made after a date fixed by him; (3) issuance to each insured veteran of a certificate setting forth the benefits to which he is entitled; (4) any other provisions necessary to carry out this Act; and (5) an annual accounting to the Administrator of the amount of premiums paid, the total of all mortality and other claim charges incurred, and the amount of the insurer's expenses and risk charges. States that insurance under this Act shall terminate upon whichever of the following events first occurs: (1) satisfaction of the veteran's indebtedness under the loan upon which the insurance is based; (2) the veteran's 70th birthday; (3) termination of the veteran's ownership of the property securing the loan; (4) discontinuance of payment of premiums by the veteran; or (5) discontinuance of the entire contract or agreement. (Adds 38 U.S.C. 791-95)"
