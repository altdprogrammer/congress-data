Defines the term \"improvements\". States that the Secretary may grant to the applicant all or part of the money applied for, except that no grant or aggregate of grants made under this Act to any State, local, or interstate agency or public port authority may exceed $1,000,000. Authorizes appropriations of $30,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 and each fiscal year thereafter for grants under this Act. Directs the Secretary to undertake a comprehensive study to determine the immediate and long-range requirements of public ports in the United States: (1) for expansion and modernization in order to meet adequately the economic and defense needs of the United States; and (2) to meet such standards as may be imposed by law for purposes of environmental protection and port safety and security. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress the final results of such study not later than one year after the effective date of this Act. Authorizes appropriations of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 and $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1976 for purposes of conducting the study."
