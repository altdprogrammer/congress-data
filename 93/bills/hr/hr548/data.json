Provides that the mails may not be used to make a sale, delivery, or distribution, of any obscene matter. Sets forth a definition of obscene matter for purposes of this Act. States that any person who mails, or causes to be mailed, any potentially offensive sexual material to any addressee, who has not expressly requested receipt of such material from the sender, shall place on the envelope or other wrapping or cover under which such material is mailed a symbol which the Postal Service shall prescribe. Provides that any person who receives mail bearing such symbol and who does not wish to open such mail may either destroy it, or mark it \"refused\" and return it to the post office. Requires the Postal Service to devise and implement procedures to prevent the delivery of mail bearing the symbol required by this Act to any person who notifies the Postal Service that he does not wish to receive unsolicited mailings of potentially offensive sexual material."
