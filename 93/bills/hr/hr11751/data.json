States the order of precedence for the payment of the gratuity to dependents. Excludes the payment of benefits if death was caused intentionally or by intentional misconduct or by an individual who would otherwise be entitled to the death benefits. Authorizes the appropriation in each fiscal year of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
