States that, if such estimate is less than 90 percent of the amount which the Department of Agriculture had originally planned to deliver to schools, the Secretary shall pay to State educational agencies by no later than April 15, 1973, an amount of funds equal to the difference between the initial estimate and the amount to be delivered during fiscal year 1973, as determined on March 15, 1973. Requires this amount to be distributed to the States according to their ratio of meals served during fiscal year 1972 under the National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. Provides for a withholding of funds for programs in nonprofit, private schools in any State in which the Secretary is directly administering the program. Authorizes the Secretary to provide additional funds for school lunch and breakfast programs from funds appropriated for surplus food removal and price support programs. Provides that funds distributed under this Act shall not be subject to the State matching requirements for school lunch programs. (Amends 42 U.S.C. 1755)"
