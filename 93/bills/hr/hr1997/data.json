Entitles any person who acquires rehabilitated or restored rental housing from a taxpayer who elected the amortization deduction and who did not discontinue the amortization deduction, to a deduction with respect to the adjusted basis of such facility based on the remaining amount of the 60 month period taken by the person who rehabilitated the house.
