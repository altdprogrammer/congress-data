    "text": "Public Records Act - Defines the terms used in this Act, including \"public record\". States that every public record is the property of the United States. Provides that, except as otherwise provided by law, the President or Vice President may destroy or cause to be destroyed any public record in his custody within thirty days after he prepares or receives it, if such record was received, held, prepared, or originated by or for him. States that after an individual ceases to hold the office of President or Vice President, the Administrator of General Services shall take custody of the existing public records received, held, prepared, or originated during the period when such individual held office, except that the successor to the office held by the individual shall retain temporary custody of such records as the successor certifies to be necessary in the performance of his duties. Provides for the preservation of public records by the Administrator in the National Archives. States that the President or Vice President or the executor or administrator of his estate may impose restrictions on public access to any public record obtained from him by the Administrator under this Act for a period of not more than five years from the date on which the President or Vice President, as the case may be, ceases to hold such office. States that any such restriction shall not be effective to deny access to any public record pursuant to any legally authorized demand or order of any court or any duly constituted body of Congress. States that, notwithstanding any other provision of law or any agreement entered into by the United States, the Administrator of General Services shall obtain or retain, as the case may be, custody of all existing public records received, held, prepared, or originated during the period beginning January 20, 1969, and ending on August 9, 1974."
