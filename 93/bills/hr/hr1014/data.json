    "text": "Toxic Substances Control Act - Asserts that adequate authority should exist to restrict the distribution and use of chemicals found to be toxic and hazardous consumer products. Provides that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall for various classes and uses of chemical substances prescribe by regulation standards for test protocols and for the manner in which results from tests conducted and evaluated as are necessary to protect the health and the environment. Provides that for any chemical substance produced in commercial quantities, after evaluating all information available to him, and after referring the matter to a committee of the Toxic Substances Board, the Administrator may publish proposed regulations to: (1) restrict or prohibit the use of distribution of the chemical substance as necessary to protect health and the environment; (2) require that any or all persons engaged in the distribution of the substance so regulated give notification to purchasers of the restriction; and (3) require such other action as necessary to carry out such restrictions including prohibiting or restricting the scale, use, or removal of such substance or product. Provides for objections to the Administrator's regulations by any person who is adversely affected, and allows such person to request a public hearing, which may be held after due notice. Provides that as soon as practicable after receipt of objections, comments, and the hearing, if such hearing was held, the Administrator shall make public an order affirming, modifying, or withdrawing the initial order or regulation. Provides that such new order shall be accompanied by detailed explanations for accepting or rejecting all or part of the evidence submitted by the manufacturer or processor and other interested persons. Allows a person who is adversely affected to petition for judicial review of the Administrator's orders in the United States Court of Appeals, whose judgement is subject to review by the Supreme Court. Provides that the Administrator shall by regulation require each manufacturer of chemical substances to report to him for entry into the National Registry of Chemical Substances: (1) the name of each chemical substance produced by the manufacturer; (2) the chemical structure of each substance; (3) the catagories of use of each such substance; (4) reasonable estimates of the amounts of each substance to be produced for each such catagory of use; (5) a description of the byproducts resulting from the production of each such substance and from the use thereof; and (6) the results of any tests on the health or environmental effects of any such substance or its byproducts which have been performed by or at the instance of the manufacturer or such results as are otherwise known to him. Provides that the manufacturer shall state the probable termination date of testing and evaluating substances for safe handling, a desired target date for commencing production, as well as a statement on how critical the substance is to the manufacturer's operation. Provides for the establishment of a National Registry of Chemical Substances. Provides that, among other things, such Registry shall contain data on chemical substances which were mass-produced prior to the time that the provisions of this Act went into force, but which were not previously tested for environmental or health impact. Provides that the authority of the Administrator shall not apply to: (1) economic poisons subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and chemical substances used solely in such poisons; (2) foods, drugs, and cosmetics subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, the Federal Meat Inspection Act, and the Poultry Products Inspection Act; and (3) any source material, special nuclear material, or byproduct material, as defined in the Atomic Energy Commission Act. Provides that within two years of enactment of this Act the standards for test protocols issued by the Administrator shall be considered minimum standards for all Federal departments charged with testing substances for human health or environmental impact. Provides for the establishment of the Toxic Substances Control Board. Provides that the Administrator shall consult such Board on proposed regulations and before taking action on such regulations to prohibit or restrict the sale, use, or removal of substances under this Act. Provides that the Administrator is authorized to conduct such research and monitoring, and revise research laboratory standards as are necessary to carry out his functions under this Act. Provides for sharing by the Federal Government of the cost of additional testing of each chemical substance with respect to its safety for man and the environment. Authorizes the Administrator, for the purpose of inspecting, copying, and verifying laboratory standards, the correctness of records, reports, or other documents required to be kept or made under this Act and otherwise facilitating the carrying out of his functions under this Act, to enter any factory, warehouse, or premises in which chemical substances are manufactured, processed, tested, or held and to conduct an administrative inspection thereof. Authorizes the Administrator to prohibit the export and the Secretary of the Treasury to prohibit the import of such restricted substances out of and into the United States. Provides that trade screts and commercial or financial information obtained from any manufacturer or processor under this Act shall be confidential. Provides that any person who willfully violates such prohibitions shall on conviction be fined not more than $25,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. Provides that any person who violates such prohibitions shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 for each day of violation. Authorizes necessary appropriations for the purposes and administration of this Act."
