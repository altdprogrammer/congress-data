    "text": "Provides that the project for the Sandridge Dam and Reservoir, Ellicott Creek, New York, for flood protection and other purposes, be modified to authorize the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to undertake minor channel improvements, independently of the investigation of alternative methods called for by the Flood Control Act of 1970. Makes such work subject to the items of local cooperation required for similar projects and such work to be limited to areas downstream from Maple Road in the town of Amherst, New York, and such other areas as may be deemed necessary. Provides that this authorization is for interim protection and remedial type action only, and is not intended to adversely affect any further alternatives to the Sandridge Dam."
