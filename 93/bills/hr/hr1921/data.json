Provides that a tax payment on tread rubber used in further manufacturing shall be considered an overpayment if the rubber is sold, in connection with any other article produced, to a State or local government, nonprofit educational organization or used for supplies for vessels or aircraft. Requires the credit or refund, in the case of a new tire the sale of which is later adjusted as the result of a warranty or guaranty, to be in proportion to the adjustment in the sales price of such tire. (Amends 26 U.S.C. 6416(b))"
