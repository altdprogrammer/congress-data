Requires each oil company which presently owns or controls any coal or uranium asset to file a report with the Attorney General within 120 days of enactment. Authorizes the Attorney General to seek injunctive relief in the appropriate district court for violations of this Act, and prescribes penalties for such violations. States that a violation of this Act by a corporation shall be deemed to be also a violation by the individual directors, officers, receivers, trustees, or agents of such corporation who shall have authorized or done any of the acts constituting the violation in whole or in part.
