Imposes an embargo upon shipment of the following: (1) certain agricultural products; (2) all medical and pharmaceutical supplies; and (3) certain industrial and manufactured products . States that the restrictions herein described shall be imposed upon the described goods and materials to the following nations: Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Algeria, and Qatar. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to monitor all shipments of goods and materials herein described to all nations to determine which nations, if any, are aiding in any evasion or mitigation of the effects of this embargo by funneling restricted goods and materials to the Arab nations listed in this Act. Directs the Secretary to prepare and submit to Congress continuing reports on such activities with recommendations of what further trade embargos would be necessary to eliminate or minimize such activity. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as are necessary to place into effect and maintain such trade restrictions."
