Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from granting to any Federal, State, or local agency or to any private individual or organization any right-of-way, easement, or reservation in, over, across, through, or under any area within the system unless the grantee pays to the Secretary the fair market value of the right-of-way, easement, or reservation. Provides that all sums received by the Secretary pursuant to these provisions shall, after necessary administration expenses incurred by him, be deposited into the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund and shall be available to carry out the provisions for land acquisition of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act, and the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act. Provides that any request for permission to use an area within the National Wildlife Refuge System which was filed with the Secretary of the Interior on which the Secretary has not taken final action before such date of enactment shall be treated by the Secretary as having been filed with him. Provides that this Act shall apply with respect to any right-of-way, easement, or reservation granted by the Secretary of the Interior on or after the date of the enactment of this Act, including any right-of-way, easement, or reservation granted on or after such date in connection with any use permitted by him under this Act. Requires that funds remaining in the Refuge Revenue Sharing Fund at the end of each fiscal year be transferred to the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund and thereby made available for land acquisition in accordance with the provisions of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act."
