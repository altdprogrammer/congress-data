    "text": "Provides, under the Controlled Substances Act, that any person who is not himself an addict and who violates the Act by knowingly or intentionally distributing, or possessing with intent to distribute, heroin to a person twenty-one years of age or older shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twenty years. Provides that such distribution by such a person to a person under twenty-one years of age shall invoke a term of imprisonment of thirty years. Provides that in the case of either of the above sentences imposed, imposition or execution of such sentence shall not be suspended, probation shall not be granted, and, in the case of an alien, deportation shall not be allowed in lieu of such sentence. Provides that a judicial officer may order pretrial detention of a person charged with such unlawful distribution or possession with intent to distribute such heroin, after a hearing and finding: (1) that there is substantial probability of such person's guilt; (2) that there is no condition or combination of conditions of release which will reasonably assure the safety of any other person or the community; and (3) that such person is not himself an addict. Sets forth the procedure by which such pretrial detention hearing shall be conducted."
