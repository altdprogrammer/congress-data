    "text": "Energy Independence Act - Title I: Energy Research and Development Administration - Establishes an independent executive agency to be known as the Energy Research and Development Administration, administered by an Administrator, Deputy Administrator and five Assistant Administrators, one of whom shall be responsible for fossil energy, another for nuclear energy, another for environment, safety, and conservation, another for research and advanced energy systems, and another for national security. States that the responsibilities of the Administrator shall include, but not be limited to: (1) exercising responsibility for policy planning coordination, support, and management of research and development programs respecting all energy sources, including assessing the requirements for research and development in regard to various energy sources in relation to near-term or long-range needs, policy planning in regard to meeting those requirements, undertaking programs for the optimal development of the various forms of energy sources, managing such programs, and disseminating information resulting therefrom; (2) providing Federal grants or loan guarantees to, or make contracts with, any public or private agency, institution, organization, corporation, or individual for payment of the cost of programs to develop economical, commercially feasible sources of energy and the cost of any other activity which is necessary or appropriate. Transfers to the Administrator all functions of the Atomic Energy Commission, the Chairman and members of the Commission, and the officers and components of the Commission, except as provided in this Act. Transfers to the Administrator specified functions of the Secretary of the Interior, the National Science Foundation, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Requires that, within six months from the date of enactment of the Act, the Administrator shall transmit to the Congress his recommendations for an aggressive Federal research strategy and priorities designed to achieve solutions to immediate and short-term energy supply system and associated environmental problems. Directs the Administrator, within one year from the date of enactment, to transmit his recommendations for an aggressive Federal research strategy and priorities designed to achieve solutions to middle-term (to 1990) energy supply system and associated environmental problems. Directs the Administrator, within eighteen months from the date of enactment, to transmit his recommendations for a Federal research strategy and priorities designed to achieve solutions to long-term (beyond 1990) energy supply systems and associated environmental problems; within six months to transmit his recommendations for an aggressive Federal research strategy and priorities designed to achieve solutions for the conservation of present and future energy supplies; and within six months to transmit his recommendations for a progressive annual schedule for new energy source development which will, by 1980, reduce our dependence on energy imports to no more than 1 percent of our total energy needs. Title II: Nuclear Energy Commission - Renames the Atomic Energy Commission the Nuclear Energy Commission and directs it to continue licensing and related regulatory functions. Title III: Miscellaneous and Transitional Provisions - Provides that nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to limit, curtail, abolish, or terminate any function of the President which he had immediately before the effective date of this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of sums necessary to carry out this Act."
