    "text": "Speedy Trial Act - Title I: Speedy Trial in United States Courts - Provides that the trial of a defendant charged with an offense against the United States shall be commenced within sixty days from the date the defendant is arrested or a summons is issued. Provides that certain necessary delays shall be excluded from the above provision, including periods resulting from defendants absence, the need for a competency hearing, the necessity for proper hearing and disposition of pretrial motions, and a continuance granted at the request of the defendant or the United States attorney upon a showing of good cause. Provides that if a defendant, through no fault of his own or his counsel, is not brought to trial as required by this Act, the information or indictment shall be dismissed on motion of the defendant or on the court's own motion. Provides for a delay of six months in the effective date of this Act for courts with extreme backlogs. Provides that the Supreme Court of the United States and the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules shall review the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the United States Code, where relevant, and report to the Congress by December 30, 1973, on changes in the Federal Rules and the Code which will speed the time from arrest or charge to trial and retain the substantive protections guaranteed to individual defendants by the Constitution. Title II: Speedy Trial in State Courts - Provides that no State shall receive any funds under this title if the Administrator of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration finds that such State has not adopted a rule of law that any trial arising out of any arrests, indictments, or informations shall be commenced within sixty days of the defendant's arrest or summons, or charge by indictment or information, whichever is earlier, and that, if such trial is not so commenced, the charges against the defendant arising out of such arrest, indictment, or information shall be dismissed with prejudice. Provides that, in the case of a State's inability to meet such requirements, the Administrator may grant an extension of the applicable date of the eligibility requirement, not to exceed a total of two additional years, if he finds that the State or locality has been making a good faith effort to comply with such requirements. Provides that the Administrator is authorized to establish model timetables, provide technical assistance, disseminate information, and generally aid States in planning to comply with the eligibility requirements of this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated $10,000,000 annually for such purpose. Title III: Pretrial Services Officers - Provides that any court having original jurisdiction to try offenses against the United States may appoint one or more suitable persons to serve as pretrial services officers who shall also serve as probation officers and shall have the full range of duties of probation officers. Provides that the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall have general supervisory powers over such pretrial services officers, including the duty to annually report on their effectiveness and to recommend necessary modification of the program."
