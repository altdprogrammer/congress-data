    "text": "Presidential Protection Act - States that Federal departments and agencies shall assist the United States Secret Service by: (1) providing, without reimbursement, personnel, equipment, or facilities on a temporary basis for a period not to exceed two weeks at any one location in any one year; (2) providing such facilities, equipment, and services as are required by the United States Secret Service to secure no more than one property not in Government ownership or control, such property having been designated by a President, President-elect, former President, or any other person entitled to protection; and (3) providing such facilities, equipment, and services, as are required by the United States Secret Service to secure any other property not in Government ownership or control to the extent that such expenditures do not cumulatively exceed $5,000 at any one property owned, leased, occupied, or otherwise utilized by persons entitled to protection by the Secret Service. Provides that no payments shall be made pursuant to this Act for services, equipment, or facilities ordered, purchased, leased, or otherwise procured by persons other than officers or employees of the Federal Government duly authorized by the Director of the United States Secret Service to make such procurements. Stipulates that all improvements and other items acquired pursuant to his Act shall remain the property of the Federal Government and shall be removed at the termination of the protective responsibility of the United States Secret Service unless it is economically unfeasible, as determined by the United States Secret Service, to do so. Requires every department and agency, including the Executive Office of the President making expenditures pursuant to this Act shall transmit a detailed report of such expenditures to the Committee on Appropriations and Committees on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Senate on April 30 and September 30 of each year."
