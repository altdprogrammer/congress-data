    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) National Energy Conservation Act - Expresses the findings of Congress and declares that it is the policy of the United States to establish a comprehensive program of energy conservation to achieve, by 1978, a national rate of growth of energy use of not more than two percent per year. Specifies the elements comprising such energy conservation program including the recovery of energy and national resources from industrial, urban, and agricultural wastes. Directs the chief executive of each agency and regulatory body of the United States to investigate, identify, and develop specified energy management factors and report to the Council on Energy Policy. Establishes in the Executive Office of the President a Council on Energy Policy to serve as the principal adviser to the President. Enumerates the powers, functions, and duties of the Council, including: (1) to transmit, within six months, a report to the President and the Congress setting forth proposed legislation necessary to achieve the purposes of this Act; and (2) to prepare annual reports on the progress of this Act, specifying in detail the content of such reports, including estimates, trends, evaluations, and recommendations on the energy resources of the United States. Authorizes to be appropriated for fiscal year 1975 $1,000,000; and for fiscal year 1976 $2,000,000 to carry out the purposes of this Act."
