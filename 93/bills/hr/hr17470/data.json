Directs the Board to perform specified functions, including to: (1) determine, at periodic intervals, what agricultural commodities are available for export from the United States, taking into account such factors as domestic need and carryover reserves; and (2) determine, as necessary, a domestic price level for each such commodity which may be exported above which an allocation system for end use buyers in foreign countries shall be imposed by the Board. Sets forth provisions governing the membership of the Board."
