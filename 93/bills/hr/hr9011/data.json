Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make grants from the funds of Acts authorizing appropriations for the administration of Indian affairs upon mutually agreeable terms which will accomplish the general purposes for which the funds were appropriated. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to tribes under this Act for: (1) strenghtening tribal development; (2) developing natural resources, and constructing community facilities and other public works; (3) economic development, employment assistance, work experience, and job training, including youth programs; and (4) land acquisition in connection with the above purposes. Sets forth provisions governing grants under this Act. Requires records, audits, and reports of funds appropriated under this Act. Provides for the reduction or termination of funds granted to a tribe for failure to comply with the provisions of this Act, and authorizes judicial review of a final order. Requires laborers on construction assisted under this Act to be paid wages at prevailing rates. Authorizes the payment of relocation costs for those displaced by development activities under this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as necessary to carry out this Act."
