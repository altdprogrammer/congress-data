    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Emergency Jobs and Unemployment Assistance Act - =Title I: Public Service Employment= - Authorizes appropriation of $2,500,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 to carry out this Act. Directs the Secretary of Labor to enter into arrangements with eligible appliants to provide financial assistance in providing transitional employment in public service jobs, and training and manpower services related to such employment. Requires that 90 percent of funds to applicants be used for wages and employment benefits to persons employed in public service jobs under this Act. Requires preference to unemployed persons who have exhausted their benefits, those who are ineligible for such benefits, and those unemployed for 15 or more weeks. Sets forth a formula for allotment of funds to areas of unemployment. Sets forth provisions for areas of excessively high unemployment (above 7 percent) and to expand job opportunities. Allows prime sponsors, under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973, to use funds obligated for public service employment for projects planned to extend over a 12-month period. Disallows a requirement that applicants place a proportion of public service jobholders in other jobs. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to recommend to prime sponsors an aim of maintaining a nationwide average in federally supported wage rates per public service jobholder of $7,800. Establishes an outreach program and public information program designed to produce jobs and job training opportunities for specified veterans, and to inform them about jobs, job training, and educational opportunities under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973. Requires that such program also inform employers, labor unions, contractors, Federal agencies, and educational institutions of their responsibilities under such Act. =Title II: Special Unemployment Assistance Program= - Provides for the payment to each State, which enters into a specified agreement with the Secretary of Labor of such amounts as are deemed necessary by the Secretary to carry out the provisions of this title in the State. Sets forth a schedule whereunder eligible individuals may receive a payment of assistance or waiting period credit based upon a week of unemployment. Sets a special unemployment assistance period under this title. Sets forth a schedule for determining the weekly benefit amount payable under this title. Sets a limit on the program duration under this title. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out this title. =Title III: Job Opportunities Program= - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to provide financial assistance to Federal programs and projects identified through a specified review process. Requires that funds allocated under this title be for programs which the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor jointly determine will contribute significantly to the reduction of unemployment; can be initiated promptly; and can be largely completed within 12 months. Requires Federal agencies and regional commissions established under the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 or pursuant to this Act to review their budgets and plans; evaluate the job creation effectiveness of such plans; and to submit to the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor recommendations for programs with potential for creating jobs. Authorizes to be appropriated $500,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 to carry out the provisions of this title, except that no further obligation of funds appropriated under this title may be made subsequent to a determination that the average rate of unemployment has receded below 6.5 per cent for three consecutive calendar months as determined by the Secretary of Labor."
