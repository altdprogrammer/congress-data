    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to carry out ten maintenance demonstration projects at locations to be determined in order to demonstrate the benefits of eliminating safety hazards through the proper maintenance of highways. Stipulates that each project shall be for highways which are on a Federal-aid system, other than the Interstate System, and that the total mileage of all projects shall not exceed five hundred lane-miles. States that such projects shall be selected so as to demonstrate proper maintenance techniques with respect to various classes of highways, various types of pavements, bases and subbases, and various locations having differing terrain and climatic conditions. Requires the Secretary, together with the State highway department, to establish standards for the projects, including: (1) periodic inspections by the Secretary; (2) test control sites for comparisons; and (3) appropriate recordkeeping requirements. Provides for an annual report to Congress by the Secretary, and authorizes appropriations of $20,000,000 to carry out this Act. (Adds 23 U.S.C. 405)"
