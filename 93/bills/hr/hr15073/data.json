States that an action in a court of the United States seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the United States or that the United States is an indispensable party. Establishes procedures for the enforcement of grants-in-aid to be followed by each agency which is authorized to make or administer such grants."
