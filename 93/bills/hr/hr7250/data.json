    "text": "Provides that under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 no person shall be denied the equal right to rent, purchase, finance (through mortgage or otherwise), or insure a dwelling on account of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, national origin, or, if an adult, age. States that any person who is denied a right in violation of this Act shall be entitled to damages and all other appropriate legal and equitable relief. Provides that whenever the Attorney General receives a complaint in writing signed by an individual to the effect that such person is being denied a right in violation of this Act, and the Attorney General believes the complaint is meritorious and certifies that the signer of such complaint is unable, in his judgment, to initiate and maintain appropriate legal proceedings for relief, and that the institution of an action will materially further the purposes of this Act, the Attorney General is authorized to institute for or in the name of the United States a civil action in any appropriate district court of the United States against such parties and for such relief as may be appropriate."
