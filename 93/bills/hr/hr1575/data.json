Provides that whoever knowingly introduces such a knife into interstate commerce shall be fined not more than $2,000 and/or imprisoned not more than five years. Asserts that all knives which open automatically and which have a blade of more than three inches in length are nonmailable unless the knives are to be used by the members of the Armed Forces in the performance of their duties. Allows the Postmaster General to require any person proposing to mail such knife to explain in writing that the mailing of such knife shall not violate the provisions of this Act. (Adds 18 U.S.C. 2331-2353)"
