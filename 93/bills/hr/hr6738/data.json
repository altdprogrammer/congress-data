Reduces the term of office of the Comptroller General and his Deputy from fifteen years to five years. Sets forth the functions of the Office of Budget and Expenditure Oversight. Sets forth requirements for any officer or employee of the United States, including the President, regarding the impoundment of any appropriation. Requires the head of each department and establishment in the executive to submit to the Office of Budget and Expenditure Oversight a duplicate copy of all legislative and budgetary requests submitted by him to the Office of Management and Budget.
