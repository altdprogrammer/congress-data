Authorizes, to be appropriated for carrying out the provisions of this Act, $135,000,000 for fiscal year 1974, and for each succeeding fiscal year prior to July 1, 1977; and further authorizes to be appropriated such additional sums as the Congress may determine. Sets forth the definitions of terms used in this Act. States that funds available for grants shall be used for: (1) the establishment of bilingual education programs; (2) planning and providing technical assistance for such programs; (3) training designed to prepare persons to participate in such programs; and (4) auxiliary community activities designed to facilitate the implementation of a program. Specifies the requirements which an application for a grant must meet for approval. States that for carrying out programs for individuals on reservations serviced by elementary and secondary schools operated for Indian children, a nonprofit organization of the Indian tribe which operates any such school may be considered to be a local educational agency for purposes of this Act. Establishes in the Office of Education a Division of Bilingual Education through which the Commissioner shall carry out his responsibilities relating to bilingual education and headed by a Director of Bilingual Education. Requires the Director to prepare and submit to the Congress and the President an annual report on the condition of bilingual education in the Nation. Specifies the items to be included in such report. Establishes a National Advisory Council on Bilingual Education to be composed of fifteen members, to advise the Commissioner in the preparation of general regulations and with respect to policy matters arising in the administration of this Act. Directs the National Institute of Education to carry out a program of research in the field of bilingual education in order to assist local educational agencies in planning and operating effective programs of bilingual education."
