States that such amortization deduction shall be an amount equal to the amortizable basis at the end of each month divided by the number of months remaining in the period. Provides that a taxpayer who has elected to take the amortization deduction may, at any time after making such election, discontinue the amortization deduction with respect to the remainder of the amortization period. Prescribes the procedures for such termination. Defines the terms used in this Act, including \"certified historic structure\" and \"certified rehabilitation\"."
