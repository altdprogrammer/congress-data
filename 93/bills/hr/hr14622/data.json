Provides that no individual shall pay a tax of less than 20 percent by reason of a tax exemption. States that a tax is imposed on each individual's income equal to 20 percent of the amount by which the sum of the items of tax preference exceed $12,000. Repeals the provisions on tax carry over. Allows a taxpayer to waive a deduction from gross income which is tax preference. Provides that such waived amount shall not be taken into account in figuring the minimum tax for tax preferences."
