    "text": "Rural Health Service Act - Increases to $3000 per year the amount in loans which may be granted under the Public Health Service Act to a student of medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, pharmacy, podiatry, optometry or veterinary medicine if such student is from a rural area and indicates an intention to practice his profession in a rural area. Provides for the cancellation of the entire amount of interest and loans made to physicians, dentists or optometrists at the rate of 33 1/3 percent of the total of such loans plus accrued interest for each fiscal year of practice in a rural area. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as are necessary to carry out the Act. Extends the authorization for appropriation to fiscal year 1978 for funds to enable those students who begin school before July 1, 1977, to continue their education. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to make grants or enter into contracts with public or nonprofit agencies or organizations for special projects relating to the expansion and delivery of health care in rural areas. Authorizes appropriations for such grants and contracts. Allows the Secretary to make grants to State health planning agencies to enable them to conduct special surveys of rural health needs in their States and to develop plans for meeting such needs. Specifies that such surveys will be designed to determine the various types of health personnel required and other relevant needs for such rural areas. Authorizes appropriations for such surveys. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to, or enter into contracts with State or local educational agencies or other agencies for the purpose of: (1) identifying rural area residents with a potential for health professions training and encouraging such training; (2) publicizing sources of financial aid available to those undertaking such training; and (3) establishing programs to facilitate enrollment in certain health professions schools by rural residents with a potential for training. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to schools of the health professions or of the allied health professions to assist in meeting staffing and operation expenses in enrolling students under the Rural Incentive Program. Prescribes the amounts of such grants on the basis of the number of students in each school and the individual financial need of each school."
