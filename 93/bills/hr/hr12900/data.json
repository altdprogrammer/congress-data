    "text": "Establishes a New Energy Sources Corporation. Provides that it shall be the function of the Corporation to select, the two most technically and economically feasible methods for manufacturing substitute natural gas from coal. Authorizes the Corporation to construct and operate a demonstration-type facility for each such method selected. States that if the Corporation determines that a method so demonstrated is technically and economically feasible on a commercial scale, the Corporation is authorized to construct and operate a full-scale, commercial-size facility to manufacture substitute natural gas from coal by such method. Makes it the funciton of the Corporation to evaluate proposed methods of development of oil shale and select at least two of the most feasible methods from a technical, economical, and environmental standpoint for manufacturing petroleum products from shale. Authorizes the Corporation to construct and operate demonstration-type facilities for underground mining techniques for restoring processes, for in situ processes, or for any other method deemed feasible to develop the oil shale resource. Authorizes the Department of the Interior to make availabe to the Corporation, any public domain lands presently withdrawn and known to be valuable for oil shale deposits. Makes it the function of the Corporation to select from the proposed methods of development of geothermal steam at least two of the most feasible methods to: (1) develop the technology of power generation from geothermal resources; and (2) develop the technology of by-product recovery. Authorizes the Corporation to construct and operate demonstration-type facilities to develop the resource. Directs the Corporation to evaluate proposed methods for the development of a synthetic crude from tar sands and select at least two of the methods for manufacturing petroleum products from tar sands. Authorizes the Corporation to construct and operate demonstration-type facilities to mine and extract (by either aboveground or in situ methods) the tar sand resources. Requires the Corporation to evaluate methods for the utilization of solar energy when such processes have reached the stage of development that they are ready to be demonstrated. Authorizes the Corporation to construct and operate such demonstration-type facilities that are required to prove the technical and economic feasibility of the processes selected. Provides that where Federal lands are required, the Department of the Interior is authorized to make available any public lands needed in carrying out the purposes of this Act. Requires the Corporation to make annual reports available to interested parties on the progress of its operations. Requires such reports to be in sufficient detail so that independent engineering and economic judgments can be made based on such reports. Authorizes an appropriation of $10,000,000 for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1973, to permit initial organization of the Corporation, and for each of the five succeeding fiscal years, such sums as may be necessary."
