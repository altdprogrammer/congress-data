States that the Congress finds it to be fitting and appropriate to provide the Indian tribes with certain powers of self-determination that are necessary to enable such tribes to carry out the effective development and operation of their lands. Grants the governing body of an Indian tribe with enumerated powers to carry out the purposes of this Act."
