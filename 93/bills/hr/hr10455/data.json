Charges the Assistant Secretary with all authority in the administration of the functions of such Bureau which are delegated to him or conferred on him by the Secretary of State in the areas of human rights, assistance for refugees, people migrating across international boundaries, and victims of natural disasters and of wars occurring outside the United States. Declares it to be the policy of the United States Government to terminate all military assistance and sales to any government committing serious violations of human rights, and to suspend any economic assistance directly supportive of the government committing such violations. Defines fundamental human rights as follows: (1) all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights; (2) everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person; and (3) no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\". Makes it the policy of the United States Government henceforth to suspend any economic assistance which is utilized by the government concerned in a discriminatory manner in violation of the principles set forth in article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations."
