    "date": "1974-03-11", 
    "text": "Environmental and Energy Supply Coordination Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to provide for a means to assist in meeting the essential needs of the United States for fuels, in a manner which is consistent, to the fullest extent practicable, with existing national commitments to protect and improve the environment. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, for any period beginning on or after the date of enactment of this Act and ending on or before November 1, 1974, to temporarily suspend any stationary source fuel or emission limitation under the Clean Air Act as it applies to any person, if the Administrator finds that such person will be unable to comply with such limitation during such period solely because of unavailability of types or amounts of fuels. Provides that any such suspension under this Act shall be conditioned upon compliance with such interim requirements as the Administrator determines are reasonable and practicable. Requires that such interim requirements shall include, but need not be limited to: (1) a requirement that the source receiving the suspension comply with such reporting requirements as the Administrator determines may be necessary; (2) such measures as the Administrator determines are necessary to avoid an imminent and substantial endangerment to health of persons; and (3) requirements that the suspension shall be inapplicable during any period during which fuels which would enable compliance with the suspended stationary source fuel or emission limitations are in fact reasonably available to that person (as determined by the Administrator). Provides for authorization of coal use by specified fuel-burning stationary sources which have converted to, or begun a conversion to, coal use, upon a plant-by-plant basis. Authorizes the Administrator to establish priorities under which manufacturers of continuous emission reduction systems shall provide such systems to users thereof, if he finds that priorities must be imposed in order to assure that such systems are first provided to users in air quality control regions with the most severe air pollution. Directs the Administrator to study, and report to Congress not later than May 31, 1974, with respect to: (1) the present and projected impact on the program under this Act of fuel shortages and of allocation and end-use allocation programs; (2) availability of continuous emission reduction technology (including projections respecting the time, cost, and number of units available) and the effects that continuous emission reduction systems would have on the total environment and on supplies of fuel and electricity; (3) the number of sources and locations which must use such technology based on projected fuel availability data; (4) priority schedule for implementation of continuous emission reduction technology, based on public health or air quality; (5) evaluation of availability of technology to burn municipal solid waste in these sources; and (6) projections of air quality impact of fuel shortages and allocations. Authorizes the appropriation of $3,500,000 for a study of the health effects of emissions of sulphur oxides to the air resulting from specified conversions to coal use. Directs the Federal Power Commission to issue a Presidential permit pursuant to Executive Order 10485 of September 3, 1953, for the construction, operation, maintenance, and connection of facilities for the transmission of electric energy at the borders of the United States without preparing an environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for facilities for the transmission of electric energy between Canada and the United States in the vicinity of Fort Covington, New York. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Energy Office to conduct a study on potential methods of energy conservation and, not later than six months after the date of enactment of this Act, to submit to Congress a report on the results of such study. Requires that, within ninety days of the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation, after consultation with the Federal Energy Office Administrator, shall submit to the Congress for appropriate action an \"Emergency Mass Transportation Assistance Plan\" for the purpose of conserving energy by expanding and improving public mass transportation systems and encouraging increased ridership. Directs the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Federal Energy Office Administrator, to make an investigation and study for the purpose of conserving energy and assuring that the essential fuel needs of the United States will be met by developing a high-speed ground transportation system between the cities of Tijuana in the State of Baja California, Mexico, and Vancouver in the Province of British Columbia, Canada, by way of the cities of Seattle in the State of Washington, Portland in the State of Oregon, and Sacramento, San Francisco, Fresno, Los Angeles, and San Diego in the State of California. Directs the Administrator and the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a joint study, and to report to the Commitee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the United States House of Representatives and the Committees on Public Works and Commerce of the United States Senate within one hundred and twenty days following the date of enactment of this section, concerning the practicability of establishing a fuel economy improvement standard of 20 percent for new motor vehicles manufactured during and after model year 1980. Requires such study and report to include, but not be limited to: (1) the technological problems of meeting any such standard, including the leadtime involved; (2) the test procedures required to determine compliance; the economic costs associated with such standards, including any beneficial economic impact; (3) the various means of enforcing such standard; (4) the effect on comsumption of natural resources, including energy consumed; and (5) the impact of applicable safety and emission standards. Directs that, in the course of performing such study, the Administrator and the Secretary of Transportation shall utilize the research previously performed in the Department of Transportation, and the Administrator and the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of the Federal Energy Office, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, and the Secretary of the Treasury. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Energy Office to, by order, after balancing on a plant-by-plant basis the environmental effects of use of coal against the need to fulfill the purposes of this Act, prohibit, as its primary energy source, the burning of natural gas or petroleum products by any major fuel-burning installation (including any existing electric powerplant) which, on the date of enactment of this Act, has the capability and necessary plant equipment to burn coal. Provides that any installation to which such an order applies shall be permitted to continue to use coal or coal byproducts as provided under the Clean Air Act. Provides for both civil and criminal penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act."
