    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Fair Labor Standards Amendments - Increases the minimum wage rate for employees covered before 1966 to not less than $2 per hour for the period ending June 30, 1974, and not less than $2.20 per hour thereafter. Increases, in graduated increments, the minimum wage rate for (1) nonagricultural employees; (2) agricultural employees; and (3) specified employees in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Provides for special industry committees in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands which can adjust upward the wage rate increases required under the Act, and sets rates for newly covered industries. Provides for hardship review committees in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands which could lower the amount of mandated raises in accord with documentary evidence of an inability to pay such raises. Extends coverage under the Fair Labor Standards Act to Federal and State employees, transit employees, nursing home employees, sugar employees, seasonal industry employees, domestic service employees employed in households, and maids and custodial employees of hotel and motels. Establishes a minimum wage rate of $1.60 per hour for full time students employed in any occupation other than specified hazardous occupations. Provides exceptions to the minimum rate: (1) for students if the Secretary of Labor prescribes such exception in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment; and (2) for students employed in service and retail establishments, agriculture, and higher education institutions for twenty hours per week. Provides an exception for students of elementary and secondary schools if the employment is an integral part of the education program. Limits the employment of children under 12 in agriculture to farms owned or operated by their parents or guardians, except in specified circumstances. Establishes a $1,000 civil penalty for violations of the child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Provides that employees of a public agency, including State employees, may maintain an action under such Act against the public agency in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction. Requires, in the Secretary's annual report to Congress as required by such Act, studies on the economic effects changes made in the minimum wage and overtime coverage and on the justification or lack of justification for the exemptions to such coverage made by such Act."
