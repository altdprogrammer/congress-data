    "text": "Endangered Species Conservation Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to provide a program for the conservation, protection, restoration, or propagation of species and subspecies of fish and wildlife, including migratory birds, that are threatened with extinction, or are likely within the foreseeable future to become threatened with extinction. Sets forth the procedure by which the Secretaries of Interior and Commerce (hereinafter \"Secretary\") shall determine if a species or subspecies of fish or wildlife shall be regarded as an endangered species. Lists the following factors to be considered in determining if a species or subspecies is threatened with extinciton or will likely become threatended with extinction: (1) the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (2) overutilization for commercial, sporting, scientific, or educational purposes; (3) disease or predation; (4) the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or (5) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. Provides that the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register, a list by scientific and common name or names of species and subspecies determined to be endangered. Provides that the Secretary may, from time to time, by regulation revise such list. States that until such republication an endangered species already listed shall be considered an endangered species presently threatened with extinction pursuant to this Act. Provides that the Secretary shall utilize the land acquisition and other authorities of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act, as amended, the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956, as amended, and the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, as appropriate, to carry out a program in the United States of conserving, protecting, restoring, or propagating those species and subspecies of fish and wildlife that he lists as endangered species pursuant to this Act. States that it is unlawful for any person to: (1) import into or export from the United States, receive or cause to be so imported, received, or exported; or (2) take or cause to be taken within the United States, the territorial sea of the United States, Federal lands, or upon the high seas; or (3) ship, carry or receive by any means in interstate commerce; or (4) sell or offer for sale any species or subspecies which is listed as an endangered species. Provides that any State law or regulation is void to the extent that it would effectively permit or prohibit imports, exports or transactions in interstate or foreign commerce in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this Act. Allows exceptions from the prohibitions contained in this Act to permit the taking of an endangered species for scientific purposes and for the propagation of such fish and wildlife in captivitiy for preservation purposes. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to promulgate such regulations as may be appropriate to carry out the purpose of this Act. Provides that the Secretary may require any person importing or exporting fish and wildlife to file a declaration stating such information as he deems necessary to facilitate enforcement of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating to promulgate such regulations as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this Act. States that the Secretary, through the Secretary of State, shall encourage foreign countries to provide for the protection, conservation and propagation of fish and wildlife, and shall encourage bilateral and multi-lateral agreements with such countries for these purposes. Provides that, in carrying out the program authorized by this Act, the Secretary shall cooperate to the maximum extent practicable with the several States. States that such cooperation shall include consultation before the acquisition of any land for the purpose of conserving, protecting, restoring, or propagating any endangered species. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with the States for the administration and management of any area established for the conservation, protection, restoration, and propagation of endangered species. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
