    "text": "States that the limitations placed upon any Indian Tribe by Federal law in its exercise of self-government shall not be construed to: (1) effect any rights in tribal lands secured to any Indian tribe by any law or treaty; (2) abridge the powers of self-government of any Indian tribe except to the extent specified in the prohibitions set out in such Act; (3) affect any tribal law or custom of any Indian tribe regulating the selection of the officers, bodies, or tribunals by or through which the powers of self-government of the tribe are executed; (4) invalidate any tribal law or custom of any Indian tribe which is consistent within the prohibitions set out in such Act; or (5) deprive any Indian court of the power to impose in any case within its jurisdiction any penalty or punishment sanctioned by tribal law or custom which does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment within the purview of such Act or exceed the limits of punishment as therein specified. Provides that no model code of justice recommended to the Congress by the Secretary of the Interior shall be applicable with respect to any Indian tribe unless the body increasing the legislative powers of the tribe has first adopted such code."
