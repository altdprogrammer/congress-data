Directs the Federal Communications Commission to establish regulations to insure such operations include provisions: (1) requiring each television network to provide a balanced program structure to its affiliated stations; and (2) prohibiting any television network from entering into any agreement with any broadcasting station which agreement unreasonably restricts use by the station of programs offered by any other network or program supplier, which agreement denies the station the privilege of refusing to transmit programs of such network, or which agreement has a duration of more than 2 years. Specifies additional requirements which shall be included in such regulations. Imposes a fine of $5,000 per offense on any television network willfully disobeying the Commission's rules or orders, up to a ceiling of $10,000 for licenses or permitees of a broadcasting station or $50,000 for a television network."
