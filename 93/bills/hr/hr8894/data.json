    "text": "Wholesome Fish and Fishery Products Act - Imposes continuous inspection for fish and fishery products, and makes further definitions concerning these products, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Prohibits any adulteration or simulation of an official inspection legend or certificate; and the possession of such legends or certificates without notification to the Secretary of Agriculture. Sets forth the definition of adulterated fish or fishery product for the purpose of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make a survey of fish processing establishments and vessels in order to gather information for the development of adequate standards of good manufacturing practices, including standards of sanitation and quality controls. Authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations within one year after funds are appropriated, and these standards would become effective within one year. Authorizes the Secretary to issue a certificate of registration to fishing establishments or vessels which comply with the regulations. Requires an official mark to label all fish products that have complied with the regulations, and any firm found in violation of the regulations could have its certificate of registration suspended, in some cases summarily, and in other cases after a hearing. Authorizes the Secretary to impose any needed regulations for storage and handling of fish. Directs that imported fish and fishery products meet the same requirements as domestic products and requires any firms engaged in the business of processing fish and fishery products to maintain records and make them available for inspection. Exempts individuals who raise, harvest, prepare, and transport fish products for their own personal use and do not engage in the business of buying or selling of fish from this Act. Asserts that any person who has denied a certificate or whose certificates has been suspended may have an opportunity for a hearing and judical review of the denial, withholding, suspension, or withdrawal of certificates and of withholding of approval of labeling or packaging. Encourages and promotes State enforcement but provides for Federal enforcement if a State fails to enforce provisions at least equal to this Act. Authorizes interdepartmental cooperation between the Secretary of HEW and the Secretary of the Interior and also authorizes consultation between the Secretary of HEW and the National Advisory Committee established by this Act."
