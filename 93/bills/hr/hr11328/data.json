Sets forth a formula for the Secretary to follow in allocating such funds among the States.

Directs the Secretary to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out this title. Title III: Grants for Research, Training, and Demonstration Projects - Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to, and enter into contracts with, public agencies and/or nonprofit private agencies and organizations for the purpose of: (1) funding research programs designed to further the knowledge of how to prevent, identify, and treat instances of child neglect and abuse; (2) developing and establishing training programs for professional and paraprofessional personnel who are engaged in, or intend to work in, the field of prevention and/or treatment of child neglect and abuse; and (3) funding innovative projects which show promise of being successful in the prevention and/or treatment of child neglect and abuse cases.
