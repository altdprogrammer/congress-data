    "text": "Ban Sports From Closed-Circuit Television Act - Prohibits any person, under the Communications Act, from presenting any sports event to the public by means of a closed-circuit television production except as provided in this Act. Provides that a sports event may be presented to the public by means of a closed-circuit television production only if the person proposing to so present such event has applied to the Federal Communications Commission to present such event, and such application has been approved by the Commission. States that the Commission shall approve such application only if it is satisfied: (1) that the rights to broadcast such event have been offered to an adequate number of radio and television networks or licenses; and (2) because of lack of interest on the part of the public, it is neither likely nor reasonable that such event will be presented to the public by means of a broadcast for which no charge is made to the broadcast audience."
