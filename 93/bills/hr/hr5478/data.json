States that such funds may not be expended by any Federal agency other than the Office of Economic Opportunity. Requires the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity to provide financial assistance to community action agencies for the planning, conduct, administration, and evaluation of community action programs and components. Prohibits the Director from delegating or transfering any of his powers or functions unless the President complies with the requirements relating to executive reorganizations. Prohibits the disposal of any money or property which would have the effect of abolishing or reducing the powers or functions of the Director. Provides that the Director shall not transfer funds for a period of one year unless the President has complied with executive reorganization requirements of title 5, United States Code. Prohibits the suspension of financial assistance for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions unless the recipient agency has been afforded reasonable notice and opportunity for a full hearing."
