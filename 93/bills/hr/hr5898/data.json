    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) High Seas Oil Port Act - Declares that it is the purpose of this Act to authorize the Secretary of Interior to grant licenses for the construction of high seas oil ports and to provide for the regulation and protection of such ports. Prohibits the construction and operation of a high seas oil port or any other fixed structure in the offshore coastal waters of the United States except as specifically authorized by the laws of the United States. Specifies activities for which a high seas oil port may not be used. =Title I: Construction of High Seas Oil Ports= - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue licenses for the construction of high seas oil ports. Sets forth the criteria for the issuance of such licenses. Directs the Secretary to establish and apply criteria for evaluating the potential impact of construction or operation of proposed high seas oil ports on the marine environment. Enumerates criteria which must be included in such evaluation. Sets forth procedures for application for licenses, and for subsequent consideration of such licenses in the form of: (1) consultation with other Federal agencies, (2) consultation with adjacent coastal states, and (3) notice, hearings, and judicial review. Specifies procedures for suspension or revocation of a license to construct. Provides that when construction of a port has been completed in accordance with the requirements of the license and the provisions of this Act, the Secretary shall collect from the licensee a fee equaling three per cent of the construction cost. Directs the Secretary to then certify the fact of completion to the Secretary of the department in which the coast Guard is operating. Authorizes for the fiscal year 1974 and for each of the two suceeding fiscal years the appropriation of such sums, not exceeding $500,000 for any fiscal year, as necessary for administration of this title. =Title II: Operation of High Seas Oil Ports= - Provides that, upon receipt of the certification of the Secretary of the Interior as required by Title I of this Act, the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall convert the license to construct a high seas oil port to a license to operate the oil port. Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to issue reasonable rules and regulations prescribing procedures under which the high seas oil ports shall be operated. Specifies that these rules and regulations shall include port operations, pilotage requirements, maximum vessel drafts, marking of anchorage areas, facility maintenance, personnel health and safety measures, prevention or minimization of pollution of the marine environment, and measures for prevention or minimization of any adverse impact from the operation of the oil port. Provides that high seas oil ports licensed under this Act do not possess the status of islands and have no territorial seas of their own, but shall be deemed to be located within the navigable waters of the United States. Enumerates laws applicable to high seas oil ports with respect to interstate commerce, workman's compensation, labor disputes and customs laws. Establishes the High Seas Oil Port Liability Fund and provides for the assessment of a fee of two cents per barrel at the time of offloading at the high seas oil port, to be paid to the Fund. Provides that notwithstanding any other provision of law the Fund shall be liable for all damages (excluding clean-up costs) to real and personal property within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States that are a result of operations or activities related to a high seas oil port and occurring in the vicinity of such port. Limits liability for all claims arising out of one incident to $100,000,000."
