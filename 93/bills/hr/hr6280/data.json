    "text": "Consumer Protection Act - Finds that the interests of consumers are inadequately protected within the Federal Government, and are essential to the fair and efficient functioning of a free market economy. Creates the Office of Consumer Protection, independent of the President and of the executive departments, and under the control and direction of the Consumer Counsel of the United States. Directs the President to appoint the Consumer Counsel and his Assistant, each with the advice and consent of the Senate, to hold office for a term of 15 years. Gives Congress the right to remove the Counsel or the Assistant at any time by joint resolution after notice and hearing when either has been inefficient or permanently incapacitated or guilty of neglect of duty, or for cause. Requires the retirement of the consumer Counsel or the Assistant at the age of 70 years. Allows an annuity after serving 10 years in office. Forbids any employee of the Office of Consumer Protection from engaging in other business inconsistent with his official responsibilities under this Act. Outlines the general authority of the Consumer Counsel, and makes him subject to the Civil Service and classification laws. Directs each Federal agency to make its services, personnel and facilities available to the Office of Consumer Protection and except when prohibited by law to furnish information to the Office. Directs the Consumer Counsel to transmit to Congress and the President an annual report each January. Outlines the functions of the Office of Consumer Protection, with its primary function to advise Congress and the President as to matters affecting the interests of the United States, consumers, and to protect and promote these interests. Provides that the Consumer Counsel, as a matter of right, may petition for, initiate, appear, or intervene in any investigation, complaint, action, appear, or other proceeding before any Federal court or agency in behalf of interests of consumers. Permits the Counsel to intervene in proceedings or actions before State or local agencies and courts if not inconsistent with law or agency rules. Outlines the protection of consumers interests in administrative proceedings and requires every Federal agency to notify the Office of all its actions which substantially affect consumers. Directs the Office to receive, evaluate, act on, and transmit consumer complaints to all appropriate Federal or non-Federal entities. Directs the Office to maintain a public document room containing an up-to-date listing of all signed consumer complaints for public inspection and copying. Directs the Office to gather and disseminate to the public information concerning: (1) the functions and duties of the Office; (2) consumer products and services, and (3) problems encountered by consumers. Directs the Office to encourage public and private testing and research activities to improve consumer services, and to make recommendations to Federal agencies con- cerning this research. Directs the Office to periodically review products which have been tested. Directs the Office not to disclose to the public any information which would reveal trade secrets or other information which is privileged or confidential or under special protection of the law. Directs the Office to act under procedures of fairness and to provide all interested persons a reasonable opportunity to comment on proposed release of product test data, prior to release. Defines the terms used in this Act."
