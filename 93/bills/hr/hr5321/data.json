    "text": "Federal Animal Damage Control Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct directly or by agreement with qualified agencies or institutions, public and private, a program of research which shall concern the control and conservation of predatory and depredating animals and the abatement of damage caused by such animals. Authorizes to be appropriated for such program not to exceed $1,500,000 for each fiscal year occurring after fiscal year 1973. Authorizes the Secretary to provide annual financial assistance to any State which may propose to administer a program for the control of predatory and depredating animals. Provides that the Secretary may not, except in emergency situations, approve any State program which entails the field use of chemical toxicants for the purpose of killing predatory animals or the field use of any chemical toxicant which causes any secondary poisoning effect for the purpose of killing other mammals, birds, or reptiles. Directs the Secretary to conduct such operational programs for the control of predatory and depredating animals as he may deem necessary or desirable. Authorizes to be appropriated $3,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1973 and 1974, and $2,000,000 for each succeeding fiscal year thereafter for control programs. Authorizes to be appropriated $1,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1973-74 for operational programs. Prohibits any person from making field use of any chemical toxicant on any Federal lands for the purpose of killing predatory animals, or making field use on such lands of any chemical toxicant which causes any secondary poisoning effect for the purpose of killing other mammals, birds, or reptiles. Provides that any person convicted of any violation of this part, or of any regulation promulgated under this Act, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year or both. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purpose of this Act other than specific authorizations previously made."
