Suspends the President's authority to authorize the Director to delegate any of his powers or functions, or programs administered under this Act unless he complies with the requirements for executive reorganizations. Prohibits the Director from disposing of property belonging to the Office of Economic Opportunity that would have the effect of reducing the Office's powers, functions or programs. Provides that the Director shall not transfer funds to other Federal agencies for the performance of Office of Economic Opportunity functions delegated after January 31, 1973, if the President has not complied with the requirements of the Executive Reorganization Act of 1949 as provided in this Act. Provides that any unexpended funds so transferred prior to January 31, 1973, shall be returned to the Office of Economic Opportunity. Provides procedures for a full and fair hearing before financial assistance may be suspended under any title of this Act."
