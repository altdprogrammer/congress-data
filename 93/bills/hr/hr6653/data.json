Allows him to pay up to 90 percent of the cost of a State or local program, and up to 100 percent for emergency or disaster projects. Provides that no contract shall be entered into under this Act with a contractor who is, or whose employees are, under State law, exempted from operation of the State workmen's compenstation law, generally applicable to employees, unless the contractor shall undertake to provide either through insurance by a recognized carrier, or by self insurance, as allowed by State law, that the persons employed under the contract, shall enjoy workmen's compensation coverage equal to that provided by law for covered employment. Provides that the Secretary shall consult and cooperate with the Office of Economic Opportunity, the Administration on Aging, and any other related programs, with a view to achieving optimal coordination with such other public and private programs or projects of a similar nature. Makes appropriations for the purpose of this Act of $35,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1972, $60,000,000 for fiscal year ending June 30,1973."
