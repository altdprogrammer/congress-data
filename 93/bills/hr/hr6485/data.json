Amends 7 U.S.C. 1314. Provides that this Act shall not apply in any case in which the Secretary of Agriculture or his designee finds any such nonquota tobacco is readily and distinguishably different from any kind of tobacco produced under quota, because of seed variety, cultural practices, method of curing and other factors affecting its physical characteristics, as determined through the application of the Federal Standards of Inspection and Identification of quota types and the tobacco does not possess any of the distinguishable characteristics of a quota type."
