    "text": "Police Compensation Act - Authorizes the Attorney General, through the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, to make grants to cities to increase the compensation of police personnel and to create additional police positions. Authorizes appropriations of $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1974 and such amounts as Congress may find necessary to appropriate for each of the nine succeeding fiscal years to carry out the purposes of this Act. Directs that $90,000,000 of the amount appropriated for the first fiscal year is to be used for grants to cities with population in excess of 100,000. Directs the grants be appropriated among the cities on a per capita basis. Directs that not more than ten percent be granted to cities with a population of less than 100,000 upon a finding by the Attorney General that the city has urgent need for the Federal grant. Sets forth requirements for applications for grants. Provides that a city shall not use more than 25 percent of any grant to create additional police positions unless the Attorney General finds that such city has an urgent need for additional police manpower; and in no event shall more than 50 percent of any grant be used for such purpose. Entitles each city receiving an initial grant to a renewal of such grant for each succeeding fiscal year."
