States that violations of this Act shall be deemed to be an unfair act or practice in commerce under the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Requires the Federal Trade Commission to report to the Congress within six months of the date of enactment of this Act whether any additional legislation is required to prevent acts or practices in commerce which adversely affect any independent marketers as defined in this Act."
