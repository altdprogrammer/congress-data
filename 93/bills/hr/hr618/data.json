Provides that the Secretary shall estimate such percentage as follows: (1) first, he shall estimate the amount of individual income taxes that will be received in the Treasury during the calendar year in which such fiscal year ends; and (2) then he shall determine that percentage which one-half of the budget surplus for such fiscal year is of the amount estimated under part (1).
