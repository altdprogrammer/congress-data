Establishes, within the Department of Commerce as a part of the National Bureau of Standards, a Fire Research and Safety Center which shall provide additional scientific and technical knowledge applicable to the prevention and reduction of fires; conducting medical research aimed at improving the performance of men in fighting fires and at the healing of victims of fires; and in the operating of a comprehensive fire data and information system. Provides that the Director of the Center shall perform studies into the operational and managerial aspects of fire departments and services using quantitive techniques, including operations research, management economics, and cost effectiveness studies. Establishes, within the Department of Commerce, as part of the National Bureau of Standards, a United States Fire Academy which shall advance the professional development of fire service personnel; and conduct such development, testing, and demonstration projects as are deemed necessary to introduce new technological standards, operating methods, command techniques, and managerial systems into use in the fire services of the nation. Authorizes the Academy to conduct courses and programs of training and education in the basic techniques of fire prevention, fire inspection, firefighting and the administration and management of fire departments and fire services. Provides for the education and training of local fire units and departments, state and local governments, and private institutions through the establishment of fire training courses and programs in fire engineering at junior colleges and universities. Provides for the inclusion of fire prevention and detection technology and practices in the education and professional practice of architects, builders, city planners engaged in the design and planning affected by fire safety problems. Provides that the Superintendent shall admit to the Academy individuals who are members of the firefighting forces with due regard to an adequate geographic representation. Authorizes the provision stipends to students attending Academy courses and programs in amounts not to exceed 75 percent of the cost of attendance. Authorizes the Superintendent to make payments to institutions of higher education for loans to individuals enrolled on a full-time basis in recognized undergraduate or graduate programs in fire research or engineering not to exceed $2,500 per academic year for any individual. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to appoint a 12 member Board of Visitors to the United States Fire Academy to review annually the program of the Academy consisting of two members of the Senate, two members of the House of Representatives, and eight individuals designated by the Secretary from persons representative of the fire service community.
