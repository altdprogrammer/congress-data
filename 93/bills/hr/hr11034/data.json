Establishes eligibility requirements for such units in order to receive grants. Prohibits employment discrimination by units receiving grants. Sets forth a distribution of funds schedule which requires that 30 percent of grant funds be used for fire equipment and 50 percent for maintaining or improving firefighting personnel's pay. Limits a firefighting grant to any one unit to $3,000,000. Requires the Administration to establish the National Fire Protection Advisory Council which shall establish minimum training standards for firefighting personnel, recommended ambulance rescue service standards, and equipment standards for rescue and firefighting. Provides that the Advisory Council shall terminate on June 30, 1976. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act of $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1974; $150,000,000 for fiscal year 1975; and $200,000,000 for fiscal year 1976.
