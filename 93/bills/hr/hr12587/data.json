Provides that the President shall, by written order stating in full the considerations for his actions, roll back prices for crude oil and petroleum products to levels no higher than those prevailing in the seven-day period ending November 1, 1973, in order to reduce inflation. States that price increases annnounced after November 1, 1973, and made retroactive to dates prior to November 1, 1973, shall not be considered as having been in effect prior to such date for purposes of this section. Permits the President to make exceptions to compensate for increased costs for crude oil and petroleum products produced or refined outside the United States."
