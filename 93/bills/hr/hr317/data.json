Provides that the use of the Armed Forces of the United States in hostilities in the absence of a declaration of war or specific authorization by Congress shall be reported promptly, and in no event later than twenty-four hours after the commencement of hostilities, in writing by the President to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, together with a full account of the circumstances under which such hostilities were initiated and the estimated scope of such hostilities. Provides that the authority of the President to deploy Armed Forces of the United States and to direct or authorize such Armed Forces to engage in hostile action, in the absence of a declaration of war or specific authorization of the Congress, shall terminate upon the adoption by either House of the Congress of a resolution disapproving continuance of the action taken."
