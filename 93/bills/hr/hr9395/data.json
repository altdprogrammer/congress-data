    "text": "Federal Family Support Act - Permits the registration of a support order by the obligee of that support order in the State or district in which the obligor of the order resides, in those cases where such State or District is outside the State in which the support order was made. Provides for contempt proceedings against an obligor failing to comply with the support order so registered. Provides that such proceedings shall not be subject to any limitation with respect to amount in controversy. Provides that an obligor who leaves the State in which the support order was issued or in which related proceedings have been instituted shall be punished by a fine of not more than $2,500 or by imprisonment for not more than three years, or both. Creates a rebuttable presumption that one who leaves the State wherein a support order has been served upon him shall be deemed to have left the State with intent to avoid compliance with such order. Provides that in all criminal proceedings under this Act a wife may testify against her husband without his consent."
