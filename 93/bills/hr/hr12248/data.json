Directs the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to initiate and carry out a program as provided in this Act for the development and demonstration of solar heating systems for use in residential dwellings and commercial buildings. Provides for the installation of solar heating systems in residential dwellings, to be monitored by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Provides that such residential dwellings shall be located in a sufficient number of different geographic areas in the United States to assure a realistic and effective demonstration of solar heating and cooling systems involved. Directs the Director of the National Science Foundation to initiate, support and fund basic and applied research activities related to solar energy in support of the objectives of this Act. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to assure the full dissemination of information with respect to the activities conducted under this Act to Federal, State, and local authorities, the building industry and the public at large. Directs the Secretary to establish and operate a Solar Heating and Cooling Information Data Bank for collecting, reviewing, processing, and disseminating solar heating and cooling information in support of the objectives of this Act. Sets forth reporting requirements for agencies conducting activities under this Act. Provides for adjustment of the maximum dollar amount of any Federally-assisted mortgage loan or the maximum per-unit or other cost of any Federally-constructed housing if such structure is furnished with solar heating or combined solar heating and cooling equipment under the demonstration program established by this Act. Provides that within sixty days after creation of any permanent Federal organization having jurisdiction over the energy research and development functions of the United States, all research and development functions vested in other agencies by this Act, along with related records, documents, personnel, obligations and other items shall be transferred to the new organization. Authorizes the appropriation of up to $50,000,000 to carry out this Act."
