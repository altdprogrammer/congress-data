Provides that no person shall create, erect, maintain, or construct any obstruction, barrier, or restraint of any nature which interferes with the free and unrestricted right of the public, individually and collectively, to enter, leave, cross, or use as a common the public beaches. Establishes Federal jurisdiction over legal actions connected with the provisions of this Act. States that it is desirable that the States and the Federal Government act in a joint partnership to protect the rights and interests of the people in the use of the beaches. Authorizes the Secretary of whatever department the Coast Guard is operating under to place at the disposal of the States such research facilities and information as may assist them in carrying out the provisions of this Act, to make grants, and to provide financial assistance for the development and maintenance of transportation facilities necessary in connection with the use of public beaches."
