    "text": "Flood Disaster Protection Act - Title I: Expansion of National Flood Insurance Program- Increases, under the National Flood Insurance Act, to $35,000 the aggregate liability for any single-family dwelling, and to $100,000 for any residential structure containing more than one dwelling unit. Increases to $10,000 the aggregate liability per dwelling unit for any contents related to such unit. Increases to $100,000 the aggregate liability in the case of business properties which are owned, leased, and operated by small business concerns. Increases, in the case of any other properties which may become eligible for flood insurance coverage under the Act, to $100,000 the aggregate liability per unit for any contents related to such unit. Provides that no Federal office or agency shall approve any financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes on and after July 1, 1973, for use in any area that has been identified by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as an area having special flood hazards and in which the sale of flood insurance is authorized under this Act, unless the building or mobile home and any personal property to which such financial assistance relates is, during the anticipated economic or useful life of the project, covered by flood insurance in an amount at least equal to its development or project cost or to the maximum limit of coverage authorized for the particular type of property under the Act, whichever is less. Removes the limit of outstanding notes and obligations that may be issued for purposes of financing the provisions of the Act. (Amends 42 U.S.C. 4016) Increases from $4,000,000,000 to $10,000,000,000 the total authorized face amount of flood insurance outstanding and in force at any one time under the Act. (Amends 42 U.S.C. 4026) Title II: Disaster Mitigation Requirements- Provides that no Federal officer or agency shall approve any financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes on and after July 1, 1975, for use in any area that has been identified by the Secretary as an area having special flood hazards unless the community in which such area is situated is then participating in the national flood insurance program. Provides that each Federal instrumentality responsible for the supervision, approval, regulation, or insuring of banks, savings and loan associations, or similar institutions shall by regulation prohibit such institutions on and after July 1, 1975, from making, increasing, extending, or renewing any loan secured by improved real estate or a mobile home located or to be located in an area that has been identified by the Secretary as an area having special flood hazards, unless the community in which such area is situated is then participating in the national flood insurance program. Repeals the disaster assistance penalty provision of the Act. Authorizes the Secretary to issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
