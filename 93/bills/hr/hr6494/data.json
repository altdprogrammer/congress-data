    "text": "Creates the Indian Trust Counsel Authority as an independent agency in the executive branch. Provides that the Authority shall be governed by a board of Directors composed of three members to be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Requires that at least two of the members of the board of Directors be Indians. Directs the Authority to render legal services in regard to rights or claims of Indians to natural resources, including, but not limited to, rights to land, rights to the use of water, timber, and minerals, and rights to hunt and fish, within the United States. Provides that nothing in this Act shall absolve the Department of the Interior and the Department of Justice of their responsibilities to the Indians, except that the Department of Justice as of the effective date of this Act or as soon thereafter as practicable, is relieved of its responsibility to Indians with regard to the above rights or claims. Provides that the legal services performed by the Authority may include but shall not be limited to, the investigation and, inventorying of Indians' land and water rights, in all courts, before Federal, State, and local commissions, and in all administrative proceedings. Authorizes the Authority to: (1) make such rules and regulations as it deems necessary to carry out its functions; (2) request from any department, agency, or independent instrumentality of the Government any information, personnel, services, or materials it deems necessary to carry out its functions under this Act; (3) receive and use funds or services donated by others; and (4) make such expenditures or grants, either directly or by contract, as may necessary to carry out its responsibilities under this Act. Authorizes necessary appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
