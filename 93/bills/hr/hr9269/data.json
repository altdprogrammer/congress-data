Requires the Secretary to notify the House and Senate Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs promptly upon receipt of an application for a right-of-way for a pipeline twenty-four inches or more in diameter. States that no right-of-way for such pipeline shall be granted until sixty days after a notice of intention to grant the right-of-way has been submitted to such committees, unless each committee by resolution waives the waiting period. Title II: Trans-Alaskan Pipeline Authorization Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to grant, in accordance with the provisions of this Act and without further action under the National Environmental Policy Act, such rights-of-way and permits as he deems necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of a trans-Alaskan oil pipeline. Authorizes the Secretary to investigate the feasibility of one or more oil or gas pipelines from the North Slope of Alaska to connect with a pipeline through Canada that will deliver oil or gas to United States markets. Authorizes the President to enter into negotiations with the Government of Canada to determine the terms and conditions under which pipelines or other transportation systems could be constructed across Canadian territory for the transport of oil and gas from Alaska's North Slope to markets in the United States."
