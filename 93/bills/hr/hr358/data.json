    "text": "National No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act - Prohibits any person from registering any motor vehicle upon a public street or road unless such vehicle is insured under a qualifying no-fault policy pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation or provides a security bond, proof of qualification as a self insurer, or other securities affording security equivalent to that afforded under a qualifying no-fault policy. Provides for a fine of not to exceed $1,000 or imprisonment for not to exceed six months, or both, for knowingly violating the above requirements. Requires that to be a qualifying no-fault policy, an insurance policy, except as to the occupants of a motor vehicle other than the insured vehicle or the operator or user of a motor vehicle engaging in criminal conduct, must provide benefits as follows: (1) to any person injured an amount equal to the net economic loss, as defined by this Act, sustained by such person as a result of such injury; and (2) to the legal representative of any person killed for the benefit of the surviving spouse and any dependent, without regard to fault, an amount equal to the net economic loss sustained by such spouse and dependent as a result of the death of such person. Provides for the payment for net economic loss as such losses are incurred except that in the case of death payment may at the option of the beneficiary be made immediately as a lump sum payment. Requires, in the case of injury or death to any person, that the insurer pay compensation for damages other than economic loss. Requires the insurer to pay any person for damages to property arising from the use of the insured vehicle. Exempts any person who is the owner, operator, or user of an insured motor vehicle or the operator or user of an uninsured vehicle who has no reason to believe that such vehicle is uninsured from tort liability for damages unless that person is engaging in criminal conduct. Forbids any person from proceeding to trial and prohibits any judgment from being rendered (except by the consent of all parties) in a suit including a claim for damage other than economic loss unless (a) all claims for net economic losses have been satisfied, or (b) there exists a claim for a net economic loss which is agreeably the result of the accidental harm for which the claim for damage is made and which has not been paid within thirty days after the insurer has received reasonable notice of the fact and a demand for payment, or (c) three years have elapsed since the date of the event upon which the claim is based or one year has elapsed since the date of the event and all claims attributable to economic losses have been satisfied. Renders unenforceable any contract for settlement of any claim for damage other than payment in consideration of any economic loss. Establishes the statute of limitations for bringing suit under provisions providing compensation for damages other than economic loss at four years from the date of the accident or one year after the last payment for economic loss, whichever is shorter. Allows additional coverages and benefits not inconsistent with the requirements of this Act. Subjects any insurer to $5,000 civil penalty for each policy issued in violation of this Act. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate a uniform statistical plan for the allocation and compilation of claims and loss experience data, such plan to be followed by every insurer writing qualifying no-fault policies and by every rating or advisory organization or statistical agent. Requires the Secretary to organize an assigned claims bureau and assigned claims plan in each State, the cost for the maintaining of which shall be assessed against insurers in each State by the appropriate State insurance supervisory authority. Forbids any insurer to write any qualifying no-fault policy unless the insurer participates in the assigned claims bureau in each State in which it writes such policies. Establishes standards by which a claimant may obtain benefits under the assigned claims plan. Allows the awarding of reasonable attorney's fees to any person making a claim under a qualifying no-fault policy."
