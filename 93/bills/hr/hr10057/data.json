States that this act shall not apply to the use of such force by anyone acting under a reasonable belief that such use is necessary: (1) in a bona fide defense of the people of this nation against the use or imminent use of such force by another nation against them or their property; or (2) in bona fide defense of the people of another nation upon, but only upon, the public request of its head of government for armed intervention by this nation and pursuant to the requirements of the United Nations Charter; or (3) in response to a request by the Secretary General of the United Nations acting pursuant to a resolution of the General Assembly or the Security Council. Provides that persons convicted of violating this Act shall forfeit their office and be ineligible for military or governmental office for the rest of their life, and may be imprisoned for any term of years or life. Provides that any military or civilian personnel of this nation who is instructed to violate this Act may secure a judgment in the national courts of this nation that such instruction is unlawful, and that such courts may stay execution of such instruction."
