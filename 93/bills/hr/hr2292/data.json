Provides that whenever the waters of any stream or other body of water are proposed or authorized to be impounded, diverted, the channel deepened, or the stream or other body of water otherwise controlled or modified for any purpose whatever, it shall be the responsibility of the person or agency proposing such project to include a report describing, to the extent known, the potential effect of such project on wildlife resources and their environment and the means and measures to be taken to prevent or substantially minimize any such adverse effects. States that the head of the appropriate Federal agency or department shall not approve any project application unless the Governor of the State or States in which the project may be located certifies in writing within ninety days after receipt of notice of application for a permit, license, or assistance, to such agency that there is reasonable assurance that the project will be located, designed, constructed, and operated so as to prevent or substantially minimize damage to wildlife."
