Provides that the Commissioner of Customs shall levy on all products entering the United States which are subject to this Act, in addition to any tariffs, a charge or charges set by the Secretary of Agriculture at levels which are in his judgment sufficient to defray the probably costs of all examinations and inspections carried out pursuant to this Act."
