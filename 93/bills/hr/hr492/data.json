States that it shall be unlawful and contrary to the public policy of the United States for any labor organization to strike or engage in any other course of action for the purpose of inducing, persuading, or compelling any employer in an industry affecting commerce to accede to or grant or otherwise put into effect any demand for wages, rates of pay, or any other terms and conditions made pursuant to any combination, agreement, conspiracy, or understanding declared unlawful under this Act where the effect may be to substantially or materially affect the production, use, cost, distribution, selling, or otherwise handling of any commodity or service in commerce. Provides that, for the purpose of this Act, no action or plan of action, including strikes, picketing, and boycotts, undertaken by an individual labor organization in furtherance of or in relation to any purpose of such organization and which is not undertaken or carried out in concert with any other labor organization or with any employer or other person, shall be deemed to be in restraint of trade or commerce."
