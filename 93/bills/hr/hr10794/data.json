    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1973-10-09", 
    "text": "Occupational Safety and Health Act Amendments - Requires that when a proposed rule, which would establish a new occupational safety and health standard, or which would affect an existing standard, is published in the Federal Register, it shall be accompanied by a statement summarizing its economic impact on affected employers, including an estimate of the total cost which would be incurred by employers in each affected industry in complying with such rule. Provides that after a violation of an occupational safety and health standard has been abated an employer need not continue to post the citation for such violation at or near the site of the violation. Establishes a procedure whereby an employer receiving a citation can obtain a variance from the standard violated by persuading the Secretary that work procedures in operation at the time of the citation are equally effective in protecting his employees. Changes from mandatory to permissive the assessment of fines for serious violations. States that in determining whether a fine should be assessed, due consideration should be given to the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the employer and the history of previous violations. Requires the Secretary of Labor to provide advice and technical assistance through consultation at the work sites of employers who have 100 or fewer employees, and who request such assistance."
