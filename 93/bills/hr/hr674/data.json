    "text": "Declares that the interests of the United States require the restoration of domestic harmony at the earliest time; that such interests will be served by the annulment of all legal disadvantages that have been incurred or suffered by reason of opposition to the Vietnam war, to the extent consistent with national security and the preservation of internal order; and that it is an immunity of citizens of the United States to enjoy such annulment, to the extent and on the conditions, if any, that may be authorized or imposed by the President. Expresses the approval of the Congress to such amnesty or mitigation of punishment for nonviolent military offenders and for Federal offenders as the President of the United States may, from time to time, grant by public proclamation, unconditionally or on such conditions as he may prescribe. Authorizes the President to restore United States citizenship solely or partly because of their disapproval of United States participation in the Vietnam War. Authorizes the President to grant, by public proclamation, amnesty or mitigation of punishment to State offenders. Provides that any grant of amnesty pursuant to this Act shall have the effect of restoring all civil and political rights that have been lost or impaired by reason of the violation for which amnesty is granted, unless the President of the United States shall otherwise declare in the public proclamation granting such amnesty. Makes this Act effective only upon the cessation of hostilities."
