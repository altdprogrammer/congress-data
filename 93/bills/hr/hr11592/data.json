    "text": "Provides that prior to the date on which any stationary source or class of moving sources is required to comply with any requirement of an application implementation plan, under the Clean Air Act, the Governor of the State to which such plan applies may apply to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone the applicability of such requirement to such source (or class) for not more than one year. States that if, in the opinion of the Administrator compliance with such requirement would be an undue financial burden on the person to whom the requirement applies; or if the Administrator determines that such source (or class) is unable to comply with such requirement because the necessary technology or other alternative methods of control are not available or have not been available for a sufficient period of time; and the continued operation of such source is essential to national security or to the public health or welfare, then the Administrator shall grant a postponement of such requirement."
