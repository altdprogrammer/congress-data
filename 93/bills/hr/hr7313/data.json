Provides that the Secretary shall establish such rules and regulations as may be necessary: (1) to provide for applications in such form and containing such information as may by necessary to obtain registration pursuant to this title; (2) to require that each applicant make an adequate showing of financial responsibility to engage in the business of conducting a travel agency in order to obtain such registration; and (3) to require that such financial responsibility be established in accordance with objective criteria prescribed in such rules and regulations. Provides that registration certificates issued pursuant to this title shall not be assignable or transferable. Provides for a fine of up to $1,000 upon a finding that the holder of a registration certificate has engaged in any of the following practices: (1) fraud or bribery in securing a registration certificate issued pursuant to this title; (2) the making of any false statement as to a material matter in any application or other statement required by or pursuant to this title; (3) violation of any provision of this title or any code, rule, or regulation adopted hereunder; (4) any fraud or fraudulent practice in the operation and conduct of a travel agency business including, but not limited to, intentionally misleading advertising; (5) activities prohibited by this title leading to conviction of a misdemeanor; (6) activities leading to conviction of a misdemeanor; (6) activities leading to conviction of a felony; and (7) breach of a fiduciary duty to a principal. Provides for the revocation of the certificate of a registered agency for violations of this title after an opportunity for a hearing and review by the United States court of appeals. Provides penalties of up to $2,000 or imprisonment of not more than two years, or both, for any knowing and willful violations of this title. Provides that effective on and after January 1, 1974, no State or subdivision thereof shall adopt or enforce any law regulating, or setting any standards with respect to, the activity of engaging in the business of conducting a travel agency. Provides that the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the rules, regulations and orders of any other Federal agency which may by law regulate carriers of air or steamship carriers."
