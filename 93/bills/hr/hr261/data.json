    "text": "Asian American Affairs Act - Establishes the Cabinet committee for Asian American Affairs to advise, authorize, and direct the departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Federal Government and organizations receiving Federal funds regarding appropriate action to be taken to help assure that Federal and other programs are providing the assistance needed by Asian Americans as a whole or by the individual Asian American ethnic, cultural, or nationality groups. Provides that the committee shall advise and direct such departments, agencies, and instrumentalities on programs focusing on the special problems and needs of Asian Americans. Establishes an Advisory Council composed of twelve members appointed by the President from among persons who are representative of the Japanese American, Chinese American, Korean American, Filipino American, Polynesian American, and other elements of the Asian American community in the United States. Provides that the committee shall direct and authorize the Advisory Council and staff to investigate such areas of possible discrimination as the committee may specify, and possible discriminatory practices in the areas of employment, housing, education, welfare and other public services, religion, recreation and other areas that may arise against the Asian Americans. Provides that the committee shall conduct public hearings at any place with power to subpena records to investigate discrimination against Asian Americans; examine for, resolve, and correct any injustices and discrimination against Asian Americans in their respective departments; and foster such surveys, studies, research, and demonstration and technical assistance projects, establish such relationship with State and local governments and the private sector, and promote such participation of State and local governments and the private sector as may be appropriate to indentify and assist in solving the special problems of Asian Americans as a whole or as individual Asian American ethnic, cultural, or nationality groups. Gives the Advisory Council cease and desist powers to enforce its finding of discriminatory practices against Asian Americans. Requires the Advisory Council to submit to the committee an annual report on its activities. Authorizes to be appropriated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974, $7,000,000 and for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, $12,000,000 to carry out the purposes of this Act."
