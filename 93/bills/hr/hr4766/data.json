States that no court, department, or agency of the United States shall require directly or indirectly the transportation of any student if such transportation poses a risk to the health of such student or constitutes a significant impingement on the educational process with respect to such student. Provides methods of judicial enforcement for any civil actions involving a denial of equal protection of the laws arising out of the operation of public elementary or secondary schools."
