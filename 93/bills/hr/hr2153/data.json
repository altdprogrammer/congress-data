Provides that after June 30, 1973, no air carrier or foreign air carrier shall operate an aircraft in air transportation unless all passengers boarding that aircraft in the United States, and all baggage carried aboard the aircraft, shall have been inspected by means of a metal detection device or by an X-ray device immediately prior to boarding and have not been found to carry or contain an unauthorized device or weapon of any kind. Prescribes criminal penalties for violation of this Act. (Amends 49 U.S.C. 1514, 1421)"
