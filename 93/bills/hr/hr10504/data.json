Directs federal agencies to analyze the cost of the energy consumption of each new facility constructed over its economic life, in addition to the initial cost of constructing the facility. Defines the terms used in this Act. Requires each department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government having jurisdiction over any direct Federal, federally insured, or federally assisted construction program to require the preparation of a complete life-cycle cost analysis for all new facilities exceeding fifty thousand square feet of usable flood space, for the expected life of the facility."
