Revises the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act by establishing a thirteenth region for Natives who, in accordance with the provisions of such act, are non-residents of Alaska. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to afford all enrolled non-resident Natives an opportunity to inform him within 180 days after enactment of this Act whether or not they wish to be enrolled in the thirteenth region. Prescribes the procedure for electing the five incorporators of the thirteenth regional corporation, who are also to serve as its initial directors. Requires the Secretary to make any necessary adjustments in future distributions of sums from the Alaska Native Fund to reflect changes in enrollment made pursuant to this Act. Provides for the cancellation of stock previously issued by Native Corporations to Natives who are enrolled in the thirteenth region. Exempts through 1976 corporations organized under the Settlement Act from the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940."
