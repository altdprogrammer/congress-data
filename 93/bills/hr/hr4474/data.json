Directs the Secretary to seek a level of balance in air traffic congestion through distribution of air traffic facilities. Encourages an air traffic controller to participate in at least 4 hours per month in flight familiarization training. Requires air traffic controllers to participate in a training program once each year that shall include at least five days of familiarization with another air traffic control facility.
