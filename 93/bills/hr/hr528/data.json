States that such increases shall take place in two-year steps. Provides that the rates for the first 250,000 pieces of each issue of a second-class publication shall not exceed 66 2/3 percent of the applicable rates. Provides that after July 6, 1972 the revenues received from rates for second-class publications shall not exceed 50 percent of the published rate. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to credit to the Postal Service Fund such sums as may be needed to equal the revenues that would have been received if the publishers of second-class publications were to pay 100 percent of the applicable rate for such postage. (Amends 39 U.S.C. 3626) Provides that the Postal Rate Commission shall in answering requests for changes in rates or fees in each class of mail or type of service consider the educational, cultural, scientific and informational value to the recipient of mailed materials. (Amends 39 U.S.C. 3622)"
