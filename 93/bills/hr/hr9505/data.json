    "text": "Allows a tax credit under the Internal Revenue Code against the Federal income tax for State and local real property taxes or an equivalent portion of rent paid on their residences by individuals who have attained the age of 65. Provides that where an individual has attained the age of 65, there shall be allowed as a credit the amount of real property taxes paid which were imposed by a State or political subdivision on property owned and used by him as a principal residence or rent constituting such taxes as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. Provides that the total credit payment for any taxable year shall not exceed $500. Reduces the tax credit by 5 percent of the amount by which the taxpayer's household income exceeds $15,000. Provides that where the joint return of the husband or wife is filed, the age requirement is met if either person is 65 or older. Apportions the credit allowed to cover only that part of a residence actually used by the taxpayer or that part of a farm not in excess of four acres. Provides that an individual who is a tenant-stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation shall be treated as owning the house or apartment which he occupies and such person shall be treated as having paid real property taxes equal to the deduction allowable in direct proportion to taxes actually paid on a particular residence where during the taxable year there has been a change in residence. Provides that the term \"rent constituting property taxes\" means an amount equal to 15 percent of the rent paid during a taxable year by the taxpayer for the right to occupy his dwelling (exclusive of charges for utilities, services, and furnishings). Reduces the amount of real property taxes paid by an individual by the amount of any refund given on such taxes. Provides that there shall be no assessment of interest charges where there has been an underpayment of taxes by an individual if the amount due is paid within sixty days after the taxpayer receives a refund of real property taxes which caused the underpayment. (Amends 26 U.S.C. 42)"
