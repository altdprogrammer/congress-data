Provides that coverage under the mail delivery insurance program shall: (1) not exceed $2,500 with respect to each insured matter transmitted in the mail, and (2) not include the value of the insured matter itself, if such matter is damaged or lost, but only losses resulting from the late delivery or nondelivery of such matter. Directs the General Accounting Office to conduct an investigation and study of domestic mail service for the purpose of establishing a schedule of standard processing and delivery periods for such mail service."
