Provides that to qualify for this option the decedent must have had an interest in the farm, ranch or business for at least ten years prior to the valuation date. Provides that under the market-value alternative all relevant factors should be considered in valuing an interest including the earning capacity of the business, ranch or farm and the degree of control represented by the interest being valued (Adds 26 U.S.C. 2031(c))."
