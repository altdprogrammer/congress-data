    "text": "National Protection Act - States that it is the policy of the United States to encourage trade with all market economies and friendly nations (except nonmarket economies) when such trade has been determined by the President to be in the national interest. Declares, that the encouragement of exports is a secondary consideration and that the primary concerns of the United States are national security and possible harm to the American economy from unfair competition arising out of United States exports used in combination with slave and semislave labor within nonmarket economies. States that it is the policy of the United States to deal with world shortages of particular commodities, whenever feasible, through international cooperation with the major suppliers and consumers of such commodities, rather than by taking unilateral action. Provides for bipartisan consultation of specified congressional committees for determination of items the exportation of which is to be controlled, and the extent of such control."
