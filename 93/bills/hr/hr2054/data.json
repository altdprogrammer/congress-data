Specifies the benefits to which such civilians are entitled. States that if a civilian American citizen or his dependent has received from the United States any payments on account of the same injury or death, or from his employer any support or compensation for such injury or death, the benefits extended under this Act shall be diminished by the amount of such payments. Provides that this Act shall have retroactive effect to December 7, 1941, and the right to benefits shall be held to have begun to accrue as of that date. (Adds 50 App. U.S.C. 2004(j))"
