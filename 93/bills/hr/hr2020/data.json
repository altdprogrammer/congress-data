Requires the Secretary of the Army or any other officer with the intention of constructing such facility to notify the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in writing, who shall then notify the State involved. Stipulates that if such State within one hundred and twenty days of this notification files with the Administrator its objection of construction, such license or authorizations to the issuance of such license or authorization shall not be issued except upon such conditions as the Administrator, the objecting State, and the head of the agency of the United States proposing to issue such license or authorization shall jointly require."
