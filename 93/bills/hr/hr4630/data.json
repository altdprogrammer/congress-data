    "text": "Public Service Employment Act - Declares it to be the purpose of this Act to provide unemployed and underemployed persons with employment in jobs providing needed public services and appropriate training and related services. Authorizes to be appropriated to carry out this Act such sums as Congress determines necessary for each fiscal year ending prior to fiscal year 1977. Provides that the Secretary of Labor shall enter into arrangements with applicants for the purpose of providing financial assistance to public and private nonprofit agencies and institutions for the creation of jobs providing employment for unemployed or underemployed persons in carrying out needed public services. Provides that such eligible applicants shall be: (1) States, counties, cities, and other units or combinations of units of general local government which have established public service employment councils; and (2) other public and private agencies and institutions when government units of services are inadequate or nonexistent. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with eligible applicants, using 25 percent of the funds authorized under this Act, for the purpose of providing employment, for unemployed and underemployed persons residing in areas of substantial unemployment, in jobs providing needed public services, which shall be carried out to the maximum practicable extent within such areas. Provides for the establishment of a public service employment council. Provides that the Secretary shall not provide financial assistance for any program or activity under this Act unless he determines that: (1) the program will result in an increase in employment opportunities over those which would otherwise be available, will not result in the displacement of currently employed workers, will not impair existing contracts for services or result in the substitution of Federal for other funds in connection with work that would otherwise be performed, and will not substitute public service jobs for other federally assisted jobs; (2) persons employed in public service jobs assisted under this Act shall be paid wages which shall not be lower than whichever is the highest of the minimum wage which would be applicable to the employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the State or local minimum wage for the most nearly comparable covered employment, or the prevailing rates of pay for persons employed in similar public occupations by the same employer; (3) funds under this Act will not be used to pay persons employed in public service jobs under this Act at a rate in excess of $12,000 per year; (4) all persons employed in public service jobs assisted under this Act will be assured of workmen's compensation, health insurance, unemployment insurance, and other benefits at the same levels and to the same extent as other employees of the employer and to the same working conditions and promotional opportunities as such other employees enjoy; (5) provisions of law relating to health and safety conditions shall apply to such program or activity; (6) the program will, to the maximum extent feasible, contribute to the occupational development or upward mobility of individual participants; (7) not to exceed 10 percent of the funds available for any program under this Act will be used for the acquisition or the rental or leasing of supplies, equipment, materials, or real property; and (8) every participant shall be advised, prior to entering upon employment, of his rights and benefits in connection with such employment. Provides that the Secretary shall transmit at least annually a detailed report setting forth the activities conducted under this Act. Provides that the Secretary shall carry out a program of research and pilot projects into alternative ways and means to research full employment."
