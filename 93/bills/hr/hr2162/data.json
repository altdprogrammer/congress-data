    "text": "Uniform Motor Vehicle Insurance Act - Prohibits the registration or knowing operation or use of any motor vehicle upon public roads unless such vehicle is insured under a policy of insurance meeting the requirements of this Act. Makes any violation of this provision a misdemeanor and punishable by as much as a $1,000 fine and/or one year imprisonment. Requires insurance policies to include among its provisions that the insurer shall pay, without regard to fault, to any person (or to the person's legal representative for the benefit of the surviving spouse or any dependents if the injuries sustained result in death) an amount equal to the net economic loss sustained by such person arising out of the operation or use of such vehicle. Requires that such payment shall not be made to occupants of another motor vehicle, or to an operator or user of any motor vehicle used feloniously or in the commission of a felony. Enumerates those conditions which shall make an operator of an insured vehicle liable to the insurer for benefits payable to others. Includes among such conditions the operations of the motor vehicle: (a) while intoxicated; (b) while under the influence of drugs; (c) when the operator is attempting to commit or committing a felony; and (d) when the operator has wrongfully converted the vehicle. Provides that a claim may be made by any person not an occupant against the insurer of any vehicle involved, but that for such a claim (or claims) the insurer of each vehicle involved shall proportionately contribute. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to categorize all motor vehicles larger than ordinary passenger cars for the purpose of assigning percentages of responsibility for claims arising from economic losses to occupants of all other vehicles involved. Provides that the owner, operator or user of an insured motor vehicle shall be liable for damages for catastrophic harm arising out of the negligent use of such vehicle to the extent that such damages exceed economic loss, but that the insurer shall make available optional insurance therefor. Stipulates that an application for insurance shall not be rejected, nor shall a policy be cancelled, except for suspension or revocation of the license of the owner or principal operator to operate a motor vehicle, or for failure to pay the premium thereon. Directs the Secretary of Transportation, after consultation with insurers and State insurance authorities, to promulgate a common uniform statistical plan for the allocation and compilation of claims and loss experience data to be followed by insurers and ratings or advisory organizations or statistical agents named by any insurer to gather, compile, or report claims and loss experience data. Authorizes the Secretary to require standard uniform and standard minimal policy provisions and classes of risk and rating territories for coverage under this Act. Requires the Secretary to organize an assigned claims bureau and assigned claims plan in each State to be maintained by the insurers who must participate in every State where they offer insurance. Provides that all injured persons may obtain benefits through the assigned claims bureau and assigned claims plan in their State of residence if no such benefits are applicable to the injury or death, or no such benefits can be identified, or the indentifiable benefits are, because of financial inability of one or more insurers to fulfill their obligations, inadequate to provide such benefits. Directs that claims shall be assigned so as to assure a fair allocation of the burden on insurers. Provides that an insurer who makes an assigned claims payment shall be reimbursed, without regard to fault, by the owner of a motor vehicle which was not insured under this Act at the time of the accident out of which such assigned claim arose. Provides for the awarding of attorneys' fees and costs to a person fraudulantly or arbitrarily denied a claim and provides the same for an insurer where a fraudulent or excessive claim is filed."
