States that a person may not procure or cause to be prepared a consumer report on any consumer unless it is clearly and accurately disclosed to the consumer that such a report may be made. Entitles the consumer to a copy of such report. Provides that any consumer reporting agency which negligently or maliciously publishes any untrue statement or representation with respect to a consumer shall be liable to such consumer for: (1) actual damages, but not less than liquidated damages of $1,000; (2) punitive damages; and (3) a reasonable attorney's fee and other litigation costs reasonably incurred. Directs the President to establish a Board of Consumer Investigation Examiners. Provides that the Board shall promulgate such rules and procedures, as it deems necessary or appropriate in order to regulate the examining, licensing, and practices of individuals who investigate consumers for the purpose of preparing or aiding in the preparation of investigative consumer reports. Establishes procedures and guidelines for granting or revoking licenses granted individuals to prepare or aid in the preparation of investigative consumer reports. Provides for judicial review in an appropriate United States district court for any individual aggrieved by any final decision of the Board denying, revoking, or suspending a license. Makes it unlawful for any individual: (1) to investigate any consumer for the purpose of preparing or aiding in the preparation of any investigative consumer report without a license issued to such individual by the Board; or (2) to violate the terms of any license issued to him by the Board. Provides that any individual who violates the above paragraph shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. Authorizes necessary appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
