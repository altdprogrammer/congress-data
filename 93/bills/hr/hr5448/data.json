    "text": "District of Columbia No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to establish in the District of Columbia a system of first party, no-fault insurance for victims of motor vehicle accidents. Sets forth the definitions of terms used in this Act. Provides that the right to basic reparation benefits exists: (1) for every person suffering loss from injury arising out of an accident occurring in the District of Columbia; (2) for basic reparation insureds and their survivors suffering loss from injury arising outside the District of Columbia; and (3) for the driver and occupants of a secured vehicle (other than (a) one used in the business of transporting persons or property and (b) one owned by a Federal agency) for injury arising outside the District of Columbia. Sets forth the priority of applicability of security for payments of basic reparation benefits. Abolishes tort liability relating to accidents occurring in the District of Columbia and arising from ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, with specified exceptions. Requires that every owner of a motor vehicle in the District of Columbia provide security for (1) the payment of basic reparation benefits under this Act and (2) for payment of tort liabilities arising from maintenance or use of the motor vehicle. States that security be required for registration of a motor vehicle in the District of Columbia. Prescribes the obligations of an owner of a motor vehicle owner upon termination of his security. Specifies the minimum amounts required for tort liability security: (1) $10,000 for bodily injury sustained by one person, with an aggregate minimum amount of $20,000 for all bodily injury damages; and $5,000 for all damages arising from destruction of property. Permits reparation obligors to organize an assigned claims bureau and to adopt rules for operation and assessment of costs on a fair and equitable basis. Sets forth provisions regarding the time for presenting claims under this Act, attorney's fees, settlements, and judgments for future benefits. Provides for the equitable allocation of burdens among insurers until this system is established. Makes the effective date of this Act January 1, 1974. Prohibits from coverage under this Act all accidents occurring before this date."
