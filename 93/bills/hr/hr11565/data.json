    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Directs the Administrator of General Services to develop design criteria for new federally funded buildings to provide for the best practicable use and conservation of energy. Provides that the Administrator shall consider: (1) features that make use of sunlight and other natural phenomena; (2) insulation and elimination of excessive fenestration; (3) energy expended in the manufacture and transportation of building materials; and (4) new techniques for energy supply, generation, and transmission. Provides that the Administrator of General Services shall examine existing buildings to determine what improvements can be made to insure that these buildings will utilize the best possible technology for the conservation of energy. Authorizes appropriations of $1,500,000 for carrying out the purpose of this Act. Requires the Administrator to report by January 1, 1975, to the Congress a report on the results of the survey inventory and on his activities under this Act. Declares that it is the policy of the United States to insure that energy conservation practices are employed in the design of Federal and federally assisted facilities. Directs Federal agencies to carry out the construction of Federal facilities and the construction and renovation of major Federal facilities under their jurisidiction or programs for the construction of federally assisted facilities and the construction and renovation of major federally assisted facilities in such a manner as to further such policy. Directs each Federal agency having jurisdiction over any Federal or federally assisted facilities construction program to require the preparation of a complete life-cycle cost analysis for each major facility (exceeding fifty thousand square feet of usable floor space), for the expected life of the major facility. Directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration to develop, publish, and implement energy conservation guidelines for all Federal procurement, except that the United States Postal Service shall have the responsibility to develop, publish, and implement energy conservation guidelines for all postal procurement."
