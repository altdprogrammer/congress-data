    "text": "Narcotics Addict Treatment and Rehabilitation Act - Title I: The Federal Criminal Justice System and Narcotic Addicts - Directs the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to provide any suspected narcotics addict awaiting trial for any offense against the laws of the United States, such examinations and treatment as are best suited to the timely discovery of whether such individual is an addict and proper care to any such individual who is determined to be an addict. Authorizes each officer of the United States, having the authority to sentence offenders to penalties prescribed by law for any offense against the United States, in the case of any such offender whom such officer believes may be an addict, to sentence such offender to such penalty and require the examinations and treatment specified in this Act, or to suspend the sentence of such offender if such suspension is permitted by law, upon condition and only so long as such offender undergoes the examination and treatment provided for in this Act. Provides that none of the examinations or treatment made or provided for in this Act shall be construed or deemed a criminal conviction for any purpose. Title II: The Criminal Justice Systems of the States and Municipalities as they Relate to Narcotic Addicts - Provides that whenever the Attorney General determines, upon application by a unit of general local government, that the rate of narcotic addict-related crime in the areas under the jurisdiction of that unit of general local government reaches emergency proportions, such unit shall be eligible for assistance under this part during such period of time as the Attorney General determines the emergency is in effect, and such determination, along with an account of the reasons therefor, shall be transmitted by the Attorney General to the Congress. Authorizes the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to make grants, on such terms and conditions as it deems necessary, including the requirement of periodic reports concerning the use of assistance given under this section, to any unit of general local government determined to be eligible under this Act in order to enable such unit to implement a plan, approved by the Administration, providing for a broad range of medically sound programs for the treatment of addicts, and having as its overall goal making treatment available to every addict in such unit. Authorizes appropriations of $100,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974 and such sums thereafter as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this title and $100,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974, and such sums thereafter as are necessary to carry out the purposes of the addict treatment and rehabilitation programs under this Act. (Adds 18 U.S.C. 4251-4257)"
