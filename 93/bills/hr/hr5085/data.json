    "text": "Revises the Federal Aviation Act so as to establish a policy with respect to the use of United States air carriers for international movement by air of property procured, furnished or financed by the United States. Provide that the civil air carriers holding proper authorization from the Civil Aeronautics Board shall be used to the fullest extent practicable for all Department of Defense movements of persons or property by air between a place inside the United States and a place outside thereof or between two places both of which are outside the United States, to the extent such carriers are available at rates established under the Federal Aviation Act. Requires that as a minimum at least 50 percent of the annual gross tonnage (measured in ton-miles) of all property moved by the Department of Defense by air between a place in the United States and a place outside thereof, or between two places both of which are outside the United States, shall be transported by United States civil air carriers participating in the Civil Research Air Fleet program and holding certificates of public convenience and necessity under Section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act to the extent such carriers are available at rates established under such Act. States that the provisions of this Act will be waived whenever the Congress by concurrent resolution or otherwise, or the President of the United States or the Secretary of Defense, declares that an emergency exists justifying a temporary waiver of the provisions of this section and so notifies the appropriate agencies and certificated air carriers. Provides that every department or agency having responsibility under this Act shall administer its program under regulations issued by the Comptroller General of the United States."
