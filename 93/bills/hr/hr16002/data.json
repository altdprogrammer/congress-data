Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make grants to each of the several States for the purpose of enabling each State to acquire and restore an historic site within each State for use as a meetinghouse in accordance with the provisions of this Act, except that no grant to any one State shall exceed $1,000,000. Provides that any application for a grant under this Act shall contain an estimated budget of various acquisition, restoration, and maintenance expenses. Sets forth provisions governing the approval of any application. Establishes a Meetinghouse Coordination Board to review each application made in accordance with the provisions of this Act for the purpose of making recommendations to the Secretary as to which of the historic site or sites contained in such application should be approved by the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
