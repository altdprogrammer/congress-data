    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Provides, under the Communication Act, that if any game of a professional sports club is to be broadcast by television pursuant to a league contract and all tickets have been purchased seventy-two hours before game time, no agreement which would prevent the broadcasting by television of such game at the same time and in the area in which such game is being played shall be valid or have any force or effect. Requires that the right to broadcast such game by television shall be made available to a television broadcast licensee on reasonable terms and conditions. Empowers any interested person to commence a civil action for injunctive relief restraining violations of this Act. Defines the term \"professional sports club\" to include any professional football, baseball, basketball, or hockey club. Directs the Federal Communications Commission to conduct a study of the effect of this Act and annually submit a report to the Committee on Commerce of the Senate and the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives. Requires such report to include data and any recommendations for legislation relating to the broadcasting of professional football, baseball, basketball, and hockey games which the Commission determines would serve the public interest. Provides that this Act shall be repealed effective December 31, 1975."
