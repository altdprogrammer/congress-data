    "text": "Runaway Youth Act - States that it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to develop accurate reporting of the number of juveniles who leave and remain away from home without parental permission nationally and to develop an effective system of temporary care outside the law enforcement structure. Authorizes grants and technical assistance to localities and nonprofit private agencies for the purpose of developing local facilities to deal primarily with the immediate needs of runaways. Bases the size of such grants upon the number of runaway children in a community and the existing availability of services. Authorizes the appropriation of up to $10,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1974, 1975, and 1976 for the operation and construction of facilities for care of runaway juveniles. Limits the Federal share for the construction of new facilities to 50 percent. Limits the Federal share for the acquisition and renovation of existing structures, the provision of counseling services, staff training and general operation costs to 90 percent for any fiscal year. Authorizes the appropriation of up to $500,000 to carry out a comprehensive statistical survey defining the major characteristics of the runaway youth population and determining the areas of the country most affected. Requires a report by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare on such survey to the Congress not later than June 30, 1973."
