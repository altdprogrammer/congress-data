    "text": "Congressional Budgetary Control Act - Provides that within 30 days after the President transmits the budget of the United States Government to Congress for any fiscal year, the Joint Committee on the Budget created under Public Law 92-599 shall determine and report to Congress a recommended maximum limitation of the aggregate amount to be appropriated for such fiscal year. Requires the Congress, within 30 days after such recommendations, to establish by concurrent resolution a maximum limitation on the aggregate amount to be appropriated for such fiscal year. States that no appropriation legislation shall be in order for consideration by the House of Representatives or the Senate which exceeds the fiscal year limitation unless it contains: (1) a rescission of an equivalent amount of unobligated appropriations for the fiscal year; or (2) an amendment increasing the total appropriation limitation. Requires each edition of the House and Senate calendars to include: (1) a list indicating the legislative history of each appropriation bill; and (2) a compilation indicating the appropriations limitation and the aggregate amount appropriated by bills approved by the House, Senate, and President respectively. Provides that the fiscal year shall coincide with the calendar year. Authorizes the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to conduct a complete study of the Federal budgetary process, and to report to the Congress his recommendations for an orderly transition of all U.S. departments from a fiscal year basis to a calendar year basis. Extends the Joint Committee on the Budget beyond the 93d Congress, 1st Session."
