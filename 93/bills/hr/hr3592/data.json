    "text": "Forestry Incentives Act - States the declaration of the Congress that the Nation's growing demands on forests and related land resources cannot be met by intensive management of Federal lands and industrial forests alone. Declares that a forestry incentives program is necessary to supplement existing forestry assistance programs to further motivate, encourage and involve the owners of non-Federal public forest lands in actions needed to protect, develop, and manage their forest lands at a level adequate to meet emerging national demands. Authorizes and directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop and carry out a forestry incentives program to encourage the protection, development and management of small nonindustrial private lands and non-Federal public forest lands. Authorizes the appropriation of up to $25,000,000 to carry out the provisions of this Act."
