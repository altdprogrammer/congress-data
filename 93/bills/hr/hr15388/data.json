    "text": "Expresses the findings of Congress, including that: (1) fish populations of the world have been steadily declining; (2) one of the world's most important salmon fisheries is the sockeye salmon fishery of Bristol Bay, Alaska; and (3) provisions for the rehabilitation of fisheries which have failed have been inadequate. Increases, under the Commercial Fisheries Research and Development Act of 1964, from $1,500,000 to $5,000,000, the funds to restore fisheries, giving preference to those States where there is a commerical fishery failure due to a resource disaster arising from natural causes, from foreign violations of international fisheries agreements, or from undetermined causes."
