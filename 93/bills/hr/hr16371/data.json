Defines the terms used in this Act. Establishes the Solar Energy Coordination and Management Project to have responsibility for management and coordination of a national solar energy research, development and demonstration program. Directs the Project to carry out its duties in cooperation with specified Federal agencies, including the Atomic Energy Commission and the Federal Power Commission. Instructs the Chairman of the Project to initiate a solar energy resource determination and assessment program. emphasizing identification of promising areas for commercial exploitation and development. Enumerates the specific goals of the determination and assessment program. Directs the Chairman of the Project: (1) to initiate a research and development program for resolving the major technical problems inhibiting commercial utilization of solar energy in the United States; (2) to implement a research and development program to demonstrate the technological means for securing and utilizing the solar energy resource base; and (3) to initiate a program to design and construct facilities to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing the various forms of solar energy. Details the goals of each such program. Authorizes the National Science Foundation to support, coordinate, and encourage the development of policies set forth in this Act. Establishes a Solar Energy Research Institute to perform research functions in connection with the Project activities under this Act. Calls for the creation of a Solar Energy Information Data Bank, specifying the content of data to be collected and compiled. Authorizes to be appropriated to the National Science Foundation for fiscal year 1975, $2,000,000 for use in the preparation of the comprehensive program. Authorizes to be appropriated to carry out this Act, for fiscal years beginning after fiscal year 1975, such sums as the Congress may hereafter authorize."
