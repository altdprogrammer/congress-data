    "text": "Independent Special Prosecution Act - Establishes an Office of Special Prosecutor. Empowers the office to investigate: (1) possible violations of Federal law, and possible instances of official misconduct by Federal officials, which occurred in connection with the 1972 Presidential primaries and general election and any campaign, canvass, or other activities related to such election; and (2) allegations of other illegal conduct or official misconduct on the part of Richard M. Nixon, members of the White House staff, or Presidential appointees. Provides that the Office shall be headed by a Special Prosecutor, who shall be appointed by the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. States that the Special Prosecutor shall serve for a term beginning upon his appointment and ending on June 30, 1977, and shall be removable only by impeachment. Provides that the Special Prosecutor is vested with all of the powers and duties of the Attorney General of the United States and of the United States attorney in any judicial district of the United States in which legal proceedings are or may be brought under this Act. States that the Office shall remain in existence until such time as the Special Prosecutor certifies to the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia that all investigations and prosecutions conducted under this Act have been completed, or on June 30, 1977, whichever occurs first. Authorizes appropriation of sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Such sums shall remain available, without fiscal year limitation, until expended. States that in the event that any person initiates legal proceedings challenging the constitutionality of any provision of this Act, the Office shall have the right to defend the constitutionality of this Act in any such proceeding, and shall be entitled to utilize the funds transferred or appropriated to the Office to defray any expenses incurred in the course of such a defense."
