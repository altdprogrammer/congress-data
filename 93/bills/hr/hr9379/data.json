    "text": "Expresses the finding of Congress that wild and domestic animals and birds are needlessly maimed through the use of steel leghold traps. Declares it to be the policy of Congress to prevent this unnecessary suffering through discouraging the use of such traps and devices. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to issue regulations relating to acceptable means for the trapping and capturing of mammals and birds on Federal lands in a humane manner. Establishes an advisory commission to advise the Secretary with respect to traps designed for capturing mammals or birds. Provides criminal penalties for (1) transporting unapproved traps in interstate or foreign commerce; (2) interstate shipment of hides or feathers taken by unapproved traps; and (3) placing unapproved traps on Federal lands. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
