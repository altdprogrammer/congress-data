    "date": "1973-05-21", 
    "text": "Title I: General Management Authority - National Resource Land Management Act - Presents the declaration of the Congress that the national resource lands are a vital national asset containing a wide variety of natural resource values and that the national interest will best be served by retaining the national resource lands in Federal ownership except where the Secretary determines that disposal of particular tracts of national resource lands is consistent with the purposes, terms, and conditions of this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage the national resource lands under principles of multiple use and sustained yield in a manner which will, using all practicable means and measures, protect the environmental quality of the national resource lands to assure their continued value for present and future generations. Provides that the use, occupancy, or development of any portion of the national resource lands contrary to any regulation of the Secretary or contrary to any order issued pursuant to any such regulations is unlawful and prohibited. Provides that the Secretary shall prepare and maintain on a continuing basis an inventory of all national resource lands and their resources, giving priority to areas of critical environmental concern. Directs the Secretary in conjunction with public participation, to develop, maintain and, when appropriate, revise land use plans for the national resource lands consistent with the terms and conditions of this Act. Requires that in the development and maintenance of land use plans the Secretary shall: (1) use a systematic interdisciplinary approach to achieve integrated consideration of physical, biological, economic, and social sciences; (2) give priority to the designation of areas of critical environmental concern; (3) rely, to the extent it is available, on the inventory of the national resource lands and their resources; (4) consider all present and potential uses of the lands; (5) consider the relative scarcity of the values involved and the availability of alternative means including the need for recycling and sites for realization of those values; (6) weigh long-term public benefits against more immediate local or individual benefits; and (7) consider the requirements of applicable pollution control laws. Title II: Sale Authority - Authorizes the Secretary to sell tracts of national resource lands for fair market value if they are isolated and not suitable for management by the Bureau of Land Management or any other Federal agency, if they were purchased for a specific purpose and are no longer suitable for that or any other Federal purpose or if transfer would serve an overriding public benefit. Authorizes the Secretary in specified instances to sell reserved mineral interests in lands to the surface owners. Title III: Management Implementing Authority - Provides the authority to acquire, by purchase or exchange, lands necessary for authorized programs or for blocking up existing land holdings. Provides authority to issue a document of disclaimer of interest in land to which the United States no longer claims as interest. Establishes a working capital fund for the Bureau of Land Management and affords a specified method of accounting for various programs and service operations of the Bureau of Land Management. Makes violations of laws or regulations pertaining to national resource land a crime and by vested enforcement authority in certain designated Departmental employees. Authorizes the Secretary to cooperate with State and local law enforcement agencies and to reimburse the agencies for services on national resource lands. Title IV: Authority to Grant Rights-of-Way - Authorizes the Secretary to grant rights-of-way for such purposes as pipelines, powerlines and roads. Specifies conditions for granting such rights-of-way including provisions for protection of the environment. Title V: Preservation of Valid Existing Rights and Repeal of obsolete and Superseded Law - Provides for the repeal of specified laws. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed as a limitation upon any State criminal statute."
