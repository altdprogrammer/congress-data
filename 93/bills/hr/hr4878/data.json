    "text": "Travel Agents Registration Act - Declares the finding of Congress that it is in the public interest to strengthen the travel agency industry and to maintain public confidence in travel agents by regulating travel agents. Provides that on and after January 1, 1973, no person shall, directly or indirectly, engage in the business of conducting a travel agency without having first received a registration certificate as provided by this Act. Establishes in the Department of Transportation a Bureau of Travel Agents Registration, headed by a Director appointed by the Secretary of Transportation. Establishes a Travel Agents Registration Board to advise the Director and to pass on applications for registration certificates. Provides that the Director shall promulgate such rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, those necessary to require sound financial practices by registered travel agents and those considered necessary to carry out the purposes of this title. Provides that the Secretary shall establish such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out this Act, and shall promulgate a binding code of ethics for the travel agency industry. Requires the granting of a certificate by the Director if the applicant was conducting a travel agency on September 3, 1968, has been doing so for two or more years, and has been approved for appointment as an agent for two or more years by two or more conferences of air or steamship carriers, unless the Director makes a specific determination that the applicant lacks good character or financial integrity. Provides that when an application for a registration certificate shall have been examined by the Director and the Director, with the advice of the Board, has determined that the applicant has complied with the rules and regulations promulgated by the Director and the Director, with the advice of the Board, shall have determined that the applicant, if issued a certificate of authorization, would provide a useful public service, the Director shall issue and deliver a registration certificate to the applicant. Provides that a registration certificate shall not be issued to any person who has been convicted in any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a possession of the United States, of a felony or a crime concerning activities prohibited by this Act. Provides that registration certificates issued pursuant to this title shall not be assignable or transferable, and shall expire every second year. Provides for a fine of up to $1,000 upon a finding that the holder of a registration certificate has engaged in any of the following practices: (1) fraud or bribery in securing a registration certificate issued pursuant to this title; (2) the making of any false statement as to a material matter in any application or other statement required by or pursuant to this title; (3) violation of any provision of this title or any code, rule, or regulation adopted hereunder; (4) any fraud or fraudulent practice in the operation and conduct of a travel agency business including, but not limited to, intentionally misleading advertising; (5) activities prohibited by this title leading to conviction of a misdemeanor; and (6) activities leading to conviction of a felony. Provides for the revocation of the certificates of a registered agency for violations of this title after an opportunity for a hearing and review by the United States court of appeals Provides penalties of up to $500 or imprisonment of not more than 6 months, or both, for any knowing and willful violations of this title."
