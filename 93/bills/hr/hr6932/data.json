    "text": "Veterans Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation Act - Requires the Administrator of the Veterans' Administration to furnish to any veteran for a drug dependence or drug abuse disability such special medical treatment and rehabilitative services and such hospital and domiciliary care as he finds to be reasonably necessary to bring about the veteran's recovery and rehabilitation from such disability. Requires that in contracting for treatment and rehabilitative services in non-Veterans' Administration facilities, the Administrator shall, wherever feasible, give priority to community-based, multiple-modality, treatment and rehabilitation programs which employ peer group veterans and stress outreach efforts to identify and counsel veterans eligible for treatment and rehabilitative services under this Act. Directs the Administrator to utilize all available resources of the Veterans' Administration in seeking out and counseling toward treatment and rehabilitation of all veterans eligible for treatment and rehabilitation under this Act. Provides that the Administrator shall, to the maximum extent feasible, contract for the services of or employ former addict veterans. Establishes the Special Rehabilivation Revolving Fund for special rehabilitation programs of education and training of specified veterans. Requires an annual audit of the Fund by the Comptroller General. Requires the Administrator to submit to the Congress six months after the enactment of this Act and thereafter on each February 1 a full report on the implementation of this Act, with respect to drug dependency and abuse, and an evaluation of the effectiveness of alternate treatment and rehabilitation programs provided."
