    "text": "States that no law providing for the punishment of persons evading or refusing registration for the military service of the United States, or of persons evading or refusing induction in the Armed Forces shall apply to any person who has evaded or refused such registration or induction during the period August 4, 1964, to March 29, 1973, if such person: (1) presents himself to the National Amnesty Board within two years after the date of the enactment of this Act, or that date on which all missing in action have been accounted for, whichever date is later; (2) agrees to serve for two years in the Armed Forces or to serve in alternate civilian service; and (3) agrees to begin and continue such service at specified pay grades. Empowers the National Amnesty Board to waive in part or in whole such service requirement. Provides that any person who has been convicted and is serving a prison sentence for evading or failing to register for the military service during August 4, 1964, and March 29, 1973, or for evading or refusing induction in the Armed Forces of the United States during such period shall be released from prison, and the remaining portion of any punishment shall be waived, if such person complies with the conditions of amnesty set forth in this Act, except that the two-year period of service shall be reduced by the period served in prison with respect to his conviction. Waives the service requirement completely for persons who have served at least eighteen months in prison because of such conviction. Establishes the National Amnesty Board. Authorizes the Board: (1) to issue such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out effectively the provisions of this Act; and (2) to review such other cases involving offenses against the United States as the President considers appropriate for such review consistent with the purposes of this Act."
