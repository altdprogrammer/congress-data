    "text": "Meetinghouse Preservation Act - States that the purpose of this Act is: (1) to celebrate the Bicentennial of this country through the preservation within each of the several States of a historic site that might otherwise be lost; (2) to provide a meetingplace in each of the several States for those citizens interested in retaining their tangible, indigenous heritage, whether historic, cultural, or natural, in planning for future changes and developments, and (3) to give existing State programs involved with preserving of historic and architecturally important structures an illustration of the best possible techniques used in the preservation of such historic sites and structures, and the multiple, significant ways in which such sites and structures can be used. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make grants to each of the several States for the purpose of enabling each State to acquire and restore an historic site within each State for use as a meetinghouse in accordance with the provisions of this Act, except that no grant to any one State shall exceed $1,000,000. Provides that any application for a grant under this Act shall contain an estimated budget of various acquisition, restoration, and maintenance expenses. Sets forth provisions governing the approval of any application. Establishes a Meetinghouse Coordination Board to review each application made in accordance with the provisions of this Act for the purpose of making recommendations to the Secretary as to which of the historic site or sites contained in such application should be approved by the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
