    "text": "States that a refiner or distributor shall not cancel, fail to renew, or otherwise terminate a franchise unless he furnishes prior notification in writing to such distributor or retailer by certified mail not less than ninety days prior to the date on which such franchise will be canceled, not renewed, or otherwise terminated. Provides that a franchisor shall not cancel, fail to renew, or otherwise terminate a franchise unless: (1) the retailer or distributor whose franchise is terminated fails to comply substantially with any essential and reasonable requirement of such franchise or fails to act in good faith in carrying out the terms of such franchise, or (2) such franchisor does not engage during the three-year period beginning on the date of such cancellation in the sale of refined petroleum products in commerce for sale other than resale in the State and the metropolitan area in which the franchise was located, and satisfied the court in any action under this Act that such cancellation is a product of a good faith business judgment of such franchisor. Provides that, if a refiner or distributor engages in conduct prohibited under this Act, a retailer or a distributor may maintain a suit against such refiner or distributor. Provides that the provisions of this Act will expire at midnight June 30, 1975, but that such expiration shall not affect any pending action or proceeding."
