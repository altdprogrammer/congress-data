Requires the President to cease the impounding of funds set forth in each special message within sixty calendar days of continuous session after the message is received by the Congress unless the specific impoundment shall have been disapproved by the Congress by passage of a concurrent resolution in accordance with the procedure under this Act. Directs any resolution introduced with respect to a special message to be referred to the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives or the Senate. Directs the Committee to make a motion to proceed to consideration of the resolution, and forbids amendments to this motion. Limits debate on the resolution to not more than two hours, divided equally between those in favor and and those opposed to the resolution. Forbids amendment to the resolution, debate on motions to postpone and motions to proceed to consideration of other business, and all appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules of the Senate or House of Representatives to the procedure relating to any resolution."
