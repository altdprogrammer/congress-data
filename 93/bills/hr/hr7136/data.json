    "text": "Handicapped Workers' Employment Opportunity Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Labor or his designate to pay sums to a nonprofit sheltered workshop, under agreement with a manufacturer, for the cost to the workshop of performing work normally exported for completion by workers in a foreign country. Specifies that such amount shall take into account the payment received by the sheltered workshop from the manufacturer for performance of the work, if such payment by the manufacturer is equal to or greater than the cost which the manufacturer would have incurred by having such work performed in a foreign nation. Directs the Bureau of Foreign Commerce of the Department of Commerce to conduct a survey of the types of work that may be performed outside of the United States for manufacturers located in the United States, and to publish in the Federal States, and to publish in the Federal Register a list of the average costs incurred by such manufacturers for such work. Defines \"sheltered workshop,\" \"handicapped person,\" and \"nonprofit,' for purposes of this Act."
