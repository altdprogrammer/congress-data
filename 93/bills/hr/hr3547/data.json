Requires a pistol club desiring to be licensed under this chapter to file an application for such license with the Secretary. Establishes a $25 annual fee for such license. Directs such clubs to meet various requirement in order to have their applications approved. Provides for administrative and judicial review in the case of a license denial or revocation by the Secretary. Provides that whoever violates any provision of this chapter or knowingly makes any false statement or representation with respect to the information required by the provisions of this chapter to be kept in the records of a pistol club licensed under this chapter, or in applying for any license under the provisions of this chapter, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, and shall become eligible for parole as the Board of Parole shall determine. Provides that any handgun involved or used in or intended to be used in any violation of the provisions of this chapter or chapter 44 (firearms legislation) of title 18, United States Code, or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, or any violation of any other criminal law of the United States, shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture. Exempts from the provisions of this Act the importation, manufacture, sale, purchase, transfer, receipt, or transportation of any handgun which the Secretary determines is: (1) being imported or manufactured for, sold, or transferred to, purchased, received, or transported by, or issued for the use of, the United States or any department or agency thereof or any state or any department, agency, or political subdivision thereof; (2) unserviceable, not restorable to firing condition, and intended for use as a curio, museum piece, or collectors' item; and (3) a professional security guard service which is licensed by the State in which the handgun is to be used and which is authorized to provide armed security guards for hire. Establishes procedures for the reimbursement of a person who voluntarily delivers a handgun to a law enforcement agency.
