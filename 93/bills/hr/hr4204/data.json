Authorizes $700,000,000 for fiscal 1974 and $1,000,000 for fiscal 1975 to fund the Special Employment Assistance Program. Provides that an application for financial assistance for a public service employment program under this Act shall include specified provisions concerning local education agencies' manpower needs, and non-infringement upon currently filled public service. Extends to labor organizations the opportunity to submit comments with respect to an application for assistance under this Act. Earmarks not less than 2 percent of the funds under the Act for special public service employment programs for Indians. Redefines \"unemployed\" for purposes of the Act so as not to apply different criteria on account of a person's previous employment. Amends 42 U.S.C. 4874-4877, 4883"
