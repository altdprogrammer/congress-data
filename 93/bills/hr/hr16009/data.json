Provides that the interest on the balance of such loans made to cover losses resulting from a major disaster shall be one percent, and that such loan payments may be deferred. Authorizes the refinancing of any mortgage or other liens outstanding against the destroyed or damaged property if such property is to be repaired, rehabilitated, or replaced, except that the amount refinanced shall not exceed the amount of physical loss sustained."
