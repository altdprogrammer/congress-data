    "text": "Forest and Rangeland Environmental Management Act - States that in recognition of the vital importance of America's renewable resources of the forest, range, and other associated lands to the Nation's social and economic well being, and in recognition of the necessity for a long term perspective in planning and undertaking national renewable resource programs, the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Forest Service, shall prepare a National Renewable Resource Situation Assessment. Provides that the Assessment shall be updated by the Secretary of Agriculture not less than every five years nor more than every ten years thereafter and shall include but not be limited to: (1) a detailed discussion of present and anticipated uses, demand for, and supply of renewable resources; (2) a general inventory of these present and potential renewable resources and opportunities for improving the yield of tangible and intangible goods and services; (3) a description of Forest Service programs and responsibilities in research, cooperative programs, and management of the National Forest System; and (4) a detailed study of Forest Service personnel requirements as needed to satisfy existing and on-going programs. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make and keep current a comprehensive survey and analysis of the present and prospective conditions of and requirements for the renewable resources of the United States, its territories and possessions, and of the supplies of such renewable resources, including a determination of the present and potential productivity of the land, and of such other facts as may be necessary and useful in the determination of ways and means needed to balance the demand for and supply of these renewable resources, benefits and uses in meeting the needs of the people of the United States. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to prepare and keep current a program set forth in appropriate detail, for each of the next five decades, for protection, management, and development of the National Forest System, including forest development roads and trails, for cooperative programs on non-Federal lands, and for research. States that on the date Congress first convenes in 1975 and thereafter at not less than ten-year intervals the President shall transmit to the Congress, when it convenes, the assessment and the program required under this Act, with recommendations for each of the five decades ahead. Provides that, commencing with the fiscal budget for the year ending June 30, 1976, requests presented by the President to the Congress covering Forest Service and related agencies' activities shall express in qualitative and quantitative terms the extent to which the programs and policies projected under that budget meet the goals and policies established under this Act. States that the Congress hereby sets the year 2000 as the target year when the renewable resources of the National Forest System shall be in an operating posture whereby all backlogs of needed treatment for their restoration shall be reduced to a current basis and the major portion of planned intensive management procedures shall be installed and operating on an environmentally sound basis."
