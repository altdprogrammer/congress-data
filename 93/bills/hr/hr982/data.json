    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Excludes the following classes of persons from eligibility under the Immigration and Nationality Act to adjust their status from nonimmigrants to that of permanent resident aliens without leaving the United States to secure an immigrant visa: (1) aliens who are not immediate relatives and who accept unauthorized employment prior to filing adjustment applications; and (2) aliens who have been admitted in transit without visa. Restores adjustment of status eligibility to Western Hemisphere aliens. Makes it unlawful for any employer to knowingly employ, refer for employment, or continue to employ any alien in the United States who has not been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, unless the employment of such alien is authorized by the Attorney General. Sets forth procedures for determining employers' violations of this section. Provides that such violations shall be punishable by a penalty of not more than $500 for each such alien employed. Provides that a second such violation shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both. Provides that any vessel, vehicle, or aircraft which has been or is being used in furtherance of a violation shall be seized and forfeited. Directs any officer or employee of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to disclose to the Immigration and Naturalization Service the name and most recent address of any illegal alien who is receiving assistance under the Social Security Act."
