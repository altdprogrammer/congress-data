    "text": "Senior Citizens Job Corps Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to establish a senior citizen community service employment program by entering into agreement with public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations, agencies of a State government or a political subdivision of a State, or a combination of such political subdivisions. Provides that no payments shall be made by the Secretary toward the cost of any project established or administered by any such agency or organization unless he determines that such project: (1) will provide employment only for eligible individuals; (2) will provide employment for eligible individuals in the community in which such individuals reside; (3) will employ eligible individuals in services related to publicly owned and operated facilities and projects; (4) will contribute to the general welfare of the community; (5) will provide employment for eligible individuals who do not have opportunities for other suitable public or private employment; (6) will result in an increase in employment opportunities for eligible individuals; (7) will include short-term training as may be necessary to make the most effective use of the skills and talents of those individuals who are participating; (8) will assure that safe and healthy conditions of work will be provided; and (9) will be established or administered with the advice of persons competent in the field of service in which employment is being provided. Authorizes the Secretary to pay the entire cost of any project which is the subject of an agreement entered into under this Act. Provides that no contract shall be entered into under this Act with a contractor who is, or whose employees are, under State law, exempted from the operation of the State workmen's compensation law generally applicable to employees, unless the contractor shall undertake to provide either through insurance by a recognized carrier, or by self insurance, as allowed by State law, that the persons employed under the contract shall enjoy workmen's compensation coverage equal to that provided by law for covered employment. Provides that the Secretary shall consult and cooperate with the Office of Economic Opportunity, the Administration on Aging, and any other Federal agency administering a related program or programs, with a view to achieving optimal, coordination with such other programs and shall promote the coordination of projects under this Act with other public and private programs or projects of a similar nature. Authorizes to be appropriated $35,000,000 for fiscal year 1974 and $60,000,000 for fiscal year 1975 to carry out the purpose of this Act."
