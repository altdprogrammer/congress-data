Provides that in the case of an eligible veteran who is pursuing a program of education under this Act on a half-time or more basis, other than a program exclusively by correspondence or a program of flight training, the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs shall pay directly to the educational institution on behalf of such veteran the customary cost of tuition (including such laboratory, library, or other similar fees as are customary, as well as the costs of books, supplies, equipment, and other necessary expenses, excluding board, lodging, other living expenses, and travel) which similarly circumstanced non-veterans enrolled in the same courses are required to pay. Provides that in no event shall the payment authorized by this Act exceed $4,000 for an ordinary school year. Provides that if the educational institution has no customary cost of tuition, a fair and reasonable rate of payment for tuition, fees, or other charges for such course or courses shall be determined by the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs."
