    "text": "United States Housing Act - Declares that it is the policy of the United States to promote the general welfare of the Nation by employing its funds and credit to assist the States to remedy unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and shortages of decent dwellings for families of low income. States that no person should be barred from serving on the governing body of a local public housing agency because of his tenancy in a low-income housing project. Defines the terms used in this Act. Empowers the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to make loans to public housing agencies to help finance or refinance the development, acquisition, or operation of low-income housing projects. States that the Secretary may have outstanding at any one time obligations in an amount of up to $1,500,000,000. Authorizes the Secretary to make annual contributions to public housing agencies to assist in achieving and maintaining the low-income character of their projects. Sets forth the aggregate allowable amounts for such contributions for fiscal years 1970 through 1975. Requires that specified amounts be available only for low-income housing for persons who are members of any Indian tribe, band, pueblo, group, or community of Indians or Alaska Natives which is recognized as eligible for service from the Bureau of Indian Affairs or who are the wards of any State government. States that any contract for loans or annual contributions entered into by the Secretary with a public housing agency may cover one or more low-income housing projects. Empowers the Secretary, subject to specific limitations, to consent to the modification, with respect to the rate of interest, time of payment, security, or any other term, of any contract. Provides that the Secretary may include in any contract conditions to insure the low-income character of the project involved, and that no otherwise eligible applicant shall be excluded from any project because of race, religion, nationality, age, sex, marital status, or amount or source of income. Sets forth additional contract provisions and requirements. Directs the Secretary to encourage public housing agencies, in providing housing predominantly for displaced, elderly, or handicapped families, to design, develop, or otherwise acquire such housing to meet the special needs of the occupants and, wherever practicable, for use in whole or in part as congregate housing. States that each public housing agency may provide low-rent housing in private accommodations where such housing can be provided at a cost equal to or less than housing in projects assisted under other provisions of this Act. Empowers the Secretary to make annual contributions to public housing agencies for the operation of low-income housing projects in the amount required: (1) to assure the low-income character of the projects involved, and (2) to achieve and maintain adequate operating services and reserve funds. Sets forth general provisions governing the actions by the Secretary with respect to the functions, powers, and duties vested in him by this Act. Prescribes the labor standards required in any contracts made under this Act. Permits the exemption of specified projects from the rental formula."
