    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to private nonprofit organizations and any public agency of a unit of local government in any State to develop programs to detect and treat incidents of lead-based paint poisoning under the Lead Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act. Increases from seventy-five percent to ninety percent the limit on the Federal share of the cost of developing such programs. Stipulates that any organizations receiving funds under the Act shall make available to the Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United States any books and records necessary to assist them in auditing funds received under this Act. Directs the Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission to conduct appropriate research on multiple layers of dried paint film, containing the various lead compounds commonly used, in order to ascertain the safe level of lead in residential paint products. States that, not later than December 31, 1974, the Chairman shall submit to Congress a full report of his findings and recommendations as developed pursuant to such programs. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to establish procedures to eliminate the hazards of lead based paint poisoning in any housing which is covered by an application for mortgage insurance or housing assistance payments under a program administered by him. Lowers the percentage of lead contained in a paint to five-tenths of 1 percent lead by weight in order to be designated a lead-based paint under this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $20,000,000 yearly for fiscal years 1974-75 for grants used for the detection and treatment of lead-based paint poisoning; $30,000,000 yearly for fiscal years 1974-75 for grants used for the elimination of lead-based paint poisoning; and $2,500,000 yearly for fiscal years 1974-75 for Federal demonstration and research programs on the elimination of lead-based paint poisoning. Establishes a National Childhood Lead Based Paint Poisoning Advisory Board to advise the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare on policy relating to the administration of this Act. States that the Act shall supersede all State and local laws relating to lead content in paints. Amends 42 U.S.C. 4801-43"
