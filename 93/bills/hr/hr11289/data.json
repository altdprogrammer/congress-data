    "text": "Establishes an Independent Office of Special Prosecutor to be administered by and act under the direction of a Special Prosecutor to be appointed by the United States Federal District Court for the District of Columbia with the advice and consent of the Senate. States that the independent Office of Special Prosecutor shall have full exclusive authority and responsibility for investigating and prosecuting criminal and civil offenses against the United States by any person arising out of: (1) the unauthorized entry on June 17, 1972, into offices maintained by the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate Office Building in Washington, District of Columbia; (2) conduct and activities related to the Presidential campaigns, primaries, and election of 1972; (3) allegations of criminal offenses involving the President, members of the White House staff, or other Presidential appointees; and (4) such new matters, bearing a proximate relation to the foregoing, as the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia may deem appropriate for assignment to the Special Prosecutor, and which the Special Prosecutor consents to accept. Provides that no Special Prosecutor for any such offenses shall be appointed in any manner other than that provided under this Act. Grants the Special Prosecutor full power and authority to review all documentary evidence available from any source; and determine whether or not to contest the assertion of Executive Privilege or any other testimonial privilege. Provides that the Special Prosecutor shall report to the chairman and the ranking Republican of the House Judiciary Committee with respect to any investigation relating to impeachable offenses committed by the President. Provides that neither the district court, nor the President of the United States, nor the Attorney General, nor any other officer of the United States shall have any authority to direct, countermand or interfere with any action taken by the Special Prosecution in carrying out responsibilities pursuant to this Act. States that the United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have authority to remove the Special Prosecutor or the Deputy Special Prsoecutor for neglect of duty, willful violation of the provisions of this Act, or the commission of extraordinary improprieties, but for no other cause. Provides that if the President determines that actions or omissions by the Special Prosecutor prevent or materially impair the faithful execution of the laws of the United States he shall petition the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for the removal of the Special Prosecutor setting forth, in detail, the basis of his determination. Provides that the Office of Special Prosecutor shall remain in existance until such time as the Special Prosecutor certifies to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia that all investigations and prosecutions conducted pursuant to this Act have been completed. Authorizes appropriations to the Office of Special Prosecutor of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
