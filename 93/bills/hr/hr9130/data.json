    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) =Title I:= Limits the width of a right-of-way through the public lands for pipelines to fifty feet plus the ground occupied by the pipeline, unless the Secretary of the Interior finds that in limited areas a wider right-of-way is reasonably necessary for operation and maintenance after construction, or to protect the environment or public safety. Requires the Secretary to notify the House and Senate Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs promptly upon receipt of an application for a right-of-way for a pipeline twenty-four inches or more in diameter. States that no right-of-way for such pipeline shall be granted until sixty days after a notice of intention to grant the right-of-way has been submitted to such committees, unless each committee by resolution waives the waiting period. =Title II: Trans-Alaskan Pipeline Authorization Act= - Requires the Secretary of the Interior to report annually to the House and Senate Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs on the safety and environmental requirements imposed by this Act; and to establish by regulation, including public hearings, procedures giving Federal, State, and local government agencies and the public adequate notice and opportunity to comment upon right-of-way applications. Extends to non-Federal land the requirement that pipelines on such land must accept, convey, transport, or purchase without discrimination, oil or gas delivered to the line. Requires examination of pipelines and facilities on public lands to discover leaks and possible leaks. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the President, the Congress, the Secretary of Transportation and the Interstate Commerce Commission on any dangers of explosions or spillage on public lands, including a statement of corrective action taken. =Title II: Trans-Alaskan Pipeline Authorization Act= - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to grant, in accordance with the provisions of this Act and without further action under the National Environmental Policy Act, such rights-of-way and permits as he deems necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of a trans-Alaskan oil pipeline. Requires rights-of-way to include terms and conditions providing for liability of rights-of-way holders to any Alaska Native or Native Organization for injuries or damages, including those to fish and wildlife and other natural resources, arising from activities conducted by such holders. Directs the Secretary to take action to assure that no person shall on grounds of race or sex be excluded from participating in activities conducted under rights-of-way. Provides that any action or proceeding involving a right-of-way, to which the United States is a party, shall be brought in a United States district court and shall take precedence over all other pending matters. Provides that any review may be had only upon direct appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. Prohibits the Secretary of Labor from issuing short-term clearances to foreign nationals for construction, operation, or maintenance of the pipeline when unemployment is 4.5 percent or above. Requires that any crude oil exports must be approved by Congress. Provides that holders of rights-of-way be strictly liable for all damages resulting from discharges of oil from vessels owned, operated or leased by or for such holders. Requires such holders to post a bond that shall at all times be adequate to cover any judgment recovered against the holder. Requires such holders to pay for the control and total removal of pollution, caused by operations of such holders, which damages or threatens aquatic life, wildlife, or public or private property. Directs the Secretary to report at least semiannually to the House and Senate Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs on construction progress on the trans-Alaskan pipeline and on the implementation of environmental stipulations, and to issue a cease-and-desist order to halt construction of the pipeline when stipulations attached to rights-of-way are not being implemented or when significant damage to the environment may occur if construction is not halted. Requires materials for the pipeline to be manufactured in the United States. Authorizes the Secretary to investigate the feasibility of one or more oil or gas pipelines from the north slope of Alaska to connect with a pipeline through Canada that will deliver oil or gas to United States markets. Authorizes the President to enter into negotiations with the Government of Canada to determine the terms and conditions under which pipelines or other transportation systems could be constructed across Canadian territory for the transport of oil and gas from Alaska's north slope to markets in the United States."
