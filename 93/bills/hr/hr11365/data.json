Transfers specified duties and functions to the Attorney General. Abolishes the Advisory Corrections Council and the Federal Board of Parole. Establishes in the Department of Justice the Criminal Justice Services Administration to be headed by an Administrator appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Provides for a Deputy Administrator of the Criminal Justice Services Administration. Creates within the Administration the National Criminal Justice Board to be composed of eleven members (one from each judicial circuit) who shall represent diverse backgrounds. Makes it the duty of such Board: (1) to formulate, promulgate, and oversee a national policy on the treatment of persons under the jurisdiction of courts of the United States; (2) to prescribe the duties of probation officers; and (3) to perform such other duties as the Administrator may require. Provides for the publication of proposed guidelines, for making objections thereto, and for the holding of public hearings on such objections. Establishes in each judicial district a Criminal Justice Office, composed of not less than three members appointed by the Attorney General. Provides that immediately following the arrest of a person charged with a Federal offense, the case shall be assigned to the appropriate District Office, which shall: (1) investigate the defendant's background and the circumstances surrounding the alleged offense and make such information available to the appropriate judicial officer or court, along with a recommendation as to the setting of bail; (2) recommend, if indicated, mental observation; (3) submit, within thirty days of arrest, a written report to the counsel of record for such defendant, and the office of the United States Attorney having jurisdiction over the case, and the appropriate judicial officer or court. States that such report shall set forth the findings and conclusions of the District Office as to any physical, mental, social, economic, or other problems of the defendant, and shall state whether diversion of the defendant from the criminal justice system of prosecution is desirable and, if desirable, the type of diversion recommended. Provides for the filing of additional reports by the Office when a defendant is convicted of a Federal offense. Specifies the content of such reports, including recommended sentence, reason for imprisonment and goals for the offender to attain while imprisoned. Directs the District Office to carry out, with respect to a defendant who has been sentenced, the function relating to probation, parole, or other form of release transferred to the Administration by the Federal Criminal Justice System Reorganization Act. Establishes within the Administration a Bureau of Juvenile Justice which shall be headed by a Director, appointed by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Makes the Director responsible for all functions transferred to the Administration pursuant to the Federal Criminal Justice System Reorganization Act. Establishes within the Administration the Office of Ombudsman of the Federal Criminal Justice System, which shall be headed by a Director. Provides that any petition for collateral review of a conviction filed by a Federal offender, or any petition filed by an inmate in a State or Federal penal or correctional institution for redress of grievances concerning conditions within such institution, may be referred by the court to the Office of Ombudsman of the Federal Criminal Justice System. Provides that the Office shall have ninety days within which to consider such petition and, if possible, to resolve the matter contained therein. Creates, within the Administration, the Bureau of Federal Criminal Justice Coordination which shall conduct a continuing study of all Federal activities within the Federal Criminal Justice System. Provides that the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration and the Bureau of Prisons shall be within the Administration. Authorizes necessary appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
