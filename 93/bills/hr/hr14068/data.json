Requires any person who sells or distributes number 1 fuel oil or number 2 fuel oil to provide for the marking of such fuel oil in accordance with rules which the Administrator shall prescribe under this Act, except that such fuel oil shall not be marked if such fuel oil is to be used in a manner which makes it subject to such tax under the Internal Revenue Code. Gives the Federal Energy Office Administrator powers of inspection on business premises, in storage tanks, and in vehicles to determine compliance with this Act."
