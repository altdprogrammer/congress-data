Provides that a purchaser of a subdivision lot may revoke the contract for such purchase within 72 hours (formerly 48 hours) excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, where he received a property report less than 48 hours before he signed the contract. States that it shall be unlawful for any developer or agent to engage in interstate advertising. Provides that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit any communication, not otherwise illegal, between a developer or agent and any person who has initiated negotiations regarding the purchase of a lot or any lots in a subdivision. States that it shall be unlawful to sell or lease any lot in any subdivision unless the developer or agent gives bond to assure the completion (in substantial conformity with the estimated schedule) of the improvements to be installed by the developer as required. Provides that the expenses of every investigation of the affairs of any developer, broker, agent, or other person or organization, including any appraisal of its real property or of any real property on which it holds a mortgage, made pursuant to the authority conferred by any provision of the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, shall be borne and paid by the developer or other person or organization so investigated."
