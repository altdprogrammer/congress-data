States that when either House of Congress and its committees, to the extent of matter within their jurisdiction, requests the presence of and information from an officer or employee of a Federal agency, that officer or employee shall appear and shall supply all information requested except information specifically ordered withheld by the President in a signed statement which sets forth a detailed explanation of the grounds upon which such withholding is based. Provides that an officer or employee of an independent requlatory agency shall appear and shall supply all information requested. Empowers either House of Congress and its committees to obtain information withheld by an agency head, the President or a witness in response to a request for information or testimony under the Act, by adopting a resolution stating that the information or testimony is needed for the exercise of a valid legislative or investigative function under the Constitution and that the national interest outweighs the grounds cited by the President for withholding the information or testimony, and authorizing counsel to file a civil suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to obtain the information requested."
