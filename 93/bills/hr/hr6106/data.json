Provides that the Authority shall be governed by a board of Directors composed of three members to be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Requires that at least two of the members of the board of Directors be Indians. Directs the Authority to render legal services in regard to rights or claims of Indians to natural resources, including, but not limited to, rights to land, rights to the use of water, timber, and minerals, and rights to hunt and fish, within the United States. Provides that nothing in this Act shall absolve the Department of the Interior and the Department of Justice of their responsibilities to the Indians, except that the Department of Justice as of the effective date of this Act or as soon therafter as practicable, is relieved of its responsibility with regard to the above rights or claims. Provides that the legal services performed by the Authority may include, but shall not be limited to, the investigation and inventory of the Indians' land and water rights and the preparation and trail and appeal of cases in all courts, before Federal, State, and local commissions, and in all administrative proceedings."
