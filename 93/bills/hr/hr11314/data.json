    "text": "Emergency Daylight Savings Time Energy Conservation Act - Declares the findings of Congress, including that studies indicate that if daylight saving time were extended to be in effect year round, such action by the Federal Government could serve as an incentive for other energy conservation efforts which could lead to greatly expanded energy savings. States that these energy conservation efforts could include such actions as: (1) turning down thermostats several degrees; (2) limiting unnecessary automobile travel; (3) turning off office air-conditioners and heating plants an hour earlier in the afternoon; (4) making a conscious effort to limit unnecessary use of lights; and (5) shutting off all unnecessary office building lights and outdoor display; and the Uniform Time Act, the one hour advance in time shall continue during the period from 2 o'clock antemeridian on the last Sunday of October, 1973, until 2 o'clock antemeridian on the last Sunday of April, 1974. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) make a study to determine the amount of energy which is conserved as a result of the extension of daylight saving time; (2) report the results of such study, together with his recommendations to the President and the Congress not later than June 30, 1974."
