Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, in order to develop an effective, coordinated fish disease control program for the protection of fishery resources, to enter into cooperative agreements with the appropriate agencies of the States. Makes provisions for such agreements. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce to order the owner of any fish or article specified as diseased to destroy, disinfect, or quarantine such fish or article, and to compensate the owner for any fish destroyed. Prescribes a fine not exceeding $1,000 and/or imprisonment up to one year for persons receiving or delivering for the transport in interstate or foreign commerce any fish or article infected or contaminated by a disease.
