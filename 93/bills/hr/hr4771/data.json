    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) District of Columbia Rent Control Act - Authorizes the District of Columbia Council to adopt rules regulating rents if public hearings show that a shortage of leased or rental housing is causing overcrowding or increasing rents. States that any rules so adopted shall provide means whereby increased costs incurred by landlords shall be taken into consideration in determing the amount of rents or benefits which landlords are entitled to receive in connection with use or occupancy under the rules. Authorizes the Council to establish a temporary District of Columbia Housing Rent Commission to carry out such rules. Empowers the Commission to: (1) adopt, promulgate, amend, or rescind such rules as it deems necessary to effectuate this Act; (2) receive and review complaints by tenants with respect to violations of the rules of the Council or the Commission; and (3) grant, upon a hearing, exemptions from the rules to landlords when a serious financial hardship would be caused. Empowers the Chairman to hold such hearings, administer oaths, and require by subpena attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of records, and documents as the Commission deems advisable in carrying out its functions under this Act. Provides that in the case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpena the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, at the request of the Chairman of the Commission, shall have jurisdiction to issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Commission. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums, not to exceed $85,000, as may be necessary to carry out these provisions. Prohibits any retalitory action by landlords against tenants who exercise rights conferred by this Act or by any rule issued under this Act. Provides for judicial review of Commission decisions and for a fine of $5000 for violations of this Act or Commission or Council rules. Provides for the termination of the provisions of this Act, and all rules under it, one year after their dates of enactment. Directs the Council, on the expiration of six-month period following the effective date of rules adopted pursuant to this Act, to conduct a hearing to determine whether such rules should be modified or terminated."
