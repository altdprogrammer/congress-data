Provides that the Federal share of project costs related to the security of persons and property on the airport shall be 82 percent of the allowable costs. States that such grant agreements must have been entered into after publication in the Federal Register of Notices of Proposed Rulemaking with respect to airport security. (Amends 49 U.S.C 1711, 1714 (a)(b), 1716 (c), 1717, 1720 (b)) (Adds 49 U.S.C. 1513) Provides for an initial United States share of 100 percent of the costs of the acquisition of land for future airport development.

Title II: Air Transportation Security Act - States the finding of Congress that the United States Government must establish and maintain an air transportation security program and an air transportation security law enforcement force under the direction of the Administrator of the Federal Avaiation Administration in order to adequately assure the safety of passengers in air transportation. Provides that after June 30, 1973, no air carrier or foreign air carrier shall operate an aircraft in air transportation unless all passengers boarding that aircraft in the United States, and all such passenger's baggage brought aboard the aircraft, wherever stowed, shall have been inspected by means of a metal detection device or by an x-ray device immediately prior to boarding and have not been found to carry or contain an unauthorized explosive, device, or weapon of any kind. Prescribes civil and criminal penalties for violations of the above provisions. Authorizes to be appropriated from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund such amounts, not to exceed $5,500,000, to acquire the devices required by this Act. Provides, under the Federal Aviation Act, that the Administrator in administering the air transportation security program shall establish and maintain an air transportation security force of sufficient size to provide a law enforcement presence and capability at airports in the United States adequate to insure the safety from criminal violence and air piracy of persons traveling in air transportation or intrastate air transportation. Provides that the Administrator shall require any air carrier, intrastate air carrier, or foreign air carrier to refuse to transport: (1) any person who does not consent to a search of his person to determine whether he is unlawfully carrying a dangerous weapon, explosive, or other destructive substance; or (2) any property of any person who does not consent to a search or inspection of such property to determine whether it unlawfully contains a dangerous weapon, explosive, or other destructive substance. Extends the criminal penalties for having a dangerous weapon on one's person while on board or while attempting to board an airplane, to having such a weapon in one's property and to attempting to place such a weapon aboard an aircraft.
