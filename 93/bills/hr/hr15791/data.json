Sets forth procedures for filling vacancies in the Board of Education of the District of Columbia. Changes the fiscal year of the District of Columbia to October 1 - September 30. Authorizes the District of Columbia Council to prohibit the establishment of any horizontal property regime, real estate condominiums project, or other conversion of units in a multiunit structure into a condominium pursuant to the Horizontal Property Act of the District of Columbia. Revises the Home Rule Act by giving the Mayor rather than the Council the authority to reject any and all bids for general obligation bonds issued by the District of Columbia. Makes technical and conforming amendments in the Home Rule Act."
