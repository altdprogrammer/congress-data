States that the failure of any Government department to make timely payment of any payment authorized by this Act shall not subject: (1) any Government department, or any person who is a subsequent purchaser of any real property from any Government department, to the payment of any penalty or penalty interest, or to any payment in lieu of any penalty or penalty interest; or (2) any real estate or other property or property right to any lien, attachment, foreclosure, garnishment, or other legal proceeding. Exempts specified Government held real estate from the provisions of this Act."
