    "text": "Animal Welfare Act Amendments - Provides, under the Federal Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, that no animals shall be delivered to any intermediate handler or common carrier for transportation in commerce unless the animals are accompanied by a veterinarian's certificate certifying that the animals are sound, healthy, and in such condition that they may reasonably be expected to withstand the rigors of the intended transportation without adverse effects. States that specified animals shall not be delivered for transportation if they are less than eight weeks of age. Provides that no intermediate handler or common carrier shall participate in any practice under which the cost of such animal or its transportation is to be paid and collected upon delivery of the animal to the consignee. Imposes civil penalties for violations of such provisions. Makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly sponsor, attend, deliver to, receive for, or use the mail services for, a dog or animal fighting venture as a result of engaging in interstate or foreign commerce. Imposes criminal penalties for first and second violations of such provisions."
