    "text": "Establishes the National Commission on the Prevention of Raw Material Shortages within the legislative branch of Government. States that the duties of the Commission shall be to investigate and report to the Congress on the raw materials which the United States presently imports at the rate of 10 percent or more of annual consumption, those raw materials which are likely to be imported at such rate by 1985, and any other raw materials which in the judgment of the Commission may become in short supply sufficiently by 1985 to seriously affect realization of national economic goals of the United States. Requires such report to include an analysis of: (1) the possiblity of the supply of such raw materials being disrupted by shortage in supply or the actions of countries or companies engaged in the production or transportation of such raw materials; (2) the probable economic impact of shortages in such raw materials; (3) the availability of substitute materials for such raw materials, the economic impact of such substitution, and the research in progress which could result in the increased availability of substitute materials; (4) actions and policies of companies involved in the supply and distribution of such raw materials to determine if these actions and policies will increase the available supply of such raw materials; and (5) the policies, laws, and actions of the United States Government to determine whether they are consitent with the national policy of anticipating and avoiding shortages in such raw materials. States that such report shall make recommendations for changes in laws which affect scientific research, foreign trade, taxation, raw material exploration, government procurement, national economic policy, national environmental policy, and any other domestic or foreign policy of the United States Government affecting supply of such raw materials. Requires such report to be made to the Congress of the United States within two years of the establishment of the Commission. Specifies the composition of the Commission and the powers of its members and agents. Gives the Commission the power to hold hearings and to issue subpoenas compelling the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any evidence that relates to any matter under investigation by the Commission. Allows the Commission to obtain official data from any department or agency of the United States to carry out the provisions and purposes of this Act, to accept gifts, and to use the mails in the same manner and upon the same conditions as other Federal agencies. Authorizes to be appropriated the sums necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
