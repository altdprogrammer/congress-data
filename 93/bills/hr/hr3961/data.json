    "text": "Forest Lands Restoration and Protection Act - Title I: Commercial Forest Lands - Asserts that within forty-five days after the enactment of this Act the Secretary of Agriculture shall publish in the Federal Register proposed criteria for the designation by the States of commercial forest lands located therein. Provides that within a reasonable time for interested person to submit opinions (but no later than ninety days after the initial publication) the Secretary shall promulgate such criteria. Requires each State to designate all lands consistent with the criteria as commercial forest lands and in addition each State shall adopt: (1) standards for timber harvesting and land management of such designated lands and (2) a plan for the implementation, maintenance and enforcement of such standards. Restricts the sale or introduction of any timber into commerce which was harvested from any land in the several States other than from designated commercial forest lands or which was harvested in violation of the applicable standards or plans. Asserts that a person convicted of the above violation shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000, or by imprisonment for not more than one year or both for the first conviction and for second and subsequent offenses by a fine up to $25,000 and/or imprisonment up to 5 years. Provides that one-third of the fine shall be paid to any person who gives information leading to a conviction. Authorizes the Secretary to require the person who owns, leases, operates, or otherwise controls such forest lands to maintain records and to make such reports as he may require. Provides that the Secretary shall have a right of entry to such lands and at reasonable times access to the records maintained pursuant to this Act. Provides that each State shall establish requirements for the licensing by the State of all foresters working within the State in accordance with criteria to be established by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to cooperate with the States in providing technical assistance to small forest landowners in the development of timber harvesting and land management plans. Title II: Timber Harvesting and Land Management on Federal Forest Lands - Asserts that, beginning one year after the enactment of this Act, timber harvesting on Federal forest lands shall be conducted under timber harvesting and land management plans promulgated under this title. Requires the Secretary, or in certain cases the Secretary of the Interior, to promulgate plans for the harvesting of timber on Federal forest lands. Provides that any contract for timber harvesting on Federal lands shall be entered into by competitive bidding and the appropriate Secretary shall also provide that it is the responsibility of said contractor to comply fully with the policies and requirements of this Act. Provides penalties for the violation of any plan promulgated under this Act. Provides that no logs or unfinished forest products from Federal forest lands or from commercial forest lands shall be exported from the United States unless the Secretary shall find that the Nation's projected timber supply needs for each of 5 consecutive years thereafter can be satisfied entirely by domestic supplies. Establishes the Federal Forest Land Fund and provides that the Fund shall consist of such amounts as may be appropriated or credited to the Fund as provided in this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Fund amounts equal to the net proceeds accruing to the United States from the sale of forest products. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to hold the Fund and to report to the Congress not later than the 1st day of March each year on the financial condition and the results of the operations of the Fund. Provides that amounts in the Fund shall be available to the Secretary to complete the national forest system, to enlarge tree-planting operations, and to carry out other activities to improve the environment within Federal forest lands. Provides protection for employees of timber harvesting operations who believe they were discharged or discriminated against by reason of the fact that any such employee has notified the Secretary of an alleged violation of this Act or has testified or is about to testify in any proceedings resulting from the administration or enforcement of the provisions of this Act. Provides that the Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior shall submit to the Congress on September 1 of each year a report on the actions taken by each under this Act."
