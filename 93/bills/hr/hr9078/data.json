Provides that such assets shall be held in trust by the Secretary, on behalf of the United States, for the tribe. Provides that this Act shall reinstitute all, and shall not abrogate any, water, hunting, fishing, and trapping rights or privileges, and any other rights and privileges of the tribe enjoyed under Federal treaty or otherwise.
