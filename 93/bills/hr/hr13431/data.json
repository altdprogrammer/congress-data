Requires that such National Task Force shall provide for: (1) a coordinated research program encompassing the programs of the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism, and Digestive Diseases, related programs of the other research institutes, and other Federal and non-Federal programs; (2) the utilization of existing research facilities and personnel of the National Institutes of Health for accelerated exploration of opportunities of special promise in scientific areas related to the known complications of diabetes mellitus; (3) a system for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of all data useful in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diabetes mellitus, including the establishment of a diabetes research data bank to collect, catalog, store, and disseminate insofar as is practicable the results of diabetes research undertaken for the use of any person involved in diabetes research; (4) support of manpower programs of training in fundamental sciences and clinical disciplines to provide an expanded and continuing manpower base from which to select investigators, physicians, and allied health professions personnel, for participation in clinical and basic research and treatment programs relating to diabetes including, where appropriate, the use of training stipends, fellowships, and career awards; (5) budget estimates and projections reflecting the funds required to fully implement the recommended plan; (6) methods of education for persons having diabetes; and (7) an emphasis on the counseling to persons, especially children, having diabetes and to their families with regard to adjustments and medical regimen required of such persons. Authorizes the appropriation of $1,000,000 for the purpose of establishing the National Task Force under this Act. Directs the Director to establish programs for cooperation with State and other health agencies in the early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes as well as programs of public, professional, and patient education. Authorizes the appropriation of $5,000,000 each year for fiscal years 1973, 1974, and 1975, and the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary thereafter, for the diabetes control program. Authorizes the Director to make grants to, or contract with States, political subdivisions, universities, hospitals, and other public or nonprofit private institutions, agencies, or organizations, which are community oriented, for projects and programs for the conduct of research, demonstration, training in and utilization of allied health personnel, or public and professional education for the early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus, or counseling and assistance in self-management. Provides that such grants shall cover a maximum of 75 percent of the costs of such projects and programs. Authorizes the appropriation of $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1973, and a like sum for each of the next two succeeding fiscal years, and such sums as may be necessary thereafter, for the purpose of such grants under this Act. Authorizes the Director to establish not more than six model diabetes research, treatment, and education clinics throughout the United States within the framework of existing programs. Provides that the purpose of such clinics shall be to test the feasibility of such clinics with regard to: (1) the development of improved methods of detecting diabetes; (2) the development of improved methods of intervention against high-risk factors which cause diabetes; and (3) the development of highly skilled manpower in diabetes diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Authorizes the appropriation for the establishment of the clinics authorized under this Act $6,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, and a like sum for each of the next two succeeding fiscal years and such sums as are necessary thereafter."
