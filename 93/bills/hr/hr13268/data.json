Provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, that the Commission shall be the primary civil and criminal enforcement agency for violations of the provisions of this Act. Provides that any violation of any such provision shall be prosecuted by the Attorney General or Department of Justice personnel only after consultation with, and with the consent of, the Commission.
