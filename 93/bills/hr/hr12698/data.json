Defines the terms used in this Act. Declares that no public employer, as a condition of employment or of the continuation of employment with such public employer, shall take any action, on the basis of the membership or nonmembership of any individual in any labor organization, which may deny or abridge the right of any individual to public employment. Provides that any individual aggrieved by any violation or threatened violation of this Act shall be entitled to: (1) injunctive relief and (2) any damages cognizable at law resulting from such violations or threatened violations."
