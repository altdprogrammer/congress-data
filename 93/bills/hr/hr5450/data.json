Provides that in the case of transportation of material, by a vessel or aircraft registered in the United States or flying the United States flag, from a location in a foreign State which is a Party to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, a permit issued pursuant to the authority of that foreign State Party shall be accepted as if it were issued by the Administrator."
