    "text": "Includes State and local governments and agencies within the definition of \"employer\" for purposes of the Age Discrimination Act of 1967. (Amends 29 U.S.C. 630, 634) Prohibits Discrimination on account of age in any personnel action affecting employees or applicants for employment in the Federal Government, including military departments, executive agencies, the United States postal service and the postal rate commission, the Library of Congress, the units of the District of Columbia Government, and units of the legislative branch, and the judicial branch having positions in the competitive service. Authorizes the Civil Service Commission to enforce this prohibition against age discrimination through appropriate remedies, including reimbursement or hiring of employees with or without backpay. Requites an individual to file a notice with the Civil Service Commission within 180 days after an alleged unlawful practice. Permits such aggrieved person to bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this Act."
