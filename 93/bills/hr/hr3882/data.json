Entitles any person who acquires rehabilitated or restored rental housing from a taxpayer who elected the amortization deduction and who did not discontinue the amortization deduction, to a deduction with respect to the adjusted basis of such facility based on the remaining amount of the 60 month period taken by the person who rehabilitated the house. Provides procedures for the election and termination of the amortization deduction and defines the terms used in this Act."
