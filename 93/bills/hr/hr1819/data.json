Authorizes the appropriate United States district court to divest the privilege created by this Act if there is established by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) there is probable cause to believe that the information, material, or source is clearly relevant to a specific probable violation of law; (2) the information, material, or source cannot be obtained by alternate means less injurious to the gathering and dissemination of information to the public; and (3) there is a compelling and overriding national interest to be served by the obtaining of the information, material, or source."
