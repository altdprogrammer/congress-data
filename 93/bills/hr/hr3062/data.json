Authorizes to be appropriated such funds as the Congress may deem necessary for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, and each of the next four fiscal years and such sums needed for payment to the States for making grants under this Act. Provides that the use of Federal funds shall be only for such programs as the planning, development, and implementation by local educational agencies of educational technology programs designed to promote uses of technological equipment and materials in the elementary and secondary schools. Authorizes the Commissioner of Education to pay each State from the funds allotted to it amounts necessary to enable the State educational agency to provide for programs designed to implement educational technology, dissemination of information relating to educational technology, evaluation of various programs, and the administration of the State plan. Specifies that any State desiring to receive payments must have a State advisory council and must submit to the Commissioner a State plan. Requires the Commissioner to approve the State plan if it conforms with the objectives of this Act; makes provision for the participation of nonprofit private school children; sets forth the administrative organization of the plan; uses 10 percent of the States's allotment for making grants to local educational agencies; sets forth criteria for achieving an equitable distribution of assistance; provides procedures for project evaluation; keeps State and Federal funds separate; and provides necessary accounting procedures.

Requires any State desiring to receive payments to have a State advisory council and to submit a State plan. Directs the Commissioner to approve the State plan if it meets criteria similar to those set forth in Title I. Title III: General Provisions - Defines terms used in the Act. Allows the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to appoint a National Advisory Council on Educational Technology to evaluate the programs and projects of this Act, to report to the Congress and the President on the success of such programs, and to make recommendations for improvements of such programs.
