Directs the Board of Education of the District of Columbia to submit each year, on or before may 1, recommendations to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia with respect to the revision of the compensation schedule and any related matter dealing with compensation or retirement of teachers in the District of Columbia. Stipulates that the Board shall, by March 1 of each year, submit to the Commissioner the following: (A) the percentage rate of the cost-of-living change since the effective date of the last revision of the compensation schedule adopted by the Council with respect to the teachers of the District of Columbia; (B) the results of a study comparing compensation of teachers in the District of Columbia (1) with teachers of districts of comparable size, (2) with teachers of jurisdictions in the metropolitan area, and (3) a representative sample of similar occupations in private industry located in the metropolitan area; and (C) with respect to each class or member, the change in rate of compensation which would be required in cost of living if comparability factors were weighted equally. Provides that each member of TSA-15 shall be issued a five-year teaching certificate, and renewals are dependent upon application and six or more hours of appropriate credit earned during the preceding five-year period. Establishes a category of employees designated \"attendance aids\" who shall meet requirements to be established by the Board in implementing this title. Title II: Teachers' Annuities - Provides that the monthly rate of annuity payable under this section shall not be less than the smallest primary insurance amount, including any cost-of-living increase added to that amount, authoried to be paid from time to time under title II of the Social Security Act. Increases the amount of annuties payable to teachers whose separation occured prior to October 20, 1969. Title III: Reorganization of Higher Education - Establishes a Board of Trustees, which shall be an independent agency of the District of Columbia government, consisting of fifteen members. States that the Trustees shall, within one year after its first meeting, consolidate the existing three institutions of public higher education in the District of Columbia into a single university to be called the University of the District of Columbia, with several schools, colleges, campuses, and units that offer a comprehensive program of higher education. Sets forth the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees with respect to establishment of the University, including the establishment of a personnel system and of policies and standards governing admissions, curriculums, programs, graduation, the awarding of degrees, and general policy making for the units of the University.
