    "text": "Emergency Crime Control Act - Title I: Planning and Law Enforcement Grants to High Crime Urban Areas - Provides that State plans for law enforcement assistance that qualify for grants under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act shall provide that each high crime urban area (of 250,000 population, or more) within such State shall constitute a separate regional planning unit which shall assist in the development of the comprehensive State plan, take receipts from the State planning agency of all Federal funds granted for use in such high crime urban area, and assist in coordinating all law enforcement efforts within such high crime urban area which are in whole or in part assisted by Federal funds under such Act. Prescribes a formula by which such State planning grants under such Act shall be allocated to such high crime urban areas. Provides, under the provision of such Act for disbursements by State planning agencies, that each State planning agency shall make a block grant in lieu of program and project grants to each high crime urban area within the State which notifies such agency that there has been organized within such area an Urban Law Enforcement Council and submits to such agency a plan for the use of such grant. Prescribes a formula by which such State planning agency shall measure such grants to such high crime urban area. Title II: Special Impact Grants to High Intensity Urban Area - Provides that the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration shall make a block grant, to each high crime urban area, measured by $5 multiplied by the population of such area, which notifies it that there has been organized within such area an Urban Law Enforcement Council, and submits to it a plan for the use of such grant. Provides that grants shall be made available under this section for fiscal years 1974, 1975, and 1976. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for the purposes of carrying out this section."
