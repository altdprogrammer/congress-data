Authorizes appropriations to carry out such services under this Act. Directs the Secretary of Labor to make financial assistance available under this Act for the establishment and operation in any State of service, employment, and redevelopment centers which shall include education classes specifically designed to assist the disadvantaged Spanish-speaking clients who are unemployed or underemployed. Limits the Federal financial assistance to any such program to 90 percent of the cost of such program."
