Amends 19 U.S.C. 1202 Makes the moving expense provisions of the Internal Revenue Code non-applicable to members of the uniformed services until January 1, 1976. Repeals the tax and regulatory provisions on filled cheese under the Internal Revenue Code. Permits specified private foundations whose assets are largely invested in the stock of a multi-state regulated company to exclude the value of this stock in computing the amount of their required charitable distributions under the private foundation provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Increases the amount of carbon dioxide that may be contained in still wines from 0.277 to 0.392 gram per 100 milliliters of wine. Requires a study of the desirability and feasiblity of instituting a system of combined social security-income tax reporting on an annual basis, such study to be submitted to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate."
