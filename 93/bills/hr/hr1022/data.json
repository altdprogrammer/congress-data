Requires that not more than two Members of the Senate be of the same political party. Authorizes the Commission to appoint a director, and such other personnel as it deems desirable. Authorizes the head of any Federal agency, upon request, to detail personnel to the Commission. Allows the Commission to hold hearings, take testimony, receive evidence, and administer oaths and affirmations. Requires the head of any department or agency of the United States to submit, upon request of the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Commission, such information as may be necessary for the Commission to carry out the Act. Empowers the Commission to issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses. Provides that no person shall be excused from attending or testifying or from producing evidence on the ground that the evidence or testimony may tend to incriminate him but that no person shall be prosecuted or subject to penalty or forfeiture on account of any testimony which he is compelled, after claiming his privilege, to give or produce. Requires the Commission to submit to the President and to each House of Congress an interim report not later than six months after the enactment of the Act and to submit a final report not later than twelve months after the enactment of the Act.
