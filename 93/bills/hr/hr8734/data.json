    "text": "Interstate Environmental Compact - Grants the consent of Congress for any two or more States to enter into the Interstate Environmental Compact. Declares that: (1) the environment of every State is affected with local, State, regional and national interests and (2) certain environmental pollution problems transcend state boundaries and thereby become common to adjacent states requiring cooperative efforts. States that the purposes of this compact are to assist and participate in the national environmental protection programs and to preserve and utilize the functions, powers and duties of existing State agencies of government. Provides that nothing in this compact shall impair, affect or extend the constitutional authority of the United States and the power and rights of the Congress of the United States to revise the terms of its consent. Provides that nothing contained in this compact shall impair or extend the constitutional authority of any signatory state, nor shall the police powers of any signatory state be affected except to the extent that two or more signatories enter into agreements for the purpose of controlling interstate environmental problems in accordance with applicable Federal legislation. Asserts that existing non-environmental intergovernmental arrangements are not affected by this compact and that existing interstate compacts relating to the environment are recognized and nothing in this compact shall be construed to affect such agreements. Allows the signatories to enter into further interstate compacts and supplementary agreements which do not conflict with their obligations under this compact. Authorizes the Governor of a State to enter into supplementary agreements for such State and his signature shall render the agreement immediately binding upon such State. Provides that: (a) the legislature of such signatory shall at its next session bring the agreement before it and approve, reverse, modify or condition the agreement of such State; and (b) nothing in the agreement shall limit the right of Congress to disapprove or condition such an agreement. Authorizes the signatories to enter into special supplementary agreements with the District of Columbia or foreign nations, for the purpose of joint, coordinated or mutual environmental management activities, upon the condition that such non-signatory party accept the general obligations of signatories under this compact and provides that such agreements shall become effective after being consented to by the Congress. Provides that the provisions of this compact or of agreements hereunder shall be severable and if any provision of this compact or agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any signatory or of the United States the constitutionality of the remainder of this compact or agreement shall not be affected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect. Provides that the compact shall become binding on a State when enacted by it into law and such State shall thereafter become a signatory. Provides that a State may withdraw from this compact by authority of its legislature one year after it notifies all signatories in writing of an intention to withdraw; however, withdrawal from supplementary agreements to which it is a party can only occur to the extent and in accordance with the terms of such agreements."
