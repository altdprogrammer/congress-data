    "text": "Extends until July 1, 1976 (presently July 1, 1972) the provision under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 requiring a Federal agency to pay 100 percent of the first $25,000 of relocation payments required for a State to furnish real property incident to a Federal program. Extends until July 1, 1974, the provision requiring 100 percent Federal payment of costs resulting from the transfer of real property to a State. (Amends 42 U.S.C. 4627) Authorizes the head of a Federal agency, until June 30, 1973, to pay such sums in excess of the first $25,000 of cost as necessary to a State not in compliance with the Act. Makes provisions for non-approval of grants to the State and for deductions from Federal funds after that date. Provides that whenever the acquisition of real property for a program or project, to be undertaken by a person or State agency furnished pursuant to a grant, contract, or agreement, will result in the forced displacement of any person on or after the effective date of this Act, the head of the Federal agency furnishing such financial assistance shall provide: (1) fair and reasonable relocation payments and assistance to or for such displaced persons; (2) relocation assistance programs; and (3) decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings to such displaced persons. Provides that no Government agency administering any Federal program shall, for the purpose of assuring compliance with the Act, impose any limitation on the removal of vacant improvements located on real property acquired in connection with such a Federally assisted project."
