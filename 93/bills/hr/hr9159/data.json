    "text": "International Opium Control Act - Calls upon the President to immediately enter into negotiations with foreign countries to establish a systematic and uniform international system of enforcement standards and penalties for illegal opium producers and traffickers. Authorizes the President to furnish assistance to friendly foreign countries, on such terms and conditions as he shall determine necessary, in order to encourage and enable those countries to eliminate the production and processing of opium within its boundaries (except such production and processing as may be required for medical or research purposes). States that such assistance shall continue for not more than five years to any single country. Requires the President to discontinue all military, economic, and other assistance to a foreign country if he determines that such country is continuing to permit the production and processing of opium which illegally enters the United States. Establishes an Executive Committee on International Opium Control to advise the President and the Congress. Requires such Committee to report annually on the effectiveness of those measures undertaken by all countries and international organizations in: (1) eliminating the production and processing of opium; (2) improving the enforcement of national laws related to opium; and (3) expediting the extradition of persons charged with offenses related to opium."
