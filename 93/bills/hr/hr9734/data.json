Requires agents, special interests, and regular employees and members of a special interest who meet the definition of an agent to maintain and preserve records of activities, contributions, and expenditures to influence Executive policies. Provides that each agent or special interest shall file a quarterly report of his activities with the Comptroller General. Declares that the Comptroller General shall administer the provisions of this Act. Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) develop and prescribe forms and standards for the notices of representation, amendments thereto, and reports filed by persons required to maintain records; (2) compile in a manner reflective of the disclosure intent of this Act, information contained in notices of representation, amendments thereto, and reports filed, with respect of each filing period; (3) report such information, as so compiled, summarize information, by person, in categories of activity after the end of each filing period, or if Congress is not in session, then as soon as possible after Congress reconvenes; (4) make available for public inspection at reasonable times in the General Accounting Office in the District of Columbia, for a period of six years following the date of filing, all notices of representation, amendments thereto, and reports filed by persons required to maintain records and all information as compiled and summarized; (5) have each notice of representation and each amendment thereto which is filed by any agent published in a special report to the Congress within three days after each such notice is received by the Comptroller General, or if Congress is not in session when such notice is so received, then as soon as possible after Congress reconvenes; (6) ascertain whether any person required to maintain records has failed to file a report, or has filed an incomplete or inaccurate report, and promptly notify such person to file or amend such report in order to satisfy the requirements of this Act or regulations prescribed by the Comptroller General under this Act; and (7) prepare a special study and report upon the request of any Member of the House of Representatives or the Senate from information in the records of the Comptroller General.
