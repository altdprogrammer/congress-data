Stipulates that the Secretary of Defense shall, in a written report, recommend annual strength levels for active-duty personnel and support such recommendation with a detailed justification. Requires the Secretary of Defense to submit to Congress an annual report (and supplemental reports) detailing weapons development and procurement schedules.
