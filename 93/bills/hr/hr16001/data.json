States that such subsidies may be made directly in the form of grants, to families who are determined, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to be eligible for assistance under this program. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1974 and for each fiscal year thereafter of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
