    "text": "Extends the coverage of the National Labor Relations Act to include employees of nonprofit hospitals. States that when a collective bargaining agreement is in effect between a health care institution and a labor organization representative the agreement shall continue in full force and effect, without recourse to strikes, picketing or lockouts, except as expressly permitted by this Act. Prescribes the procedure to be followed in negotiations for renewal of any such agreements. Provides that when a health care institution and a labor organization which is the bargaining representative of its employees enter into negotiations for an initial collective bargaining agreement, such negotiations shall be conducted in accordance with specified procedures without recourse to strikes, picketing or lockouts, except as expressly permitted. Describes the conduct which constitutes unfair labor practices. Provides for not more than four bargaining units in health care institutions (in addition to security guards): (1) professional employees, (2) technical employees, (3) clerical employees, and (4) service and maintenance employees. Gives unfair labor practice charges involving strikes and picketing at health care institutions priority over other cases in NLRB regional offices. Provides a course of action for private persons for injury due to unlawful strikes or lockouts."
