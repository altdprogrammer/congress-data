States that in the event that the period of entitlement under this Act of an eligible veteran who is enrolled in a program of education ends prior to such veteran's attainment or a predetermined and identified educational, professional, or vocational objective, the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs may extend such veteran's period of eligibility to the completion of such program of education or for nine months, whichever is the lesser period. Requires the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to reimburse any eligible veteran enrolled in a fulltime or part-time program of education for costs above $400 incurred by such veteran for tuition, exclusive expenses incurred for fees, books, supplies, or other expenses. Limits such payments to $600 for an ordinary school year. Establishes a Vietnam Era Veterans Communication Center. States that it shall be the duty of the Communications Center to make an initial and periodic evaluation of the effectiveness of the veterans outreach services program. Requires the results of such evaluations to be reported to the President and to the Congress. Directs the Communications Center to advise and assist in connection with all Federal programs pertaining to veterans of the Vietnam era. Establishes the Vietnam Era Veterans Advisory Committee to advise and consult with the Communication Center regarding any and all matters pertaining to the duties and responsibilities of the Communications Center under this Act."
