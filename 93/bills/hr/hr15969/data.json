    "text": "Housing Enforcement Assistance Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to establish within his department a housing enforcement assistance program under which he will make grants as provided in this Act to cities and other municipalities to assist them in the more effective enforcement of local housing codes, including: (1) the employment and compensation of housing inspectors and related or supporting personnel; (2) the establishment and operation of housing courts to provide a forum for the resolution of controversies involving building violations, rent strikes, evictions, and other matters relating to landlord-tenant relations and housing code enforcement; (3) the development and improvement of housing codes; (4) emergency repairs to prevent tenant hardship; and (5) such other actions to deal with aspects of housing code enforcement as in the judgment of the Secretary will significantly help in carrying out the purpose of this Act. Stipulates that the Secretary shall allocate the funds appropriated to the various cities and municipalities in the United States in accordance with a formula appropriately reflecting their need for assistance in the enforcement of housing codes. States that such formula, which shall be published in the Federal Register in advance of such allocation, shall take into account with respect to each of such cities and municipalities its size, the amount and average age of its housing which is threatened with loss from blight or deterioration but could be preserved by more effective enforcement of housing codes, its financial need, and such other factors as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate and in furtherance of the objectives of this Act. Authorizes appropriations of $40,000,000 and carry out the purposes of this Act."
