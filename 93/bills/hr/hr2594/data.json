Provides that the Adminstrator shall develop and administer uniform minimum standards of health and safety for bottled drinking water. Authorizes the Administrator to collect and make available research results for the health and safety of bottled drinking water and to make grants to public and private nonprofit agencies to determine health standards for bottled drinking water. Requires the first health standards to be published within a year of enactment of this Act. Directs that these standards will not apply to water for export if properly labeled and meeting the standards of the importing country. Requires imported bottled drinking water to meet United States standards. Makes it unlawful to distribute or import bottled water that does not meet the prescribed standards. Provides that the district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to restrain violations of this Act. Provides a civil penalty of a fine not in excess of $1,000 for violations of the regulations. Allows States to impose more restrictive standards than the Federal standards prescribed by this Act."
