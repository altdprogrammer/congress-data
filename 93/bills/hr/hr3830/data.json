    "text": "Natural Game Fish Stream Preservation Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to grant to any State agency responsible for the management of game fish Federal assistance, under the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, if the Secretary finds that the preservation of any natural game fish stream for which the State has requested assistance under this Act would be consistent with the purpose of this Act. Provides that such assistance may be in an amount sufficient to enable the State to acquire fee simple title or other interests, including riparian rights, in the stream, the streambed, and such land abutting the sides of the stream as may be necessary for the preservation of the stream. Provides for requirements which State agencies must meet in qualifying for grants under this Act. Requires States receiving assistance under this Act to appoint citizens' advisory committees which shall report to the Secretary annually with respect to the status, fees, rules, supervisory practices, and use of all natural game fish streams for which assistance is granted under this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $30,000,000 for fiscal year l974, and $30,000,000 for fiscal year l975, to carry out the purposes of this Act. Provides that not more than 6 percent of any of the sums appropriated under this Act may be granted to any one State."
