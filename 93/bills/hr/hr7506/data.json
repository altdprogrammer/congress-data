    "text": "International Voluntary Standards Cooperation Act - States the findings of the Congress that internationally recognized foreign standards can promote international trade and that effective participation in the development of such standards requires cooperation between the Government and industry. Declares that a purpose of the Act is to promote and support adequate representation of the United States in international voluntary standardization activities; to promote international trade through mutually appropriate implementation of international voluntary standardization agreements; and to improve the balance of trade and balance of payments of the United States. Defines the functions of the Secretary of Commerce relating to the administration of the Act. Gives the Secretary responsibility to identify international standardization activities where more participation by the United States is needed, to provide for appropriate participation, and to encourage appropriate use of voluntary international standards. Provides that the Secretary shall inform and consult with the Secretary of State concerning any contemplated action which involves the international relations of the United States, and requires the Secretary to utilize private capabilities and resources in performing his functions under the Act. Authorizes the Secretary to establish arrangements for United States representation through private nonprofit organizations and provides that the arrangements contain certain minimum safeguards to protect all affected persons including consumers, employees, and the general public. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct studies or investigations to carry out his functions under the Act; to examine the potential impact on international trade and the balance of trade and balance of payments of the United States, of international standards assurance systems and related activities; to provide grants to nonprofit organizations to assist them in the performance of international standardization activities under the Act; and to make advance payments. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a system for the evaluation and accreditation of testing laboratories or for organizations which oversee the work of testing laboratories. Requires the Secretary, prior to establishing such evaluation and accreditation system, to consult with affected private organizations and with the Committees established by this Act; and to publish in the Federal Register a notice of his intent to establish such a system. Requires the Secretary to establish arrangements for governmental participation in international standardization activities where private participation in such activities has proved insufficient to serve the purposes of this Act. Requires the public availability of lists of standards negotiated or developed under the Act and requires the Secretary to publish the full text of such standards if they are not available from private sources. Promotes the use of international voluntary standards developed under the Act and listed by the Secretary in Federal procurement. Authorizes Federal agencies to participate in the standardization activities on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis and specifically authorizes these agencies, with the knowledge of the Secretary, to provide the technical services of its employees to assist private nonprofit organizations in performing their activities under the Act. Authorizes the Secretary to establish policies and procedures to administer the Act. Provides that the Secretary may charge for the evaluation of laboratories performed and for the applying of lists or full texts of standards. Authorizes him to use the fees received to reimburse the appropriation or fund which supported the service performed. Establishes an Interagency Committee on Standards Policy consisting of members representing various executive departments and agencies; and a Public Committee on International Standards Policy consisting of members representing consumers, users, manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, employees, and experts in international standards and standards assurance systems. Provides that such Committees shall assist and advise the Secretary in carrying out his responsibilities under the Act. States that the Federal Trade Commission may at any time petition the Secretary of Commerce for the removal of a voluntary international standard on the grounds that such standard is contrary to the public interest. Requires an annual report to be submitted by the President to the Congress. Requires that recipients of grants and contracts maintain records and grants the Secretary or the Comptroller General access to the books and records of grantees for the purpose of audit and to assure that standards developed are in the public interest. Provides that the international standardization activities shall not effect any law or requirement (such as mandatory standards) published by agencies of the Federal Government. Authorizes necessary appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
