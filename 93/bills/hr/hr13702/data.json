Makes it unlawful for: (1) any person to perform psychosurgery in any federally connected health care facility, and (2) any federally connected health care facility to permit any person to perform psychosurgery in violation of this Act. Prescribes civil penalties for violation of this Act. Establishes a nine-member Psychosurgery Commission, and authorizes it to initiate civil actions in U.S. district courts to restrain violations of this Act. Provides for an annual report by the Commission on its activities under this Act."
