Requires such a taxpayer to receive from the donee of such property a written statement that the property represents material of historical or artistic significance and that the use by the donee will be related to the purpose constituting the basis for its exemption. Exempts from these provisions, letters and other papers collected by a public official during his term of office. (Amends 26 U.S.C. 170(e))"
