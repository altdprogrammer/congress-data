    "text": "Establishes as an agency of the District of Columbia government a Center for the Prevention of Child Abuse which shall have as its head a Director who shall be appointed by the Commissioner of the District of Columbia. Requires the Director to secure, administer, and coordinate all public and private resources available in the District of Columbia for the protection of abused or neglected children, and children in jeopardy from their home environment. Requires the Director to develop, organize, and maintain as a part of the Center multidisciplinary teams of experts, one such team to assist on each case of child abuse or neglect brought to the attention of the Center. States that each team shall include, but not be limited to, a physician, an attorney, and a social worker. States that any medical personnel and certain persons in child care in the District of Columbia, having reasonable cause to believe that a child under his charge or care, under the age of eighteen, or brought to him or coming before him for examination, care, or treatment, has in his opinion had physical, mental, or emotional injury or sexual abuse inflicted on him by other than accidental means, or has suffered physical or emotional harm due to neglect, or whose safety, health, or welfare appears to be in jeopardy from his environment, shall report such injury or harm in accordance with provisions of this Act. States that whenever a report is made under this section to a member or officer of the Metropolitan Police force, such member or officer shall immediately notify the Director. Provides that upon receiving a report made under this section the Director shall promptly make a thorough investigation, the prime purpose of which shall be protection of the child. States that if, before the investigation is complete, the opinion of the investigator is that immediate temporary removal is necessary to protect the child from further abuse or neglect, the Family Division of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia shall issue an order for immediate temporary removal and custody. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act."
