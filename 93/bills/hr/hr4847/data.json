Grants incentive awards to States that comply with standards for facilitating votes registration. Provides that, if any State, precinct, or district does not have 75 percent registration of those potentially eligible to vote in Federal elections within four years after the enactment of this title, the Administration shall (for Federal elections) further augment that area's voter registration so as to make reasonable efforts to achieve 85 percent registration. Requires each State to make provisions for the registration and voting in Federal elections for those of its eligible citizens who have writing, vision, or limb handicaps but who are otherwise eligible to register and vote. Provides that the Administration shall join with the States to make every effort to prevent fraudulent registration or voting by the careful processing of registration and voting records. Provides that whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that a State or political subdivision is denying or attempting to deny any persons the right to vote in any election in violation of this Act, he shall institute for the United States a restraining order, a preliminary injunction, or such order as he deems appropriate. States that any person who deprives or attempts to deprive any other person of any right secured by this Act shall be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned not more than five years or both. Grants individuals standing to seek injunction or redress of grievances committed in violation of rights secured by this Act.
