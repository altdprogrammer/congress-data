    "text": "National Corrections Academy Act - Establishes a National Corrections Academy. Establishes a Coordinating Council for National Corrections Training which shall be composed of fifteen members. Sets forth the terms of office of the members of the Council. Authorizes the Academy to offer the following instruction: (1) executive workshops and seminars ; (2) a correctional staff college to provide educational experience for middle-level personnel who have experience in corrections; (3) a basic course of instruction for persons seeking initial employment as corrections officers; (4) specialist training to offer instruction to full - and part-time support personnel including but not limited to chaplains, doctors, dentists, nurses, business managers, food service personnel, recreation workers, counselors, psychiatrists, vocational instructors, and social workers; (5) extensive background training for in-service staff personnel; and (6) community based programs to develop meaningful and organized efforts to successfully re-integrate the ex-offender into society. Provides that the overall policy and operations of the Academy shall be under the supervision of the Council. Provides that the Council shall report annually to the Congress on its operation and the activities of the Academy and recommend to the Congress further legislative action which may appear desirable. States that the authorized number of students shall be determined each year by the Council. Provides that reasonable efforts shall be made to insure that students are admitted so that geographic regions will be fairly represented on the basis of population and need. Provides that every student shall sign an agreement that, unless separated, he will complete the term of the course of instruction for which he has been accepted. States that following his term of education each student shall serve for a period of not less than two years in an appropriate function in the corrections field. States that every student shall receive during the period of instruction such reasonable stipends and allowances as the Council determines to be necessary. Requires each student to repay 50 percent of such stipends and allowances if the student voluntarily terminates his course of instruction or terminates his service prior to the end of the two year period. Authorizes to be appropriated $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1973 and such sums thereafter as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
