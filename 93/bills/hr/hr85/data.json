Allows the Comptroller General to provide for the grouping of items of income, sources of income, assets, liabilities, dealings in securities or commodities, and purchases and sales of real property, when separate itemization is not feasible or is not necessary for an accurate disclosure of the income, net worth, dealing in securities and commodities, or purchases and sales of real property of any individual. Provides that whoever willfully fails to file a report required by this section, or knowingly and willfully files a false report under this section, shall be fined $2,000, or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both. Requires all reports filed under this Act to be maintained by the Comptroller General as public records which, under such reasonable regulations as he shall prescribe, shall be available for inspection by members of the public."
