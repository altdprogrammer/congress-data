Provides that in no event shall payment made to an eligible veteran under this Act for any expense incurred by such veterans exceed the customary amount paid by other students in the same institution for the same service, privilege, material, or equipment; and in no event shall the total payments made to or on behalf of any veteran under this Act exceed $500 for an ordinary school year, unless the veteran elects to have such customary charges paid in excess of such limitation, in which event there shall be charged against his period of eligibility the proportion of an ordinary school year which such excess bears to $500. Provides that no payments for tuition or enrollment shall be paid to any veteran for apprentice training on the job. Provides that payments for tuition and other expenses incurred by any eligible veteran may be made by the Administrator to such veteran under this subsection on the basis of such reasonable evidence as the Administrator may require."
