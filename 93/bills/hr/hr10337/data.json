Jones pending in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. Prescribes the procedure for the negotiations. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to allot lands to Paiute Indians, not now members of the Navajo Tribe, who are located in the affected area, such land to be held in trust for them and their heirs by the United States. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer up to 250,000 acres of lands within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management within Arizona or New Mexico to the Navajo Tribe, in return for the fair market value of such land as determined by the Secretary. Establishes within the executive branch the Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation Commission. Requires the Commission, following an order of the District Court in the supplemental proceedings of the Healing case, to prepare and submit to Congress a report concerning the relocation of Members and households of each tribe from lands partitioned to the other tribe. Specifies the procedure for such relocations as may be necessary. Grants to the Hopi Tribe perpetual use of Cliff Spring in Arizona as a religious shrine, and provides that the Secretary shall make reasonable provision for the use and right of access to identified religious shrines for the members of each tribe on the reservation of the other tribe. Authorizes funds to be appropriated for the purpose of carrying out specified provisions of this Act, such funds to remain available until expended."
