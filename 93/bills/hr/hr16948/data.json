    "text": "Presidential Recordings Preservation Act - Directs the Administrator of General Services to obtain, or, as the case may be, retain complete possession and control of all tape recordings of conversations which: (1) involve former President Richard M. Nixon and/or other individuals who, at the time of the conversation, were employed by the Federal Government; (2) were recorded in the White House or the Executive Office Building located in Washington, District of Columbia; and (3) were recorded between January 20, 1969, and August 9, 1974, inclusive. Requires that none of the tape recordings covered by the Act shall be destroyed except as may be provided by Congress. Provides that if a Federal court of competent jurisdiction should decide that the provisions of this Act have deprived any individual of private property without just compensation, the Administrator is authorized to provide such compensation from funds in the Federal treasury as may be adjudged just by a Federal court of competent jurisdiction. Directs the Administrator to issue such reasonable regulations as may be necessary to assure the protection of such tape recordings from loss, destruction, or access to unauthorized persons. Directs the Administrator to issue reasonable regulations governing public access to such tape recordings. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
