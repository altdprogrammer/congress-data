Provides that, if the Commission finds that any unit of a State National Guard has refused to implement any of the standards prescribed by the Commission under this Act does not routinely meet or enforce any such standards, or, when deployed in civil disturbance, violates any such standards, the Commission shall bar the National Guard unit concerned from receiving money or any other aid, benefit, or privilege authorized by law until such time as the Commission determines that the unit has taken such actions as the Commission deems appropriate and necessary to insure that such unit will thereafter comply with this Act."
