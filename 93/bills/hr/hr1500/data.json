    "text": "Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Market-Sharing Act - Declares it to be the policy of Congress that access to the United States market for foreign-produced fresh fruit and vegetables should be established on an equitable and orderly market-sharing basis consistent with the maintenance of a strong and expanding United States production of fresh fruits and vegetables and designed to avoid the disruption of United States markets and the unemployment of United States agricultural workers. Authorizes the President to undertake negotiations with other governments for the purpose of consummating agreements to provide orderly trade in fresh fruits and vegetables including the quantitative limitation of imports of any fresh fruit or vegetables into the United States. Provides that when agreements exist which cover a significant portion of the United States imports of any fresh fruit or vegetable, the President shall by proclamation limit the quantity of such commodity which may be entered from any country or countries not parties to such agreements. Authorizes the President by proclamation to increase the amount of such products which may be imported if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that a shortage of such products exists in any one import year. Provides that the President may issue such regulations as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
