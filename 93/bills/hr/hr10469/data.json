Designates specified areas for review by the Secretary of Agriculture as to their suitability for additions to the National Wilderness Preservation System, and directs the Secretary to manage such areas to maintain their potential for such addition until Congress has acted regarding them. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, through publication in the Federal Register, to designate national forest system areas other than those specified in this Act for review as to suitability or nonsuitability for preservation as wilderness. Provides that federally owned lands within such national forest system areas designated as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, or lands hereafter acquired within the boundaries of such areas, are hereby withdrawn from all forms of appropriation under the mining laws, and from disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral leasing and all amendments thereto. Provides that upon termination of existing permits, the commercial grazing of livestock shall not be permitted within such wilderness areas."
