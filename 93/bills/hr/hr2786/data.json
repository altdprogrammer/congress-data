Requires the death sentence for killing such individual, and a $10,000 fine, or 10 year imprisonment term, for a felonious assault. Provides for similar penalties for a conspiracy to kill or assault a fireman or law enforcement officer. Specifies that the failure to arrest a suspect within 24 hours of the crime shall create a rebuttable presumption of interstate commerce. (Adds 18 U.S.C. 1116)"
