States that the Commission shall study the organization of the Executive Office of the President for the purpose of advising the President and Congress of the desirability of modifying the structure of the Office or through other means seeking to fulfill the goal of promoting efficiency, coordination, and accountability in the management of the executive branch of the Government and, through proposing amendments to the Constitution or through altering laws or other means, to facilitate the responsible delegation of duties by the President of the United States. Requires the Commission's study to include an analysis of the desirability of proposing an amendment to the Constitution creating an Executive Vice President for Domestic Affairs and an Executive Vice President for International Affairs to coordinate the instrumentalities of the Government and fulfill executive functions delegated to them by the President. Directs the Commission to report its findings to the President within one year of the enactment of this Act. Provides that thirty days after receipt of this report, the President shall forward it to Congress, accompanied by his recommendations as to its implementation."
