    "text": "Food Allowance for Older Americans Act - Establishes, under the Social Security Act, a food allowance program under which qualified elderly persons shall be provided with an opportunity to obtain an adequate level of nutrition through the issuance to them, without charge or fee or condition of any kind, a food allowance of $50 for each month after December 1973 in the form of coupons that can be used only to purchase food from retail stores. States that an individual is eligible for a food allowance under this Act only if such individual is (1) sixty-five years of age or older, (2) the head of his or her own household, and (3) has an annual income which does not exceed $5,000. Provides for the issuance of coupons reduced in value to individuals whose annual income exceeds $5,000 by not more than $480 and who otherwise meet the conditions of eligibility. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
