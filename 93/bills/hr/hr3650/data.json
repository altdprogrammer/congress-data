Provides that it shall be the function of the office to: (1) coordinate the programs and activities of all Federal agencies relating to the interests of consumers in order to achieve effectiveness and avoid duplications and inconsistencies; (2) encourage and assist in the development and implementation of consumer programs and activities in the Federal Government; (3) assure that the interests of consumers are taken into consideration by appropriate Federal agencies both in the formulation of policies with respect to consumers and in the operation of programs that may effect consumer interests; (4) cooperate with and, when requested, provide assistance to the Administrator of the Consumer Protection Agency; (5) advise and make recommendations to all Federal agencies with respect to general policy matters concerning the effectiveness of programs and activities relating to the interests of consumers; (6) submit recommendations to the Congress and the President on the means by which programs and activities relating to the interests of consumers can be improved; (7) conduct conferences, surveys, and investigations concerning the needs, interests, and problems of consumers which are not duplicative in significant degree to similar activities conducted by other Federal agencies; (8) encourage, initiate, coordinate, and participate in consumer education and counseling programs (including credit counseling); (9) encourage, report, and coordinate research and studies leading to improved products, services, and consumer information; (10) cooperate with and give technical assistance to State and local governments in the promotion and protection of consumer interests, including programs relating to the arbitration of disputes between consumers and businessmen and producers; (11) cooperate with and assist private enterprise in the promotion and protection of consumer interests; (12) publish and distribute in a Consumer Register material which will include notices of Federal hearings, proposed and final rules and orders, and other useful information, translated from its technical form into language which is understandable by the public; and (13) keep the appropriate committees of the Congress fully and currently informed of all its activities, except that this paragraph is not authority to withhold information requested by individual Members of Congress. Title II: Consumer Protection Agency - Establishes as an independent agency within the executive branch of the Government the Consumer Protection Agency, headed by an Administrator appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, to advise the Congress and the President as to matters concerning consumer interests and to protect the interest of consumers. Gives the Agency powers to carry out the objectives of this Act and sets out specific functions for the Agency.

Authorizes the Agency to intervene as a party in a proceeding in a court of the United States involving the review of Federal agency action in a rulemaking proceeding in which the Agency had participated in or an adjudicatory proceeding in which the Agency had intervened, and to the extent that a right of judicial review is otherwise accorded by law. Authorizes the Agency to institute a proceeding in a competent court of the United States to secure such a review. Authorizes the Administrator to request the Federal Agency concerned to initiate such proceedings or to take such other action as may be authorized by law with respect to such agency, when the Administrator determines it to be in the interests of consumers. Authorizes the Office of Consumer Affairs and the Agency to receive information disclosing a probable violation of any law, administrative order, Federal judgment, or other trade practice affecting consumer interests and to take action to prohibit any further violation. Requires the Agency and Office to develop and disseminate data concerning the function and duties of the Agency and Office, consumer problems, and trade practices detrimental to the interests of consumers. Authorizes the Agency to encourage and support development and application of methods and techniques for testing consumer products, to recommend to other Federal agencies with respect to such information within their authority which would be useful and beneficial to consumers, and to investigate and report to Congress on the feasibility of establishing a National Consumer Information Foundation.
