    "text": "Establishes in the Executive Office of the President the Commission on the Capability of the National Guard to Control Civil Distrubances: (1) to establish minimum training, doctrine, and equipment standards for the National Guard with respect to its use in civil disturbances; (2) to perform annual inspection of all National Guard units to determine whether or not such standards are being implemented and adhered to at the unit level and on a statewide basis; (3) to take such action as is authorized under this Act in order to insure that such standards are met; (4) to perform comprehensive reviews and critiques of the operations of any National Guard unit when used in civil disturbance control duty; (5) to contract for studies and for research and development for the purpose of devising effective nonlethal weapons and devices suitable for civil disturbance control use; (6) to act as principal coordinator between State National Guards and State and local law enforcement agencies with respect to the formulation of contingency plans and preparations for the control of civil disturbances and the exchange of relevant information and technology; and (7) to report at least annually to Congress with respect to the administration of this Act and the readiness and capability (including the availability and sufficiency of recommended protective clothing and devices, communications equipment, and nonlethal weapons) of the National Guard of each State to perform civil disturbance functions in accordance with the prescribed standards. Provides that, if the Commission finds that any unit of a State National Guard has refused to implement any of the standards prescribed by the Commission under this Act does not routinely meet or enforce any such standards, or, when deployed in civil disturbance, violates any such standards, the Commission shall bar the National Guard unit concerned from receiving money or any other aid, benefit, or privilege authorized by law until such time as the Commission determines that the unit has taken such actions as the Commission deems appropriate and necessary to insure that such unit will thereafter comply with this Act."
