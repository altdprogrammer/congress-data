    "text": "Federal Handgun Registration and Licensing Act - Defines the term \"handgun\" as a firearm designed to be fired by the use of a single hand, including the parts from which a firearm can be assembled. Excludes antique firearms from the term. Provides that the Secretary of the Treasury shall not approve for sale or delivery by a licensed dealer, licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed collector any handgun model unless he has caused to be evaluated and tested representative samples of such handgun model ahd has found that in the case of a pistol, the handgun model: (1) has a positive manually operated safety device; (2) has a combined length and height in excess of 10 inches, with the height being at least 4 inches and the length being at least 6 inches; and (3) meets specified criteria in regard to overall length, frame construction, pistol weight, caliber, safety features, and miscellaneous equipment. Provides that in the case of a revolver, the handgun model must: (1) have an overall frame length of four and one-half inches measured on a line parallel to the barrel; (2) have a barrel length of at least three inches; and (3) meet specified criteria in regard to safety devices, barrel length, frame construction, revolver weight, caliber, and miscellaneous equipment. Requires the Secretary to give written notification of the results of evaluations and testing to the licensee applicant. Requires an annual list of all handgun models approved under this Act to be published in the Federal Register and furnished annually to each licensee under this part. Makes provisions for retesting and judicial review for an applicant. Exempts from the provisions of this Act, handguns sold or delivered to designated research organizations, Federal, State, and local agencies, and duly commissioned law enforcement officers. Exempts firearms which are designated as curios or relics, and also occasional, sporadic sales by a licensed collector who is not a dealer. Prohibits any person other than a licensed importer, licensed dealer or licensed manufacturer from knowingly possessing or transfering any handgun unless it is registered with the Secretary under this Act. Provides that the application for registration shall be filed in such form as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe, including: (1) the name, address, and social security or taxpayer identification number of the applicant; (2) the number of the Federal handgun license issued to the applicant pursuant to this section; (3) the name of manufacturer, the caliber or gauge, the model and the type, and the serial number of the handgun; and (4) the date, place, and name, address, and license number of the person from whom the handgun was obtained. Specifies registration fees to be paid by applicants. Makes ineligible for registration any person who (1) is under 18 years of age; (2) is, because of alcoholism, drug addiction, or mental disease or defect, an individual who cannot possess or use handguns safely or responsibly; (3) has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; (4) is a fugitive from justice; (5) is not of good moral character; or (6) is not qualified under all applicable Federal, State, and local laws to register a handgun. Requires notice to the Secretary from a person to whom a handgun registration certificate has been issued under this section if such person changes his address, or transfers possession of a registered handgun. Makes similar provisions for obtaining a Federal handgun license for a handgun and ammunition of a caliber other than .22 rimfire. States that information required to be included in any application, certificate, or license submitted to or issued by the Secretary under this Act shall not be disclosed by him except to the National Crime Information Center established by the F.B.I., and to law enforcement officers requiring such information in pursuit of their official duties. Prescribes penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes the payment of compensation for the reasonable value of handguns voluntarily transferred to law enforcement agencies. Provides that the Secretary may prescribe such other rules and regulations as he deems reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.
