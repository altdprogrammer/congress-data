    "text": "Surface Transportation Act - Title I: Financial Assistance to Surface Transportation Companies - Revenue Financing and Railroad Equipment Obligation Insurance Fund Act - Creates in the Department of Transportation, under the Interstate Commerce Act, a Revenue Financing Division to aid in financing the transportation industry and commerce and to help in maintaining its economic stability and that of the country by promoting maximum employment and production. Provides for an Assistant Secretary of Transportation to assist the Secretary of Transportation in the execution of his functions under this title. Establishes a Loan Policy Board to establish any necessary general policies which shall govern the granting or denying of applications for financial assistance by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to guarantee lenders against loss of principal and interest on loans made to any common carrier in the transportation industry organized or operating under the laws of any State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, or the United States. Provides that, in making such guarantees, the Secretary shall determine that the prospective earning power of the enterprise furnishes reasonable assurance that the enterprise will be able to repay the loan within the time fixed and afford reasonable protection to the United States. Provides that the Secretary may not authorize any such loan guarantee with respect to a common carrier by railroad unless satisfied that the expeditures will improve the utilization and distribution of rolling stock and materially contribute to the efficiency of rail operations.

Authorizes the Secretary to make commitments to insure any equipment obligation prior to the date of execution or disbursement thereon. Provides that, to be eligible for such insurance, the Secretary must find: (1) the equipment obligation is secured by rolling stock to be financed or refinanced thereby; (2) the financing or refinancing of the rolling stock is justified by the present and future demand for transportation services to be rendered by the railroad for which the rolling stock is procured; and (3) the purchase of the rolling stock will contribute toward a national car supply adequate to meet the needs of shippers and the economy. Provides that, if at any time the money in the fund is not sufficient to pay any amount the Secretary is required to pay under an agreement, the Secretary is authorized to issue to the Secretary of the Treasury notes or other obligations in such forms and determinations, hearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to assist in the design of a national rolling stock information service and to contract with, and provide technical and financial assistance to, individual railroads or a group of railroads working together including the sharing of costs and the funding in part of demonstration projects, to assist in the establishment of a national rolling stock information system of approved design.

Provides that the district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to issue such writs of injunction or other property process as may be necessary to restrain any State, or subdivision or agency thereof, or any person from doing anything or performing any act declared to be unlawful. Title III: Procedures for Abandonment of Nonproductive Rail Facilities - Abandonment of Nonproductive Rail Facilities Act - Provides expeditious administrative procedures for the abandonment of nonproductive facilities under the Interstate Commerce Act. (Amends 49 U.S.C. 1) Title IV: Provision Relating to Competitive Equity - Competitive Equity Act - Provides, under the Interstate Commerce Act, that the Interstate Commerce Commission shall, on a continuing basis, investigate and identify traffics which are moving at rates below the variable costs incurred in handling the traffics to which such rates apply and cause such rates to be promptly brought to at least such variable costs. Provides that the Commission shall promulgate and continually maintain standards and procedures for the determination of revenue levels adequate under honest, economical, and efficient management to cover operating and capital costs, including a fair, reasonable, and economic profit.
