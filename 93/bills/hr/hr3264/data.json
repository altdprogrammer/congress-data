    "text": "Crime Victims Compensation Act - Creates the Commission to Compensate Victims of Crimes of Violence, to consist of five members appointed by the Commissioner of the District of Columbia, no more than three of whom may be members of the same political party, at least one of whom is licensed to practice medicine in the District and another of whom is licensed to practice law in the District. Authorizes the Commission to accept applications for compensation under the Act and to determine the amount of compensation, if any, to which applicants are entitled; to hold hearings; to appoint necessary officers, attorneys, examiners and other experts; to submit to the Commissioner each year a written report setting out a summary of the application disposed of by the Commission; and to promulgate rules and regulations consistent with the Act and necessary to its administration. Provides that a person is entitled to compensation under the Act if he is a victim, as defined by the Act, or a dependent of a deceased victim; his pecuniary loss is $50 or more; the appropriate law enforcement officials were notified of the crime; the applicant has fully cooperated with law enforcement officials; the victim and his assailant were not related or of the same household; the injury was not entirely attributable to the victim's wrongful act or provacation of the assailant; and the application for compensation is filed within twelve months of the date of the injury. Provides that pecuniary loss includes, in the case of injury, medical expenses, hospital expenses, loss of earnings, loss of future earnings because of a disability, and other actual expenses incurred and, in the case of death, funeral and burial expenses and loss of support to dependents of the victim. Prescribes information to be given on applications for compensation submitted to the Commission. Establishes procedures for the consideration of applications and authorizes hearings upon request of the applicant. Voids any agreement by an individual to waive, release or commute his rights under the Act. Authorizes to be appropriated for fiscal year 1973 for the cost of administering the Act not to exceed $250,000 and for payment of the compensation awards not to exceed $1,750,000. Makes the Act applicable only to injuries inflicted on or after July 1, 1972."
