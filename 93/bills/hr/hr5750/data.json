    "text": "States as a finding of the Congress that energy sources are in short supply, that Congress should act to recover underground petroleum reserves on the North Slope of Alaska, and that the study of alternative methods of recovery and delivery should thoroughly consider environmental effects, economic costs, and national security aspects of such recovery and delivery methods. Authorizes the Director of the Office of Technology Assessment to conduct a thorough study of such recovery and delivery methods, to enter into contracts appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Act, and to secure necessary information from any department or agency of the Federal Government. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into negotiations with the Government of Canada to determine the feasibility and availability of a right-of-way across Canadian territory for transmission facilities for the petroleum reserves on the North Slope of Alaska, and directs the Secretary to report to Congress the results of his negotiations within one year after the date of enactment of this Act. Delays the granting of a right-of-way, easement, or use of any Federal land for the development and operation of a pipeline for the transmission of petroleum from the North Slope of Alaska until 60 days after the Director has filed his report to the Congress. Establishes rules for the procedure to be followed in each House of the Congress in the case of resolutions referring to the matter of this Act. Authorizes funds necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act."
