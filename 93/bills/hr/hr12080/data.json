    "text": "Revises the Freedom of Information Act by requiring each United States government agency to publish and distribute copies of (1) final opinions made in the adjudication of cases, (2) those statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register, and (3) administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public. Requires each agency, upon receipt of any request for records under this Act, to (1) acknowledge such receipt within five days, (2) determine whether to comply within ten days and immediately inform the requestor of his right to appeal to the agency head any adverse determination, and (3) make a determination with respect to such appeal within twenty days. Exempts from requests under the Freedom of Information Act matter authorized under Executive order or statute to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. Prescribes reporting requirements for agencies to Congress with respect to requests made under this Act. Defines the term agency as any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the Executive branch (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency."
