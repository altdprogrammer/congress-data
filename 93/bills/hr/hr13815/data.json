Provides that, during the thirty-day period following such publication, the Commissioner shall provide interested parties with an opportunity to present their views and make recommendations with respect to such schedule. Provides that, not later than fifteen days after the conclusion of such period, the Commissioner shall submit to the Chairman of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare of the Senate, and to the Chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives, a summary of the comments received by the Commissioner during such period.
