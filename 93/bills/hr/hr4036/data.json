Provides that the President shall appoint the chairmen of the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Power Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Interstate Commerce Commission from among the members of such bodies by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and that each such member shall serve in such capacity until the expiration of his term on such body. Revokes the power of the President to remove for inefficiency a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Interstate Commerce Commission. Authorizes the President to remove for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office a member of the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Power Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Authorizes the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Federal Power Commission to act in its own name and through its own attorneys in any civil action and to supervise and conduct litigation in any civil action to which the Commission is a party. Provides that any communication to Congress respecting legislation, by any independent regulatory agency, whether transmitted in its annual report or otherwise, shall not be submitted to or be subject to clearance by the Office of Management and Budget or any other authority. Provides, under the Budget and Accounting Act, that the President's Budget as submitted to Congress shall set forth the text of the original submission to the Office of Management and Budget by each independent regulatory agency of the estimated expenditures and proposed appropriations necessary in the judgment of the agency for its support, and any agency comments which accompanied such submission. Provides that an independent regulatory agency may not conduct or sponsor the collection of information upon identical items, from ten or more persons, other than Federal employees, unless in advance of adoption or revision of any forms to be used in such collection the agency invites comment from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Provides for access to information held by such independent regulatory agencies by specified congressional committees."
