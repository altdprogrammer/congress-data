Defines the terms used in this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting by and through the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration, to operate and maintain the Federal transmission system within the Pacific Northwest. States that if the Administrator, after good-faith negotiations with a utility in the Pacific Northwest desiring to provide all or a part of such facilities, retains an item in his budget for a transmission facility, such utility may bring suit in the Federal District Court of Oregon for the purpose of determining if the Administrator has complied with the provisions of this Act. Provides for the establishment of rates and charges for the transmission of electric power over the Federal transmission system. Establishes the Bonneville Power Administration Fund in the Treasury of the United States. Specifies the sources of revenue for the Fund, and authorizes expenditures from the Fund for any purpose appropriate to carry out the duties imposed upon the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration. Authorizes the Administrator to issue and sell revenue bonds in the name and on behalf of the Bonneville Power Administration, the aggregate principal amount of any such bonds outstanding at any one time not to exceed $1,250,000,000."
