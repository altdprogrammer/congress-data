Imposes the limitation that no individual may serve as the Director for more than a total of eight years. (Amends 50 U.S.C. 403(a)) Limits the powers and duties of the Agency to specified matters relating to foreign intelligence activities (previously matters relating to intelligence activities generally). (Amends 50 U.S.C. 403(d) Provides that nothing in the National Security Act or any other provision of law may be construed as authorizing the Agency to plan or to implement directly or indirectly any covert operation. Defines the term \"covert operation\" to mean any military or paramilitary operation, any effort of any kind to achieve the overthrow of any foreign government, and any assassination or attempt to assassinate. (Adds 50 U.S.C. 403(d)(2)) Provides, under the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 (50 U.S.C. 403 (a) et seq.), that it shall be the duty of the Agency to inform, in response to request, within 60 days, the Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Affairs of the House and the Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations of the Senate regarding intelligence information collected by the Agency concerning the relations of the United States to foreign countries and matters of national security. States that the Agency may not: (1) carry out within the United States any police-type operation or activity, any law enforcement operation or activity, or any internal security operation or activity; (2) provide assistance to any other department or agency of the Federal Government or any State or local government engaged in police law enforcement or internal security operation within the United States unless such assistance is provided with the prior, specific, written approval of the Central Intelligence Agency oversight subcommittees of the Committees on Appropriations and the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House; or (3) participate, directly or indirectly, in any illegal activity within the United States."
