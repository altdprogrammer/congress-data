    "text": "Housing Rights Act - Provides that any provision or requirement in building codes or other local law or ordinance, or in any contract or agreement, which restricts the use of new or improved techniques, methods, or materials or of preassembled products in connection with the construction or major rehabilitation of federally assisted housing shall be invalid with respect to such housing except where such restriction is deemed necessary to assure safe and healthful working or living conditions. Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to test, or have tested, and to certify the comparability of new residential building techniques, methods, materials, and products with conventional ones. Provides that if the Attorney General of the United States, after consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and as appropriate with other interested Federal officials, believes that a provision or requirement in a building code or other local law or ordinance, or in any contract or agreement is invalid, he may bring a civil action in any appropriate United States district court to have the provision or requirement judicially declared invalid."
