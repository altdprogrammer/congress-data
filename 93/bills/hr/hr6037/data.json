    "text": "Timber Export Administration Act - Declares that it is national policy to alleviate the harmful effects of the excessive exportation of logs by limiting the volumes thereof that may be exported from the United States. Provides that, except for specific quantities of timber that are found to be surplus, no logs may be exported from Federal lands after January 1, 1974, and that no logs may be exported from any lands after January 1, 1977. Establishes the procedures to be followed by the Secretary of Commerce in determining whether a given quantity of logs are surplus to the needs of domestic users and processers. Provides for a general exemption from coverage for logs cut under Federal timber sales contracts entered into prior to March 1, 1973. Outlines the procedures to be followed by the Secretary's determinations in order to phase out, over a three-year period, all non-Federal log exports. Requires each person who exports timber, under the phase-out quota system, or under the surplus quantities provision in this Act, to file an annual report with the Secretary of Commerce detailing his precise level of exports and the sources of his logs. Requires exporters to provide the Secretary with access to related books, records, and accounts, and log storage areas. Provides for a maximum penalty of $10,000 or one year in prison or both for each violation of the provisions of this title. Provides that any party violating this title shall be prohibited from exporting logs for five years. (Amends 50 App. U.S.C. 2401-2413)"
