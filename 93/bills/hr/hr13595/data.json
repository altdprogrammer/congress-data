Authorizes for the Coast Guard an end-year strength for active duty personnel of 37,748 and average military student loads for the fiscal year 1975. Authorizes the use of funds originally appropriated to the Coast Guard for the primary and secondary schooling of dependents of Coast Guard personnel stationed outside the continental United States when the schools available in the locality are unable to provide adequately for the education of those dependents. Exempts vessels of not more than 5,000 gross tons used in the processing or assembling of fishery products in the fisheries of the States of Oregon, Washington, and Alaska from Coast Guard administered load line and inspection requirements. Requires the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to conduct a study of all feasible methods of enforcing fishery management jurisdiction, including any possible extension of such jurisdiction."
