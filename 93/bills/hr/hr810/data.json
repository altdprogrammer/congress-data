    "text": "Establishes a twelve member Federal Judiciary Council to advise the Congress, the Executive and the Judicial Conference of the United States on matters affecting the administration of the courts of the United States. Provides that it shall be the duty of the Council to report to the Congress from time to time, but not less than once each year, with respect to: (1) the impact of proposed legislation on the administration of justice in the courts of the United States; (2) the desirability of legislation to modernize court procedures and thereby to ease court congestion; (3) the necessity for additional personnel and facilities to handle, in a prompt and efficient manner, the increasing number of judicial proceedings; and (4) the appropriate allocation of judicial functions to the Federal courts. Authorizes the Council to: (1) request from any department, agency, or independent instrumentality of the Government any information it deems necessary to perform its duties under this chapter, and each such department, agency, or instrumentality is directed to cooperate with the Council and to furnish such information, to the extent permitted by law, upon request of the Council and (2) make expenditures and to contract with and compensate government and private agencies and persons for research projects and other services."
