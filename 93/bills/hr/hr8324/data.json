Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in consultation with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, to develop and carry out a demonstration and research program to determine the nature and extent of the problem of lead based paint poisoning in the United States, particularly in urban areas, including the methods by which the lead based paint hazard can most effectively be removed from interior surfaces, porches, and exterior surfaces of residential housing to which children may be exposed. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to establish procedures to eliminate as far as practicable the hazards of lead based paint poisoning with respect to any existing housing which may present such hazards and which is covered by an application for mortgage insurance or housing assistance payments under a program administered by the Secretary. Provides that the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, in consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, shall take such steps and impose such conditions as may be necessary or appropriate: (1) to prohibit the use of lead based paint in residential structures constructed or rehabilitated by the Federal Government, or with Federal assistance in any form, after the date of enactment of this Act, and (2) to prohibit the application of lead based paint to any toy, furniture, cooking utensil, drinking utensil, or eating utensil manufactured and distributed after the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, in consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to establish a National Childhood Lead Based Paint Poisoning Advisory Board to advise the Secretary on policy relating to the administration of this Act. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, in consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to promulgate regulations for the establishment of an advisory board for each local program assisted under this Act to assist in carrying out this program. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to private nonprofit organizations and any public agency of a unit of local government in any State to develop programs to detect and treat incidents of lead-based paint poisoning under the Lead Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act. Increases from seventy-five percent to ninety percent the limit on the Federal share of the cost of developing such programs. Stipulates that any organizations receiving funds under this Act shall make available to the Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United States any books and records necessary to assist them in auditing funds received under this Act. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to conduct appropriate research on multiple layers of dried paint film, containing the various lead compounds commonly used, in order to ascertain the safe level of lead in residential paint products. States that, not later than December 31, 1973, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a full report of his findings and recommendations as developed pursuant to such programs. Directs the Secretary to take such steps as are necessary to prohibit the application of lead-based paint to any toy, furniture, cooking utensil, drinking utensil, or eating utensil manufactured and distributed after the date of enactment of this Act. Lowers, over a two-year period, the percentage of lead contained in a paint for such paint to qualify as a lead-based paint for the purposes of this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $20,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1974 and 1975 for grants used for the detection and treatment of lead-based paint poisoning, $30,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1974 and 1975 for grants used for the elimination of lead-based paint poisoning, and $2,500,000 for each of the fiscal years 1974 and 1975 for Federal demonstration and research programs on the elimination of lead-based paint poisoning.
