Provides that a State which permits the sale of wine within the State shall permit the transportation or importation of wine of like kind produced in other States, or from materials originating in other States, into said State for sale therein upon terms and conditions equally applicable to all wine of like kind sold in the State. Provides that whenever the law of any State permits the transportation or importation of wine into that State, such State may not impose with respect to such wine any prohibition or requirement which unreasonably impairs the free flow of commerce in such wine among the several States. Provides that whenever any person engaged in the transportation or importation into any State or the distribution within any State of any wine, or any product intended for use in the production of any wine has reason to believe that such State has violated any of the provisions of this Act, such person may file in a district court of the United States of competent jurisdiction, a civil action to enjoin the enforcement thereof. Gives such court jurisdiction to hear and determine such action, and to enter therein such preliminary and permanent orders, decrees, and judgments as it shall determine to be required to prevent any such violation."
