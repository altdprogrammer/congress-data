    "text": "Schoolchildren's Assistance Act - Authorizes a 2 year program of financial assistance for all elementary and secondary school children. Declares that it is the intent of Congress to: guarantee the right of the parent to have his child educated in a school of his own choosing; perpetuate freedom of choice at all levels of education; continue the pluralistic system of education presently operative in the United States; avoid direct or indirect contravention of constitutionally guaranteed rights in matters of education; provide equal opportunity for all children; and provide educational opportunity to all children. Prohibits Federal Government officers or employees administering this Act from exercising direction or control over the policy determination, personnel, curriculum, or administration of any school. Authorizes appropriations, without any condition inconsistent with this Act being placed on such appropriations, for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1972 in the sum of $5,070,000,000 and for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1973, in the sum of $5,070,000,000. Provides that the sum of $100 shall be allotted annually to each school pupil for the purposes of defraying the costs of his education. Asserts that if a parent or legal guardian declares to the Commissioner of Education his intention to have his ward attend private school, the allotment may be granted to such private school by the Commissioner who has the power to promulgate the rules to protect the interest of the child and of the United States."
