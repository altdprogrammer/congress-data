States that user fees at these lakes and reservoirs shall be collected by officers and employees of the United States only from users of highly developed facilities requiring continuous presence of personnel for maintenance and supervision of the facilities, and shall not be collected for day use or for access to or use of water areas, undeveloped or lightly developed shoreland, boat launching ramps where no mechanical or hydraulic equipment is provided, roads, or visitor centers, or for access to or use of moderately developed facilities such as, but not limited to, picnic sites, playgrounds, drinking water, wayside exhibits, trails, overlook sites, scenic drives, toilet facilities, automobile parking areas, or for access to or use of areas containing one or more of such facilities. Provides for the collection of reasonable admission fees for a single visit at any designated area from persons who choose not to purchase the annual permit or who enter such an area by means other than by private, noncommercial vehicle. Defines 'single visit' as that length of time a visitor remains within the exterior boundary of a designated fee area beginning from the day he first enters the area until he leaves, except that on the same day such admission fee is paid, the visitor may leave and reenter without the payment of an additional admission fee to the same area."
