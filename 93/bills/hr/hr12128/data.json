    "text": "Energy Emergency Act - Title I: Energy Emergency Authorities - Establishes, until May 15, 1975, a Federal Energy Emergency Administration headed by an Administrator appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Authorizes the President to promulgate a rule for the establishment of a program for the rationing and ordering of priorities among classes of end-users of crude oil, residual fuel oil, or any refined petroleum product, and for the assignment to end-users of such products of rights, and evidence of such rights, entitling them to obtain such products in precedence to other classes of end-users not similarly entitled. Authorizes the Administrator to promulgate one or more energy conservation plans which shall be designed to result in a reduction of energy consumption to a level which can be supplied by available energy resources. Directs the Administrator to order the use of coal instead of natural gas or petroleum products in industry having the capability and necessary plant equipment to burn coal. Prevents refiners or distributors from cancelling, failing to renew or otherwise terminating a franchise unless he furnishes prior notification pursuant to this Act to each distributor and retailer affected thereby. Declares that any action taken under this Act or any other act resulting in the allocation of petroleum products and electrical energy shall be equitable, shall not be arbitrary or capricious, and shall not unreasonably discriminate among classes of users. Provides that no provision of this Act shall be deemed to convey to any person subject to this Act any immunity from civil and criminal liability or to create defenses to actions under the antitrust laws. States that to achieve the purposes of this Act, the Administrator may provide for the establishment of such advisory committees as he determines are necessary. Restricts exports of coal, petroleum products, and petrochemical feedstock under such terms as the Administrator deems appropriate. Directs the President to take into consideration and to minimize to the fullest extent possible any adverse impact of this Act on employment including the making of grants to affected individuals. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to encourage the creation and expansion of the use of carpools. Authorizes to be appropriated $5,000,000 for this purpose. Sets forth administrative procedures and provides for judicial review of decisions made pursuant to this Act in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Provides penalties for violations of this Act. Allows the Administrator to delegate any of his functions to any officer or employee of the Federal Energy Emergency Administration. Requires the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Interior to publish a regulation requiring that persons doing business in the United States who are engaged in exploring developing, processing, refining, or transporting by pipeline, any petroleum product, natural gas, or coal, to provide detailed reports to the Attorney General or the Secretary of the Interior every sixty days. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act. Title II: Coordination with Environmental Protection Requirements - Provides that the Administrator may temporarily suspend any stationary source fuel or emission limitation as it applies to any person if the Administrator finds that such person will be unable to comply with such limitation during such period solely because of the unavailability of types or amounts of fuels. States that such exemption will be given only if the Administrator determines that emissions from the source will not materially contribute to a significant risk to public health. Declares that for any air quality control region where there has been a conversion to coal, the Administrator shall review applicable implementation plans of the Clean Air Act. Requires the Administrator to conduct a study on the necessity of a parking surcharge, management of parking supply, and preferential bus/carpool lane regulations as part of the applicable implementation plans required to achieve and maintain national primary ambient air quality standards. Requires low sulfur fuel to be distributed on a priority basis to those areas of the country designated by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency as requiring low sulfur fuel to avoid or minimize adverse impact on public health. Title III: Studies and Reports - Requires specified studies relating to fuel shortages and the Energy Emergency Act be made and the results thereof reported to the President and the Congress."
