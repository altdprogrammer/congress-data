States that such increases shall take place in two-year steps. Provides that the rates for the first 250,000 pieces of each user of a second class publication shall not exceed 66-2/3 percent of the applicable rates. Provides that after July 6, 1972, the revenues received from rates for second class publications shall not exceed 50 percent of the published rate. Authorizes the Postal Service to request the Postal Rate Commission to make a recommendation for an adjustment in rates for a particular class of mail where the Congress fails to appropriate any of the amounts authorized to be so appropriated, and where under the Federal Voting Assistance Act of 1955 such amount was requested by the President in the budget."
