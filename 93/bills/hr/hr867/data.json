    "text": "National Child Abuse Act - Provides for the protection of children under 16 years of age who have had physical injury inflicted upon them, or who are further threatened with physical injury by the conduct of those responsible for their care and protection. Requires any doctor, schoolteacher, social worker, or welfare worker who finds or has reason to suspect that physical injury to a child (by guardians) has occurred to submit a full report to the appropriate police or judicial authorizies. Makes it a misdemeanor for such persons if they fail to report, and grants immunity to any such person who files a report in good faith. Directs the authority to which the report was filed to take the appropriate police and judicial action necessary to protect the child. Provides for removal of the child from the home if, in the investigation, it is determined that either or both parents are drug addicts. Provides that all payments or assistance under the Social Security Act shall be discontinued if either or both of the parents are guilty of child abuse or drug addictions, and that such assistance shall be made instead to an appropriate foster parent, foster home, or welfare agency to be used for the benefit of the child. Establishes a system whereby the Secretary of HEW shall issue a social security account number for every child in the United States (immediately after birth) in order to establish and place in operation an effective national child-identification system."
