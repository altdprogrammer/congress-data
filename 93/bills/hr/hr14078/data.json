    "text": "Housing Act for Older Americans and the Handicapped - States the finding of the Congress that among the low-income people of the Nation, millions of our elderly and many handicapped persons, unable to perform to the extent of providing their essential needs for a suitable living environment, are unnecessarily suffering in need for assistance. Makes it the purpose of this Act to give appropriate and positive support to the elderly and the handicapped, by making available a Federal housing assistance program. States that it is the intent of Congress that a community's planning, development, and management activities, directly or indirectly supported by Federal programs, will permit and encourage participation by elderly and handicapped persons so that the needs and potential contributions of these special groups can be readily acknowledged. Provides, under the provisions of the United States Housing Act of 1937, that for the purpose of providing more adequate assistance to low income elderly and handicapped individuals, each public housing agency under such Act shall, to the maximum extent consistent with the achievement of the objectives of such Act, and supplemental to other provisions of such Act which make specific reference to the elderly and the handicapped, provide housing for such individuals in accordance with this Act. Requires that at least 25 percent of the total amount of contracts for annual contribution contracts entered into in any fiscal year under such Act shall be entered into with respect to units of low-rent housing specially designed for the elderly or the handicapped in accordance with this Act. Requires that multifamily housing projects assisted under such Act for the predominant or exclusive use of elderly or handicapped individuals shall be specifically designed to accomodate the special environmental needs of the intended occupant, and be in appropriate support of, and supported by, applicable plans of a State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and possessions of the United States, or of a subdivision within any State, which respond to Federal program requirements. Requires that public housing agencies under such Act, where practicable, contract for the use of dwelling units in a manner which will promote the efficient provision of needed services to elderly and handicapped individuals, as in a community's comprehensive plan for the aged or the handicapped. Authorizes a public housing agency, notwithstanding any otherwise applicable limit on the number of units which could be contracted for in any structure, to enter into lease contracts with the owners of structures containing dwelling units predominantly or exclusively for occupancy by elderly or handicapped families for the use of all or some of such units in accordance with the provisions of this Act."
