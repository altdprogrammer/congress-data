States that no union or organization that sponsors, approves, or sanctions amateur international competition may declare ineligible for amateur international competition any student-athlete because he has participated in an amateur athletic event not sponsored, approved, or sanctioned by such union, or organization. Directs that no coach of a student-athlete may be prohibited from or penalized for participating in international competition because such competition was not sponsored or sanctioned by an organization of which the institution of higher learning is a member. Penalizes any violation of this Act by a fine of up to $10,000."
