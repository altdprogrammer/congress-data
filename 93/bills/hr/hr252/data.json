    "text": "Declares that for the purposes of determining entitlement to monthly benefits or a lump sum death payment under the Old-Age, Survivors', and Disability Insurance provisions of the Social Security Act, an individual shall be deemed to have performed employment and to have been paid wages in each month during which he or she performed householder service. Provides that an individual shall be considered as performing householder service during any month if such individual: (1) has attained the age of 18 by the end of such month: (2) lives with and maintains a household for one or more other persons during all of such month; (3) is not the dependent of such other persons (except as the spouse of one of them); and (4) does not perform employment or engage in self employment at a rate of income which is sufficient to make the quarter in which such month falls a quarter of coverage. Establishes the procedure to be used by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to compute the monthly insurance benefit to which any individual is entitled, for the month in which this Act is enacted, on the basis of the self employment income of a person who has performed householder service. Authorizes the appropriation of such funds as the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare deems necessary to meet the additional cost of benefits paid under this Act."
