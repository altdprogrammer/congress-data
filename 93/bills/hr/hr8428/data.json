    "text": "National Labor Relations Act Judicial Procedures Amendments - Provides that if an employer or a labor organization submits to arbitration in any State or Federal court, such party then shall not have any right to have an action in a different forum, unless the prior suit is dismissed or is denied for lack of jurisdiction. Prescribes punitive measures to be taken by the National Labor Relations Board for unfair labor practices. Declares that acts of violence or threats shall not be condoned or excused by reason of any unfair labor practices of any other party. Changes court review standards on evidence. Eliminates forum shopping by spelling out procedures for review of a final order of the Board."
