    "text": "Prohibits any officer or employee of the United States or of any federally assisted law enforcement agency from disseminating in any manner any criminal arrest record to any person other than another officer or employee of a law enforcement agency. Provides that no officer or employee of the United States or of a federally assisted law enforcement agency may disseminate to any person a criminal arrest record: (1) relating to an arrest which occurred more than two years before the date of such dissemination and concerning which there is no prosecution pending in a court; (2) relating to an arrest concerning which the prosecuting attorney responsible for conducting any prosecution arising out of such arrest agrees no prosecution is warranted and that no criminal arrest record should be kept; or (3) which is expunged, or prohibited from being used under a provision of a law of the State in which the arrest which is the subject of such record occurred, or by order of a court having jurisdiction with respect to such arrest. Grants every person the right to inspect any criminal arrest record concerning him maintained by any officer or employee of the United States or of a federally assisted law enforcement agency, and to receive the name of all persons to whom the arrest record was transmitted during the six-month period preceding the request. Permits a person with reason to believe that there will be an illegal dissemination or use of his arrest record to petition any United States district court to issue an order enjoining such maintenance or dissemination, or correcting such record. Allows the Attorney General or any officer of a law enforcement agency to apply to a Federal court for an order authorizing the dissemination or use of a criminal arrest record, if the applicant can show by substantial and convincing evidence that there is a compelling public interest in such dissemination or use. Provides that in responding to any question concerning any arrest the respondent may consider such question to apply only to an arrest the record of which may be lawfully disseminated or used by the Attorney General. Allows civil actions against a person responsible for the violation of any of these arrest record provisions, and allows the recovery of actual and exemplary damages. Prescribes a criminal penalty for the violation of these sections, with a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment of not more than one year, or both. Authorizes the Attorney General, after consulting with officers and members of State and local law enforcement agencies, to prescribe such regulations as he deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. (Adds 18 U.S.C. 3101-3110)"
