Requires the Secretary, on the basis of such studies, to transmit to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency information as to how, in the use of insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and other pesticides, injury to fish and wildlife can be prevented or minimized. Authorizes to be appropriated $3,500,000 for each of the fiscal years 1974, 1975, and 1976 in order to carry out the provision's set forth in the first paragraph of this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions set forth in the second paragraph of this Act."
