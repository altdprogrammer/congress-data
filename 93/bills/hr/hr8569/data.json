Directs the Secretary to incorporate specified requirements in mortgages, loans and contracts, to assure such compliance. Title II: Assistance in Financing Fire Safety Equipment for Multifamily Housing Facilities Occupied by Senior Citizens - Authorizes the Secretary to insure loans made by financial institutions to the owners or sponsors of rental projects and to public housing agencies to provide fire safety equipment. Sets forth the requirements under which loans shall be eligible for such insurance. Provides that such assistance to any low-rent housing project shall not be construed as authorizing increases in rent or altering the eligibility requirements for low-rent housing."
