Establishes a National Milk Marketing Board consisting of twelve directors to be appointed by the President upon recommendation by the Secretary of Agriculture, by cooperatives, and by handlers, to serve for terms of three years. Empowers the Board to designate certified agents pursuant to this Act, enforce prices and payments of rates for services, and promulgate regulations for enforcing this Act. Authorizes the certified agents to bargain with handlers, to provide services for producers and to pay for such services, to provide services for the market generally, and to collect from handlers certain prices for milk negotiated by the bargaining agency. Provides for the review of the certified agency's actions by the Secretary."
