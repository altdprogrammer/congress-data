    "text": "Mining and Minerals Resources Research Act - Authorizes to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior sums adequate to provide each participating State $200,000 for fiscal year 1974 $300,000 for fiscal year 1975, and $400,000 for each fiscal year thereafter, for the purpose of assisting each State in carrying on the work of a competent and qualified mining and mineral resources research institute, or equivalent agency at certain colleges or universities in such State. Requires that Federal funds used to support such institutes must be matched by non-Federal funds. Makes it the duty of such institutes to arrange for related studies or experiments by various components of the universities or colleges with which they are associated. Authorizes a $5,000,000 annual appropriation for fiscal year 1973 and the four succeeding fiscal years to meet necessary expenses of specific mineral research and demonstration projects of industrywide application undertaken by institutes. Makes the money appropriated under this Act available for paying the expenses involved in publishing reports and for coordinating programs with other institutes and other agencies. Authorizes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1974, increasing $2,000,000 annually for 5 years, and continuing at $20,000,000 annually thereafter, for the making of grants, contracts and other arrangements with educational, private, and governmental institutions to research mining and mineral resources problems related to the mission of the Department of the Interior. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to appoint an Advisory Committee on Mining and Minerals Resources Research."
