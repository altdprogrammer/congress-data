    "text": "Elementary and Secondary Education Amendments - Title I: Extension of Programs - Extends through 1978 the programs of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 including: (1) School Library Program; (2) Programs for Supplementary Educational Centers and Services and Guidance, Counseling, and Testing; (3) Programs to Strengthen State and Local Educational Agencies; (4) Bilingual Education Programs; (5) Drop-Out Prevention Programs; (6) Programs for the Education of the Handicapped; and (7) Programs of Assistance to Local Educational Agencies for the Education of Indian Children. Title II: Amendments of Existing Programs - Authorizes to be appropriated for each fiscal year an amount equal to not more than three percent of the amount appropriated to the States for the education of children of low-income families. Provides that the amount appropriated be allotted to: (1) Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands according to their respective need for grants as determined by the Commissioner of Education; and (2) the Secretary of the Interior in the amount necessary for him to make special use of the funds for Indian children. Provides that a local educational agency in a State shall be able to receive for a fiscal year: (1) $300 for each child in the school district of the local educational agency, aged five to seventeen, inclusive, who is in a family having an annual income of less than $4,000, in a family receiving an annual income in excess of $4,000 from payments under the program of aid to dependent children under a State plan approved under title IV of the Social Security Act or living in an institution for neglected or delinquent children, or being supported in foster homes with public funds; and (2) an amount arrived at by multiplying the number of children determined in the manner just described by fifty percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the State or, if greater, in the United States. Provides grants to State educational agencies establishing programs of education for the physically and mentally handicapped, for the migratory children of migratory agricultural workers, and for neglected or delinquent children. States that if the sums appropriated for any fiscal year for making the payments provided for under this title are not sufficient to pay in full the total amounts which all local educational agencies are eligible to receive, the allocations to such agencies shall be the extent necessary to bring the aggregate of such allocations within the limits of the amounts so appropriated. Title III: Study of Late Funding of Elementary and Secondary Education Programs - Directs the Commissioner of Education to make a full and complete investigation and study to determine: (1) the extent to which late funding of Federal programs to assist elementary and secondary education handicaps local educational agencies in the effective planning of their education programs, and the extent to which program quality and achievement of program objectives is adversely affected by such late funding, and (2) means by which, through legislative or administrative action, the problem can be overcome. Provides that, not later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commissioner of Education shall make a report to the Congress on such study, together with such recommendations as he may deem appropriate."
