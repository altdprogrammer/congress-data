    "text": "Safe Drinking Water Act - Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish and publish national drinking water regulations specifying the maximum permissible level of harmful contaminants in water from a public water system. Prescribes regulations for State underground waste injection control programs with inspection, monitoring, reporting, and control requirements to prevent harmful contaminants. Provides that a State has primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems and underground water sources during any period for which the Administrator determines that such State has adopted and is implementing acceptable drinking water standards. Provides for civil actions to require compliance by any State failing to assure enforcement of drinking water regulations. Provides that the Administrator, upon receipt of information that a contaminant in a public water system may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons, and that appropriate State authorities have not acted, may take such actions as he may deem necessary in order to protect the health of such persons. Authorizes the Administrator to conduct research and programs to control diseases resulting from contaminants in water, including improved methods to identify and measure contaminants, and improved methods of water treatment, purification, and distribution. Authorizes grants for projects designed to train personnel for occupations involving the public health aspects of providing safe drinking water. Authorizes appropriations for grants to States to carry out the drinking water programs established under this Act. Makes provisions for State plans and applications for assistance. Establishes a National Drinking Water Advisory Council of 15 members to advise the Administrator on matters relating to this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to prescribe such regulations as are necessary to carry out his functions under this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to establish and promulgate bottled drinking water standards. Requires the registration of preparers of bottled drinking water. Prescribes penalties for failure to comply with these registration provisions."
