    "text": "Quality School Assistance Act - Provides financial assistance to local educational agencies to assure that their resources will be adequate to provide an excellent elementary and secondary education for all children. Authorizes to be appropriated such amounts as are necessary for carrying out the purposes of this Act. Provides guidelines to be followed in making allotments to the educational agencies in each State out of the sums appropriated for the purposes of this Act. Requires any local educational agency in a State which desires to receive a grant to make an application containing: (1) an analysis of its needs for teacher preparation programs, facilities, student progress, adult education programs and a description of proposed use of funds; (2) an evaluation of the effectiveness of funded programs; (3) assurances that the agency will provide programs in private nonprofit schools of a secular or nonideological nature or such other arrangements as dual enrollments which will assure adequate participation of the children concerned; (4) assurances that funds used, property acquired, and services provided shall be by and through a public agency and that necessary records will be kept; and (5) assurance that no more than 10 percent of the funds received will be used for capital outlay and debt service. Provides that funds may not be disapproved by the State educational agency until such local agency has had an opportunity for a hearing. Provides that any State desiring to participate in such programs must submit through its State educational agency an application containing assurances and such other information as the Secretary of Education shall deem appropriate. Makes provision for the terms upon which funds are to be disbursed to the State educational agency and in turn to the local educational agency. Provides that no payment shall be made to a State which has taken into consideration payments under this section in determining the eligibility of any local educational agency in that State for State aid or the amount of that aid with respect to the free public education of children during that year or the preceding years. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend payments where, after an opportunity for a hearing, there has been found to be a failure to comply substantially with any assurance given. Permits any State dissatisfied with the Secretary's final action to file within sixty days of notice of such action in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which such State is located a petition for review of that action. Authorizes the court upon good cause shown to remand the case for further evidence and findings, or to affirm the action of the Secretary. Provides funds for the purpose of construction of facilities for local educational agencies for those pupils who are in excess of the assumed maximum classroom size of thirty students, for those one-room schools and those which lack library facilities. Makes applicable and coordinates to this Act provisions of the General Education Provisions Act."
