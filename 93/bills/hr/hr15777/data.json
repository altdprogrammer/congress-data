    "text": "Title I: Police and Firemen's Salary Amendments - Revises the salary schedule contained in the District of Columbia Police and Firemen's Salary Act of 1958. Title II: Study of Police and Firemen's Salaries and Recommendations - Provides for an annual study of police and firemen's salaries by a city personnel salary and benefits study committee whose sole function it shall be to conduct such annual study. Requires the Mayor of the District of Columbia to make recommendations to the Council of the District of Columbia with respect to changes in compensation of members of the Metropolitan Police Force and the Fire Department. Provides that the Commissioner of the District of Columbia shall establish a labor-management relations board for the District of Columbia to: (1) determine in disputed cases appropriate bargaining units and related issues; (2) resolve appeals concerning the method of determining majority status and the conduct of elections, and to certify bargaining representatives; (3) decide whether unfair labor practices have been engaged in and in such cases to issue an appropriate remedial order binding on all parties; (4) resolve negotiation impasses through mediation, factfinding, or final and binding arbitration; and (5) remand disputes if it believes further negotiations are desirable or if the matter comes under another jurisdiction. Title III: Policemen and Firemen's Retirement and Disability Act - Redefines the term \"average pay\" for purposes of computation of retirement benefits to be the average of the basic salary in effect over any 12 months of service, with each rate weighted by the time it was in effect. Provides, under the Policemen and Firemen's Retirement and Disability Act, that a policeman or fireman shall be retired for disability only upon recommendations of the Board of Police and Fire Surgeons, except that in any case in which he seeks his retirement for disability, he shall provide the necessary evidence to form the basis for the approval of such retirement. Authorizes the Commissioner of the District of Columbia to establish a Police and Firemen's Retirement and Relief Board to aid him in carrying out his responsibilities under the Policemen and Firemen's Retirement and Disability Act with respect to retirement and disability determinations and related functions. Specifies the composition of the Board."
