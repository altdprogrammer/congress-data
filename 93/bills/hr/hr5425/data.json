Permits the district court, to examine the contents of agency records in camera to determine if such records shall be exempted from disclosure. Provides that in the case of an action in the United States district court to enjoin an agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld, the United States or an officer or agency thereof shall serve an answer to any complaint made in such action within twenty days after the service upon the United States Attorney of the pleading in which such complaint is made. Provides that the court may assess against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in such action in which the United States or an officer or agency thereof has not prevailed. Provides that such disclosures under the Act may be obtained in the case of investigatory records for law enforcement purposes to the extent that such records are scientific tests, reports, or data, inspection reports of any agency which relates to health or safety, or records which serve as a basis for any public policy statement made by any agency or officer or employee of the United States or which serves as a basis for rulemaking by any agency. Provides that each Agency shall submit an annual report to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate which include statistics on the request and appeal procedures of the Act.
