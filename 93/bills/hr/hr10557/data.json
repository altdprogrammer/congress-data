Requires the administrator to utilize the most advanced technology available to prescribe minimum standard for protective outerwear to assure the maximum degree of safety for firefighting and rescue personnel. Directs the administrator to require such applicants to establish an efficient emergency communications center, and radio communications facilities capable of maintaining continuous communications center between all firefighting and rescue vehicles and the communications center. Each such applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the administrator that they are capable of providing information necessary to facilitate maximum coordination between all participants involved in any emergency situation. Directs the administrator to establish minimum standards regarding number of emergency personnel and training programs to be maintained by such applicants. Establishes criteria for such training programs. (Amends 49 U.S.C. 1432)"
