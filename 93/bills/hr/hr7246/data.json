    "text": "Motor Vehicle Emissions Control Amendments - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to test vehicles or engines to determine whether such vehicle or engine conforms the regulations issued under the Clean Air Act. States that such tests shall include tests which shall be made on a sufficient number of each manufacturer's vehicles and engines before they are introduced into commerce (or before they are admitted into the United States, in the case of imported vehicles) and which shall be reasonably designed to assure with reasonable certainty that all of such manufacturer's vehicles and engines will be capable of meeting the applicable regulations prescribed under this Act after four thousand miles of use. Provides that this testing shall apply to motor vehicles manufactured after January 1, 1975. Requires each state to provide for the establishment of emission standards for motor vehicles in use, and for a program of periodic and testing of motor vehicles. Sets forth the requirements of a satisfactory State motor vehicle inspection and testing program. States that if the Administrator finds that a State has failed to enforce effectively the portion of its implementation plan relating to motor vehicle inspection and testing which is required, he may (in addition to any other action authorized by this Act) carry out such portion of the plan in such State during any period of federally assumed enforcement. Requires the Administrator by regulation, not later than six months after the date of enactment of the Motor Vehicle Emissions Control Act of 1973, to establish testing methods and procedures for measuring emissions from motor vehicles in actual use."
