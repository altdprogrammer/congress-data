    "text": "Provides that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may, for any period beginning on or after the date of enactment of this section and ending on or before May 15, 1974, temporarily suspend any stationary source fuel or emission limitation as it applies to any person, if the Administrator finds that such person will be unable to comply with such limitation during such period solely because of unavailability of types or amounts of fuels. Provides that after public notice and opportunity for presentation of views, the Administrator may, for any period beginning after May 15, 1974, and ending not later than June 30, 1977, temporarily suspend any stationary source fuel or emission limitation as it applies to any person if the Administrator finds that such person will be unable to comply with such limitation solely because of the unavailability of types or amounts of fuels. States that a suspension granted under this paragraph shall be granted only for the period during which the person to whom it applies can reasonably be expected to be unable to obtain fuels or an emission reduction system necessary to permit him to comply with the stationary source fuel or emission limitation which it suspends. Requires the Administrator to study, and report to Congress not later than March 31, 1974, with respect to: (1) the present and projected impact on the program under this Act of fuel shortages and of allocation and rationing programs; (2) availability of scrubber technology (including projections respecting the time, cost, and number of units available); (3) projections of air quality impact of fuel shortages and allocations; and (4) evaluation of alternative control strategies for other sulfur emitting sources, including desulfurization of home heating fuels, cost, time frames, and feasibility effectiveness. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to report to Congress not later than January 3, 1975, on the implementation of this Act."
