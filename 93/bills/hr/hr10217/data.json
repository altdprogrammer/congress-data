Requires the Secretary to establish simplified requirements for small business concerns designed to eliminate unnecessary and duplicative recordkeeping and reporting. Requires the Secretary to make an annual report to the Select Committee on Small Business of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the steps taken to assure that small business concerns are not unintentionally injured economically as a result of standards imposed under such Act. Authorizes the Secretary to visit the workplace of any small employer with 25 or fewer employees in order to afford consultation and advice to such employer. Requires such a visit to be made only upon a valid request. Requires the Secretary, upon discovering violations while on a visit, to issue written notice of such violation to the employer to make corrections within a reasonable time."
