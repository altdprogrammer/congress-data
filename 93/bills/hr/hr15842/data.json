Sets forth provisions for a system of arbitration should a salary contract expire and negotiation impasses still exist.

Directs the Commissioner, for certain officially designated historic property, to assess land and improvements which, if less than full market value, shall be the basis of tax liability to the District. Provides that an eligible taxpayer may defer each year any real property tax owed in excess of 110 percent of his immediately preceding year's tax liability. Sets forth the eligibility requirements for such deferral. Provides that, after 2 years have elapsed since property has been bid off in the name of the District of Columbia for the nonpayment of taxes, the Commissioner of the District may enforce the lien of the District of Columbia for taxes or other assessments on such real property by ordering that a deed in fee simple be issued, and, up to the time of the issuance of the deed, such property may be redeemed by the payment of all taxes or assessments due the Distirct of Columbia upon such property, together with such expenses, costs, and penalties as may have been incurred.
