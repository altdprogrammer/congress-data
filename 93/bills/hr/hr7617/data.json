States that economic adjustment assistance under this title consists of: (1) readjustment allowances; (2) training and counseling benefits; (3) relocation allowances; (4) early retirement benefits; and (5) health benefits. States that the Secretary shall determine whether an applicant is entitled to receive the economic adjustment assistance for which application is made and shall furnish such assistance if the applicant is so entitled.

Title IV: General Provisions - Provides that no person designated by the Secretary as a certifying officer, or disbursing officer, in the absence of gross negligence or intent to defraud the United States, be liable with respect to the payment of any allowance certified by him under this Act. States that whoever makes a false statement of a material fact knowing it to be false, or knowingly fails to disclose a material fact, for the purpose of obtaining or increasing for himself, or for any other person any payment or assistance authorized to be furnished under this Act shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.
