Specifies the factors to be taken into account by the Attorney General in determining whether a releasee is in need of loan assistance under this Act. Stipulates that, if the Attorney General determines that it is in the best interest of the releasee not to have money provided directly to him, a loan may be in the form of the purchase of essential needs of the releasee. Specifies the terms and conditions of loans to be made under this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated to the fund $1,500,000 for fiscal year 1975, to remain available until expended."
