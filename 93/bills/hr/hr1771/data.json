    "text": "Youth Camp Safety Act - Makes it the purpose of this Act to protect and safeguard the health and well-being of youth attending day camps, resident camps, and travel camps by providing for the establishment of Federal standards for the safe operation of youth camps. Confers upon the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare the primary responsibility for the promulgation and enforcement of Federal and State youth camp safety regulations. Requires any State which desires to assume responsibility for the development and modification of youth camp safety standards to submit a State plan to the Secretary for his approval. Allows a State whose plan has been rejected to obtain review of the decision in the United States Court of Appeals. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States which have in effect approved State plans, such grants not to exceed fifty percent of the cost of carrying out the State plan. Authorizes to be appropriated $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1974 and for each succeeding fiscal years. Directs the Secretary to establish within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare an Advisory Council on Youth Camp Safety and to submit to Congress at least once a year a comprehensive and detailed report on his administration under this Act."
