    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1973-01-03", 
    "text": "Makes it the obligation of each television station licensed under the Communications Act of 1934 to make available air time for political broadcasts (Voter's Time) by Presidential, Vice Presidential and Congressional candidates. Makes Voter's Time available during general election campaigns to candidates of major parties, third parties, and minor parties. Specifies blocks of time ranging from 5-1/2 hours for a Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate of a major party to 15 minutes for Congressional candidates of minor parties. Directs that Voter's Time for broadcasts shall be carried simultaneously by all stations and networks within an appropriate area for the particular election during prime time. Charges the Federal Communications Commission with supervising and making determinations of Voter's Time responsibilities for television stations. Conditions candidates eligibility for Voter's Time on his presentation, including a substantial live appearance by the candidate and formats intended to promote rational political discussion, bring out campaign issues and giving insights into his qualifications. Requires that charges made for Voter's Time may not exceed the prevailing unit charge of the station for the same amount of program time in the same period. Provides for the reimbursement of candidates for expenses incurred in buying Voter's Time which they are legally qualified to receive."
