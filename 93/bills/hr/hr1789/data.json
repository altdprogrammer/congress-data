Prescribes a formula by which such State planning grants under such Act shall be allocated to such high crime urban areas. Provides, under the provisions of such Act for disbursements by State planning agencies, that each State planning agency shall make a block grant in lieu of program and project grants to each high crime urban area within the State which notifies such agency that there has been organized within such area an Urban Law Enforcement Council and submits to such agency a plan for the use of such grant. Prescribes a formula by which such State planning agency shall measure such grants to such high crime urban area. Title II: Special Impact Grants to High Intensity Urban Areas - Provides that the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration shall make a block grant, to each high crime urban area, measured by $5 multiplied by the population of such area, which notifies it that there has been organized within such area an Urban Law Enforcement Council, and submits to it a plan for the use of such grant. Provides that grants shall be made available under this section for fiscal years 1974, 1975 and 1976.
