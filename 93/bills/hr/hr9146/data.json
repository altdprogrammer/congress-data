    "text": "War Powers Resolution - Stipulates that nothing in this Act shall be construed to impair the authority of the President to commit U.S. Armed Forces to hostilities in any case of attack, or threatened attack, on the United States, or any possession or territory, to the extent that the President has such authority under the Constitution. Requires the President, if he commits U.S. Armed Forces to hostilities under a treaty obligation without prior declaration of war, to report such action to Congress within 24 hours, and to state the facts and circumstances surrounding such action. Provides that, within 120 days after such report, the Congress shall approve or disapprove the continuation of the hostile action. Requires the President, upon Congressional approval, to report every six months to Congress on the status of the situation. Requires continuing Congressional action of approval or disapproval within such six month periods. Provides for the termination of hostilities if Congress shall at any time disapprove such action. States that failure of Congress to exercise its review power under this Act shall be deemed approval. Prohibits the President from committing U.S. Armed Forces to hostilities where he is not exercising his constitutional authority or acting pursuant to a treaty obligation. Stipulates that nothing contained in this Act shall alter or abrogate any treaty to which the United States is presently a party."
