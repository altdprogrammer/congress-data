    "text": "Requires the cooperative conservation plan for military reservations involving the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Interior, and the appropriate State agency to provide for: (1) fish and wildlife habitat improvements; (2) range rehabilitation where necessary for support of wildlife; and (3) control of all-terrain vehicular traffic, including snowmobiles. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Defense of $1,500,000 annually for fiscal years 1973-1977 for conservation programs on military reservations. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of the Interior of $1,000,000 annually for fiscal years 1973-1977 to enable him to carry out his responsibilities under this section's cooperative plans. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Agriculture, in cooperation with the State agencies, to develop, maintain, and coordinate programs on public lands under their jurisdiction for the conservation and rehabilitation of wildlife, fish, and game. Sets forth requirements for comprehensive plans and cooperative agreements under this section. Provides that no individual will be permitted to hunt, trap, or fish on any public land within the State which is subject to a conservation and rehabilitation program under this section unless he has a valid public land management stamp. Makes provisions for the issuance and sale of such stamps. Prescribes a $1,000 fine or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both, for any person who hunts, traps, or fishes on any public land which is subject to a conservation and rehabilitation program without a valid public land management area stamp, if the possession of such a stamp is required. Provides for the forfeiture to the United States of all guns, traps, nets, and other equipment, vessels, vehicles, and other means of transportation used by any person when engaged in committing an offense under this subsection. Authorizes appropriations of $7,500,000 annually to both the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture for fiscal years 1974-1978 for public land conservation programs under this Act.
