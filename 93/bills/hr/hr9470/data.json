Transfers to the Board of Education all powers and duties over the operation of the public elementary and secondary schools in the District of Columbia now vested in and exercised by any other officer, department, or agency of the District of Columbia Government. Directs the Board of Education to establish such procedures as it deems necessary and appropriate to effectuate maximum citizen participation in policy decisions affecting the operation of the public elementary and secondary school system in the District of Columbia. Requires the Board of Education to annually prepare and submit to the District of Columbia Council both a line-item and a program budget."
