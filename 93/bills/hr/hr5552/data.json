    "text": "Developmental Disabilities Services and Facilities Construction Act - Title I: Grants for Planning, Provision of Services, and Construction of Facilities for Persons with Developmental Disabilities - Declares it to be the purpose of this Act to make grants to assist the States in preparing and implementing comprehensive plans for the care and treatment of persons suffering from mental retardation or other serious chronic mental or physical disabilities. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1971 through 1975 for such grants. Entitles the States to allotments on the basis of their population, need for services, and financial need, but specifies that no allotment to a State may be less than $100,000. Establishes a National Advisory Council on Services and Facilities for the Developmentally Disabled which would consist of twelve members to be appointed by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Provides that the Council would advise the Secretary with respect to any regulations promulgated or proposed to be promulgated by him in the implementation of these provisions; and would study and evaluate authorized programs with a view to determining their effectiveness in carrying out the purposes of which they were established. Requires any State to be eligible for such grants to have an approved State plan. Prescribes the qualifications for a State plan including that it must designate appropriate State agencies, set forth the policies for fund expenditures; assure that funds would strengthen services for persons with developmental disabilities, especially mental retardation; provide for efficient administration; establish a system for review of the plan's operation; grant special assistance to areas of urban or rural poverty in securing services; specify the proportion of funds to be dedicated to construction; and provide for adequate accounting procedures. Sets forth a system for the approval of construction projects which meet specified criteria. Directs the Secretary to approve projects meeting the specified criteria if there are sufficient funds to pay the Federal share of the cost of construction from the State's allotment. Allows the Secretary to withhold payments for construction when the State agency is not complying with provisions regarding State plans, or when adequate funds are not being provided annually for the direct administration of the State plan. Provides that States will be paid their Federal share of expenditure for planning and services in advance on the basis of estimates by the Secretary of what sums the State will expend under State plans. Allows the Secretary to withhold payments for planning and service when a State does not comply with provisions regarding State plans. Provides that the Secretary must by April 1, 1973, after consultation with the Council, prescribe: (1) the kinds of services which are needed to provide adequate programs for persons with developmental disabilities; (2) standards for the scope and quality of services; (3) the general manner in which a State shall determine priorities for services and facilities; and (4) the general standards of construction and equipment for facilities. Forbids the granting to States of funds which would duplicate previously granted State or Federal funds. Title II: Amendments to Part B of the Mental Retardation Facilities Construction Act - Allows the Secretary of HEW to make grants to institutions of higher education for the purpose of covering the cost of administering and operating demonstration facilities and interdisciplinary training programs for personnel needed to render specialized services to the mentally retarded. Authorizes appropriations for the purpose of making such grants under this title. Specifies that such grants may be approved by the Secretary only if there are reasonable assurances that grants will not result in any increase in the level of State, local, and other non-Federal funds for mental retardation services and training."
