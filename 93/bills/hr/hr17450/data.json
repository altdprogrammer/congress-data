Provides that the People's Counsel: (1) may represent and appear for petitioners appearing before the Commission for the purpose of complaining in matters of rates or services; (2) may investigate the services given by, the rates charged by, and the valuation of the properties of, the public utilities under the jurisdiction of the Commission; and (3) is authorized to develop means to otherwise assure that the interest of users of the products of or services furnished by public utilities under the jurisdiction of the Commission are adequately represented in the course of proceedings before the Commission, including public information dissemination, consultative services, and technical assistance. Authorizes to be appropriated for fiscal year 1975, such sum, not to exceed $50,000, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act.
