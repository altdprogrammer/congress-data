    "text": "Fair Labor Standards Amendments - Expands the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to include all agencies and activities of the United States, the States and their political subdivisions. Extends this coverage to domestic workers, except babysitters. Eliminates the allowance for tips as part of wages for employees in normally tipped occupations. Brings under the coverage all enterprises engaged in commerce. Provides coverage for employees of hotels, motels and restaurants in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Establishes for employees in activities covered by the Act, prior to the 1966 amendments, an hourly minimum of $2.00 during the first year from the effective date of this Act and $2.25 thereafter. Establishes for employees newly covered by the 1966 amendments (including agricultural workers) and by the 1973 amendments, an hourly minimum wage of $1.70 during the first year from the effective date of the 1971 amendments, and $2.25 thereafter. Requires in the case of any employee in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands covered by a wage order pursuant to the Act, an hourly increase over the highest rate under the wage order covering such employee of 40 cents during the first year and an additional 25 cents during the second euyear from the effective of the 1973 amendments. Includes full coverage under this Act to linen supply establishments under contract to the United States. Requires compensation for hours in excess of 8 in a day or 40 in a week at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate for most employees covered by the Act. Eliminates various provisions which provide partial overtime exemptions and makes other conforming amendments. Brings executive, administrative, or professional employees under the equal pay provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Retains the minimum wage and overtime exemptions as follows: (1) any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, or in the capacity of outside salesman; (2) employees engaged in seafood processing; (3) employees in agriculture if the employer uses 100 or fewer man days of hired labor during a peak quarter (instead of present 500 man-day test); (4) handicapped workers; (6) switchboard employees of small telephone companies; and (7) seamen on other than American vessels. Repeals existing minimum wage and overtime exemptions as follows: (1) employees in retailing and service establishments; (2) employees of motion picture theaters; (3) logging employees; and (4) agriculture employees engaged in growing and harvesting shade-grown tobacco. Retains these existing overtime exemptions as follows: (1) employees for whom the Interstate Commerce Commission may establish qualifications of maximum hours of service; (2) outside buyers of dairy products; (3) seamen; (4) employees of small radio or television stations; (5) local drivers and drivers' helpers; (6) employees engaged in livestock auction operations; (7) employees of country elevators; and (8) employees engaged in transportation of fruits and vegetables. Repeals overtime exemptions as follows; (1) employees of railroad, pipeline and air carriers; (2) employees of fish and food processors; (3) employees of street, suburban or interurban electric railways, or local trolley or motor bus carriers; (4) employees of hotels, motels, restaurants, or nursing homes; (5) employees employed as salemen, partsmen or mechanics by motor vehicle, farm implement or aircraft dealers; (6) certain agricultural employees; (7) employees engaged in ginning of cotton, sugar beet, sugar cane or maple syrup processing; (8) taxicab drivers; (9) employees of catering establishments; and (10) employees of bowling establishments. Revises the provisions relating to child labor in agriculture to restrict certain employment outside of school hours. Prohibits the unwarranted displacement of full-time employees by student workers in retail and service establishments that are brought within the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act by these amendments. Allows the Secretary of Labor to bring suit to recover unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation and an equal amount of liquidated damages without requiring a written request from an employee. Allows the Secretary to bring such actions even though the suit might involve issues of law that have not been finally settled by the courts. Brings all employees in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands under the same minimum wage and overtime protections afforded mainland workers by January 1, 1976. Provides that this Act shall become effective 60 days after date of enactment."
