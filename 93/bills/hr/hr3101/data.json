Requires any person before depositing or discharging such materials to present sufficient evidence that such materials will not endanger the natural environment and ecology of these waters. Requires such adopted standards to be adopted and enforced by Federal and State agencies, etc. that issue licenses or permits for any activity in the coastal waters. Requires State standards with repsect to the activity covered by a promulgated Federal standard must be more stringent than the Federal standard and provide adequate procedures for enforcement. Requires Federal and State agencies, etc. and other specified individuals to maintain records, make reports, and provide such information the Administrator may require to establish standards and to determine compliance with such standards. Gives U.S. district courts jurisdiction to restrain violations of this Act. Makes violators of any standard (civilly) liable for not more than $10,000 nor less than $5,000 for each violation, and each day shall be considered a separate offense in cases of continuing violations. Terminates all licenses, permits, and authorizations issued by any U.S. employee under authority of any other provision of law upon the effective date of this Act."
