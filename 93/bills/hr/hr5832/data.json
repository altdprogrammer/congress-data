    "text": "Nutritional Labeling Act - Requires any packaged consumer food product to be labeled by the processor in conformity with the following information: (1) with respect to processed food products, an analysis of nutritional contents including fat content, vitamin and protein value, fats and fatty acids, calories, and any other nutritional information deemed appropriate; (2) in the case of any canned or frozen product whose packing medium constitutes a substantial proportion of its total weight, the net weight, and drained weight of the product; and (3) in the case of any combination food item, the major ingredients by percentage weight after processing determined pursuant to the regulations of the appropriate agency. Requires such label to contain a statement of the nutritional value of the food commodity, and to appear in conspicuous and easily legible type on the package. Provides that the label of any packaged consumer product which has been packaged in a container of any given net content (by weight or volume) and which afterwards is packaged in a container of a different net content, shall conspicuously set forth the amount of difference. States that the appropriate Federal agencies shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this Act, containing such classifications, provisions, and exceptions as are necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Act and to prevent evasion thereof. Provides for injunctions in Federal courts to assure compliance with this Act. Prescribes a civil penalty of not to exceed $1,000 for any willful violation of this Act; such sum to be assessed by the appropriate agency and enforced in a Federal court in the name of the United States."
