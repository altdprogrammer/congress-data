    "text": "United States Housing Act - States that it is the policy of the United States to promote the general welfare of the Nation by employing its funds and credit, as provided in this Act, to assist the several States and their political subdivisions to remedy the unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of decent, safe and sanitary dwellings for families of low income and, consistent with the objectives of this Act, to vest in local public housing agencies the maximum amount of responsibility in the administration of their housing programs. Provides that no person should be barred from serving on the board of directors or similar governing body of a local public housing agency because of his tenancy in a low-income housing project. Permits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to make loans or commitments to make loans to public housing agencies to help finance or refinance the development, acquisition, or operation of low-income housing projects by such agencies. Provides that the Secretary may issue and have outstanding at any one time notes and other obligations for purchase by the Secretary of the Treasury in an amount which will not, unless authorized by the President, exceed $l,500,000,000. Authorizes the Secretary to make annual contributions to public housing agencies to assist in achieving and maintaining the low-income character of their projects. Provides that the Secretary may enter into contracts for annual contributions with respect to the modernization of low-income housing projects in an amount aggregating not more than $30,000,000 per annum on and after July 1, 1974, which limits shall be increased by $30,000,000 on July 1, 1975. States that the Secretary may include in any contract for loans, annual contributions, sale, lease, mortgage, or any other agreement or instrument made pursuant to this Act, such covenants, conditions, or provisions as he may deem necessary in order to insure the low-income character of the project involved, and that no otherwise eligible applicant shall be excluded from any project because of race, religion, nationality, age, sex, marital status, or amount or source of income. Stipulates that for the purpose of providing a supplementary form of low-rent housing which will aid in assuring a decent place to live for every citizen and promote efficiency and economy in the program under this Act by taking full advantage of vacancies or potential vacancies in the private housing market, each public housing agency may, to the maximum extent consistent with the achievement of the objectives of this Act, provide low-rent housing under this Act in the form of low-rent housing in private accommodations in accordance with this Act where such housing in private accommodations can be provided at a cost equal to or less than housing in projects assisted under other provisions of this Act."
