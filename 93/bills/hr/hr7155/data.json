    "text": "Child Nutrition Education Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish and administer in cooperation with State educational agencies a basic nutrition education program for children. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1974 and 1975 necessary to carry out the purposes of the program. Establishes a nutrition Education Advisory Council in each State to provide guidance in formulating the State nutrition education program. Limits the amount of money which may be used toward State administrative expenses from the funds so appropriated. Establishes those procedures for an amount to be paid to breakfast programs. Increases the number of members of the National Advisory Council on Child Nutrition and requires that one member shall be a supervisor of a school lunch program who is from an urban area; one member shall be a supervisor of a school lunch program in a school system in a rural areas; two members shall be parents of school age children; and 2 members shall be secondary school students participating in such program. Requires that a 5 member group be established to work with the Department of Agriculture in developing regulations which reflect the recommendations of the National Advisory Council on Child Nutrition and selected members of State and local food service administrators. Authorizes the readjustment of reimbursements to reflect changes in the cost of the program. Allows additional foods to be included which make a significant nutritional contribution to the program. Establishes conditions and regulations under which special assistance payments may be made available to State educational agencies for helping to assist the agency with the cost of financing and providing free and reduced price lunches. Provides that, in any year when those funds authorized have not been completely expended, the amounts unexpended shall be distributed among the States for the purchase of food by public and private non-profit schools participating in the program. Allows the Secretary, under special circumstances, to waive the requirement of State or local contribution of 1/4 cost of any equipment financed so as to enable the schools that are not able to provide the local contribution to be included in the program. Increases to $40,000,000 the appropriation for non-food assistance under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, and extends to all public schools the eligibility to participate in the program."
