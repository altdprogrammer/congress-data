    "text": "(LATEST SUMMARY) Makes it the sense of the Senate that the President should instruct the Secretary of State to give favorable consideration to making use of the various chambers of the International Court of Justice, including chambers convened to resolve regional disputes, where such disputes cannot be resolved by negotiation. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should take all appropriate measures to attempt to expand the range of international bodies eligible to request advisory opinions of the Court, giving special attention to attempting to extend eligibility to regional organizations as well as any two or more states jointly seeking an advisory opinion on any legal questions relating to a dispute between them, and that the President should undertake appropriate steps to improve, within the existing provisions of the Statute, the process whereby persons are nominated and elected to serve as judges of the International Court of Justice. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should undertake all appropriate steps to encourage the International Court of Justice, from time to time, to sit and exercise its functions outside the Hague at places more convenient to the various parties to the Statute of the International Court of Justice. Directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the United States with the request that the President report to the Senate in due course what action he has taken pursuant to this expression of advise."
