    "text": "Makes it the sense of the Senate that the President of the United States be requested to immediately, by Executive Order, declare U.S. fisheries jurisdiction beyond present territorial waters to include all waters of the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea lying within the boundaries established by the U.S.-Russian Convention of 1867. Requests the President to impose, within the full areas of extended fisheries jurisdiction, a conservation moratorium on commercial fishing, other than United States and Canadian, until such time that conservation rules and regulations are worked out on a permanent basis with the nations involved, or, when it is determined that a particular fish is in no danger of commercial depletion. Requests the President to mobilize whatever resources as may be necessary to enforce the moratorium."
