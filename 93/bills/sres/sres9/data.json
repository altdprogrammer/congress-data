Provides that in carrying out such study and investigation the special committee shall: (1) consult and confer with the President and his advisers; (2) consider the problems which may arise as the result of terminating such national emergency; and (3) consider what administrative or legislative actions might be necessary or desireable as the result of terminating such national emergency, including consideration of the desirability and consequences of terminating special legislative powers that were conferred on the President and other officers, boards, and commissions as the result of the President proclaiming a national emergency. Sets forth the authority of the special committee.
