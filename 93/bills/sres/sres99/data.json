Makes it the sense of the Senate that any persons appointed to represent the United States or the President in negotiations with foreign governments are \"public ministers\" of the United States within the language of the Constitution, and, therefore, no person may be constitutionally appointed to conduct such negotiations unless such person is first nominated to an office to conduct such negotiations, and the Senate advises and consents to his nomination. Declares that the President should submit to the Senate, for its advice and consent, all agreements of national importance previously concluded with foreign governments that have not been submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent and should submit a report on all negotiations presently being conducted with respect to possible agreements. Enumerates those appointments and negotiations which are excluded from the provisions of this resolution."
