Declares that in the event that any such committtee finds itself unable to report an authorization measure by the day prescribed in paragraph 1, it may request an extension to a date certain from the Senate, which shall be granted if a majority of the Senators present and voting concur by rollcall vote. Declares that after the day prescribed in paragraph 1, or after the expiration of an extension of time granted by the Senate as provided in paragraph 2, as the case may be, for a measure making appropriations for a fiscal year, it shall be in order for the Senate to act upon any general appropriation measure making appropriations for that fiscal year. Provides that the provisions of this rule shall not apply to a measure making continuing appropriations."
