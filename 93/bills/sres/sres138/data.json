    "text": "Makes it the sense of the Senate that each operator of a motor vehicle should, when traveling during weekends or holidays between the date of passage of this Resolution and September 3, 1973, on any road where the posted speed limit is fifty-five (55) miles per hour or greater: (1) travel at a speed no greater than ten (10) miles per hour less than the posted speed limit; and (2) turn on the headlights of his or her motor vehicle in order to publicize his or her participation in a national consumer effort to decrease consumption of motor vehicle gasoline and to increase safety on the nation's roads. Declares that the Governor of each State should, as soon as practicable, make State funds available on an equitable basis and encourage private and other governmental organizations within the State to make funds available on an equitable basis to State and local agencies, including but not limited to State highway patrols and traffic safety organizations, and to appropriate private organizations or individuals, for the purpose of encouraging motor vehicle operators to observe the provisions of this Resolution, and to inform motor vehicle operators that substantial amounts of gasoline can be saved if motor vehicles are driven less frequently, or without excessive idling, rapid acceleration or deceleration. Provides that the television, radio and print media should publicize, to the maximum extent possible, the details of this Resolution. Provides that each Federal agency which has or can make funds available through such agency's own programs or to State or local governments or to private organizations or individuals for the purpose of publicizing traffic safety efforts, should do so to the maximum extent possible, and as soon as practicable."
