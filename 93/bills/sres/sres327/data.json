Res. 60, 93d Congress, together with its findings and such legislative proposals as it deems necessary or desirable, to the Senate at the earliest practicable date, but no later than June 30, 1974. Provides that after submission of its final report, the Select Committee shall have three calendar months to close its affairs, and on the expiration of such three calendar months shall cease to exist. Provides that, in case the judicial action brought by the Select Committee against the President to obtain specified taped recordings of conversations in which the President and his former aide, John W. Dean, participated is not finally adjudicated before the expiration of such three calendar months, the Select Committee shall continue in existence thereafter until thirty days subsequent to the occurrence of one of these alternative events."
