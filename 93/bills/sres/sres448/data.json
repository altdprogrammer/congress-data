Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should make every possible effort to negotiate further nuclear arms limitation and reduction measures as part of the final accord carrying out the Vladivostok agreement. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the specific accord concluded on the basis of the Vladivostok agreement between the President of the United States and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics should be in the form of a treaty and submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent."
