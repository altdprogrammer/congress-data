    "text": "Provides that all meetings for the transaction of business of each standing committee or subcommittee of the Senate shall be open to the public. Allows a committee or subcommittee to which this paragraph applies to conduct meetings closed to the public if the committee or subcommittee in open session and with 50 percent or more of its members present determines by rollcall vote that all or part of the meeting to be held on that day should be closed to the public because disclosure of matters to be considered at the meeting would: (1) endanger the national security; (2) relate solely to matters of committee staff personnel or internal staff management or procedure; (3) tend to charge with crime or misconduct, or to disgrace, injure the professional standing or otherwise expose to public contempt any individual, or will represent a clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of any individual; (4) disclose the identity of any informer or law enforcement agent or of any information relating to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense that is required to be kept secret in the interests of effective law enforcement; (5) disclose information relating to trade secrets or financial or commercial information; (6) disclose discussion or deliberation about committee action on confirmation of a Presidential nominee; or (7) disclose other information under circumstances in which such disclosures would be clearly contrary to the public interest. Provides that subsection (8) shall not be invoked unless a majority of all members of the committee or subcommittee which seeks to invoke the exception vote to do so in accordance with the procedures se forth in the subparagraph. Requires a separate vote to be taken with respect to each committee or subcommittee meeting that is closed to the public pursuant to this paragraph, and the committee or subcommittee shall make available within one day of such meeting, a written explanation of its action. Provides that the vote of each committee or subcommittee member participating in such vote shall be recorded and published. Provides that subsection (3) shall not apply to any Government officer or employee with respect to his official duties or employment, and, that as applied to a witness at a meeting to conduct a hearing, this subsection shall not apply unless the witness requests in writing that the hearing be closed to the public."
