Provides that if the motion is passed in the affirmative by a two-thirds vote of the Senators present and voting, then said measure, motion, or other matter pending before the Senate, or the unfinished business, shall be the unfinished business to the exclusion of all other business until disposed of. Provides that a cloture motion may alternatively be presented to the Presiding Officer who shall at once state the motion to the Senate, and one hour after the Senate meets on the tenth session day for which the matter, or a motion to consider the matter, has been the pending or unfinished business, but in no event sooner than the second calendar day following the reading of the petition, he shall lay the motion before the Senate and direct that the Secretary call the roll. Provides that, upon ascertainment that a quorum is present, the Presiding Officer shall, without further debate, submit the motion to the Senate for a yea-and-nay vote. Provides that if the motion is passed in the affirmative by a three-fifths vote of the Senators present and voting, then said measure, motion or other matter pending before the Senate or the unfinished business shall be the unfinished business to the exclusion of all other business until disposed of. Provides that a cloture motion may alternatively be presented to the Presiding Officer who shall at once state the motion to the Senate, and one hour after the Senate meets on the twentieth session day for which the matter, or a motion to consider the matter, has been the pending, or unfinished business, but in no event sooner than the second calendar day following the filing of the petition, he shall lay the motion before the Senate and direct that the Secretary call the roll. Provides that if such cloture motion is passed in the affirmative by a majority vote of the Senators duly chosen and sworn, then said measure, motion, or other matter pending before the Senate, or the unfinished business, shall be the unfinished business to the exclusion of all other business until disposed of."
