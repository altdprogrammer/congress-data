Makes it the sense of the Senate that the President of the United States and the Secretary of State should, and are hereby urged and requested, to: (1) maintain regular and full consultation with the appropriate committees of the Congress and (2) report to the Congress and the Nation at regular intervals on the progress toward further arms limitations and reductions within the context of an assured deterrent which is the basis of our national security. Directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit copies of this resolution to the President and the Secretary of State."
