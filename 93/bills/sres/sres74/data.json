Makes it the sense of the Senate that the President should direct the Secretary of State to consider submitting to the International Court of Justice as many as possible of the approximately 28 territorial disputes involving our country and a number of close allies over desolate and largely uninhabited islands in the Carribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Makes it the sense of the Senate that the President should direct the Secretary of State to make a full written report, to the Senate and to its Committee on Foreign Relations within one year of the adoption of this resolution and a report for each of the five years thereafter, of actions taken and progress achieved in submitting such disputes to the court."
