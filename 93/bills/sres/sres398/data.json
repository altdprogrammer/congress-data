    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Senate on highway safety standards involving seatbelts and ignition interlock systems. Expresses the sense of the Senate: (1) that the consumer be offered an interim option which allows the motorist to elect to override the interlock system prior to starting the vehicle; (2) that the Department of Transportation promulgate a revised Motor Vehicle Safety Standard to become effective as soon as practicable, which removes the ignition interlock system entirely and that a passive restraint system such as an air cushion capable of operating under extreme climatic conditions or belt system be made standard equipment at such time; (3) that a passive restraint system is one that requires no specific manual activity on the part of the occupant to make such system operative; and (4) that the insurance industry and State insurance regulators cooperate in the establishment of auto insurance rates which reflect the relative injury reducing characteristics of the optional restraint systems available and that such representative rate information be given to the purchaser at the time of sale in accordance with procedures for consumer information dissemination contained in the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Saving Act."
