Provides that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed one hour, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Public Works, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-miniute rule. Stipulates that it shall be in order to consider the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Public Works now printed in the bill as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule, said substitute shall be read for amendment by title instead of by sections, and all points of order against sections 26, 27, and 93 of said substitute for failure to comply with the provisions of clause 4, rule XXI are hereby waived. Requires that at the conclusion of such consideration, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted and any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute.
