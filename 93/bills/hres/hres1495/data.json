Stipulates that, at the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit. Requires that after the passage of H.R. 17481, the Committee on Education and Labor shall be discharged from the further consideration of the bill S. 3548, and it shall then be in order in the House to move to strike out all after enacting clause of the said Senate bill and insert in lieu thereof the provisions contained in H.R. 17481 as passed by the House."
