Provides that the budget shall include: (1) the total of estimated Federal receipts from all sources; (2) the maximum amount to be provided in obligational authority in each appropriation bill or resolution and in such other legislative provisions of obligational authority as may be specified, and the estimated budget outlay related to each, including those outlays from funds provided in prior years; and (3) a table showing the relationship of total estimated receipts as shown in (1) to the aggregate of the maximum amounts to be provided in obligational authority and the aggregate of the estimated budget outlays as shown in (2). Sets forth a procedure for the adoption of such resolution by the House. Provides that a conference report on a bill or resolution carrying appropriations or otherwise providing obligational authority shall require the approval of two-thirds of those Members present and voting, a quorum being present, if the effect of the adoption of the report would be to provide an amount in excess of that contained in the House-authorized Federal budget for such year. Provides that, within fifteen calendar days after adoption of the House-authorized Federal budget, the Committee on Ways and Means is authorized and directed to report a resolution containing recommendations as to the levels of public debt and aggregate Federal revenues necessitated by figures on outlays and receipts contained in the House-authorized Federal budget. Sets forth a procedure for the adoption of such resolution."
