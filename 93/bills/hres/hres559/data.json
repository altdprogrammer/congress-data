    "text": "Establishes a select committee of the House of Representatives to be known as the Select Committee on Separation of Powers compose of nine Members of the House of Representatives to be appointed by the Speaker, one of whom he shall designate as chairman. Authorizes the committee to conduct a full and complete study of the separation of power under the Constitution between the three branches of Government, with particular emphasis on the relationship between Congress and the President, including: (1) a study of whether executive privilege is a valid constitutional doctrine; and if it is, what are the limitations of that privilege; (2) a study of whether the Constitution provides either the President or the Vice President with immunity from criminal prosecution; and (3) an investigation of the historical development of impeachment with careful consideration of its intended role in our form of government. Requires the committee to report to the House within one year after the date of adoption of this resolution the results of its investigation and study, together with such recommendations as it deems advisable."
