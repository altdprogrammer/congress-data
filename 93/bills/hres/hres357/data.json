Provides after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed two hours, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Banking and Currency, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule. Stipulates that, immediately after the reading of the first section of H.R. 6168 under the five-minute rule, it shall be in order to consider without the intervention of any point of order the text of H.R. 2099 as an amendment in the nature of a substitute for the bill. Provides that at the conclusion of the consideration of H.R. 6168 for amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House wih such amendments as may have been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. Stipulates that, after the passage of H.R. 6168, the Committee on Banking and Currency shall be discharged from the further consideration of the bill S. 398, and it shall then be in order in the House to move to strike out all after the enacting clause of the said Senate bill and insert in lieu thereof the provisions contained in H.R. 6168 as passed by the House."
