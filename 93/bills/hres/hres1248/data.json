Sets forth the functions of the Office, including the following: (1) to create a cross-reference capability based on the authorization statutes, showing committee jurisdiction, appropriation Acts, budget authority, budget outlays, unexpended balances, other relevant systems which are or may be compatible, and the relationships between them, under the direction of the Speaker; (2) to work closely with the House standing committees in all phases of the development of the cross-referencing capability and to coordinate with the Congressional Research Service and General Accounting Office, in the development, implementation, and operation of the cross-referencing services; (3) to advise the Speaker of developments which could improve the operation of the classification service and to issue an annual report to the House on the progress in implementation and use of the service and plans for the coming year; and (4) to make available (as development permits) publications or information in an appropriate format for use of the House committee and Members and to provide the capability to answer specific queries on the available information.
