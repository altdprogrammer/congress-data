States that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed one hour, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Commitee on Government Operations, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule. Provides that it shall be in order to consider the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Government Operations now printed in the bill as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule, and all points of order against said substitute for failure to comply with the Rules of the House are hereby waived. Stipulates that, at the conclusion of such consideration, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. States that the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. Provides that, after the passage of H.R. 3932, the Committee on Government Operations shall be discharged from the further consideration of the bill S. 518, and it shall then be in order in the House to move to strike out all after the enacting clause of the said Senate bill and insert in lieu thereof the provisions contained in H.R. 3932 as passed by the House."
