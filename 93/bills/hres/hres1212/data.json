Makes it the sense of the House that the President is requested to direct the Secretary of State forthwith to seek to submit to the International Court of Justice for binding decisions as many as possible of the approximately 28 territorial disputes involving our country and a number of our close allies over desolate and largely uninhabited islands in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Makes it the sense of the House that the President should direct the Secretary of State to make a full written report, to the Senate and to its Committee on Foreign Affairs within one year of the adoption of this resolution and a report for each of the five years thereafter, of actions taken and progress achieved in submitting such disputes to the Court."
