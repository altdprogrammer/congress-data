    "text": "Provides that upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to move that the House resolve ifself into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 69) to extend and amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and for other purposes. States that three legislative days after the conclusion of general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed four hours, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and Labor, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule. Stipulates that, notwithstanding the provisions of clause 7, rule XVI, it shall be in order to consider the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Education and Labor now printed in the bill as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule. Provides that all points of order under clause 4, rule XXI, are hereby waived against title I and sections 305, 403, 605, 702, and 803 of said substitute, and said substitute shall be read for amendment by titles instead of by sections. States that no amendment shall be in order to title I of said substitute except germane amendments which have been printed in the Congressional Record at least two calendar days prior to their being offered during the consideration of said substitute for amendment, and amendments offered by the direction of the Committee on Education and Labor, and neither of said classes of amendments shall be subject to amendment. Requires that, at the conclusion of such consideration, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. Provides that the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions."
