Declares the sense of the House that the President of the United States and the Secretaries of State and Agriculture should, and are hereby urged and requested to: (1) maintain regular and full consultation with the appropriate committees of the Congress; and (2) report to the Congress and the Nation at regular intervals on the progress toward formulating an American response in a cooperative framework to the world food crisis and the needs of the most severly affected developing countries."
