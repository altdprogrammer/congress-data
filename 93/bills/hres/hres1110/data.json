States that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed two hours, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule by titles instead of by sections. Stipulates that it shall be in order to consider the text of the bill H.R. 13790 if offered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute for the bill H.R. 10294. Directs that, at the conclusion of the consideration of H.R. 10294 for amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. States that upon the passage of H.R. 10294, the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs shall be discharged from further consideration of the bill S. 268, and it shall then be in order in the House to move to strike out all after the enacting clause of said Senate bill and insert in lieu therof the provisions contained in H.R. 10294 as passed by the House."
