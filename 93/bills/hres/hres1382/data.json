Nixon from January 20, 1969, through August 9, 1974, including proceeding to any indictment or indictments which may be justified by evidence presented to the grand jury; and (2) shall, at such time and in such manner as he deems to be proper and appropriate, release and make part of the public record whatever evidence he may have in his possession with respect to the conduct of Richard M. Nixon from January 20, 1969, through August 9, 1974. States that it is further the sense of the House of Representatives that the fundamental principle of equal justice under law will be damaged, not served, by the granting of Presidential pardons at this time to other individuals charged with or convicted of offenses against the United States with respect to the Watergate matter."
