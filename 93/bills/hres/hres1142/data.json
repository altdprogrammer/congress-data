Authorizes the Committee to make investigations of the problems of American small business enterprises, both existing and potential, and to obtain all facts possible in relation thereto which would be of public interest or would aid the Congress in enacting remedial legislation, giving particular attention to: (1) whether the potentialities of small business are being adequately developed and, if not, what factors have hindered and are hindering the normal operation of established small business and/or its development and enterprise; (2) whether agencies, departments of the Government, or Government owned or controlled corporations are properly, adequately, or equitably serving the needs of small business; (3) whether small business is being treated fairly and the public welfare properly and justly served through the allotments of valuable materials in which there are shortages, in the granting of priorities or preferences in the use, sale, or purchase of said materials, and (4) the need for a sound program for the solution of the postwar problems of small business."
