    "text": "Makes it the sense of the House that: (1) all agencies of the Federal Government, which have any responsibility for establishing priorities for the allocation of materials and facilities utilized in the production or distribution of fertilizer, give the highest priority to the fertilizer industry regarding the allocation of such materials and facilities; (2) the Federal Power Commission and appropriate State regulatory agencies do everything within their power, in the establishment of priorities for the allocation of natural gas (including gas sold under interruptible contracts), to insure producers of nitrogen with supplies of natural gas sufficient to maintain maximum production levels; (3) the Federal Energy Office include all of the energy and fuel requirements of the fertilizer industry, including local dealer requirements, in its highest priority category regarding allocation of gasoline, middle-distillates, and other liquid fuels utilized by this industry in the production, distribution, and application of fertilizer supplies; (4) the Cost of Living Council and the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce continue their monitoring and reporting of fertilizer supply availabilities, wholesale and retail prices, and export shipments; (5) the Cost of Living Council establish an investigatory program through the field offices of the Internal Revenue Service to monitor and analyze any reports of fertilizer price gouging at either wholesale or retail levels, and any changes in manufacturer marketing operations or relationships between manufacturers and local dealers and between local dealers and their customers which may affect continued availability or pricing of fertilizer supplies to farmers; and (6) the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and the Federal Energy Office immediately undertake a survey of the availability of sludge and other sources of nutrients from sewage treatment plants which by application to agricultural lands would reduce manufactured fertilizer requirements."
