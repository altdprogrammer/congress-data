Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the President should take all appropriate measures to attempt to expand the range of international bodies eligible to request advisory opinions of the Court, giving special attention to attempting to extend eligibility to regional organizations as well as any two or more states jointly seeking an advisory opinion on any legal questions relating to a dispute between them. Makes it the sense of the House of Representatives that the President should undertake appropriate steps to improve, within the existing provisions of the statute, the process whereby persons are nominated and elected to serve as judges of the International Court of Justice, and that the President should undertake steps to encourage the International Court of Justice, from time to time, to sit and excercise its functions outside the Hague at places more convenient to the various parties to the statute of the International Court of Justice."
