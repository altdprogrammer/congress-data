States that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed one hour, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule. Requires that immediately after the reading of the enacting clause, it shall be in order to consider the text of the bill H.R. 16327 as an amendment in the nature of a substitute for the bill H.R. 7917, and said substitute shall be read as an original bill for the purposes of amendment under the five-minute rule by titles instead of by sections. Stipulates that, at the conclusion of the consideration of H.R. 7917 for amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made in order by this resolution. Provides that the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. States that after the passage of H.R. 7917, the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce shall be discharged from the further consideration of the bill S. 356, and it shall then be in order in the House to move to strike out all after the enacting clause of the said Senate bill and insert in lieu thereof the provisions contained in H.R. 7917 as passed by the House."
