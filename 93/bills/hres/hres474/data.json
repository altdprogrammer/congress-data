Requires the special committee to consult with, advise, and act in a timely manner upon specific requests of the Clerk of the House of Representatives either when he is acting on his own motion or upon a written complaint made to him under oath setting forth allegations of fact under the Federal Election Campaign Act. Authorizes the special committee, when it deems it to be appropriate or of sufficient interest, to report any information secured by the committee to the Attorney General of the United States in order that he may take such action as he shall deem appropriate. States that the special committee shall cease to exist as of February 14, 1974."
