Provides that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed three hours, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Rules, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule. Stipulates that it shall be in order to consider without the intervention of any point of order the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Rules now printed in the bill as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule, and said substitute shall be read for amendment by titles instead of by sections. States that at the conclusion of such consideration, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. Provides that the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions."
