Entitles Members to revise remarks delivered by them on the floor of the House. Limits such revisions to the correction of grammatical and typographical errors; and provides that such corrections shall not change the meaning, content, or substance of those remarks. Allows Members to extend such remarks by the addition of statements, tables, statistics, and other supporting data dealing with the subject under discussion. Provides that such extension shall appear in the Congressional Record immediately following the remarks actually delivered of which it is an extension, and shall be printed in a type face distinctively different from that used for verbatim remarks."
