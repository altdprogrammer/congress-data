States that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed one hour, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule. Stipulates that it shall be in order to consider the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce now printed in the bill as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule, all points of order against the provisions contained on page 245, line 5, through page 246, line 19, for failure to comply with the provisions of clause 4, rule XXI, are hereby waived, and said substitute shall be read for amendment by titles instead of by sections. Requires that, at the conclusion of such consideration, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute.
