Provides that no person other than members of the committee and such congressional staff and such departmental representatives as they may authorize shall be present at any business or markup session which has been closed to the public. Enumerates those instances in which the provisions of this resolution shall not apply. Provides that each hearing conducted by each committee or subcommittee of the House shall be open to the public except when the committee or subcommittee, in open session and with a quorum present, determines by rollcall vote that all or part of the remainder of that hearing shall be closed to the public because disclosure of testimony, evidence, or other matters to be considered would endanger the national security or would violate any law or rule of the House of Representatives. Stipulates that hearings shall be held in open session, except when the committee, in open session and with a quorum present, determines by rollcall vote that the testimony to be taken at that hearing may be related to a matter of national security."
