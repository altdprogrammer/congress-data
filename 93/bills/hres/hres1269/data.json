States that if the President of the United States, within a reasonable period of time after such demand upon the Government of Lebanon, determines that the response of such Government is not satisfactory, he should direct the United States delegation to the United Nations to follow prescribed U.N. procedures to request that the United Nations establish a U.N. police force in any Palestinian Arab refugee camp in Lebanon, in order to deny the use of these camps by Arab terrorists."
