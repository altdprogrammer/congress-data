    "text": "Provides for the creation of a select committee of the House of Representatives, to be called the Select Committee on the Right of Privacy, to be composed of seven Members of the House of Representatives to be appointed by the Speaker, one of whom he shall designate as chairman. States that any vacancy occurring in the membership of the committee shall be filled in the same manner in which the orginal appointment was made. Authorizes and directs the committee to conduct an investigation of all aspects of privacy invasion, whether by government, business, or other means, to include, but not limited to, the following: (1) data banks containing processed files, (2) electronic eavesdropping, (3) census questions; (4) misuse of social security number and other identifying numbers; (5) financial information; (6) illegal entry; (7) mailing lists; (8) Armed Forces surveillance, (9) use of criminal records; and (10) certain forms used for employment information. Authorizes the committee, or any subcommittee authorized by the committee, to hold hearings, to set and act during the present Congress at such times and places within the United States, including any Commonwealth or possession, whether the House is in session, has recessed, or has adjourned, and to require, by subpena or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses and the production of such books, records, correspondence, memorandums, papers, and documents, as it deems necessary. States that subpenas may be issued under the signature of the chairman of the committee or any member of the committee designated by him, and may be served by any person designated by such chairman or member. Provides that the committee shall have authority to recommend the enactment of any new congressional legislation which its investigation considers is necessary or desirable to protect the individual's right of privacy. Directs the committee to make a final report of the results of the investigation and study conducted by this resolution, together with its findings and its recommendations as to new congressional legislation it deems necessary or desirable, to the House at the earliest practicable date, but no later than December 31, 1974. Permits the committee to submit to the House such interim reports as it considers appropriate. Provides that after submission of its final report, the committee shall have three calendar months to close its affairs, and on the expiration of such three calendar months shall cease to exist. Requires that the expenses of the committee through December 31, 1974, under this resolution shall not exceed $500,000, of which amount not to exceed $25,000 shall be paid from the contingent fund of the House upon vouchers approved by the chairman of the committee. Directs that the minority members of the committee shall have one-third of the professional staff of the committee (including a minority counsel) and such part of the clerical staff as may be adequate."
