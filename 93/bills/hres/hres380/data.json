Directs the select committee to investigate specified matters, including the following: (1) the breaking, entering, and bugging of the headquarters or offices of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate Building in Washington, District of Columbia; (2) whether or not any printed or typed or written document or paper or other material was removed from the headquarters or offices of the Democratic National Committee; and (3) whether any person, acting individually or in combination with others, or political committee or organization induced any of the activities mentioned above, or paid any of the participants in any such activities for their services, and if so, their identity and the source of the funds used by them to procure or finance such activities. Enumerates powers of the select committee, including the power to subpena witnesses and to expend to the extent it determines necessary any moneys made available to it by the House to perform the duties conferred upon it. States that the select committee shall make a final report of the results of its investigation and study to the House of Representatives not later than February 28, 1974. Authorizes an appropriation of $500,000 to meet the expenses of the select committee."
