Requires that after general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed two hours, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, the bill shall be read for amendment under the five-minute rule. Stipulates that it shall be in order to consider the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service now printed in the bill as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule, and all points of order against section 5 of said substitute for failure to comply with the Ruler of the House are hereby waived. Provides that, at the conclusion of such consideration, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. States that the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. Redefines part of the definition of the term \"common trust fund\" pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code as a fund maintained by a bank exclusively for the collective investment and reinvestment of moneys contributed thereto by the bank maintaining the fund, or by any other bank which is a member of an affiliated group (as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1504) of which the bank maintaining the fund is a member, in the capacity of the contributing bank as trustee, executor, administrator, or guardian.
