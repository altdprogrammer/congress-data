    "text": "Urges Congress to evaluate whether proposed welfare legislation would exacerbate violence against women, make it more difficult for women and children to escape domestic violence, or unfairly penalize such individuals victimized by or at risk of violence. Provides that welfare legislation enacted by the Congress should: (1) require that welfare-to-work, education, or job placement programs implemented by the States take domestic violence into account by providing mechanisms for screening and identifying recipients with a history of domestic violence, referring such recipients to counseling and supportive services, tolling time limits for them, and waiving other program requirements such as residency requirements, child support cooperation requirements, and family cap provisions, in cases where compliance with such requirements would make it more difficult for the recipients to escape domestic violence or unfairly penalize recipients victimized by or at risk of further violence; and (2) include a provision requiring that the Comptroller General develop and implement a comprehensive study of the incidence and effect of domestic violence on Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) recipients. Provides that welfare legislation adopted by the States that contains a welfare-to-work, education, or job placement program should take domestic violence into account by providing similar mechanisms."
