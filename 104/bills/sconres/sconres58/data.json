    "text": "Telephone Number Ownership Resolution of 1996 - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Federal Communications Commission lacks legal authority to conduct auctions or other revenue raising activities in connection with the allocation of any telephone number within the North American Numbering Plan; and (2) if the Congress is to authorize such activities, procedures will be required to protect any value attaching to new toll-free numbers by reason of a private business investment in the advertisement or public awareness of the corresponding 800 number by measures designed to prevent speculation, hoarding, and other gaming of the allocation system, and to protect consumers from fraud and confusion by preventing the misrepresentation of established toll-free numbers. Calls for the Commission to submit a plan for the allocation of toll-free 888 numbers that contains such procedures, together with its recommendations for legislative authorization of such allocation."
