Calls upon the Government of Ukraine to continue its negotiations with the G-7 countries to implement the December 20, 1995, memorandum of understanding which calls for all nuclear reactors at Chernobyl to be shut down. Urges the President to: (1) support U.S. assistance to provide medical relief, humanitarian assistance, social impact planning, and hospital development for Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and other nations most heavily afflicted by Chernobyl's aftermath; (2) encourage national and international health organizations to expand the scope of research into the public health consequences of Chernobyl so that the global community can benefit; (3) support closing the plant; and (4) support broadening Ukraine's regional energy sources which will reduce its dependence on any individual country."
