Calls for: (1) the President of the United States to encourage and support Zedillo's efforts to create an independent Mexican judicial body to evaluate the financial holdings of former and present Mexican officials, to investigate possible corruption and economic malfeasance in an effort to bring about a true democracy in Mexico, and to investigate the killings of Cardinal Juan Posadas, PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, and PRI Secretary General Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu; (2) the U.S. Congress to pursue efforts to strengthen relations with the Mexican Congress; (3) the U.S. Attorney General to pursue greater cooperation with the Mexican Government to investigate cross-border corruption and to provide protection for those willing to come forward publicly; (4) the Mexican Government to replace and prosecute corrupt regional police commanders; and (5) the interdiction of illegal narcotics to be a top priority for the United States in its management of such border. Expresses support for efforts of the Mexican people to eliminate illegal drug trafficking on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border."
