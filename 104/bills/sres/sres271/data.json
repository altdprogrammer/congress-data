Expresses the sense of the Senate that the establishment of an appointed legislature would be a violation of the Joint Declaration and the PRC should allow the Legislative Council elected in September 1995 to serve its full elected term. Urges the President and the Secretary of State to communicate to the PRC and to the Hong Kong Government and Legislative Council full U.S. support for Hong Kong's autonomy and U.S. interest in full compliance by both the PRC and Great Britain with the Joint Declaration as a matter of international law."
