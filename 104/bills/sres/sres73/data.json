Authorizes the transfer of any unexpended balance of any committee for the period ending February 28, 1995, to a special reserve to be available to any committee to meet specified unpaid obligations or expenses. Expresses the sense of the Senate that space assigned to committees covered by this resolution shall be reduced commensurate with the reductions in authorized staff funded herein. States that the Committee on Rules and Administration is expected to recover such space for purposes of equalizing Senators' offices and to consolidate the space for committees to reduce the cost of support equipment and office furniture and accessories."
