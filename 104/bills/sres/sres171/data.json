Calls upon all parties to take steps to prevent such acts. Calls upon: (1) the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority to comply with all of their commitments; and (2) the Arab states to completely dismantle the Arab boycott of Israel. Welcomes the progress made toward peace between Israel and its neighbors. Commends those Middle Eastern leaders who have committed to resolve their differences through only peaceful means. Reiterates the belief that a comprehensive, lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors is in the U.S. national interest. Encourages all participants in the Middle East peace process to continue working to achieve lasting peace agreements while fully adhering to all commitments made and agreements reached thus far."
