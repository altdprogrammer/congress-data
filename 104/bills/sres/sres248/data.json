Declares that a breakdown of the Abuja process would have disastrous humanitarian ramifications and seriously threaten other U.S. interests in West Africa. Calls upon all factions to reach a cease-fire and recommit themselves to the Abuja process. Urges the Administration to: (1) identify funds that could be either reprogrammed or transferred and used to support additional non-Nigerian West African peacekeepers; (2) consider the provision of excess defense articles for communications and logistical support and training for crowd-control techniques for non-Nigerian troops to participate effectively in a West African peacekeeping force; (3) use its influence with other nations with interests in Liberia to solicit further support for West African peacekeeping forces, including their participation at the April 26 meeting of a newly formed Contact Group in Liberia; and (4) lead United Nations (UN) efforts to activate a Commission to develop an implementation plan and sanctions against those parties violating the UN arms embargo on Liberia."
