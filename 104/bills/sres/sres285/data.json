Urges: (1) the United States, in compliance with such Act, to support efforts to bring to justice Khmer Rouge members for their crimes against humanity; and (2) the President to encourage the establishment of a national or international criminal tribunal for the prosecution of Ieng Sary (former deputy Prime Minister of the Khmer Rouge) and to provide it with any information available on Ieng Sary's alleged involvement in the Cambodian genocide. Calls for the Secretary of State to: (1) monitor preparations for upcoming Cambodian elections; (2) attempt to secure the RGC's agreement to full and unhindered participation of international observers for those elections; (3) support the continuation of human rights monitoring in Cambodia by the UN; and (4) encourage Cambodia's other donors and trading partners to raise concerns with the RGC over Cambodia's record on human rights, the environment, narcotics trafficking, and governmental conduct."
