Deletes from items not included as such a gift: (1) a reception to honor such person; and (2) meals or beverages not consumed in connection with a gift of overnight lodging. Adds as items not included as such a gift: (1) free attendance at a widely attended event connected with official duties; (2) permissible travel, lodging, and meals at an event to raise funds for a bona fide charity if participation is determined to be in the interest of the Senate or the United States (excluding transportation and other expenses for a period exceeding three days exclusive of travel time within the United States or seven days exclusive of travel time outside the United States unless approved by the Select Committee on Ethics); and (3) a sponsor's unsolicited offer of free attendance at an event for an accompanying spouse if others in attendance will generally be accompanied by spouses or if such attendance is appropriate to assist in the representation of the Senate. Requires the Select Committee on Ethics to publish notice in the Congressional Record within 30 days after the attendance by a Member, officer, or employee at such an event. Subjects the attendance by an employee at such event to approval of the employee's supervisor."
