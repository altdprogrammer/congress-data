    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Denies enforceability against any State or local government of: (1) any obligation imposed upon such government by or pursuant to a Federal law that becomes effective after the ratification of this amendment unless the Federal Government provides it with the funds needed to pay its compliance costs; and (2) any condition similarly imposed upon the receipt of Federal assistance by such a government unless it is directly and substantially related to the specific subject matter of the assistance. Allows waiver of such denial by a two-thirds recorded roll call vote of each House of Congress only if such obligations or conditions are specifically identified and imposed by a single, specified Act of Congress containing no other matter. Prohibits any Federal law from imposing upon any State or local government an obligation to enact or administer a Federal program. Provides for judicial review, but disallows as a judicial remedy an order or ruling that the Federal Government provide a State or local government with the funds needed to pay its compliance costs. Provides that nothing in this constitutional amendment shall be construed as rendering compatible with the U.S. Constitution any exercise of Federal power that would, in the absence of the amendment, violate that Constitution."
