    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Grants victims of crimes of violence and other crimes that the Congress and the States may define by law the right: (1) to notice of, and to not be excluded from, all public proceedings relating to the crime; (2) to be heard, if present, and to submit a statement at a public pre-trial or trial proceeding to determine a release from custody, an acceptance of a negotiated plea, or a sentence (grants such rights at a parole proceeding to the extent they are afforded to the convicted offender); (3) to notice of a release pursuant to a public or parole proceeding or an escape; (4) to a final disposition free from unreasonable delay; (5) to an order of restitution from the convicted offender; (6) to have the victim's safety considered in determining a release from custody; and (7) to notice of the rights established by this amendment. Grants the victim standing to assert such rights. Provides that nothing in this amendment shall provide grounds for: (1) the victim to challenge a charging decision or a conviction, to obtain a stay of trial, to compel a new trial, or to give rise to a claim for damages against the United States, a State, a political subdivision, or a public official; or (2) the accused or convicted offender to obtain any form of relief. Grants power to the Congress and the States to enforce this amendment within their respective jurisdictions by appropriate legislation, including the power to enact exceptions when required for compelling reasons of public safety."
