Sets forth the conditions to be met prior to taking lands into trust for the Tribe pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire: (1) private lands; and (2) through condemnation, with funds provided by the Tribe, certain interspersed lands that are owned by the State of Arizona in order to have both the private and the State lands taken into trust for the Tribe. Prohibits the Secretary, pursuant to the provisions of this Act and the Settlement Agreement, from placing lands, any portion of which are located within or contiguous to a five-mile radius of an incorporated town or city in Northern Arizona, into trust for the Tribe without specific statutory authority. Authorizes the Tribe, if the United States fails to discharge the obligation of voluntarily relocating Navajos residing on Hopi Partitioned Lands, to bring an action to quiet possession relating to use of such Lands after February 2002 by an eligible Navajo family that fails to enter into an accommodation. Authorizes an appropriation to the Department of the Interior of $250,000 for FY 1998 to be used for making a payment to the State of Arizona. Requires the Secretary to make such a payment to the State of Arizona after an initial acquisition of land from the State has been made by the Secretary. Amends Federal law to authorize leases by the Hopi Tribe to Navajo Indians residing on Hopi Partitioned Lands that may be for a 75-year term and extended at the conclusion of the lease term. Amends Public Law 93-531 to reauthorize the Navajo-Hopi Relocation Housing Program through FY 2000. Sets forth provisions concerning water rights on newly aquired trust lands."
