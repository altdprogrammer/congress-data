(Sec. 204) Authorizes the President to withhold 20 percent of the funds appropriated for the U.S. assessed contribution to the United Nations if the United Nations has failed to implement consensus-based decisionmaking procedures on budgetary matters which assure that sufficient attention is paid to the views of the United States and other member states who are major financial contributors. (Sec. 205) Amends the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 to require specified percentages of funds made available for a fiscal year for U.S. assessed contributions for the U.N. budget and U.N. peacekeeping activities to be withheld from obligation unless the President certifies to the Congress that the United Nations has an independent office of Inspector General to conduct audits of U.N. programs, with an Inspector General duly appointed. Prohibits the United States from paying any voluntary contribution to the United Nations for international peacekeeping activities unless such certification has been made. (Sec. 206) Directs the President to withhold ten percent of the funds made available for U.S. assessed contributions for the U.N. budget until the Secretary of State certifies to the Congress that the United Nations has implemented certain whistleblower protection policies with respect to the reporting of fraud and mismanagement. Chapter 2: United Nations Peacekeeping - Amends the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 to require the President to notify designated congressional committees of any proposed U.N. peacekeeping activity or any other action under the Charter of the United Nations that would involve the use of U.S. armed forces or the expenditure of U.S. funds. (Sec. 214) Urges the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations to make every effort to: (1) ensure that the United Nations completes a review and reassessment of each nation's assessed contributions for U.N. peacekeeping operations; and (2) advance, as part of the review, the concept that host governments in the region where such operations are carried out should bear a greater burden of its financial cost. Limits the U.S. assessed contribution for U.N. peacekeeping operations.

(Sec. 313) Prohibits the use of funds to pay U.S. membership in the U.N. Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the Inter-American Indian Institute, the Pan American Railway Congress Association, or the Interparliamentary Union. (Sec. 314) Declares that it is the sense of the Senate that the Human Rights Committee established under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights should revoke its General Comment No. 24, adopted on November 2, 1994, which: (1) claimed for the Committee the power to judge the validity under international law of reservations to the Covenant; (2) asserted that reservations of the type included in the Senate resolution of ratification (approved April 2, 1992) are invalid; and (3) asserted that invalid reservations will be read out of instruments of ratification, treating the Covenant as operative for the reserving party without benefit of such reservations.
