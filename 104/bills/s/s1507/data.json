Authorizes the Commission to perform its functions with any quorum of Commissioners as the Commission may prescribe. Reduces the total number of Commissioners to two, effective December 31, 1999, and to one, the Commission Chairman, effective December 31, 2001. Authorizes that Commissioner (or, in that Commissioner's absence, the Attorney General) to delegate to one or more hearing examiners specified powers. Directs the Attorney General: (1) to report to the Congress by May 1 of 1998 through 2002 on the status of the Commission; and (2) unless he or she certifies in such report that the Commission's continuation is the most effective and cost-efficient manner for carrying out the Commission's functions, to include an alternative plan for a transfer of the Commission's functions to another entity. Directs that such a plan that provides for the transfer of functions and powers to an entity within the Department of Justice shall take effect on November 1 of the year in which the report is made, unless the Congress by law provides otherwise."
