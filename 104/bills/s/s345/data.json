Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a cooperative agreement with York County to pay a specified maximum amount of the repair and rehabilitation costs for the system. Requires the cooperative agreement to: (1) reduce or eliminate the amounts charged to the National Park Service for its sewage disposal; and (2) minimize the impact of the system on the Park and its resources. Prohibits such system from being enlarged or substantially altered without Park Service concurrence. Authorizes appropriations."
