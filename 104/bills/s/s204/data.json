    "text": "Federal Buildings Reform Act of 1995 - Amends the Public Buildings Act of 1959 to require the Administrator of General Services to submit to the Congress a biennial public buildings plan, including: (1) a five-year plan for accommodating the public building needs of the Government; (2) lists (in order of priority) of construction, alteration, purchase, and acquisition projects and of leases for which authorizations of appropriations are requested for specified fiscal years; (3) the estimated annual and total cost of each project and lease; and (4) any final environmental impact statement prepared for a project. Requires the Administrator to provide for a public hearing in the locality of each major project included in the biennial plan to consider the project's economic and social effects, environmental impact, and consistency with urban planning goals and objectives of the community. Repeals a provision of the Act prohibiting the employment of architectural or engineering services on a permanent basis. Directs the Administrator to use the results of the continuing investigation and survey of public buildings to establish a central repository for the asset management information of the Government. Directs each Federal agency to: (1) identify unneeded, obsolete, and underutilized public buildings; and (2) annually report specified information to the Administrator. Authorizes the Administrator to conduct research and post-occupancy evaluations to determine and improve the effectiveness of existing and planned public buildings. Requires the Administrator to ensure that: (1) the headquarters of each executive department and establishment is located within the National Capital region unless otherwise specified by Act of Congress; (2) the regional, district, area, or local offices of Federal agencies are centrally located with respect to residential populations served or other governmental and private offices with which the agencies must maintain communication; and (3) the Federal agency offices are located throughout the United States generally in proportion to the geographic distribution of the U.S. population, with exceptions. Establishes a Building Design Advisory Board for conducting design competitions and reviewing the architectural design of Federal buildings. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (such Act) to require the Administrator to: (1) submit to the Board and to the Congress a list of projects for which architectural and engineering services for building design or site planning shall first be procured during the fiscal year; (2) designate a substantial number as projects for which such services shall be acquired through design competitions conducted under such Act; (3) issue model rules for conducting such projects; and (4) conduct each competition provided for under such Act. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) criteria for selection of designs; (2) recommendations concerning negotiations; (3) final selections; and (4) jury and adviser personnel matters. Requires the Administrator to require, as a condition of entering into any lease or other contract that would obligate funds in excess of $10,000 authorized pursuant to such Act, a certification consisting of declarations that the owner of the space to be leased or the contractor and any officer or principal employee of the contractor has: (1) no conflict of interest with the capacity of the person as a lessor or contractor with the Government; (2) not offered or promised anything of value to a public official for performing an official act; (3) not had a public contract terminated for default; and (4) not been convicted, indicted, or charged with specified offenses within ten years prior to the date of the solicitation for the lease or contract award. Requires the head of each Federal agency defined in the Act to review and report to the Congress on the long-term housing needs of the agency. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to report to the Congress on the feasibility and desirability of ending the monopoly of the General Services Administration with respect to providing office and storage space for Federal agencies."
