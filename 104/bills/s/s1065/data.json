    "text": "International Peace Operations Support Act of 1995 - Directs the President to submit a report to the Congress setting forth a plan and procedures for recruiting, training, and organizing into units of the armed forces a contingency force of up to 3,000 personnel, comprised of current active-duty military personnel, who volunteer additionally and specifically to serve in international peace operations and who receive added compensation for such service. Authorizes the President: (1) upon approval by the United Nations Security Council of an international peace operation and after appropriate congressional consultation, to make those units available for such operations; and (2) to terminate U.S. participation in international peace operations at any time and take actions necessary to protect U.S. forces. Requires termination of any use of the armed forces with respect to which a report was submitted or required to be submitted under the War Powers Resolution within 180 days, unless the Congress has extended such period by law. Authorizes the use of funds available to the Department of Defense to carry out this Act. Includes within the mission statement of each of the military departments the participation in international peacekeeping, humanitarian, and refugee assistance activities when determined by the President to be in the national security interests."
