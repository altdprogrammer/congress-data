    "text": "NAFTA Accountability Act - Withdraws approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as of October 1, 1997, unless specified conditions are met. Sets forth conditions for continuing U.S. participation in NAFTA, which must be met before the end of 1996. Requires the President to renegotiate the terms of NAFTA to correct trade deficits, currency distortions, and agricultural provisions in specified ways. Requires certifications by certain U.S. officials with respect to NAFTA, relating to: (1) gains in U.S. jobs and living standards (by the Secretary of Labor); (2) increased U.S. domestic manufacturing (by the Secretary of Commerce); (3) health and environmental standards, with respect to food imports and to U.S.-Mexico border areas (by the Secretary of Agriculture, the Administrator of the Food and Drug Administration, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency); (4) compliance by Mexican commercial trucks and buses with U.S. transportation safety standards before crossing the U.S. border (by the Secretary of Transportation); (5) flow of illegal drugs from Mexico and Canada (by the Attorney General); and (6) Mexican democracy and human freedoms (by the President). Directs the President to consult regularly with the Congress regarding such negotiations. Directs the U.S. Trade Representative to consult with appropriate congressional committees in developing technical and conforming amendments that may be required to carry out this Act. Expresses the sense of the Congress that until the conditions set by this Act are met: (1) the President should not engage in negotiations to expand NAFTA to include other countries; and (2) fast-track authority should not be renewed with respect to the approval of any such NAFTA expansion."
