    "text": "Department of Energy Class Action Lawsuit Act - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to bar a class action suit against any person indemnified by the United States under the Act (Department of Energy contractors) with respect to any claim for a nonphysical injury (emotional distress, mental or emotional harm, or diminution of property value) arising from a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation regardless of when it occurred. Provides that the exclusive remedy for any claim for medical monitoring in a public liability action against such contractors shall be medical monitoring by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Declares that no court may grant a remedy for a medical monitoring claim except in the case of an extraordinary nuclear occurrence, or as provided under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Bars the award of punitive damages against such contractors with respect to a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation regardless of: (1) the date of occurrence; or (2) the statutory authority under which the agreement of indemnification was entered. Declares this Act applicable to any public liability action pending on the date of its enactment, or commenced on or after such date."
