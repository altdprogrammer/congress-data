Defines \"partial-birth abortion\" as partial, vaginal delivery of the fetus prior to killing the fetus and completing the delivery. Permits the parents or the maternal grandparents (if the mother has not attained the age of 18 at the time of the abortion) through a civil action to obtain relief which would include money damages for all injuries and statutory damages equal to three times the cost of the partial-birth abortion, even if any party consented to an abortion. Permits the affirmative defense to a prosecution or a civil action, which must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence, that the physician reasonably believed: (1) the procedure was necessary to save the woman's life; and (2) no other form of abortion would have sufficed for that purpose."
