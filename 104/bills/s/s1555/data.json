Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue U.S. obligations before March 1, 1996, in an amount equal to the monthly insurance benefits payable under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act in March 1996. Exempts such obligations from the public debt limit until the earlier of March 15, 1996, or the date of the enactment of the first increase in such limit after the date of the enactment of this Act."
