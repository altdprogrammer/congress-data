Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) Reserve boundaries; (2) the transfer of funds to the Commission for land acquisition; and (3) conditions of funding (including provision for specified conservation easements and that funds may be transferred to the Commission only to the extent that they are matched from funds contributed by non-Federal sources). Directs the Commission to: (1) manage the lands acquired within the Reserve in a manner consistent with the Commission's authorities and the protection of significant watershed, wildlife, and recreational resources within the New York-New Jersey highlands region; and (2) prepare a general management plan for the Reserve, to be submitted to the Secretary for approval. Authorizes appropriations. Limits the amount that may be transferred to the Commission for the acquisition of lands and interests in land within the Reserve."
