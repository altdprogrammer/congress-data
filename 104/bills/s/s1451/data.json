Allows the Secretary, subject to the availability of appropriations, to reimburse the State and political subdivisions for costs incurred in performance of the agreement. Makes a State or its political subdivision liable to the United States in indemnification for any Federal liability imposed for an act or omission by an employee or political subdivision providing such services."
