    "text": "Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Amendments Act of 1995 - Amends the Metropolitan Washington Airports Act of 1986 to abolish the Board of Review of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. (Sec. 3) Increases from one to seven the number of persons on the board of directors of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority whom the President must appoint with the advice and consent of the Senate. Requires ten votes (currently, seven) to approve bond issues and the annual budget. Staggers the terms of presidential appointees to the board of directors. (Sec. 4) Ratifies and deems valid any action taken by the Board of Review prior to the amendments made by this Act. (Sec. 5) Requires the board of directors, including any members appointed under this Act, to continue to meet and act until necessary conforming changes in State law are made in order that the reconstituted board functions without interruption. (Sec. 6) Declares that nothing in this Act shall affect the treatment of the Airports Authority under Federal, State, or local tax law. (Sec. 7) Requires the Secretary of Transportation to appoint an advisory group of three non-Federal individuals to review: (1) the lease arrangements of Metropolitan Washington Airports with the Airports Authority; and (2) any renegotiation of such lease, including subleases, any change in the lease terms or conditions, and the amount of any payments made or received under it. Requires such lease to provide for the Airports Authority to pay to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (currently, to the general fund of the Treasury) a specified annual amount."
