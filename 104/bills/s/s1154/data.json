    "text": "Fort Peck Rural County Water Supply System Act of 1995 - Requires the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Fort Peck Rural County Water District, Inc., in Montana for the planning, design, and construction by the District of the Fort Peck Rural County Water Supply System. Requires the System to provide for safe and adequate rural water supplies, economic enhancement, mitigation of wetland areas, and water conservation in the area under the District's jurisdiction in Valley County, northeastern Montana. Requires the Secretary, under such agreement, to pay: (1) 80 percent, without reimbursement, of the amount allocated in the total budget for the planning, design, and construction of the System (as described in the Final Engineering Report and Alternative Evaluation for the Fort Peck Rural County Water District, dated September 1994, (feasibility study)); and (2) such sums as are necessary to defray increases in the budget. Prohibits the amount of the Federal funds made available under the agreement from exceeding the authorized appropriations under this Act. Allows not more than five percent of such funds to be used for activities associated with: (1) compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; and (2) oversight of the planning, design, and construction by the District of the System. Provides that the requirements of such Act must be met before the Secretary obligates funds for the construction of the System. Requires the District to design a water conservation program to ensure that users of water from the System will use the best practicable technology and management techniques to conserve water use. Requires, in accordance with the feasibility study, that mitigation for fish and wildlife losses incurred as a result of the construction and operation of the System be on an acre-for-acre basis, based on ecological equivalency and concurrent with project construction. Authorizes appropriations."
