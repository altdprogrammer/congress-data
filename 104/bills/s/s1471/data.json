    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1995-12-12", 
    "text": "Federal Tort Claims Act Malpractice Coverage for Health Centers Extension Act of 1995 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to remove provisions ending, on a specified date, the application of provisions: (1) deeming health care practitioner officers, employees, or contractors of certain entities (migrant and community health centers and grant recipients for health services to the homeless and to residents of public housing) to be employees of the Public Health Service (PHS); and (2) making a malpractice action against the United States the sole remedy against such practitioners. Adds governing board members to the list of practitioners deemed to be PHS employees. Allows the practitioners to be considered PHS employees while treating individuals who are not patients of such an entity if the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines, after reviewing the application, that the provision of the services to such individuals: (1) benefits patients of, and general populations that could be served by, the entity through community-wide intervention efforts within the communities served by such entity; (2) facilitates the provision of services to such patients; or (3) are otherwise required under an employment contract or similar arrangement between the entity and an officer, governing board member, employee, or contractor of the entity. Sets forth an application process. Directs the Attorney General to appear in State court actions to advise the court whether an officer, governing board member, employee, or contractor has been deemed to be an employee of the Public Health Service. Provides for the application of coverage to managed care plans. Revises the requirements: (1) to be considered a contractor of such an entity; and (2) of due process regarding exclusion of specific individuals from coverage. Directs the General Accounting Office to submit to the Congress a report on the medical malpractice liability claims experience of entities that have been deemed to be employees and the risk exposure associated with such entities. Reduces the maximum limit on the fund set up to cover annual estimated claims."
