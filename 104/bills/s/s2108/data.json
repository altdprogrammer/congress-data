    "text": "Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1996 - Prohibits the use of appropriated funds to provide, procure, furnish, fund, or support, or to compel any individual, institution, or government entity to provide, procure, furnish, fund, or support, any item, good, benefit, program, or service, the purpose of which is to cause, or to assist in causing, the suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing of any individual. Amends the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to incorporate a modified version of this prohibition. Adds a further prohibition, with regard to protection and advocacy systems, against certain assistance provided under such Federal laws for asserting or advocating a legal right to cause, or to assist in causing, or to receive assistance in causing, suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing. Amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit the use or availability of appropriations under such Act to provide any item, or service, for the purposes of causing or assisting in suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing. Prohibits Federal financial participation under title XIX (Medicaid), or Federal reimbursement under title XVIII (Medicare), of the Social Security Act for assisted suicide or related services. Provides for the treatment of advance directives under both Medicare and Medicaid. Prohibits the use of appropriated funds for assisted suicide and related services under the Older Americans Act of 1965, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, and under title XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services Program) of the Social Security Act. Prohibits the use of appropriated funds for assisted suicide and related services under the military and Federal employees health care systems, and as health care for Peace Corps volunteers and Federal prisoners. Amends the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act to ban the use of Federal funds for assisted suicide and related services. Amends the Legal Services Corporation Act to prohibit the use of legal assistance for assisted suicide and related services, and for asserting or advocating a legal right to such services."
