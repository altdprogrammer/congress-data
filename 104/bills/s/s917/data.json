Directs the Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) of the Department of Labor to designate an OSHA employee with such qualifications to serve as the chairperson of each Occupational Safety and Health Small Business Advocacy Review Panel established under this Act. Directs the appropriate chairperson, with respect to a proposed Federal agency rule (other than agency organization, management, or personnel rules), to determine whether such rule is significant (has an impact on small business and has an annual aggregate impact on government and the private sector of at least $50 million) and, if so, to notify the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget and the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration to appoint review panel members for evaluation of the rule. Requires each chairperson to notify panel members of the intent of an agency to issue a final rule, and to solicit comments from the panel with respect to the rule's effect on small business. Provides review panel administrative, procedural, and personnel matters. Directs each chairperson to submit to the appropriate Federal agency employees responsible for carrying out a significant rule and to the appropriate congressional committees a report containing the findings and recommendations of the review panel for such rule and a recommendation of whether to conduct a cross-section survey of the small businesses impacted by the rule. Prohibits: (1) the judicial review of review panel activities; or (2) the publication of a rule in the Federal Register until the appropriate chairperson has had an adequate opportunity for its review under this Act. Title II: Peer Review Survey - Provides that, if a review panel recommends that a survey be conducted, the Federal agency involved shall contract with a private sector firm or organization to conduct the survey. Requires the availability of survey results to each interested Federal agency and, upon request, to any other interested party."
