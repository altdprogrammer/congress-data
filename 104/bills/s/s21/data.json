    "text": "Bosnia and Herzegovina Self-Defense Act of 1995 - Directs the President to terminate the U.S. arms embargo of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina following: (1) receipt by the United States of a request from the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina for termination of such embargo and their submission of a request to the United Nations Security Council for the departure of UNPROFOR from Bosnia and Herzegovina; or (2) a decision by the Council, or decisions by countries contributing forces to UNPROFOR, to withdraw UNPROFOR from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Authorizes the President to implement the termination of the arms embargo before complete withdrawal of UNPROFOR from Bosnia and Herzegovina, but no later than the earlier of the date of complete withdrawal, or the date 12 weeks after submission of a withdrawal request to the Council by the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Provides for extensions of such deadlines. Requires the United States to bring the issue of the termination of the arms embargo before the U.N. General Assembly if the U.N. Security Council fails to adopt a resolution to terminate such embargo because of the lack of unanimity of its permanent members."
