(Sec. 3) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to revise the transaction fee schedule for: (1) exchange-traded securities; (2) off-exchange trades of exchange-registered securities; (3) off-exchange trades of last-sale-reported securities. Declares that such fees are in lieu of, and not in addition to, any fees that the Securities and Exchange Commission is authorized to impose or collect."
