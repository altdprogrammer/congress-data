Amends title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to terminate after FY 1995 the: (1) Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Program; and (2) Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) Training Program. Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to limit the Food Stamp program to providing benefits to the elderly and the disabled. Instructs the Secretary to submit to the Congress eligibility criteria for medical assistance under a State plan under SSA title XIX (Medicaid) in lieu of the eligibility criteria related to the plans terminated by this Act. Requires any savings resulting from this Act to be dedicated to reduction of the Federal budget deficit."
