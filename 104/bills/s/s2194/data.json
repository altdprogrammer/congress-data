    "text": "Outfitter and Guide Policy Act of 1996 - Requires a person or entity who offers to provide or conduct outfitter and guide (O&G) services for a fee on Federal lands to obtain authorization under this Act. Provides criteria for the issuance of such authorization, including the identification of skills, experience, and financial capability to offer O&G services. Authorizes the head of the National Park Service, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, or Bureau of Reclamation (agency head) to enter into a written O&G agreement for the use and occupancy of Federal lands to perform appropriate O&G services for the public. Authorizes the agency head to issue a noncompetitive O&G business license to a person or entity qualified to provide visitor services on a limited basis at a Federal resource area. Authorizes the issuance of additional agreements for specified reasons, including an increase in public recreational activity in an area or the termination of an existing O&G agreement. Provides for the solicitation of applicants for O&G agreements and business licenses and permits. (Sec. 6) Directs the agency head to require payment of a reasonable fee for the opportunity to provide O&G services pursuant to this Act, allowing for the adjustment of such fee only for: (1) inflation; (2) adverse material changes in agreement conditions; or (3) an unforeseen disaster. (Sec. 7) Directs the agency head to provide that the O&G license or permit holder (holder) will defend or indemnify the United States against all costs associated with injury, damage, or death of person or property resulting from the holder's negligence, with exceptions. (Sec. 8) Requires a holder to file an annual operating plan with the agency head prior to the first day in which operations are conducted under an O&G agreement. (Sec. 9) Requires the agency head to assign an allocation of use to the holder of an O&G authorization whose services are marketed and available to the public, requiring such allocation to include a principal use with regard to the nature of the O&G service. Provides for: (1) seasonal deviation from and adjustments to the assigned amount of principal use; and (2) an assignment of temporary use at the discretion of the agency. (Sec. 10) Specifies objectives to be used by the agency head to develop a program for O&G performance evaluations on at least an annual basis. (Sec. 11) Directs the agency head, upon a finding of good overall performance during the term of an O&G agreement, to renew such authorization at the request of the holder. Provides for agreement termination for cause. (Sec. 12) Makes O&G agreements transferrable only with the approval of the appropriate agency head, but prohibits such approval from being unreasonably withheld or delayed. Prohibits the modification of agreement terms upon transfer. Considers a transfer approved if the agency head fails to act within 90 days. (Sec. 13) Provides for the resolution of disputes arising between an agency and O&Gs under this Act. (Sec. 17) Authorizes appropriations."
