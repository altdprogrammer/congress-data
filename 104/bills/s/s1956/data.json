Title II: Committee on Finance - Subtitle A: Welfare Reform - Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 - Expresses the sense of the Congress that prevention of out-of-wedlock pregnancy and reduction in out-of-wedlock births are important Government interests. (Sec. 2103) Replaces the current Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) with a single program of block grants to the States for operating statewide temporary assistance (TEA) programs with certain mandatory work, education, and job preparation requirements for needy families either already with or expecting a child, which are designed to assist such families in becoming self-sufficient. Limits such families generally to no more than five years of TEA cash assistance, with certain exceptions for minor children, battered family members, and hardship situations. Requires that families include either a minor child who resides with a custodial parent or other adult caretaker relative, or a pregnant individual, in order to receive TEA assistance. Prohibits additional cash TEA assistance for children born into families already on TEA assistance, with certain exceptions for children born into families with no other children, and for children born as a result of rape or incest, unless the particular State exempts itself from such prohibition. Denies TEA assistance in cases where an individual family member is a fugitive felon or a probation or parole violator, and in certain other specified situations as well. Requires States receiving TEA grants to ensure that certain other families becoming TEA-ineligible due to increased earnings from employment or collection of child support receive similar medical assistance during the immediately succeeding 12-month period, with certain exceptions. Requires, in addition, certain adult-supervised living arrangements for unmarried teenage parents. Provides for the exchange of certain TEA program information with law enforcement agencies under specified conditions. Establishes penalties for States and individual families for specified grant and program violations, respectively, through reduced grants and assistance payments, allowing States to terminate such payments to certain adult family members without small children needing child care who refuse to: (1) engage in work, educational, or job preparation activities (required program activities); or (2) cooperate with the State in establishing paternity or obtaining child support unless the member qualifies for a good cause or other exception. Provides for a separate reduction in State family assistance grant payments for States failing to comply with Federal requirements pertaining to paternity establishment and child support enforcement. Sets forth the mechanism for State appeal of Federal adverse decisions with respect to State plans or imposition of penalties, providing for advance notification of any program violation and the opportunity for a State to correct it before any such penalty is imposed. Limits the amount of any penalty reduction in the State's quarterly family assistance grant payment. Expresses the sense of the Congress that State TEA programs should: (1) assign the highest priority to requiring adults in two-parent families and in single-parent families with older preschool or school-age children to be engaged in required program activities; and (2) require noncustodial, nonsupporting parents under age 18 to fulfill community work obligations and attend appropriate parenting or money management classes after school. Specifies State TEA plan contents, including provisions for numerical goals for reducing illegitimacy in the State over a specified ten-year period beginning in 1996, and certain certifications by the State that it will operate child support enforcement and protection programs, in order for it to be eligible (according to certain other criteria as well) to receive Federal grants for its TEA programs (family assistance grants). Allows the States to decide in their TEA plans: (1) whether or not they intend on providing TEA assistance to aliens; and (2) how to treat families moving interstate. Provides for: (1) the allowable uses of quarterly family assistance grants for family planning services and assistance to low- income households in meeting home heating and cooling costs, but denies their use for medical services generally; (2) additional grants to States as rewards for reductions in illegitimate births and for high performance under the TEA program, as well as supplemental grants to certain States for population increases; and (3) a Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs (Contingency Fund) in the Treasury for payments to certain eligible States. Makes appropriations for such grants and the Contingency Fund. Sets up a Federal loan program for State TEA programs for anti-fraud and other specified activities, making necessary appropriations. Outlines specific program data collection and reporting requirements, as well as certain research, evaluation, and study requirements. Makes applicable appropriations. Provides for direct funding, by way of three-year tribal family assistance grants, to Indian tribes with approved tribal family assistance plans (with a special rule for Indian tribes in Alaska). Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement and evaluate demonstrations of innovative and promising strategies which: (1) provide one-time capital funds to establish, expand, or replicate programs; (2) test performance-based grant-to- loan financing in which programs meeting performance targets receive grants while programs not meeting such targets repay funding on a prorated basis; and (3) test strategies in multiple States and types of communities. Directs the Bureau of the Census to expand the Survey of Income and Program Participation to obtain information that will enable interested persons to evaluate the impact of the changes made by this title on a random national sample of State program recipients. Provides for the treatment of State AFDC waivers in effect on the date of enactment of this Act and of those granted subsequently. Makes the Assistant Secretary of HHS for Family Support the official responsible for administering SSA title IV parts A and D programs, and requires the Secretary to reduce, through reductions in force if necessary, the Federal workforce within HHS by a specified amount. Eliminates certain child care programs under SSA title IV part A, including the at-risk child care program. (Sec. 2104) Allows States to contract with charitable, religious, and private organizations to provide services and administer programs established or modified under titles I, II, and VI of this Act. Prohibits the expenditure of financial assistance under such programs for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization. (Sec. 2105) Directs the Secretary of Commerce to expand census data collection efforts to enable the Bureau of the Census to collect statistically significant data on grandparent caregivers. (Sec. 2106) Requires an HHS report to the Congress on State automated data processing systems used in administering SSA title IV part A programs to determine what would be required to establish a system for tracking public program participants and checking case records to determine if such participants are participating in public programs of two or more States. (Sec. 2107) Details requirements for a similar report, and study, on alternative outcomes measures for evaluating the success of the States in moving individuals off welfare through employment. (Sec. 2108) Establishes the Welfare Formula Fairness Commission to study and report to the Congress on the funding formulas applied, the bonus payments provided, and the work requirements established, under the TEA program. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 2109) Makes conforming amendments to SSA, the Food Stamp Act of 1977, and related provisions of other specified Federal laws. (Sec. 2112) Directs the Commissioner of Social Security (Commissioner) to: (1) develop a prototype counterfeit-resistant social security card; and (2) study and issue a report to the Congress with regard to improving the social security card application process.
