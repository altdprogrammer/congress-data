    "text": "Victims of Abuse Insurance Protection Act - Prohibits insurers and health carriers from engaging in specified acts (such as denying, terminating, or limiting coverage) on the basis that the applicant or insured (or any person with whom the applicant or insured is associated) is, has been, or may be the subject of abuse involving household or family members, current or former spouses, or individuals in or formerly in a sexually intimate relationship. Prohibits insurers from using, disclosing, or transferring information about an applicant's or insured's abuse status or abuse-related medical condition for any purpose unrelated to the direct provision of health care unless required by an order of an insurance regulatory entity, a court order, or abuse reporting laws. Requires an insurer that takes any adverse action relating to any plan or policy of an abuse subject (whether applicant or insured) to advise such individual of the specific reasons for the action. Regulates subrogation of claims resulting from abuse. Empowers the Federal Trade Commission to examine and investigate any insurer regarding compliance with this Act. Provides for a private cause of action against the insurer in Federal or State court by an abuse subject applicant or insured claiming to be adversely affected by an act or practice of the insurer."
