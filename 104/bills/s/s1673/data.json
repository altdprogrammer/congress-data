(Sec. 611) Authorizes the Secretary to reimburse board members of the DOD domestic dependent school system for travel and transportation expenses which include program and activity fees, when the Secretary determines that such programs and activities are reasonable and necessary for the performance of school board duties. (Sec. 612) Provides that, when a member of the armed forces is ordered to a foreign country and the laws of such country prohibit or restrict the entry of a motor vehicle, such member may elect to receive paid storage of such vehicle in lieu of the normal transportation allowance for such vehicle. (Sec. 613) Repeals a Federal provision prohibiting the payment of lodging expenses of a DOD civilian employee on official business away from home when adequate Government quarters are available. Subtitle D: Retired Pay, Survivor Benefits, and Related Matters - Makes March 1996 the effective date of an increase in military retired pay which became effective on December 1, 1995. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 to repeal a provision which provides a contingent alternative effective date for the military pay increase for FY 1998. (Sec. 616) States that the dependents of members of the Selected Reserve, like the members themselves, shall be permitted the use of certain morale, welfare, and recreation facilities of DOD on the same basis as members on active duty. Makes an identical allowance for dependents of members of the armed forces who would otherwise be eligible for military retired pay but for the fact that they are under 60 years of age. (Sec. 617) Repeals a Federal provision authorizing survivors of military personnel who die as a result of injury or illness incurred while serving on active duty in support of a contingency operation to receive a payment of all leave accrued.

(Sec. 621) Amends Federal provisions concerning the payment of military retired or retainer pay to survivors and dependents of military personnel to: (1) include facsimile or other electronic transmission as a valid service of process; (2) require a finding of proper jurisdiction before a court of one state can modify or alter an original court order from another state; and (3) provide that the effective date of the termination of retirement benefits for a person who has been sentenced by a court-martial shall be the date of discharge from the uniformed services. (Sec. 622) Requires (current law authorizes) the Secretary, and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard, to establish a program which assists eligible former military and Coast Guard personnel to obtain certification and licensure as elementary and secondary school teachers (known as the troops-to-teachers program). Reduces from five to two school years the period a former member must be employed as such a teacher after receiving such assistance. Reduces the amount required to be paid to the educational agency involved by the Secretary concerned representing a portion of the teacher salary. Makes similar changes with respect to current teacher placement programs for eligible separated civilian DOD employees and displaced DOD contractor employees. (Sec. 623) Allows a member whose travel to a new duty station is delayed by participation in a critical operational mission to defer such travel (for which a travel or transportation allowance is authorized) for up to one year after assignment to such mission. (Sec. 624) Authorizes the Secretary to pay to civilian DOD personnel performing overseas duty the same allowances and benefits authorized for members of the Foreign Service under the Foreign Service Act of 1980. Title VII: Health Care Provisions - Amends the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) to authorize the Secretary to pay amounts for covered services which are higher than prescribed limits when enrollees in managed care programs obtain covered services (currently, covered emergency services) from nonparticipating providers. (Sec. 702) Amends Federal provisions establishing the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship and Financial Assistance Program to provide alternative service obligations (currently, the only authorized alternative is assignment to health professional shortage areas) for Program participants relieved of their active duty service obligation under the Program.

(Sec. 703) Excludes officers assigned to duty in DOD from the limitation on the maximum number of commissioned officers of the Public Health Service authorized to serve on active duty. (Sec. 704) Repeals statutory restrictions on the use of DOD funds or facilities to perform abortions.

Authorizes the following for members described under (3), above: (1) the recovery, care, and disposition of remains; (2) eligibility for retirement pay upon separation due to disability after 30 days or less of active-duty service; (3) entitlement to basic pay; and (4) compensation for inactive-duty training. Title VIII: Acquisition and Related Matters - Repeals the defense procurement technical assistance cooperative agreement program. (Sec. 802) Authorizes the requisitioning and use of Government vehicles for the training and administration of the National Guard by the States, Territories, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. (Sec. 803) Amends the National Defense Authorization Act: (1) for Fiscal Year 1991 to extend through FY 1998 the pilot Mentor-Protege Program; and (2) for Fiscal Year 1994 to extend through FY 1999 the authority of the Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to carry out prototype activities directly relevant to weapons or weapon systems proposed to be acquired or developed by DOD. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a follow-on acquisition of any prototype or technology demonstrator developed in connection with such activities. (Sec. 805) Amends Federal provisions concerning the authority of the Secretary and the military department Secretaries to enter into transactions in order to carry out basic, applied, and advanced research projects to: (1) repeal a reporting requirement; and (2) state that certain proposals, business plans, or technical information submitted in anticipation of such projects will not be considered \"agency records\" for five years (and therefore will be considered confidential as proprietary data). (Sec. 806) Provides that any subdivision of appropriations made in this Act and hereafter under the heading \"Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy\" shall be considered to be for the same purpose as any subdivision under such heading in any prior year. (Sec. 807) Directs the Secretary to rely on the private sector for commercial or industrial type supplies and services for or beneficial to the accomplishment of authorized DOD functions, except when the Secretary determines that the function should be performed by government personnel. Empowers the Secretary to contract with private or non-government entities for the provision of such functions. Title IX: Organization and Management - Subtitle A: General Matters - Redesignates the North American Air Defense Command as the United States Element, North American Aerospace Defense Command.

(Sec. 903) Amends the Foreign Trade Zones Act to remove the Secretary of the Army from membership on the Foreign Trade Zone Board. Subtitle B: Financial Management - Establishes in DOD and each of the military departments an Environmental Restoration Account.
