    "text": "Prevention of Prisoner Double-Dipping Act - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to revise the limitation on the payment of OASDI benefits to prisoners and certain other inmates of publicly funded institutions. Extends such limitation to any individual confined in a jail, prison, or other penal institution or correctional facility pursuant to a felony charge, but only with respect to months after the first 30 days of such confinement. Requires the Commissioner of Social Security to study and report to the Congress on methods to insure the timely and accurate reporting of information respecting such public inmates with respect to current law limitations on OASDI and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits under SSA title XVI to them. Authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) contract with interested State or local institutions used to confine such individuals for monthly reports to the Commissioner of certain identifying information in order to enforce such benefit limitations; and (2) pay such an institution benefit amounts with respect to each eligible individual. Amends title XI of the Social Security Act to provide for civil monetary penalties, including quintuple damages for any OASDI and SSI benefits received, for fraudulent use of social security account numbers and cards. Authorizes additional appropriations for the Commissioner through the Office of Inspector General to use only for increasing the number of investigators and auditors charged with pursuing charges of fraud against the OASDI and SSI programs. Requires the Commissioner to study and report to the Congress on methods to streamline the review and appeals process under the OASDI and SSI programs."
