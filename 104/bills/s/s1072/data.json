Provides that in any prosecution thereof in which the threat or fear is based on bodily injury or property damage by a labor organization member or agent, the pendency, at the time of such conduct, of a labor dispute the outcome of which could result in the obtaining of employment benefits by such member or agent does not constitute prima facie evidence the property was obtained \"by\" such conduct."
