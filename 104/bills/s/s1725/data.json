    "text": "National Discovery Trails Act of 1996 - Amends the National Trails System Act to provide that national discovery trails established under the Act shall be components of the National Trails System. Provides that such trails shall be extended, continuous interstate trails located so as to provide for outdoor recreation and travel and to connect representative examples of America's trails and communities. Designates the 6,000-mile American Discovery Trail (established by this Act) as a national discovery trail. Provides that the Trail shall extend from Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware to Point Reyes National Seashore in California, traveling northern and southern routes from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Denver, Colorado. Exempts the Trail from comprehensive national scenic trail plan requirements under the Act, but requires the responsible nonprofit organization for the Trail to consult certain entities and submit to specified congressional committees, within three fiscal years after this Act's enactment, a comprehensive plan for the protection, management, development, and use of the Trail. Provides that the Secretary charged with the overall administration of National Scenic and National Historic Trails shall administer a National Discovery Trail in cooperation with a nonprofit organization."
