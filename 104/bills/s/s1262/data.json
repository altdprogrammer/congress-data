    "text": "Tobacco Products Control Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (with regard to cigarettes) and the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 (with regard to smokeless tobacco products) to make unlawful: (1) advertising on certain outdoor billboards; (2) advertising in publications having more than 15 percent of their total readership under 18 years old; (3) product placement (paid for by a manufacturer) as a prop in any general public motion picture; and (4) placement of a brand name or logo in a video, on a video game machine, or in a family amusement center. Amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit or reduce, starting in FY 1997, formula grants to States for prevention and treatment of substance abuse unless the State has a law: (1) prohibiting the sale or distribution of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18; (2) regulating in specified ways cigarette or smokeless tobacco product vending machines; and (3) prohibiting the distribution without charge of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products or the distribution of coupons redeemable for cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products. Allows amounts from the formula grants to be used to enforce such State laws. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to declare that nothing in the FDCA or any other Act shall provide the Food and Drug Administration with any authority to regulate in any manner tobacco or tobacco products."
