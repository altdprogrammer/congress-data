Title IV: Transfer and Disposal of Reserves - Subtitle A: Strategic Petroleum Reserve - Transfers to the Secretary of Defense all functions performed by the Secretary of Energy regarding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, including the Industrial Petroleum Reserve, the Early Storage Reserve, and the Regional Petroleum Reserve.

Prescribes procedural guidelines for Corps preparation and implementation of a Yucca Mountain site characterization plan. (Sec. 702) Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to reaffirm that the obligation of the Secretary of Energy to accept high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel beginning by January 31, 1998, is absolute and is not dependent on commencement of operation of a repository or a monitored retrievable storage facility.
