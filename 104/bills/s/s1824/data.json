Requires that the study: (1) determine the significance of the ranching use and pastoral character of the land and the significance of that use and character to the purposes for which the Park was established; and (2) identify any need and practicable means for preservation of the land that is necessary to protect that use and character. Requires the Secretary to: (1) reinstate, if necessary, and extend until June 1, 1997, the grazing permit under the same terms and conditions as were in effect before its expiration; and (2) cancel the extension with respect to any portion of the land that is disposed of in a manner that would result in it no longer being used for ranching or other agricultural purposes."
