Allows the networks to be statewide or regional. Specifies the services for which grant amounts must be used. Authorizes appropriations.

Involves the cooperative in matters such as third party reimbursement, employee health insurance, malpractice insurance, and managed care and practice standards. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes competitive grants to develop and implement a plan for mental health outreach programs in rural areas. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes grants to enable rural communities to provide stipends to physicians, nurses, or other health professional trainees to encourage such individuals to continue to provide health care services in such communities.
