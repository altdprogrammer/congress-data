Requires such corrected data to be published in 1995 and biennially thereafter. Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop or cause to be developed a State cost-of-living index which ranks and assigns an index value to each State using data on wage, housing, and other costs relevant to the cost of living; and (2) multiply the Federal Government's statistical poverty thresholds by the index value for each State's cost of living to produce State poverty thresholds for each State. Requires the State cost-of-living index and resulting State poverty thresholds to be published before September 30, 1996 for calendar year 1995 and to be updated annually thereafter."
