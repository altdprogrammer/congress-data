Directs the Attorney General, while such alien defendant is awaiting deportation, to take such alien into custody and not release such alien unless so permitted by order of the sentencing court. Prohibits the Attorney General, during the period such an alien defendant is to remain outside the United States as a condition of supervised release, from consenting to the alien's reentry."
