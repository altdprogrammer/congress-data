(Sec. 4) Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to require certain customs fees charged against merchandise imported from a foreign trade zone to be applied only to the value of the privileged or nonprivileged part of such merchandise. Declares that the similar application of such customs fees to imported U.S. agricultural products processed and packed in a foreign trade zone shall be effective to entries made on or after certain dates. (Sec. 6) Amends the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act and the Andean Trade Preference Act to declare that duty reductions for certain handbags, luggage, flat goods, work gloves, and leather wearing apparel shall not apply to textile and apparel articles subject to textile agreements. (Sec. 8) Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to authorize the United States Customs Service to extend the time for filing a drawback (refund) claim for duties for up to 18 months if a major disaster on or after January 1, 1994, prevented timely filing of such claim. (Sec. 9) Directs the Customs Service to provide for the liquidation or reliquidation (refund) of certain entries made at New York, New York, in accordance with the results of an administrative review, during the period from May 1, 1984, through March 31, 1985, by the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce (case number A-580-008). (Sec. 10) Amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to grant duty-free treatment, through February 1, 1999, of the personal effects of, and other equipment imported and used by, participants, their families and associated members, and officials involved in the 1998 Goodwill Games. (Sec. 13) Amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to declare that importers of civil aircraft that have been entered duty-free shall: (1) maintain such supporting documentation as the Secretary of the Treasury may require; and (2) be deemed to certify that such imported article is a civil aircraft, or has been imported for use in civil aircraft and will so be used. (Currently, importers must file a statement, along with the supporting documentation, with the appropriate customs officer stating that such article is and will be used as a civil aircraft, or that it has been imported for use in civil aircraft, and that it has been approved for such use by the Federal Aviation Administration.) (Sec. 15) Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to provide that certain marking requirements with respect to imported articles and containers shall not apply to: (1) certain coffee and tea products; and (2) spice products. (Sec. 16) Amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to grant duty-free treatment to certain imported silver and gold bars. Provides for staged rate reductions for specified items. (Sec. 17) Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to repeal the mandate for the East-West Trade Statistics Monitoring System. (Sec. 18) Revises requirements for the retroactive electronic filing (reconciliation) of entries with the Customs Service.
