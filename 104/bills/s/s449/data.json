    "text": "Illinois Land Conservation Act of 1995 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) to establish the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie (MNP) to consist of portions of the Joliet Army Ammunition Plant (Arsenal) in Illinois and to be managed as part of the National Forest System. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) roads, utility rights-of-way, and access within the MNP; (2) agricultural leases and special use authorizations; (3) user fees; (4) salvage of improvements; (5) treatment of user fees and salvage receipts; and (6) cooperation with States, local governments, and other entities. Requires the Secretary of the Army to transfer the Arsenal property constituting the MNP, without reimbursement, to the Secretary. Permits the transfer of portions only for which no further action is required under environmental law and that have been eliminated from the areas to be studied further pursuant to the Defense Environmental Restoration Program for the Arsenal. Requires the Secretary of the Army to retain jurisdiction, authority, and control over real property at the Arsenal that is used for: (1) water treatment; (2) the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous substances or petroleum products or derivatives; and (3) response purposes or actions required under an environmental law to remediate contamination or noncompliance. Directs the Secretary of the Army to convey certain Arsenal property to: (1) the Department of Veterans Affairs to be used for a national cemetery; (2) the county of Will, Illinois, to be used for a landfill; and (3) the village of Elwood, Illinois, and the city of Wilmington, Illinois, to be used for industrial parks. Provides that use of such landfill by Federal agencies or additional acreage added for purposes of accommodating the disposal of materials from the restoration of the Arsenal shall be at no cost to the Federal Government. Requires such property to revert to the Secretary for inclusion in the MNP if the property is not operated as a landfill. Provides for the conveyance of specified other Arsenal property to be added to the MNP subject to the Secretary's acceptance. Directs the Secretary of the Army, with respect to the real property at the Arsenal, to remain liable for and continue to carry out all: (1) response actions required under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and all remediation actions required under other environmental laws at or related to the property; and (2) actions required under other environmental laws to remediate petroleum products or their derivatives. Requires the Secretary of the Army to retain any obligation or liability at the Arsenal that he or she had under CERCLA and other environmental laws."
