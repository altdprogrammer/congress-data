Requires any State submitting a report with an increase of five percent or more in its child poverty rate from the previous report to submit to the Secretary, for acceptance or rejection, a corrective action plan outlining the manner in which it will implement appropriate reductions in its child poverty rate until such time as the Secretary determines that the rate for the State involved has fallen to certain levels. Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations establishing the methodology by which States determine child poverty rates."
