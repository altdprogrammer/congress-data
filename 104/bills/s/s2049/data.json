    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Limited Sessions Title II: Two-Year Budgeting Budget Process and Oversight Reform Act of 1996 - Title I: Limited Sessions - Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to repeal provisions with respect to congressional adjournments. Allows a sine die adjournment of the Congress on any date provided by it in each odd-numbered calendar year. Requires such adjournment by July 31 in each even-numbered calendar year with the exception that the Congress may remain in session after such date, only if: (1) a state of war exists pursuant to a declaration of war by the Congress; or (2) it enacts a concurrent stating the necessity of remaining in session to enact legislation relating to a natural disaster, an increase in the public debt limit, or appropriations to provide for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property. (Sec. 102) Prohibits each Member of Congress, during any calendar year of the first session of a Congress, from receiving pay for any period after September 30 if the Congress has not completed action on reconciliation legislation and biennial appropriation bills in accordance with the timetable under provisions of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Excludes a calendar year in which the first congressional session continues from the preceding calendar year. Imposes such prohibition for the second session of a Congress for any period after July 31 during which it has not adjourned sine die in accordance with such timetable unless it remains in session because of a war or an emergency pursuant to this Act. Excludes a calendar year in which the second congressional session continues from the preceding calendar year or any period of a third congressional session. Provides that such pay not received shall be forfeited and shall not be payable at any later time. Sets forth provisions with respect to adjustments if necessary in withholdings and deductions for life and health insurance coverage for Members of Congress during the first and second congressional session to provide for the payment of employee contributions for the entire calendar year, as applicable. Provides that: (1) nothing in this Act shall result in the lapse of such coverage for any Member of Congress; and (2) any period of a calendar year in which the Member does not receive such pay shall not be a period of creditable service and shall not be construed as a separation from service. Title II: Two-Year Budgeting - Biennial Budgeting Act of 1996 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and other Federal law to revise the Federal and congressional budget processes by establishing a two-year budgeting and appropriations cycle and timetable. Defines the budget biennium as the two consecutive fiscal years beginning on October 1 of any odd-numbered year. (Sec. 203) Devotes the first session of any Congress to the budget resolution and to appropriations decisions, retaining current deadlines in most cases. Changes certain deadlines to conform to the biennial scheme. Devotes each second session to authorization activity, subject to specified deadlines. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to issue four-year projections of congressional budget action. (Current projections are on a five-year basis.) Revises the reconciliation process to: (1) increase from 20 to 100 hours the time of debate permitted in the Senate with respect to reconciliation measures; and (2) make it out of order in both the House and the Senate to consider any reconciliation legislation changing any provision of law other than one relating to new budget or spending authority, revenues, or the public debt limit. (Sec. 205) Conforms provisions governing the President's budget to the biennial framework. (Sec. 206) Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to conform to the biennial framework. (Sec. 207) Terminates, effective October 1, 1997, spending authority for each discretionary spending program unless it is reauthorized after the date of enactment of this Act. Makes it out of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, or conference report that includes any provision that appropriates funds unless such appropriation has been previously authorized by law. Allows the requirements of this section to be waived or suspended in the House of Representatives or the Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members."
