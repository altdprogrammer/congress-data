    "text": "National Heritage Act of 1995 - Establishes within the Department of the Interior a National Heritage Areas Partnership Program to assist the Secretary of the Interior in: (1) evaluating areas nominated under this Act for designation as a national heritage area (area); (2) advising State and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and other appropriate entities regarding suitable methods of recognizing and conserving thematically and geographically linked natural, historic, and cultural resources and recreational opportunities; and (3) making grants to units of government and nonprofit organizations to prepare feasibility studies, compacts, and management plans in accordance with the purposes, criteria, conditions, and requirements of this Act. Outlines criteria for designation as an area, including the presence of: (1) a distinctive assemblage of natural, historic, cultural, or recreational resources; (2) unique traditions, customs, beliefs, or folklife; (3) opportunities for conserving such unique resources; and (4) recreational and educational opportunities. Allows an area to be so designated only by an Act of Congress after submission of a feasibility study, compact, and statement of the relevant Governor's approval to the Secretary. (Sec. 6) Requires each: (1) compact to include information relating to the objectives and management of an area proposed for designation; and (2) plan to present comprehensive recommendations for the conservation, funding, management, and development of the area. Requires a management entity to develop and submit to the Secretary the plan and to set priorities in the compact and plan for the area. Provides that if a plan is not submitted within three years after designation as an area, the area shall be ineligible for technical assistance under this Act. Allows an area with a timely plan to receive technical assistance for a seven-year period beginning on the date of designation. Provides procedures for the withdrawal of such designation. (Sec. 9) Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance and grants to units of government and private nonprofit organizations for feasibility studies, compacts, and, upon the request of a management entity, management plans and their implementation. Provides for oversight by the Secretary of areas with expired eligibility. (Sec. 12) Authorizes appropriations. Limits technical assistance and grants to 75 percent of the cost of a study, compact, or plan. Limits total and annual funding for an area. Terminates the authorities contained in this Act on September 30 of the 15th fiscal year after the date of enactment of this Act. (Sec. 14) Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on the status of the Program as a whole."
