    "text": "Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1996 - Amends the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 to revise and expand the guidelines under which the authorities of the Secretary of the Interior regarding oil and gas receipts collected on lease obligations may be delegated to a State upon its request. Provides for judicial review of any Secretarial action to approve or disapprove a State proposal. (Sec. 4) Sets a seven-year statute of limitations for any judicial proceeding or demand arising from a royalty obligation. Prescribes procedural guidelines for Secretarial and delegated States' actions and limitation periods, including royalty adjustments and refunds. (Sec. 6) Sets forth royalty terms, interest, and penalties, and assessments. (Sec. 7) Prescribes procedural guidelines under which the Secretary and the State concerned shall jointly determine on a case by case basis the amount of what production from marginal properties shall be subject to prepayment or regulatory relief. Permits the Secretary's sole determination if the royalty payments are not shared with any State. (Sec. 8) Renders inapplicable except to Indian leases: (1) the current statute of limitations governing the recovery of penalties; and (2) the Secretary's authority to enter into cooperative agreements with any State (or Indian tribe) with respect to oil or gas royalty activities. Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to repeal the guidelines governing refunds or credit granted to a lessee for excess payments. (Sec. 9) Excludes Indian lands and privately owned minerals from the purview of this Act."
