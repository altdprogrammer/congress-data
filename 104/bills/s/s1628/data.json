(Sec. 2) Requires any controversy or dispute arising out of the appropriate fee to be paid for the user's past or future performance of nondramatic musical works in the repertoire of a performing rights society (PRS) to be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association. Outlines provisions: (1) requiring the confidentiality of arbitration findings; (2) limiting the length of time that the finding of an appropriate fee shall apply; (3) requiring a PRS to make available to all interested persons access to copyright and licensing information for each nondramatic musical work in its repertoire; and (4) requiring a PRS to make available a printed directory of each title in its repertoire. Provides restrictions for PRSs not in compliance with such requirements. (Sec. 3) Requires each PRS to offer to any radio broadcaster that so requests a per programming period license (license) to perform nondramatic musical works in the repertoire of the PRS. Outlines provisions: (1) determining the price of each such license; (2) providing for the determination of the performance of nondramatic musical works by a broadcaster under any such license; and (3) enforcing a broadcaster's right to apply for and receive such a license. (Sec. 4) Exempts from copyright infringement the transmission of religious services, or the recording of a program embodying such services in their entirety, if there is no commercial advertisement or commercial sponsor within such program. (Sec. 5) Defines \"performing rights society,\" \"general music user,\" and \"loudspeaker\" for purposes of the copyright laws."
