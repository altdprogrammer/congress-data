    "text": "Foreign Bank Enforcement Act of 1996 - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act with respect to the penalty for unauthorized participation in an insured depository institution by an individual with a criminal conviction involving dishonesty. Revises the exception for individuals who have received the prior written consent of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to allow the prior written consent of any appropriate Federal banking authority. Amends the International Banking Act of 1978 to: (1) cite circumstances under which certain Federal bank regulatory agencies shall not be compelled to disclose information obtained from a foreign supervisor; and (2) authorize an order to terminate foreign bank offices in the United States issued by either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Comptroller of the Currency to contain appropriate terms and conditions. Amends Federal criminal procedure to authorize a court to: (1) direct disclosure of matters occurring before a grand jury during an investigation of a banking law violation to identified personnel of a State as well as a Federal financial institution regulatory agency; and (2) issue such an order at any time during or after completion of the investigation of the grand jury upon a finding of substantial need."
