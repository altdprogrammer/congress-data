Requires that implementation of the Act be through EPA. Eliminates requirements for a Director and a minimum number of staff. Allows activities to be carried out through grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts. Reduces the percentage of funds to be obligated for environmental education grants of not more than $5,000. Prohibits use of grants for certain lobbying activities. Eliminates provisions for environmental internships and fellowships. Eliminates environmental education awards provided for under such Act, except the President's Environmental Youth Awards. Revises requirements for membership on the National Environmental Education Advisory Council. Revises requirements for membership on the Federal Task Force on Environmental Education to require that it be open to representatives of any Federal agency actively engaged in environmental education. (Under current law, membership must include specified agency representatives.) Eliminates specific requirements for contents of Advisory Council reports. Changes the name of the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation to the Foundation for Environmental Education. Increases the size of the Board of the Directors. Replaces the prohibition on transmission of logos or other means of identification on donated educational materials with a provision that allows the Foundation to acknowledge receipt of donations by means of listing of donor names but prohibits such acknowledgment from: (1) appearing in materials presented to students; or (2) identifying a donor by means of a logo or other corporate commercial symbol, slogan, or product. Authorizes appropriations. Revises funding limitations. Limits amounts available for administrative costs."
