Includes as eligible a project for a route proposed for inclusion in the National Highway System or of regional significance for which the United States is or becomes, before September 30, 1996, obligated to pay and with respect to which the Mayor of the District certifies that sufficient funds are not available to pay the full non-Federal share of costs. Requires the District, by September 30, 1996, to repay the amount of any increased Federal share paid for a project by the United States or such amount will be deducted from the funds apportioned or allocated to the District for the category of the project for FY 1997. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to report to specified congressional committee on: (1) each project for which an increased Federal share has been paid; and (2) any specific cause of delay in the rate of the availability of obligation of such funds."
