    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Senate Election Spending Limits and Benefits Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions Senate Campaign Spending Limit and Election Reform Act of 1995 - Title I: Senate Election Spending Limits and Benefits - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) to set forth Senate election voluntary spending limits and benefits, including primary and runoff expenditure limits and primary and general election filing requirements. Sets limits on the use of personal funds and general election expenditures. Entitles complying candidates to specified broadcast discounts and free time and postage reductions. Directs the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to certify each candidate's eligibility for free broadcast time under the Communications Act of 1934 within 48 hours after a candidate qualifies for a general election ballot. Sets forth provisions regarding FEC determinations, excess payments and revocation of status, and civil penalties for misuse of benefits. (Sec. 103) Amends the Communications Act to: (1) provide for preemption only in situations beyond a station's control; and (2) extend the license revocation provision for failure to provide access to cable systems. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends FECA to require a candidate, after qualifying for the primary, to declare if he or she intends to spend more than $250,000 of his or her own funds (i.e., personal funds, funds of the candidate's immediate family, and personal loans incurred by the candidate and the candidate's family in connection with the election campaign) in the election and if so, raises the contribution limits on his or her opponent from $1,000 to $5,000. Removes his or her opponents' contribution limit entirely if a candidate declares that he or she will spend more than $1 million of his or her own funds. (Sec. 202) Prohibits the personal use of campaign funds. (Sec. 203) Sets forth political advertising provisions for print broadcast or cablecast communications."
