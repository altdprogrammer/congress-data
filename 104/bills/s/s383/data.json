Directs the Secretary of Defense to develop for deployment at the earliest practicable date: (1) a cost- and operationally-effective ABM system; and (2) advanced TMDs. Requires a plan with respect to the deployment of such systems to be submitted to specified congressional committees within 60 days after the enactment of this Act."
