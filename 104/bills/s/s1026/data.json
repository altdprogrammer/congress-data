(Sec. 237) Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) it is vital to U.S. national security interests that the United States defend itself from the threat of a limited, accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile attack; (2) the deployment of a national missile defense system strengthens strategic stability and deterrence; (3) the Senate should undertake a comprehensive review of the continuing value and validity of the ABM Treaty, and recommend additional policy guidance on the future application of such Treaty; and (4) the Senate Committee of Foreign Relations, upon completion of such review, should report its findings to the Senate. (Sec. 238) Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) unless a missile defense system is flight tested against a ballistic missile target that exceeds a specified range or velocity, such system will neither be considered to have been tested in an ABM mode nor considered capable of countering strategic ballistic missiles; and (2) any international agreement that would limit the RDT&E of missile defense systems in a more restrictive manner shall be entered into only pursuant to the treaty making powers of the President under the Constitution. Prohibits, with specified exceptions, the use of any funds authorized to DOD during FY 1995 to implement an agreement with any of the independent states of the former Soviet Union entered into after January 1, 1995, that would establish a demarcation between theater missile defense systems and anti-ballistic missile systems for purposes of the ABM Treaty or that would restrict the performance, operation, or deployment of U.S. theater missile defense systems. (Sec. 238) States that, until a missile or air defense system is flight-tested in an ABM-qualifying flight test, such system, upgrade, or component: (1) has not been tested in an ABM mode, for Treaty purposes; and (2) is therefore not subject to Treaty application, limitation, or obligation. Prohibits appropriated funds from being expended or obligated by any Government official to apply such Treaty to RDT&E or deployment of such non-qualifying air or missile defense systems. Ceases the application of such prohibition when a system is flight tested in an ABM-qualifying manner. Requires the Secretary to annually certify to the Congress that no U.S. air or missile defense system is being constrained by the ABM Treaty in a manner inconsistent with this section. Finds that ballistic missile range and velocity parameters should be subject to the Senate's review under section 237.
