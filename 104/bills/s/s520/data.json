    "text": "Adoption Assistance for Families Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an income tax credit for up to $5,000 of qualified adoption expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year. Sets forth a formula for reduction of such credit for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income exceeds $60,000. Denies such a credit for any expense for which a deduction or credit is allowable under another Code provision. Defines \"qualified adoption expenses\" as reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney's fees, and other lawful expenses directly related to legal adoption of a child, but not any expenses paid from any funds received under a Federal, State, or local program. Disqualifies for such a credit any expenses in connection with the adoption of a child of the taxpayer's spouse."
