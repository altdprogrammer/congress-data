States that certain of such lands shall be added to the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge and the Kenai Wilderness.

Specifies that such withdrawal: (1) shall not include any validly selected land by Alaska or Alaska Native Corporation, or any lands that the Secretary determines has mineral potential based on surveys conducted or to be conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey; and (2) shall not occur until the Secretary has complied with specified FLPMA (Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976) requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to study the remaining lands within the area for future potential withdrawal pursuant to the FLPMA. Provides that such designation is subject to all valid existing rights, including R.S. 2477 Rights-of- Way. Authorizes appropriations."
