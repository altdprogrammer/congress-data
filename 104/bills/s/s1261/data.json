    "text": "Foreign Trust Tax Compliance Act of 1995 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise the requirements regarding information that must be reported regarding certain foreign trusts. (Sec. 3) Modifies the circumstances (with regard to foreign trusts having one or more U.S. beneficiaries) in which a transferor is treated as the owner. (Sec. 4) Replaces provisions setting forth a special rule applicable to foreign grantors with provisions declaring that provisions relating to treating grantors and others as substantial owners shall apply only when that application results in an amount being currently taken into account in computing the income of a U.S. citizen or resident or a domestic corporation. (Sec. 5) Requires a United States person to report information regarding foreign gifts or bequests when the gifts' aggregate value during a taxable year exceeds $10,000. (Sec. 6) Modifies requirements regarding the interest charge on accumulation distributions from foreign trusts. (Sec. 7) Changes the circumstances in which an estate or trust is included in the definition of \"United States person.\" Modifies the definition of \"foreign estate\" and \"foreign trust.\" Requires (for provisions relating to the imposition of a tax on transfers to avoid income tax) treating a trust which is not a foreign trust and which becomes a foreign trust as having transferred, immediately before becoming a foreign trust, all of its assets to a foreign trust."
