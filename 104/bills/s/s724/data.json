Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) application requirements; (2) minimum amounts allocated to qualifying States; (3) performance evaluations; and (4) technical assistance and training. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to make a compensating reduction of the authorization of appropriations from Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants. Directs the Administrator to submit to the Congress a report regarding the possible use of performance-based criteria in evaluating and improving the effectiveness of juvenile corrections facilities and programs."
