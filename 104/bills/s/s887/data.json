    "text": "Investigations into Terrorism Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit knowingly falsifying or concealing a material fact or making any false statements or representations on any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch or any department, agency, committee, subcommittee, or office thereof, except a court when performing an adjudicative function (currently, such prohibition applies to any matter within the jurisdiction of any U.S. department or agency). Prohibits the obstruction of any U.S. department or agency proceeding or any congressional investigation by acting with an improper purpose, personally or by influencing another, including by making false or misleading statements or withholding, concealing, altering, or destroying documents. Amends the Federal judicial code to limit the exemption of an officer or employee of the Federal Government acting within an official capacity from U.S. district court jurisdiction to enforce a Senate subpoena or order to instances where the head of such person's department or agency, with the approval of the Attorney General, has directed the officer not to comply with the subpoena and has provided the issuer of the subpoena with a written explanation of the reasons for noncompliance. Provides for a U.S. district court to order an individual to provide information which he or she refuses to provide on the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination in proceedings ancillary to either House of Congress (currently, such authority applies only to proceedings before either House)."
