Authorizes the President to transmit a draft bill to the Congress with such a proposal that clearly identifies the budget authority that is proposed to be rescinded. Requires the reduction of discretionary spending limits and the adjustment of committee allocations not later than five days after the date of enactment of a bill containing rescissions of budget authority. Establishes expedited procedures in the Senate and the House of Representatives for consideration of such bill. Grants the President the authority to direct that any budget authority proposed to be rescinded in the special message not be available for obligation for a period not to exceed 45 calendar days from the date the President transmits such message. Excepts from such budget authority the funding of direct spending programs and budget authority provided for social security. Authorizes the President to propose the repeal of any targeted tax benefit in the same manner as the proposal of rescissions of budget authority under this Act."
