Limits the percentage of funds for the CBERO that may be used for administrative expenses. Mandates a program of investigations regarding diseases of the eastern oyster and oysters in coastal U.S. waters, with emphasis on the Chesapeake Bay. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to operate (as well as establish) the CBERO. Authorizes the CBERO's Director to transfer funds to another Federal agency or provide financial assistance to a State or political subdivision agency for conducting research, assessment, monitoring, data management, or outreach."
