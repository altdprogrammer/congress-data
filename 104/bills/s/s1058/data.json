    "text": "Comprehensive Torture Victims Relief Act - Prohibits the U.S. Government from expelling, extraditing, or involuntarily returning an individual to a country if there is substantial evidence that the individual would fear subjection to torture. Allows any alien presenting a credible claim of having been tortured in the alien's country of nationality (or, in the case of an alien having no nationality, that country in which the alien last habitually resided) and who applies for refugee status, asylum, or withholding of deportation under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to be processed in accordance with this Act. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) consideration by appropriate officials of the effects of torture; (2) expedited processing of refugee admissions and for asylum and withholding of deportation; and (3) parole in lieu of detention. Directs the Attorney General, other officials of the Department of Justice, and the Secretary of State to provide training for immigration officials and consular officers regarding the identification of evidence of torture, the circumstances surrounding torture, the long-term effects and the physical, cognitive, and emotional effects of torture, and the appropriate manner of interviewing torture victims. Directs the National Institutes of Health to study and report to specified congressional committees with respect to the estimated number and geographic distribution, needs, and availability of services of refugees and asylum-seekers admitted to the United States since October 1, 1987, who were tortured abroad. Amends the INA to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide grants to programs in the United States to cover the cost of specified services for torture victims. Authorizes the appropriation of funds to assist domestic centers and programs for the treatment of torture victims. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to provide grants to treatment centers and programs in foreign countries which are specifically carrying out projects or activities to treat victims of torture. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes appropriations to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture for FY 1996 through 1997."
