    "text": "Small Business Lending Enhancement Act of 1995 - Amends the Small Business Act to reduce the level of participation by the Small Business Administration (SBA) in loans guaranteed under the Act on a deferred basis to: (1) 75 percent of the outstanding balance, if the balance exceeds $100,000; and (2) 80 percent of such balance, for balances less than or equal to $100,000. Allows such percentages to be reduced upon request of the participating lender. Prohibits the SBA from using the percentage requested as a criterion for establishing priorities in approving guarantee requests. Limits the maximum interest rate under the Preferred Lenders Program to that charged for other loan guarantees under the Act. Increases the loan guarantee fees authorized to be charged by the SBA on all guaranteed loans payable over a period in excess of one year. Establishes a fee of two percent of the total deferred participation share of loans of $80,000 or less. Repeals provisions allowing participating lenders providing loans of less than $75,000 to retain a portion of the loan guarantee fee charged by the SBA. Directs the SBA to assess and collect an annual fee, to be payable by the participating lender and not charged to the borrower, in an aggregate amount equal to 0.5 percent of the outstanding balance of the deferred participation share of the loan. Directs the SBA to notify the congressional small business committees at least 15 days before making any significant policy or administrative change affecting the operation of the SBA loan program. Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to direct the SBA, with respect to each guaranteed loan made from the proceeds of development company debentures issued by qualified State or local development companies, to: (1) assess and collect a fee for such loan, payable by the borrower; and (2) use the fee proceeds to offset the cost of making such loan guarantees. Amends the Small Business Administration Reauthorization and Amendment Act of 1988 to extend through FY 1997 the preferred surety bond guarantee pilot program."
