    "text": "National Grasslands Management Act of 1996 - Amends the Forest Rangeland Renewable Resource Planning Act of 1974 to remove the National Grasslands and land utilization projects administered under title III of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act (such Act) from the National Forest System (NFS). Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, to manage the National Grasslands as a separate entity and in accordance with this Act and the provisions and multiple use purposes of such Act. Requires the Secretary to administer grazing permits and implement grazing management decisions in consultation, cooperation, and coordination with local grazing associations and other grazing permits. Requires fees and charges for livestock grazing on the National Grasslands to be determined in the same manner and according to the same formula that was used for such grazing during the 1996 grazing year. Allows the Secretary to adjust the grazing fee to compensate for approved conservation practices and administrative expenditures."
