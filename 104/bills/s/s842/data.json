    "text": "Individual Accountability Act of 1995 - Amends title IV part A (Aid to Families With Dependent Children) (AFDC) of the Social Security Act to replace the AFDC program with a plan that consolidates and funnels funding directly to the States (\"block grants\"), provided that: (1) adult beneficiaries of the State assistance programs work; and (2) specified State child support and paternity establishment programs are in operation. Limits the amount of the block grants, prohibits the use of funds for medical services, and permits the redirection of a specified percentage of a State's funds for: (1) supplemental security income for the aged, blind, and disabled; (2) medical assistance programs; (3) food assistance; and (4) elementary and secondary education. Establishes specified accounting and reporting requirements, and requires that the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General alone supervise and regulate the administration of the block grants. Requires that State assistance be administered without discrimination on the basis of disability, sex, race, color, or national origin. Makes religious groups eligible to provide assistance to the needy using block grant funds so long as they do not deny assistance benefits on the basis of religion. Prohibits certain State and Federal requirements with respect to such religious organizations."
