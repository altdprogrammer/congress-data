Title I: General Provisions - Revises IDEA to declare that the right to equal educational opportunities for all children with disabilities is guaranteed by the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the Constitution. (Sec. 103) Allows the Office of Special Education Programs to accept voluntary and uncompensated services. (Sec. 104) Revises requirements for: (1) prescribing regulations; (2) eligibility for financial assistance; and (3) discretionary grant programs. Requires the Secretary of Education to develop and implement a comprehensive plan for activities under titles IV and V of this Act. Provides for specified enhanced services to children with disabilities. Lists entities eligible for awards. Authorizes the Secretary to limit, without rulemaking, competitions to projects that give priority to one or more targeted areas, if each project addresses the needs of children with disabilities and their families. Provides for application management, including a peer review process. Authorizes the Secretary to use certain funds for: (1) payments to non-federal entities for administrative support; (2) Federal employees to monitor projects; and (3) evaluation of program activities carried out under these programs. (Sec. 107) Repeals IDEA provisions for: (1) acquisition of equipment and construction of necessary facilities; and (2) grants for the removal of architectural barriers. Title II: Assistance for Education of All Children with Disabilities - Revises entitlements and allocations for assistance for education of all children with disabilities. (Sec. 201) Authorizes States to determine whether to make subgrants smaller than a specified minimum amount to some local education agencies (LEAs). (Sec. 202) Revises and consolidates State eligibility and planning provisions. Provides that a child with a disability who qualifies for special education does not have to be classified by a specific impairment or condition. Requires the State educational agency (SEA) to: (1) examine data to determine if significant racial disproportionality is occurring in the identification or placement of children under IDEA; and (2) review and revise policies accordingly. Provides that, if a hearing officer agrees with the parents' unilateral placement of a child with a disability in a private school, the LEA may be required to reimburse the parents. Requires a non-educational agency, if it is responsible for services necessary to ensure a free appropriate public education for children with disabilities, to pay for or provide such services directly or by contract or other arrangements. Requires States to: (1) ensure that interagency agreements or other mechanisms are in effect between educational agencies and non-educational agencies for defining respective financial responsibilities, resolving interagency disputes, and interagency coordination; and (2) establish a mechanism by which LEAs may seek reimbursement from agencies for the costs of providing related services. Revises requirements for a comprehensive system of personnel development. Allows LEAs to use appropriately trained and supervised paraprofessionals. Requires States to: (1) establish performance goals and indicators for children with disabilities; (2) ensure that these children participate in general State and district-wide assessments, with appropriate accommodations, where necessary; and (3) develop guidelines for participation in alternative assessments for those children who cannot participate in such general State and district-wide assessments. Consolidates funding and public participation requirements. Revises requirements for State advisory panels and their duties. Repeals requirements for three-year State plans. (Sec. 203) Revises LEA and SEA eligibility and maintenance of effort requirements, with specified exceptions. Allows specified activities, regardless of certain excess cost and noncommingling of funds requirements, including: (1) incidental benefits to non-disabled students; (2) simultaneous services on a space-available basis to non-IDEA-eligible children with disabilities protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (RA); (3) a coordinated services system that links education, health, and social welfare services, systems, and entities to improve educational and transitional results for all children and their families; and (4) a school-based improvement plan.
