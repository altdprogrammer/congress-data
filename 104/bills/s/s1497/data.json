Requires the Administrator to conduct a study of hazardous waste managed in accordance with this Act to characterize the risks to human health or the environment associated with such management, upon completion of which the Administrator may impose additional requirements or defer management of such risks to other State or Federal programs or authorities. Amends SWDA to exempt from land disposal restrictions solid waste identified as hazardous based on characteristic alone if the waste no longer exhibits a hazardous characteristic at the point of injection into any Class I deep well regulated under safe drinking water provisions of the Public Health Service Act."
