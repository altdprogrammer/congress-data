Limits the Federal share to 25 percent of the total cost of a project (with an exception of up to 50 percent of the cost of any feasibility study). Authorizes the Secretary to participate in the design, planning, and construction of the Long Beach Desalination and Research Development Project in Los Angeles County, California, and the Las Vegas Area Shallow Aquifer Desalination Research and Development Project in Clark County, Nevada. Limits the Federal share of project costs to 50 percent. Prohibits the Secretary from providing operation and maintenance funds for any of such projects. Prohibits funds from being appropriated for the construction of any project authorized under this Act until a feasibility study has been completed and the Secretary has determined that the non-Federal project sponsor is financially capable of funding its share of project costs."
