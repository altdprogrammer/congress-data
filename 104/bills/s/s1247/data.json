Allows the deduction whether or not the individual itemizes deductions. Excludes employer-provided coverage under an accident or health plan from the gross income of an employee. Amends Federal law to allow a Government contribution to be made under the Federal Employees Health Benefits program for both a medical savings account and a catastrophic health plan."
