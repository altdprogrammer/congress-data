    "text": "Aviation Security Act of 1996 - Amends Federal aviation law to direct the Secretary of Transportation to provide for the enhancement of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aviation security programs, including: (1) the development of more stringent procedures for the screening of cargo and checked baggage; (2) the development of a methodology to profile the types of passengers, cargo, and air transportation that present a significant degree of risk to aviation security, including improved methods for matching and searching luggage or other cargo; (3) the deployment of explosive detection equipment in airports; (4) the establishment of a program for enhancing the screening and training of air carrier personnel (and subcontractors), including requiring employment security and criminal history checks on such personnel; and (5) the development of performance-based measures for all security functions covered by this Act. Directs the President to establish, within the appropriate Federal agency, the Office of Family Advocate, which shall develop standards of conduct for informing and supporting families of victims of aircraft accidents. Directs the Secretary to assess a fee against each airline passenger, which shall be deposited into a new Aviation Security Account, established by this Act to fund aviation security enhancement activities."
