Allows waiver or suspension of such point of order under certain circumstances. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General, before the end of each fiscal year, to take certain joint actions to ensure the financial integrity of the trust fund against any expenditures from any account established to combat health care waste, fraud, and abuse which do not relate to the administration of the Medicare program."
