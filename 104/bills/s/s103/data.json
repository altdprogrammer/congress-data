    "text": "Lost Creek Land Exchange Act of 1995 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire certain lands owned by the Brand S Corporation and located in the Lost Creek area of the Deerlodge National Forest and within the Gallatin National Forest (to be added to and administered as part of such National Forests) in exchange for certain lands within such National Forests and specified timber rights on Deerlodge National Forest lands. Exempts the Wineglass Tract from such exchange unless measures are in place to protect the scenic, wildlife, and open space values of the Tract. Directs the Secretary to improve legal public road access to Gallatin National Forest System lands between West Pine Creek and Big Creek. Prohibits the Secretary from acquiring lands under this Act if it is determined that such lands have become contaminated with hazardous substances. Releases the United States from any responsibility or liability with respect to hazardous wastes or other substances placed on any of the lands covered by this Act after their transfer to the ownership of another party. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed as either diminishing or increasing any U.S. responsibility or liability based on the condition of such lands on the date of such transfer."
