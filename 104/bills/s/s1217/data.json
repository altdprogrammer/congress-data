Deems the professional to have provided the service without compensation only if, prior to furnishing the care, the professional: (1) agrees to furnish the service without charge to any person, including any insurance or program covering the recipient; and (2) provides the recipient with notice of the limited liability. Preempts inconsistent State laws, but not State laws providing greater incentives or protections to the professional."
