Prescribes guidelines for interest rates for new capital investments. Amends the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Settlement Act to appropriate specified amounts to the Administrator in certain fiscal years so long as the Administrator makes annual payments to the Tribes under a certain settlement agreement. Directs the Administrator to offer to include provisions in future electric power service contracts that preclude further increases in the principal amount or interest rate obligations to the Government."
