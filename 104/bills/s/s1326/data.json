    "text": "Repeals provisions of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1993 which amended the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act with respect to applicable State workers' compensation laws. Amends the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSAWPA) to make State workers' compensation laws, which are applicable to and provide coverage for a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker, the exclusive remedy for actual damages for loss from an injury or death of such a worker, for all cases in which a final judgment has not been entered. Provides that this does not preclude recovery under such Act for statutory damages or relief (except that such relief may not include back or front pay or in any manner expand or otherwise alter or affect a recovery or rights conferred under a State workers' compensation law. Increases statutory damages under MSAWPA under certain limited circumstances. Provides for tolling of the statute of limitations on actions brought under MSAWPA during the time period in which a claim under State workers' compensation was pending. Requires disclosure of information regarding workers' compensation coverage to migrant or seasonal agricultural workers. Directs the Secretary of Labor to determine, considering specified factors, the level of liability insurance required of employers engaged in transportation of migrant or seasonal agricultural workers."
