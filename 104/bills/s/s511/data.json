    "text": "Regulatory Sunset and Review Act of 1995 - Provides that the effectiveness of a regulation issued by a Federal agency shall terminate on the applicable termination date (specified in this Act) unless the head of the agency: (1) reviews the regulation; (2) submits a preliminary report on findings and proposed recommendations; (3) reviews and considers comments regarding the preliminary report that are transmitted to the agency by the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget and by appropriate congressional committees; and (4) submits to the President, the Administrator, and the Congress and publishes a final report on the review and a notice extending the effectiveness of the regulation, with or without modifications, within a specified time frame. Sets forth termination dates of regulations (seven years after this Act's enactment for existing regulations, three years after the regulation takes effect for new regulations, and seven years after publication of a notice for an extension for a regulation that is extended under this Act). Provides for temporary extensions. Requires the head of each agency to: (1) conduct thorough and systematic reviews of all regulations issued by the agency to determine if those regulations are obsolete, inconsistent, or duplicative or impede competition; (2) issue reports on the findings of those reviews, with recommendations for terminating, extending, modifying, or consolidating regulations; and (3) solicit comments from the public (including the private sector) before making determinations and sending a report regarding a regulation. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) criteria for review; (2) preliminary and final reports on reviews of regulations; (3) reports on the schedule for reviewing existing regulations; (4) functions of the Administrator; (5) designation of agency Regulatory Review Officers; and (6) judicial review."
