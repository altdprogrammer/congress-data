Sets forth conditions under which Indian tribes may be treated as States. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress on: (1) recommendations for addressing hazardous and solid wastes and underground storage tanks (USTs) within Indian country; (2) methods to maximize Indian participation in, and administration of, programs under such Act; and (3) an estimate of the amount of assistance required and a discussion of proposals by the Administrator concerning the provision of assistance to Indian tribes for the administration of such programs. Requires the Administrator to establish an inventory of sites within Indian country at which hazardous waste has been stored or disposed. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reserve at least three percent of the amounts made available to States from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund for Indian tribes to carry out response actions for petroleum USTs."
