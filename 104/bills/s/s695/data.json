    "text": "Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve Act of 1996 - Establishes the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve to provide for the preservation, restoration, and interpretation of the Spring Hill Ranch area of the Flint Hills of Kansas. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to administer the Preserve as specified. Provides that, with the consent of a private owner of land within the boundaries of the Preserve, the regulations issued by the Secretary concerning the National Park Service providing for the proper use, management, and protection of persons, property, and natural and cultural resources shall apply to the private land. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) expend Federal funds for the cooperative management of private property within the Preserve for research, resource management, and visitor protection and use; and (2) include in such agreement an indemnification provision by which the United States agrees to hold harmless, defend, and indemnify the landowner in full from and against any suit, liability, or cost arising out of any personal injury or property damage claim that occurs in connection with the operation of the Preserve under the agreement, subject to specified limitations. Directs that the Preserve be treated as a unit of the National Park System for all purposes, including exercising authority to charge entrance and admission fees under specified provisions of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. Requires the Secretary: (1) to prepare and submit to specified congressional committees a general management plan for the Preserve; and (2) as part of the plan's development, to prepare a financial analysis indicating how the Preserve's management may be fully supported through forms of non-Federal funding. Authorizes the Secretary to allow hunting and fishing on Federal lands within the Preserve. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to acquire specified real property and improvements thereon within the boundaries of the Preserve. Sets forth provisions regarding payments to local governments in lieu of taxes for such real property. Prohibits: (1) such property from being acquired without the owner's consent; and (2) U.S. acquisition of fee ownership of any lands within the Preserve other than these lands. (Sec. 7) Establishes the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve Advisory Committee. (Sec. 8) Specifies that nothing in this Act shall give the Secretary authority to regulate lands outside the land area acquired by the Secretary under section 6. (Sec. 9) Authorizes appropriations."
