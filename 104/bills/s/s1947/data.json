    "text": "Clone Pager Authorization Act of 1996 - Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the use of a clone pager (defined as a device that is programmed identically to any numeric digital display paging device and that allows the user to receive messages at the same time as the user of the paging device). Modifies provisions regarding the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices to cover the use of clone pagers. Authorizes a Federal court, upon the request of an attorney for the Government or an officer of a law enforcement agency authorized to acquire and use a clone pager, to order a provider of a paging service or other person to furnish to such investigative or law enforcement officer all information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the programming and use of such pager unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with the paging services provided."
