Authorizes the National Park Foundation to provide funds from the special account to the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to be used to pay the Federal share of the cost of eligible projects such as the design, construction, operation, maintenance, repair, or replacement of a facility within the Park that meets specified guidelines. Requires the Director to enter into a cost-sharing agreement with a non-Federal entity for each eligible project for which funds are provided under this Act. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on the Park infrastructure improvement."
