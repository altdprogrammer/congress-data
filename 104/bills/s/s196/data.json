    "text": "United States-Mexico Border Environmental Protection Act - Establishes in the Treasury the United States-Mexico Border Environmental Protection Fund to be used to investigate and respond to conditions that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determines present a substantial threat to the land, air, or water resources of the Border Environment Zone (as defined by the La Paz Agreement between the United States and Mexico). Requires the Secretary of State to transfer a specified amount to the Fund. Authorizes the Administrator to declare an environmental emergency in the Zone if conditions present a substantial threat to the land, air, or water resources in the area. Prohibits such a declaration if the condition is specifically within the sole jurisdiction of the International Boundary and Water Commission. Authorizes the Administrator to establish a system for information sharing and for early warning to the United States, the several States, political subdivisions, and Indian tribes of environmental problems affecting the Zone. Permits the Secretary, acting through the U.S. Commissioner of the International Boundary and Water Commission, to enter into agreements with the Ministry of Foreign Relations of Mexico for the correction of and response to border sanitation emergencies. Prohibits the expenditure of U.S. funds for emergency investigation or remediation in Mexico without a cost-sharing agreement unless the expenditure would be cost-effective and in the U.S. interest. Establishes the United States International Boundary and Water Commission Fund to carry out international agreements under this Act. Requires the Secretary to transfer a specified amount to the Commission Fund."
