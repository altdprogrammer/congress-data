    "text": "Amends the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 to prohibit the providing of U.S. intelligence information to the United Nations or any of its affiliated organizations, or to any U.N. officials or employees, unless the President certifies to appropriate congressional committees that the Director of Central Intelligence has implemented specified requirements agreed to and implemented by the United Nations for protecting such intelligence. Authorizes waiver of such requirements upon certification by the President to appropriate congressional committees that providing such information is in the vital national interests of the United States and that all possible measures protecting such information have been taken. Requires the President to report at least quarterly to specified congressional committees on the types and volume of intelligence provided to the United Nations, including the purposes for which it was provided, as well as any unauthorized intelligence disclosures that become known."
