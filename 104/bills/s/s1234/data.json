Includes among such revisions and changes: (1) making the House of Representatives a legislative agency for purposes relating to claims of or against the Federal Government; (2) providing agencies with the authority to require the taxpayer identification numbers of the persons doing business with them; (3) expanding various specified collection and offset authorities and Governmentwide cross-servicing; (4) barring delinquent Federal debtors from obtaining Federal loans or loan guarantees; (5) adjusting Federal civil monetary penalties for inflation; and (6) establishing in the Treasury the Debt Collection Improvement Account to reimburse agencies for expenditures for improvement of tax administration and agency debt collection and debt recovery activities. (Sec. 201) Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to exempt means-tested programs from any offset when notified by the head of the respective agency. Authorizes the Secretary to exempt other payments from offset upon written request (including justification under Secretary-prescribed standards) of the head of the payment certifying agency. (Sec. 203) Amends the Privacy Act of 1974 to exempt from computer matching requirements matches for administrative offset or claims collection or any other payment intercept or offset program authorized by statute. (Sec. 1001) Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) establish guidelines to assist agencies in the performance and monitoring of debt collection activities; and (2) consolidate all reports concerning debt collection into one annual report. Requires the Secretary to: (1) report to the Congress on debt collection services; and (2) prescribe regulations requiring certain agency reports on loans and accounts receivable managed by the head of the agency. Title II: Justice Debt Management - Repeals specified provisions of Federal law to provide for expanded use of private attorneys in Federal debt collection efforts. (Sec. 1201) Amends the Federal judicial code to provide for nonjudicial foreclosure of mortgages. Title III: IRS Levy Authority - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for a continuing levy on non-means tested Federal payments, modify the levy exemption under such Code, and provide for the disclosure of return information to the Financial Management Service in levies with respect to any applicable government payment."
