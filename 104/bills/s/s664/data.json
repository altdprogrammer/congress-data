    "text": "Competitive Consumer Electronics Availability Act of 1995 - Requires the Federal Communications Commission to adopt regulations to assure competitive availability, to consumers of telecommunication services, of converter boxes, interactive communications devices, and other customer premises equipment from manufacturers, retailers, and other vendors not affiliated with any telecommunications system operator. Provides that such regulations shall not prohibit any telecommunications system operator from also offering devices and customer premises equipment to consumers if the system operator's charges to consumers for such devices and equipment are separately stated and not bundled with or subsidized by charges for any telecommunications service. Authorizes the Commission to waive a regulation adopted pursuant to this Act for a limited time upon an appropriate showing by a telecommunications system operator that such waiver is necessary to the introduction of a new telecommunications service."
