Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to declare that a disaster has occurred and that Federal funding is necessary to repair and rebuild rail lines damaged by it. Prohibits such assistance unless emergency disaster relief funds are appropriated for such purpose. Amends the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 to declare that it is the purpose of the Congress to promote the revitalization of the railway system through, among other things, preservation of light density lines. Revises interest rate, repayment, and prepayment penalty requirements with respect to guaranteed railroad improvement loans."
