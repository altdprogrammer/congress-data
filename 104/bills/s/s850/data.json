    "text": "Child Care and Development Block Grant Amendments Act of 1995 - Amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to consolidate Federal child care programs. Extends the authorization of appropriations under the Act. Revises provisions for the lead agency to allow such agency to administer the financial assistance received by the State under the act either directly or through other governmental or nongovernmental agencies. Requires sufficient time and statewide distribution for the notice of the public hearing on child care services provision under the State plan. Revises provisions for the State application and plan. Eliminates a requirement that providers that are not required to be licensed or regulated under State or local law be required to register with the State before payment is made under the Act. Requires the State to implement mechanisms to ensure that appropriate payment mechanisms exist so that proper payments under this subchapter will be made to providers. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop minimum child care standards, appropriately reflective of tribal needs and available resources, applicable to Indian tribes and tribal organization receiving assistance under the Act. Reduces the set-aside from 25 to 15 percent of annual assistance to a State; but applies such set-aside only to child care quality improvement activities and no longer to early childhood development and before- and after-school care services. Adds a limitation on administrative costs. Requires the sliding fee scale to ensure a representative distribution of funding among the working poor and recipients of Federal welfare assistance. Expands eligibility criteria to include families earning up to 100 percent (currently 75 percent) of the State median family income. Revises requirements relating to quality improvement activities to include: (1) under resource and referral programs, consumer education, referrals honoring parental choice, and activities to improve quality and availability of child care; and (2) under other activities, increasing availability of care before- and after-school, for infants, and during nontraditional work hours. Repeals a requirement that States expend a specified minimum amount of reserved funds for early childhood development and before- and after-school services. Revises requirements for enforcement and for reports. Authorizes the Secretary to permit an Indian tribe or rganization to use certain assistance to construct or renovate facilities that will be used to carry out child care programs. Provides for reallocation of assistance to other Indian tribes or organizations under certain conditions. Allows use of child care certificates as deposits. Includes among eligible child care providers those who care for an eligible great grandchild or sibling (if in the latter case the provider lives in a separate residence). Eliminates certain registration requirements for providers who are relatives. Requires a State that uses funding for child care services under any Federal program to: (1) ensure that activities carried out using such funds meet the requirements, standards, criteria of, and the regulations promulgated under, the Act; (2) administer such funds to the lead agency and integrate them into the State program under the Act. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal Government has a responsibility to provide funding and leadership with respect to child care. Repeals: (1) the State Dependent Care Development Grants Act; and (2) the Child development Associate Scholarship Assistance Act of 1985. Directs the Secretary to submit to the Congress a legislative proposal in the form of an implementing bill containing technical and conforming amendments to reflect the amendments and repeals made by this Act."
