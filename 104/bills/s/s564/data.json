Requires the President to adhere to principles of necessity and proportionality such that: (1) force may not be used for purposes of aggression; (2) the President shall have determined, before the use of force, that the objective could not have been achieved satisfactorily by means other than the use of force; (3) the use of force shall be exercised with levels of force, in a manner, and for a duration essential to and directly connected with the achievement of the objective; and (4) the diplomatic, military, economic, and humanitarian consequences of the action shall be in reasonable proportion to the benefits of the objective. (Sec. 102) Directs the President, except where an emergency exists that does not permit sufficient time, to seek the advice of the Congress before any use of force abroad. Establishes the Congressional Leadership Group on the Use of Force Abroad to facilitate regular consultation between the President and the Congress on foreign and national security policy. (Sec. 103) Requires the President, within 48 hours of commencing a use of force abroad, to submit a Use of Force report to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the president pro tempore of the Senate. Provides for periodic reporting on the status, scope, and expected duration of the use of force. (Sec. 104) Authorizes the President to continue a use of force abroad for longer than 60 days after the date by which the Use of Force report is required only if: (1) the Congress has declared war or provided specific statutory authorization for the extended period; (2) the President has requested the Congress to enact a joint resolution constituting such a declaration or authorization but the resolution has not been subject to a vote in each House; or (3) the President has certified to the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate that an emergency exists that threatens the U.S. national interests and requires the period of limitation to be exceeded. (Sec. 105) Sets forth conditions under which joint or concurrent resolutions involving declarations of war and the use of force abroad shall receive expedited consideration in the Congress. (Sec. 106) Prohibits funding for any use of force abroad that is inconsistent with this Act. (Sec. 107) Authorizes Members of Congress to bring actions alleging violations of this Act. Sets forth provisions regarding judicial review and remedies. (Sec. 110) Repeals the War Powers Resolution. Title II: Expedited Procedures - Sets forth congressional procedures for the consideration of resolutions regarding the use of force abroad."
