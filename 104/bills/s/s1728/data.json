    "text": "Amends the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987 to exempt certain Navy owned or operated vessels from such Act's requirements that certain garbage be discharged in special areas at sea. Prescribes special requirements for such vessels for the discharge of non-plastic and non-floating garbage consisting of metal, glass, and a slurry of seawater, paper, cardboard, and food waste at certain distances from the nearest land. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to publish in the Federal Register: (1) a list of such vessels planned to be decommissioned between certain dates; and (2) standards to ensure their compliance with such Act without impairing operational capabilities."
