    "text": "Line Item Veto Act - Grants the President legislative line item veto rescission authority. Authorizes the President to rescind all or part of any discretionary budget authority or veto any targeted tax benefit if the President determines that such rescission: (1) would help reduce the Federal budget deficit; (2) will not impair any essential Government functions; and (3) will not harm the national interest. Requires the President to notify the Congress of such a rescission or veto by special message after enactment of appropriations legislation providing such budget authority or a revenue Act containing a targeted tax benefit. Makes such a rescission effective unless the Congress enacts a rescission disapproval bill. Describes: (1) information to be included in the President's message; and (2) procedures to govern consideration of rescission disapproval legislation in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
