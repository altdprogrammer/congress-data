    "text": "Deepwater Port Modernization Act - Amends the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 to revise the term \"deepwater port\" to include a fixed or floating manmade structure (other than a vessel) that is located beyond the territorial sea and off the U.S. coast which is used as a port or terminal for the transportation of oil from the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf. Eliminates: (1) certain utilization and transfer restrictions on deepwater ports; and (2) a certain antitrust precondition with respect to the licensing of such ports. Authorizes the Secretary to exempt a person from certain information requirements with respect to the issuance of a deepwater port license. Repeals the restriction on the issuance of a deepwater port license requiring that the Secretary of Transportation first receive opinions from the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission as to whether such action would adversely affect competition, restrain trade, promote monopolization, or otherwise contravene the antitrust laws. Requires a deepwater port, among other things, to accept, transport, or convey without discrimination all oil delivered to it. Directs the Secretary to prescribe and enforce marine protection and navigational safety procedures with respect to a deepwater port through the operations manual of a deepwater port licensee. (Currently, such procedures are enforced by regulation.)"
