    "text": "Peace Powers Act of 1995 - Repeals the War Powers Resolution. (Sec. 3) Requires the President, in every possible instance, to consult with the Congress before introducing the armed forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated and to consult regularly with the Congress until such forces are no longer engaged in such hostilities or have been removed from such situations. (Sec. 4) Directs the President, in the absence of a declaration of war, to report to the Speaker of the House and the president of the Senate in any case in which the armed forces are introduced: (1) into hostilities or situations described above; (2) into the territory, airspace, or waters of a foreign nation while equipped for combat, with specified exceptions; or (3) in numbers which substantially enlarge armed forces equipped for combat already located in a foreign nation. Requires such report to set forth: (1) the circumstances necessitating such introduction; (2) the constitutional and legislative authority under which such introduction took place; and (3) the estimated scope and duration of the hostilities or involvement. Provides for continuing reports to the Congress as long as the armed forces are so engaged. (Sec. 5) Amends the United Nations Participation Act to prohibit the President from subordinating any element of the armed forces participating in a United Nations peacekeeping activity to the command or operational control of any foreign nationals unless he submits specified documents to the designated congressional committees or the Congress enacts an Act or joint resolution authorizing such subordination. Lists as the specified documents determinations by the President that: (1) the proposed subordination is in the national security interest (along with a justification for such determination); (2) the unit commanders of the armed forces proposed for subordination will retain the ability to report independently to higher U.S. military authorities; (3) the United States will retain authority to withdraw the armed forces from the activity at any time and to take any action to protect such forces if endangered; (4) the armed forces will remain under U.S. administrative command for purposes of discipline and evaluation; and (5) the proposed foreign command arrangement does not violate the Constitution. (Sec. 6) Requires the President to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the total amount of funds appropriated for national defense purposes after FY 1995 that were expended during the preceding fiscal year for United Nations peacekeeping activities. Permits the payment to the United Nations of the U.S. share of peacekeeping activities, beginning with FY 1996, only to the extent that such share exceeds the total amount appropriated for the preceding fiscal year reduced by the amount of any reimbursement or credit for U.S. support for peacekeeping. (Sec. 7) Provides for notification to the Congress of proposed participation in, or expenditure of funds for, United Nations peacekeeping activities."
