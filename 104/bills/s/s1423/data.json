    "text": "Occupational Safety and Health Reform and Reinvention Act - Amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) to provide that employee safety and health participation committees are not prohibited under the National Labor Relations Act or the Railway Labor Act. (Sec. 3) Revises inspection provisions. Prohibits routine inspections of employers of ten or fewer employees if such employers: (1) are farming operations which do not maintain a temporary labor camp; or (2) are in a category of employers having an occupational injury or a lost workday case rate which is less than the national average. Grants the Secretary of labor specified types of discretionary authority in determining which employee complaints must receive special inspection responses. (Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary to establish a voluntary compliance program granting partial exemption from certain OSHA safety and health inspections and investigations for employers who either retain certain consultation or certification programs, or have an exemplary safety record and a safety and health program meeting specified criteria, including having an employee participation program. (Sec. 5) Adds employer defenses of employee misconduct or alternative safer methods. (Sec. 6) Prohibits the Secretary from establishing any quotas for subordinates within the Occupational Safety and Health Administration with respect to number of inspections conducted, citations issued, or penalties collected. (Sec. 7) Provides for warnings in lieu of citations. (Sec. 8) Reduces penalties for nonserious violations and where there are mitigating circumstances. Directs the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission to assess all civil penalties, giving due consideration to their appropriateness with respect to specified factors. Provides for various reductions of penalties for voluntary compliance program participants or exemplary safe worksites under certain conditions. (Sec. 9) Directs the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with States for the provision of State consultation services to employers concerning the provision of safe and healthful working conditions. Makes a State eligible to enter into such an agreement only if its approved plan does not include provisions for federally funded consultation to employers. Requires that at least 15 percent of the annual appropriation to carry out OSHA be expended for education, consultation, and outreach efforts. (Sec. 10) Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) cooperative agreements to encourage the establishment of comprehensive safety and health management systems which include specified required features; and (2) a voluntary protection program, also with specified required features, to encourage the achievement of excellence in both the technical and managerial protection of employees from occupational hazards. (Sec. 11) Extends OSHA coverage to public employees by including Federal, State, and local governments under the OSHA definition of employer. (Repeals special separate provisions for Federal agency safety programs and responsibilities.) Extends application of OSHA provisions to the Postal Service."
