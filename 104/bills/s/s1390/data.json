Requires a private person who makes the latter election, after consulting with and obtaining the concurrence of the State and each political subdivision of the State within which the violation occurred, to enter into an agreement to pay the prescribed amount to an appropriate person to carry out one or more environmental projects. Requires a separate agreement to be entered into with respect to each penalty for which an election is made. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) suitable environmental projects; and (2) oversight."
