    "text": "Attorney's Fees Equity Act of 1995 - Entitles to reimbursement of reasonable attorney fees incurred during and as a result of an investigation that does not result in adverse action against such person a current or former: (1) Department of Justice (DOJ) attorney, agent, or employee who supervises an agent who is the subject of a criminal or disciplinary investigation arising out of acts performed in the discharge of duties in prosecuting or investigating a criminal matter, who is not provided representation under DOJ regulations; and (2) attorney, agent, or employee who supervises an agent employed as or by a Federal public defender who is the subject of such an investigation arising out of acts performed in the discharge of duties in defending or investigating a criminal matter in connection with the public defender program, who is not provided representation by a Federal public defender or the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Considers an investigation not to result in adverse action against such person if: (1) in the case of a criminal investigation, the investigation does not result in indictment of, the filing of a criminal complaint against, or the entry of a plea of guilty by the attorney, agent, or supervising employee; and (2) in the case of a disciplinary investigation, the investigation does not result in discipline or results in only discipline less serious than a formal letter of reprimand finding actual and specific wrongdoing. Requires the Attorney General to provide notice in writing of the conclusion and result of the investigation. Permits an attorney, agent, or supervising employee who was the subject of an investigation to waive entitlement to reimbursement of attorney fees as part of a resolution of a criminal or disciplinary investigation. Sets forth further procedures regarding applications for, and payments of, reimbursement. Requires the official making an award to inquire into the reasonableness of the amount requested."
