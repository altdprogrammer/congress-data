    "text": "Domestic Saturday Night Special Act of 1996 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the possession or transfer of a nonsporting handgun that has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, with exceptions. Allows the sale and transfer of: (1) a revolver with a barrel length of not less than two inches, if such revolver could otherwise be imported into the United States on the basis of a determination by the Secretary of the Treasury that it is a sporting handgun; and (2) a handgun which, if designed to use a larger caliber ammunition, could otherwise be imported into the United States on the basis of such determination. Defines the term: (1) \"nonsporting handgun\" to mean a firearm designed to be fired with a single hand that is not a sporting handgun and any combination of parts from which such a firearm can be assembled; and (2) \"sporting handgun\" to mean a firearm designed to be fired with a single hand that the Secretary has determined to be of a type generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes. Sets penalties for violations."
