    "text": "Professional Baseball Antitrust Reform Act of 1995 - Amends the Clayton Act to make the antitrust laws applicable to the business of organized professional major league baseball with respect to labor- management relations. Specifies that this Act shall not affect: (1) the outcome of any antitrust litigation based on any area or activity of the business of professional baseball other than the area of, or an activity relating to, relations between labor and management of major league baseball; (2) the application of the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961; or (3) the applicability or nonapplicability of the antitrust laws to professional baseball's amateur draft, the minor league reserve clause, the Professional Baseball Agreement, or any other matter relating to the minor leagues. Makes the nonstatutory labor exemption from the antitrust laws inapplicable to any term or condition that: (11) is unilaterally imposed or maintained by any party that has been subject to an agreement between the owners of major league baseball and the labor organization representing the players of major league baseball; and (2) differs substantially from the provisions of the basic agreement between the two parties that expired on December 31, 1993. Specifies that nothing in this Act shall affect the scope or application of the nonstatutory labor exemption from the antitrust laws, that \"term or condition\" does not include a strike or lockout, and that this provision shall not apply to conduct that is incidental to or occurs after the mutual adoption of an agreement between the owners and the labor organization representing the players of major league baseball to replace the December 31, 1993, agreement, but shall apply to other conduct occurring before the adoption of such an agreement."
