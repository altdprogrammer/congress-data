(Sec. 101) Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make monthly advance payments to such a plan with respect to an individual enrollee of either a monthly choice care value amount (determined according to a specified formula) or of a monthly premium, whichever is less. Requires the Secretary to pay each eligible individual 75 percent of any excess over the plan premium of the weighted average of the choice care value amounts with respect to all individuals in a reimbursement area (rebate amounts), with the remainder of the excess amount deposited in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Authorizes the Secretary, after obtaining appropriate experience in operating the choice care program, to establish one or more demonstration projects to determine the choice care value amount through competitive bidding by choice care plans in reimbursement areas in which at least three such plans (including national indemnity plans) participate in the bidding. Title II: Tax Provisions Relating to Choice Care Plans - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for: (1) Medicare medical savings accounts (MSAs) for income-excludible deposit of rebate amounts or equivalent cash deposits to cover the qualified medical expenses of individuals entitled to benefits under Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance) and enrolled under Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) for whose benefit the Medicare MSA is maintained; and (2) the tax treatment of Medicare MSAs, their distributions, and Medicare Choice Care program rebates not deposited in an MSA."
