    "text": "Revises various specified Federal laws concerning the transfer, disposal, and distribution of certain surplus Federal property by the Department of Defense (DOD) and other specified Federal agencies. Gives State and local governments priority over foreign countries in receiving nonlethal excess DOD supplies before they are made available for humanitarian relief purposes. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 to exclude motor vehicles from the personal property DOD may transfer to Federal and State agencies for counter-drug activities. Repeals the mandate for DOD participation in infrastructure improvement demonstration programs conducted by Regional Equipment Centers in Newport Township and Cambria County, Pennsylvania. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, with respect to the transfer of property for environmental protection in foreign countries, to prohibit such transfers unless the Administrator of General Services (GSA Administrator) determines that there is no Federal or State use requirements for the property under any other provision of law. Amends the Small Business Act to subject to the supervision of the GSA Administrator, in consultation with State agencies responsible for surplus property distribution, the transfer of U.S.-owned technology or surplus property to participants in the small business and capital ownership development program. Repeals the authority of the Secretary of Energy to transfer surplus equipment to an educational institution with which it has a partnership agreement. Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to repeal the authority of a Federal agency head or the director of a Federal laboratory to give excess research equipment to an educational institution or nonprofit organization. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to authorize the Administrator of General Services to delegate such transfer authority to the director of a Federal laboratory. Requires the Administrator of General Services to review all such laws for a report to the Congress on the effectiveness of surplus personal property disposal programs along with recommendations for consolidating them under a single Federal authority."
