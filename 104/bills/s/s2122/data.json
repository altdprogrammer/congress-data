Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) provide technical assistance regarding such Plan and its implementation to Ohio, such State's political subdivision, nonprofit organization, or any other person on a request by the management entity; and (2) assist in the Plan's development. Prohibits: (1) as a condition of such technical assistance, the Secretary from requiring any recipient to enact or modify land use restrictions; (2) the Secretary or any other Federal agency from making a limitation on fishing, hunting, or trapping a condition of the determination of eligibility for, or receipt of, assistance under this Act."
