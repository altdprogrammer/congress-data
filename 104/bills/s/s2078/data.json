Prohibits the aircraft or parts from being flown or otherwise removed from the United States unless dispatched by the National Interagency Fire Center in support of an international wildfire suppression agreement or for purposes jointly approved in advance by the Secretaries of Defense and Agriculture. Authorizes the Secretary to sell such equipment only if the Secretary of Agriculture certifies to the Secretary that the purchasing person or entity is capable of meeting the terms and conditions of a contract to deliver fire retardant by air. Directs the Secretary to prescribe sale regulations which: (1) ensure that any such sale is made at fair market value; and (2) require certain certifications and establish appropriate means to ensure compliance with the sale conditions of this Act. Requires a report from the Secretary to specified congressional committees on the Secretary's exercise of authority under this Act."
