Subtitle B: Participating State Program - Sets forth the general framework for a State program negotiated and contracted with at least one health plan to provide access to qualified health plans to eligible children and pregnant women residing in the State. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide certain payments for operating and administrative costs of participating States. Title II: Qualifying Policies - Subtitle A: Qualifying Policies - Describes the qualifying health policies for children and pregnant women, with a prohibition under each policy against any cost-sharing requirements for preventive services. Subtitle B: Access and Preexisting Condition Limitations - Places certain limitations on the imposition of preexisting condition exclusions under such policies, prohibiting them outright with regard to pregnant women. Subtitle C: General Duties and Responsibilities of the Secretary - Authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations and interim final regulations to implement the State program. Title III: Assistance to Families and Pregnant Women - Prescribes guidelines for determining the eligibility of children and pregnant women for premium and cost-sharing assistance. Requires States to have such assistance programs in effect to qualify for Federal payments under this Act. Prescribes penalties for material misrepresentation and false information in applications for assistance. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations under which each State operating a program for premium assistance shall have in effect an enrollment outreach system. Requires reduction of Federal payments for administrative errors. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - Prohibits any employer which elects to make employer contributions on behalf of an employee, or an employee dependent, for health insurance coverage from conditioning, or varying, such contributions with respect to any such individual by reason of their status as an individual eligible for premium assistance. Provides that an employer shall not be treated as failing to meet such requirements if the employer ceases to make employer contributions for health insurance coverage for all its employees. (Sec. 402) Prohibits a participating State from modifying the eligibility requirements for children or pregnant women under the State Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act in any manner that would have the effect of reducing the eligibility of children or pregnant women for coverage under such program. (Sec. 403) Expresses the sense of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate that the program established under this Act should be fully financed in a budget neutral manner by offsetting revenues derived from increasing the taxes on tobacco and providing for reductions in undeserved corporate tax breaks."
