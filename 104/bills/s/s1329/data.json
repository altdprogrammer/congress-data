Requires, to be eligible for such BEA, a minimum of two years of continuous active duty for active-duty personnel, unless the individual is discharged or released due to a service-connected disability or voluntarily or involuntarily at the convenience of the Government (with other conditions). Requires a minimum of six years of service for reserve personnel (with other conditions). Requires, in each case, that the individual complete the requirements of the equivalence of a high school diploma during such service and not receive educational assistance under any other military program. Provides exceptions to the minimum service requirements. Requires a reduction from basic pay ($100 monthly for active-duty personnel, $50 for reserve members) for participation in the BEA program. Entitles each individual to one month of BEA benefits for each month of active or reserve duty. Allows all eligible individuals to elect not to participate in the BEA program. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to pay to each eligible individual a BEA allowance to be used for specified educational purposes (e.g., paying off educational loans or beginning new education or training). Provides the monthly rate of BEA to be paid for active-duty and reserve members. Requires such amounts to be increased in conformity with increases in the Consumer Price Index. Requires an individual to use such BEA within ten years after initial discharge or release from duty. Provides an exception in the case of an individual who was prevented from using such assistance due to a physical or mental disability which was not the result of the individual's own willful misconduct. Bars an individual from receiving duplicative Federal educational assistance benefits. (Sec. 102) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) provide an income tax credit for the unused portion of BEA benefits which expire during a taxable year; and (2) exclude from gross income any amounts deducted from an individual's basic pay for participation in the BEA program. Title II: Funding - Extends through FY 2000: (1) the requirement that non-service disabled veterans having incomes above a specified level make copayments in exchange for hospital and medical care received through the Department of Veterans Affairs; (2) the authority for collection of a $2 copayment from veterans above a minimum income level for prescription medication furnished for outpatient treatment of a non-service-connected condition; (3) certain Department medical care cost recovery authority; (4) the authority of the Secretary to charge and collect a fee for veterans' housing loans guaranteed by the Department; (5) the authority to collect increased loan fees for manufactured housing for veterans; (6) the procedures applicable upon the default of Department-guaranteed loans; (7) the authority under veterans' benefits' provisions and the Internal Revenue Code to verify a veteran's income for purposes of eligibility for needs-based benefits; and (8) a pension payment limitation of $90 monthly to Medicaid-eligible veterans and their surviving spouses who have no dependents and reside in Medicaid-participating nursing homes. Repeals a Federal provision which prohibits the withholding of any veterans' benefit payments otherwise due in order to offset any loan made by the Department to such veteran or surviving spouse. Directs the Secretary to phase out and close by the end of FY 1996 Department supply depots located at Somerville, New Jersey; Hines, Illinois; and Bell, California. Requires the transfer of specified supply funds from the Department of Veterans Affairs Revolving Supply Fund to the Treasury for each of FY 1995 and 1996. Amends the Social Security Act to: (1) rename the Medicare and Medicaid Coverage Data Bank as the Health Care Coverage Data Bank; and (2) use such Data Bank to assist in the identification of, and the collection from, third parties responsible for the payment of Department-furnished health care items and services. (Sec. 202) Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to prohibit the annual pay adjustment for members of Congress from exceeding the percentage adjustment for Federal employees under the General Schedule. (Sec. 203) Requires an individual convicted of fraudulently obtaining Federal employee benefits to forfeit any prospective benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. Prohibits a person from receiving benefits during incarceration for a felony, but allows his or her dependents to be paid a percentage of such benefits during such period. Requires Federal or State agencies to furnish the Secretary of Labor with the names and social security numbers of individuals so confined. Repeals a Federal provision limiting to $100,000 the fine for falsifying statements in order to receive Federal compensation if the total amount of the benefits falsely received does not exceed $1,000. (Sec. 204) Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to assist Federal employees permanently disabled during the performance of duty in seeking or obtaining employment. Authorizes the Secretary to reimburse another employer for employing such an individual. Authorizes the Secretary to expand the Federal Employees' Compensation Act Periodic Roll Management Project to all offices of the Office of Workers' Compensation Program of the Department of Labor. (Sec. 205) Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to sell the: (1) Snettisham Hydroelectric Project to Alaska, pursuant to a specified agreement; and (2) Eklutna Hydroelectric Project to the municipality of Anchorage, under a specified agreement. Continues the exemption of both projects from all provisions of the Federal Power Act, unless a future modification of such projects affects Federal lands not currently used. Outlines provisions concerning: (1) jurisdiction to hear agreement disputes; (2) rights-of-way; (3) authority to select lands under the purchase agreements; and (4) a prohibition against including the Federal lands so conveyed in the Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act or any related law. Directs the Secretary of Energy, within one year of such sales, to: (1) complete the business of, and close, the Alaska Power Administration; (2) prepare and submit to the Congress a report documenting the two sales; and (3) return unused funds to the Treasury. Repeals Acts and provisions made inconsistent by the sales and closing. (Sec. 206) Terminates on September 30, 1995, most provisions (two exceptions) of the Trade Act of 1974 which provide compensation and other benefits to groups of workers adversely affected in their occupation by excessive imports into the United States. (Sec. 207) Amends title XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services) of the Social Security Act to merge and consolidate the funding of the at-risk child care program with the program of block grants to States for social services. Authorizes appropriations for the merged program through FY 1999. Merges into the block grant program certain discretionary social services programs, maintaining their discretionary status. Consolidates the FY 1995 through 1999 funding for the discretionary programs. (Sec. 208) Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use death certificate information for social security program purposes and to redisclose such information to other Federal or State agencies for appropriate purposes. Requires all States to supply the Secretary with such information, regardless of whether they have in effect a contract to furnish such information. Directs the Secretary to establish and collect a fee for the disclosure of such information to other Federal and State agencies. Authorizes the Secretary to provide a Federal or State agency with technical assistance with regard to the effective collection, dissemination, and use of death information. (Sec 209) Amends the National Housing Act with respect to insured mortgage refinancing assistance to: (1) include refinancing costs in the amount of a refinanced mortgage that may be insured under such Act; and (2) permit recaptured budget authority to be used for certain refinancing-related assistance. (Sec. 210) Makes certain congressional findings with respect to multifamily housing project (MHP) mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Amends the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 to remove the requirement that the Secretary of HUD (Secretary, for purposes of this section) manage or dispose of MHPs in a manner that supports fair housing strategies and is consistent with local housing market conditions. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) dispose of MHPs to purchasers meeting specified requirements; and (2) contract for MHP management services. Directs the Secretary to maintain MHPs still held in a safe and sanitary condition and at full occupancy, if possible. Requires the Secretary to undertake at least one of the following actions to ensure tenant affordability: (1) enter into owner contracts under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937; (2) enter into annual contribution contracts with public housing agencies to provide tenant-based assistance to eligible low-income families; (3) reduce the sales price, apply use or rent restrictions, or provide other financial assistance to ensure that at least some units are available to and affordable by such families; and (4) transfer an MHP to another public housing agency or other appropriate entity for use under a different public housing project (with specified transfer agreement requirements). Authorizes the Secretary, with respect to an MHP, to: (1) provide short-term loans to facilitate a sale to a nonprofit organization or public agency; (2) make available tenant-based assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act to very low-income families that do not otherwise qualify for project-based assistance; (3) make some of the MHP units available for uses other than rental or cooperative uses; and (4) require some MHP units to contain use or rent restrictions making them available only to very low income persons for the remaining useful life of the property. Provides required terms for contracts authorized under this section. Directs the Secretary, prior to the sale of an MHP, to: (1) develop a disposition plan for the project that specifies minimum terms and conditions; and (2) allow appropriate and timely input into disposition plans and sales by local government officials as well as the community and tenants involved. Directs the Secretary to notify State agencies and units of local government of the Secretary's acquisition of title to an MHP and allow such entities 45 days to express an interest in the project. Provides conditions with respect to the purchase of an MHP by such an entity after such expression of interest and the acceptance of a qualifying offer. Sets forth: (1) rights of tenants who are displaced by the disposition of an MHP; and (2) mortgage and MHP sale requirements, including sales to State and local governments. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees describing the status of MHPs owned by or subject to mortgages held by the Secretary."
