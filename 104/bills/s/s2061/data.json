Authorizes the International Trade Commission (ITC) to treat as a domestic industry only that portion of the production of such products located in such geographic area. Amends provisional relief guidelines to require the ITC to expedite its determination procedure upon request by either the President or the U.S. Trade Representative (or a resolution adopted by either of two specified congressional committees), stating that provisional relief may be necessary to prevent or remedy actual or threatened serious injury to the domestic industry. Cites conditions under which the ITC may waive the 90-day monitoring requirement."
