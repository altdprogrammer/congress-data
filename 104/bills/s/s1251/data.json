Transfers to the fund amounts received as a result of Internal Revenue Code amendments made by this Act plus any overpayment designations or contributions as provided for in this Act. Mandates distributions from the Fund to the National Institutes of Health, to the National Center for Research Resources, and for carrying out specified Public Health Service Act provisions relating to health information communications. Excludes amounts in the Fund from consideration or enforcement with regard to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 or the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Title II: Financing Provisions - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the excise tax on tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes. (Sec. 203) Requires such materials exported without tax payment to be marked as regulations require. Imposes, for related violations, a monetary penalty and requires forfeiture of the materials and any vessels, vehicles, and aircraft used. Regulates reimportation. Adds references to importers to provisions relating to permits, inventories, reports, and certain criminal penalties and forfeitures. Ends: (1) tax-free consumption by manufacturers' employees; and (2) tax-free removal for the use of the United States. Subjects to taxation all books or sets of cigarette papers regardless of the number of papers. Allows denial of a permit to operate as a manufacturer, importer, or export warehouse proprietor if minimum capacity or activity requirements are not met. (Sec. 204) Imposes an excise tax on roll-your-own tobacco manufactured in or imported to the United States. (Sec. 205) Allows an individual to designate that a portion of any tax overpayment and a cash contribution be paid over to the Fund. Terminates the designation provisions when the sum of all designations for the second and third preceding years is less than $5 million."
