Requires the Commission to submit a report to the Congress concerning offenses involving child pornography and other sex offenses against children, including: (1) an analysis of the sentences imposed for specified offenses involving children and recommendations regarding modifications to the sentencing guidelines; (2) a survey of the recidivism rate for offenders convicted of committing sex crimes against children, an analysis of the impact on recidivism of sexual abuse treatment provided during or after incarceration, or both, and an analysis of whether increased penalties would reduce recidivism; and (3) such other recommendations as the Commission deems appropriate."
