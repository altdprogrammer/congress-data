    "text": "Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to provide that any chemical supply house that, after having been provided a warning within the previous ten years, sells a listed chemical to a person who uses or intends or attempts to use the listed chemical, or who causes the listed chemical to be used or attempted to be used, to manufacture or produce methamphetamine, shall: (1) be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $250,000; or (2) for a second violation, be ordered to cease the production and sale of any chemicals. Directs the Attorney General to provide a written warning to each chemical supply house that violates such provision. Requires that all amounts received from enforcement of the civil penalty be used by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for the environmental cleanup of clandestine laboratories used to manufacture methamphetamine. Increases penalties for the possession and distribution of a list I chemical. Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to reflect such amendment. Adds penalties for the manufacture and possession of equipment used to make methamphetamine. Includes specified transactions involving pseudoephedrine among those constituting a \"regulated transaction.\" Adds iodine, red phosphorous, and hydrochloric gas to the list of list I chemicals. Expresses the sense of the Congress with respect to methamphetamine, including that the rise in manufacture and usage of methamphetamine is of major concern to the United States, that a substantial portion of the ephedrine used to make methamphetamine is smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border, and that all ephedrine and pseudoephedrine producing countries and Mexico should cooperate in any way possible to deter the smuggling of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine into the United States."
