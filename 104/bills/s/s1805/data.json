    "text": "Voyageurs National Park Accessibility and Partnership Act of 1996 - Amends Federal law to establish the Voyageurs National Park Intergovernmental Council, which shall develop and monitor a comprehensive management plan (plan) for the Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota. Sets forth provisions regarding Council membership and termination, procedural matters, compensation, and funding. Requires the Council: (1) to submit to the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of Minnesota a plan for the park (to be developed and implemented by the responsible Federal agencies, the State of Minnesota, and local political subdivisions) and to submit a preliminary report to the Secretary; and (2) in developing the plan, to examine all relevant issues, including appropriate public access and recreational use, the proper distribution of visitors in the park, a comprehensive visitor education program, and the need for wilderness management for certain park areas. Bars the Council from considering removing park designation or allowing mining, logging, or commercial or residential development. Directs the Council to: (1) report to the International Joint Commission on water levels in the Rainy Lake Watershed; (2) submit the plan to the Secretary and Governor for review (and requires the Secretary to approve or disapprove the plan within 90 days); (3) review and monitor the implementation of the plan (and authorizes the Council, after public comment and approval by the Secretary, to modify the plan if the Council and the Secretary determine that the modification is necessary); and (4) advise and cooperate with appropriate Federal, State, local, and tribal governmental entities, before the approval of the plan, to minimize adverse impacts on the park. Bars the Secretary, from the date of enactment through the date a management plan is approved, from issuing regulations relating to the park, except for regulations required for routine business and emergency regulations."
