(Sec. 3) Permits a debt collector to acquire income, assets, or credit information from a person other than the debtor's attorney if the attorney refuses to provide such information. (Sec. 4) Revises procedural guidelines for: (1) debt validation; (2) legal actions by debt collectors; and (3) limitations on damages, including repeal of the allowance of up to $1,000 in additional damages. Provides that this Act: (1) supersedes any State law creating a private right of action against a debt collector; (2) does not provide a remedy for any violation of State law regarding debt collection practices; and (3) does not establish any liability or penalty for violation of State law unless such violation also constitutes a violation under this Act."
