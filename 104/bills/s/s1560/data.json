Directs the Secretary of State to report to specified congressional officials by March 1, 1996, on the steps taken by the Colombian Government to ensure effective counter-narcotics efforts. Specifies that such certification and reporting requirements are in addition to any such requirements under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961."
