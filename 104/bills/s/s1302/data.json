Reduces sugarcane loan rates from 18 cents per pound to 12 cents per pound over three years. Prohibits sugar price supports. Provides for the conversion of any current nonrecourse loans that are extended into recourse loans. Extends and increases sugar marketing assessment provisions. Includes imported sugar within such provisions' scope. Provides for the regulation of imported raw sugarcane at prices not greater than the world sugar price or the raw sugarcane loan rate. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to terminate sugar marketing quota and allotment provisions."
