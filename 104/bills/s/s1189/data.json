Specifies that any individual who submits to the Attorney General written medical documentation that the individual has a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection shall receive $125,000 from amounts available in the Fund if the individual: (1) has a blood-clotting disorder and was treated with blood-clotting agents between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 1987; (2) is the lawful spouse of such individual or the former lawful spouse and was the lawful spouse of the individual at any time after a date within such period on which the individual was treated; or (3) acquired the HIV infection through perinatal transmission from a parent who is such an individual. Requires that a claim for payment be filed with the Attorney General by or on behalf of such individual and that the Attorney General determine that the claim meets the requirements of this Act. Specifies that a claim under this Act shall not be assignable or transferable. Sets limits regarding the number of claims per victim. Prohibits the Attorney General from paying claims filed under this Act unless filed within three years after this Act's enactment."
