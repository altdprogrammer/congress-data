    "text": "Establishes the Outer Continental Shelf Impact Assistance Fund to provide impact assistance to coastal States from allocable new revenues (payments received by the United States as royalties, net profit share payments, and related late-payment interest from natural gas and oil leases under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act). Sets forth a formula for use by the Secretary of the Interior to determine the portion of the allocable share of new revenues attributable to each coastal State and county eligible to receive impact assistance payments. Mandates that such funds be expended by the eligible coastal States and counties for certain environmental projects and activities. Requires: (1) an eligible county to submit for the Governor's approval a plan setting forth the projects and activities for which it proposes to expend impact assistance funds; and (2) the Governor of each recipient State to account to the Congress for all Fund monies received for the previous fiscal year."
