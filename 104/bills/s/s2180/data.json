    "text": "Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1996 - Amends Federal criminal code provisions regarding failure to pay legal child support obligations to create two new categories of felony offenses, subject to a two-year maximum prison term: (1) traveling in interstate or foreign commerce with intent to evade a support obligation if the obligation has remained unpaid for a period longer than one year or is greater than $5,000; and (2) willfully failing to pay a support obligation regarding a child residing in another State, if the obligation has remained unpaid for a period longer than two years or is greater than $10,000. Specifies that the existence of a support obligation that was in effect for the time period charged in the indictment or information creates a rebuttable presumption that the obligor has the ability to pay such obligation for that period. Directs the court, upon a conviction, to order restitution in an amount equal to the total unpaid support obligation as it exists at the time of sentencing."
