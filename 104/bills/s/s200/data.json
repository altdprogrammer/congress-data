Directs the Secretary to promulgate standards for the uniform testing of projectiles against body armor that meets minimum standards for protection of law enforcement officers (which standards have been developed in cooperation with the U.S. Attorney General and which take into account variations in performance related to the length of the barrel of the handgun and the amount and kind of powder used)."
