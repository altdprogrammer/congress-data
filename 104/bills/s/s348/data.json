Requires Federal agencies to submit rules and reports on them, including any cost-benefit analyses, to the Congress. Allows the Congress to stop final implementation of significant rules through a joint resolution of disapproval (and override of any Presidential veto of such resolution). Defines a significant rule as any rule that may have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities."
