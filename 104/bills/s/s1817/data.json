Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) judicial review; (2) a right of certain aggrieved, persons, corporations, or unincorporated associations to intervene in proceedings concerning imposition of a tax; (3) termination of any tax so imposed, increased, levied, or assessed automatically after one year or at any time if the court determines that the deprivation of rights has been cured to the extent practicable; (4) preemption; and (5) State and local governmental rights."
