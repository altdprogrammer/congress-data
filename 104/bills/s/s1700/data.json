    "text": "Federal Gang Violence Act - Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to amend chapter three of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to increase the offense level by six, in addition to any other adjustment, except with respect to trafficking in cocaine base, if a defendant was a member of a criminal street gang at the time of the offense. Revises Federal criminal code provisions regarding criminal street gangs to modify or establish the definitions of \"conviction,\" \"criminal street gang,\" and \"pattern of criminal activity\" to make reference to \"predicate gang crimes.\" Defines \"predicate gang crimes\" to include: (1) a State offense that involves a controlled substance for which the maximum penalty is not less than five years' imprisonment or that is a felony crime of violence that has as an element the use or attempted use of physical force against another; (2) any Federal or State felony offense that involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used against another; and (3) specified Federal or State offenses, including a conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation to commit such offenses. Increases penalties for interstate and foreign travel or transportation in aid of racketeering. Includes criminal street gang activity within the term \"unlawful activity\" for purposes of such provisions. Directs the Commission to increase the base offense level for: (1) traveling in interstate or foreign commerce in aid of a street gang or other racketeering enterprise; and (2) the commission of a violent crime in aid of a street gang or other racketeering enterprise. Prohibits and sets penalties for: (1) soliciting or recruiting persons to participate in criminal gang activity; and (2) using body armor in the commission of a Federal crime. Makes: (1) crimes involving the use of minors, firearms offenses, and alien smuggling predicate offenses under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act; and (2) serious juvenile drug offenses predicate offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act. Increases penalties for transferring a firearm to a minor, with knowledge that it will be used to commit a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. Increases the time limit within which an alleged delinquent who is in detention pending trial must be brought to trial. Requires the Secretary of State to identify qualified translators to be made available to assist Federal law enforcement agencies in criminal investigations by monitoring legal wiretaps and translating recorded conversations. Authorizes appropriations for the hiring of additional Assistant U.S. Attorneys to prosecute violent youth gangs."
