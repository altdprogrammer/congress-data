    "text": "State and Local Government Interstate Waste Control Act of 1995 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit a landfill or incinerator, effective January 1, 1996, from receiving out-of-State municipal solid waste for disposal or incineration unless the owner or operator of the landfill or incinerator obtains authorization (as part of a host community agreement) from the affected local government. Requires owners or operators to make specified information regarding the facility available prior to seeking such authorization. Authorizes State Governors, unless inconsistent with a host community agreement or permit authorizing the receipt of out-of-State waste, to limit the quantity of out-of-State waste received at landfills and incinerators that received documented shipments of such waste in 1993 (or were authorized to receive pursuant to an agreement or permit entered into prior to this Act's enactment) to an annual amount equal to the quantity received in 1993. Permits State Governors, unless inconsistent with a host community agreement or permit, to prohibit the disposal of such waste at landfills and incinerators that received such waste in 1993 (or were authorized to pursuant to a prior agreement or permit) if the waste is generated in a State determined to have exported more than the following amounts of waste to landfills or incinerators not covered by host community agreements: (1) 3.5 million tons in 1996; (2) 3 million tons in 1997 and 1998; (3) 2.5 million tons in 1999 and 2000; (4) 1.5 million tons in 2001 and 2002; and (5) 1 million tons in 2003 and thereafter. Establishes limitations on waste exports to landfills or incinerators not covered by host community agreements or permits. Exempts from the prohibition on receipt of out-of-State waste, except as otherwise provided, landfills and incinerators that: (1) received documented shipments of such waste during 1993; or (2) prior to this Act's enactment, entered into host community agreements or received permits authorizing the acceptance of such waste. Prohibits landfills or incinerators from receiving out-of-State waste in the absence of a host community agreement if the operating permit or license for the facility was denied or revoked. Permits the receipt of such waste without an authorization from the affected local government if the waste is generated within, and the landfill or incinerator is located within, the same bi-State level A metropolitan statistical area that contains two contiguous major cities located in different States."
