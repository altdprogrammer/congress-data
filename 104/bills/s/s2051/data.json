Requires that the sponsor of such a treatment drug be encouraged to design open protocols. Title II: Development, Manufacture, and Procurement of Drugs for the Addiction (sic) of Cocaine and Heroin Addictions - Requires that the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences establish criteria for an acceptable drug for the treatment of addiction to cocaine and an acceptable drug for the treatment of addiction to heroin. Allows the patent owner of a drug to treat cocaine or heroin addiction to apply to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to sell the patent rights to, or make an exclusive licensing agreement with, the Secretary. Sets the purchase amount at $100 million for the cocaine treatment drug and $50 million for the heroin treatment drug. Directs the Secretary, after the sale or licensing, to develop a manufacturing and distribution plan. Authorizes appropriations."
