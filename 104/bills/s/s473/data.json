    "text": "Nuclear Energy Policy Act of 1995 - Prohibits the building of any civilian nuclear power reactor unless there exists: (1) a facility licensed by the United States for the permanent emplacement of of high-level radioactive radioactive waste (including spent nuclear fuel) from the reactor; and (2) an adequate volume of capacity within the emplacement facility to accept all high-level radioactive waste generated by the reactor during its reasonably foreseeable operational lifetime. Limits the aggregate volume of high-level radioactive waste generated by certain civilian power reactors to the total volume of capacity available in facilities for the permanent emplacement facilities for high-level radioactive waste (including spent nuclear fuel). Permits private citizen's suits to enforce this Act."
