    "text": "Coastal Shipping Competition Act of 1996 - Amends Federal shipping law known as the Jones Act to redefine U.S. citizen to include certain corporations, partnerships, trusts, joint ventures, and other business entities organized under U.S. or State law, some (but not all) of whose officers, directors, or partners are U.S. citizens (currently all must be U.S. citizens), even though a parent corporation, partnership, or other second-tier owner, or trust beneficiary, is not a U.S. citizen. Allows a coastwise endorsement on the certificate of documentation for certain foreign qualified vessels and vessels of foreign registry (whose nation of registry extends reciprocal privileges to U.S. vessels). Renames the requirements for Great Lakes licenses and registry as inland waterways endorsements requirements. Makes conforming amendments to the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 and other related Federal law with respect to transportation of merchandise or passengers, towing and salvaging operations, dredging operations, and liability for injury or death of master or crew member."
