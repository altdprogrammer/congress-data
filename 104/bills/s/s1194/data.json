Prescribes guidelines for competitive review of such Federal grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements. Directs the Secretary to designate three marine mineral research centers, one in the continental shelf regions of the United States, the second in deep seabed and near-shore environments of islands, and the third in arctic and cold water regions. Restricts administrative expenses to not more than five percent during a fiscal year. Authorizes appropriations."
