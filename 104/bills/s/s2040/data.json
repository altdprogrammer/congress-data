Enhances penalties for certain activities involving flunitrazepam under: (1) the CSA, including manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to distribute specified quantities of flunitrazepam; and (2) the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, including possessing, manufacturing, and distributing flunitrazepam for purposes of unlawful importation. Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to amend the Sentencing Guidelines so that one dosage unit of flunitrazepam shall be equivalent to one gram of marihuana for determining the offense level under the Drug Quantity Table."
