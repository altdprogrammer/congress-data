    "text": "Crime Victim Assistance Improvement Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to increase the special assessments on convicted persons in the case of a felony. Extends the period of obligation to pay an assessment. Prohibits a person sentenced to pay a fine or restitution from being released from custody following sentencing until the person has paid the fine or restitution in full. Specifies that a restitution order may require the defendant to make payments to the court to be disbursed to the victim when necessary to protect the privacy and safety of the victim. Authorizes the court to permit the defendant to delay payment if the defendant is unable to pay. Provides for the enforcement of a sentence of a fine through an order suspending Federal benefits. Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to: (1) make a crime victim compensation program eligible for funding under such Act only if the program does not provide compensation to any person who has been convicted of a Federal offense with respect to any time period during which the person is delinquent in paying a fine or other monetary penalty imposed for the offense; and (2) exclude any amount of compensation that the applicant receives through a crime victim compensation program from the income of the applicant for purposes of any maximum allowed income eligibility requirement in any Federal, State, or local government program using Federal funds that provides assistance to crime victims, until the total amount of assistance from all such programs is sufficient to fully compensate the applicant for losses suffered as a result of the crime."
