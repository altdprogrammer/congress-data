Directs the Secretary to study: (1) the feasibility of requiring satellite-based train control systems to provide positive train control for railroad systems in the United States by January 1, 2001; and (2) the technical, structural, and economic feasibility of automatic train escape devices. Directs the Secretary, to the extent feasibility is determined, to promulgate regulations requiring installation of such control systems and train escape devices by specified dates. Directs the Secretary to establish, by regulation, minimum safety standards for fuel tanks of locomotives of rail passenger trains that take into consideration environmental protection and public safety. Directs the Secretary to determine, and report to the appropriate congressional committees, whether to promulgate regulations for public safety purposes to: (1) require crash posts at the corners of rail passenger cars; (2) require safety locomotives on rail passenger trains; (3) establish minimum crash-worthiness standards for passenger cab cars; or (4) carry out any combination of the above. Directs the Secretary to: (1) study whether to promulgate regulations requiring placement of rail signals along railways in specified positions; and (2) promulgate such regulations if the requirement is determined necessary. Requires a report to the Congress if such placement is determined unnecessary."
