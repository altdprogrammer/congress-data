Imposes the tax on such products held in a foreign trade zone on the date of the tax increase if taxes have been determined or customs duties liquidated. Doubles the amount transferred to the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund from revenues resulting from the tax on special motor fuels, gasoline, and diesel fuel. Establishes in such Fund the following separate accounts to which a portion of such fuel tax revenues shall be transferred for capital or capital-related expenditures before October 1, 1997: (1) an AMTRAK Account; (2) an Interstate and Federal-Aid Highway Account; and (3) a State and Local Roads and Bridges Account."
