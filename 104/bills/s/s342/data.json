Requires the Secretary to provide technical assistance and to detail two employees to the Commission. (Sec. 111) Directs Federal entities conducting or supporting activities directly affecting the flow of the Cache La Poudre River through the Corridor or its natural resources to consult with the Commission with respect to such activities. Authorizes the Secretary or the Administrator of a Federal agency to acquire land in the Corridor's floodplain by exchange for other lands within such agency's jurisdiction within Colorado, based on fair market value, to be used to fulfill the purposes for which the Corridor is established. Requires that such lands be identified by the Commission for acquisition by a Federal agency and that the Governor and political subdivision of Colorado or the owner where the lands are located concur in the exchange. Authorizes the Administrator of General Services to convey, without monetary consideration to the United States, to Colorado, its political subdivisions, or instrumentalities thereof, all U.S. right, title, and interest in and to any surplus real property within such State which the Secretary determines is suitable and desirable to meet the purposes for which the Corridor is established. (Sec. 112) Directs the Commission and the Secretary, in carrying out this Act, to emphasize voluntary cooperation.
