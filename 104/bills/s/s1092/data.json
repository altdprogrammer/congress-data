    "text": "Free Burma Act of 1995 - Imposes specified sanctions against Burma, unless the President certifies to appropriate congressional committees that Burma has: (1) unconditionally released all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi; (2) implemented the results of the 1990 elections, including the transfer of power to civilian authority and the protection of basic human rights; and (3) implemented an effective counternarcotics effort. (Sec. 3) Directs the President to initiate negotiations with foreign countries the United States trades with for the purpose of entering into agreements to: (1) support U.S. sanctions against Burma; and (2) cease trade with and investment in Burma. Directs the President, if he certifies to the Congress that a country has failed to enter into an agreement, or has entered into an agreement but is not enforcing it, to withdraw: (1) any designation of such country as a beneficiary developing country or beneficiary country under specified Acts; (2) special duty rate status under column one of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States; and (3) most-favored-nation treatment status. (Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. executive director of each multilateral financial institution to vote against any loan for China until the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees it has terminated arms sales and other arms transfers to Burma. (Sec. 6) Directs the President to withhold all U.S. assistance to Thailand until he certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that it is cooperating in providing support and relief for Burmese exiles and refugees. (Sec. 7) Requires the President to report to the appropriate congressional committees on: (1) the chemical and biological weapons capability of Burma; (2) a plan to provide U.S. assistance in support of the democracy movement in Burma; (3) the treatment by Thailand of Burmese students, refugees, and exiles resident there; and (4) the status of arms sales and other arms transfers to Burma, including the amount of expenditures by it in the acquisition of arms."
