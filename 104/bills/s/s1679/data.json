Directs the Congressional Research Service to prepare and make public, after each Congress adjourns sine die, a report on the extent of Federal statutory preemption of State and local government powers enacted into law during the preceding Congress or adopted through judicial interpretation of Federal statutes. Requires copies of such report to be sent to the President and appropriate congressional committee chairmen."
