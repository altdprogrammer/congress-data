(Sec. 103) Permits punitive damages, to the extent permitted by applicable Federal or State law, in any civil action in a Federal or State court against a defendant if the claimant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the harm suffered was the result of conduct that is either specifically intended to cause harm or carried out with conscious, flagrant disregard for the rights or safety of other persons. Prohibits punitive damages in the absence of an award of compensatory damages exceeding nominal damages. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) limits on punitive damage awards involving certain drugs and medical devices; (2) pleading of punitive damages; (3) bifurcation of trial at the defendant's request; and (4) limits on awards. Title II: Joint and Several Liability Reform - Provides that in any civil action for personal injury, wrongful death, or based upon principles of comparative fault, the liability of each defendant for noneconomic damages shall be several only and not joint. Makes each defendant liable only for the amount of noneconomic damages allocated to such defendant in direct proportion to such defendant's percentage of responsibility. Directs that a separate judgment be rendered against such defendant for that amount. Requires the trier of fact to determine the proportion of responsibility of each person for the claimant's harm whether or not such person is a party to the action. Specifies that this title shall not preempt or supersede any Federal or State law to the extent that such law would further limit the application of joint liability to any kind of damages. Title III: Civil Procedural Reform - Revises rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) to require (current law authorizes) the court to impose sanctions upon attorneys, law firms, or parties that have violated provisions regarding abusive litigation practices. Requires sanctions imposed for violation of that rule to be sufficient to compensate the parties that were injured by the conduct. Specifies that nothing in that rule limits the inherent power of the Federal courts to sanction misconduct of attorneys or parties appearing before such courts. (Sec. 302) Expresses the sense of the Congress that each State should require each attorney admitted to practice in such State to disclose in writing, to any client with whom such attorney has entered into a contingency fee agreement, the actual services performed, the precise number of hours expended, and whether a referral fee was paid. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) study and evaluate contingent fee awards and their abuses; (2) develop model State legislation; and (3) prepare and disseminate to State authorities the findings made and model legislation developed. (Sec. 303) Amends: (1) rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence regarding expert testimony; and (2) rule 68 of the FRCP regarding offers of judgment or settlement. Title IV: Health Care Liability Reform - Provides that in any health care liability action, in addition to actual damages, punitive damages, or both, a claimant may be awarded noneconomic damages in an amount not to exceed $250,000, regardless of the number of parties against whom the action is brought or the number of claims or actions brought with respect to the health care injury. Prohibits an award for future noneconomic damages in such an action from being discounted to present value. Sets forth provisions regarding reductions in jury awards and applicability of this title. (Sec. 402) Establishes a two-year statute of limitations for the initiation of a health care liability action, with an exception for minors. (Sec. 403) Sets forth provisions regarding the periodic payment of future damages. (Sec. 404) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to one or more States to establish demonstration projects under which the State establishes a no-fault medical liability system, subject to specified requirements. Authorizes appropriations. Title V: Control of Abusive Prisoner Litigation Practices - Amends the Federal judicial code to allow a Federal court to authorize the commencement, prosecution, or defense of any proceeding with payment of a partial fee or of the total fees and costs in installment payments. Requires: (1) a prisoner who files an affidavit of inability to pay to include in the affidavit a statement of all assets the prisoner possesses; (2) the court to make inquiry of the correctional institution in which the prisoner is incarcerated regarding the prisoner's assets and to require full or partial payment of filing fees according to the prisoner's ability to pay; and (3) the court to dismiss the case if the allegation of poverty is untrue, if satisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious (current law) or fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted, or if the claim is insubstantial in that the plaintiff suffered no injury or an insubstantial injury, even if partial filing fees have been imposed by the court. (Sec. 503) Amends the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act to prohibit any civil action for deprivation of rights from being brought by an adult convicted of a crime confined in any correctional facility until available plain, speedy, and effective administrative remedies are exhausted. Repeals a provision requiring that the minimum standards provide for an advisory role for employees and inmates in the formulation, implementation, and operation of the system. Requires the Attorney General to develop a procedure for the prompt review and certification of systems for the resolution of grievances of adults confined in any correctional or pretrial detention facility if such systems are in substantial compliance with the minimum standards (current law) or are otherwise fair and effective. Title VI: Miscellaneous Provisions - Specifies that this Act shall not provide a basis for Federal court jurisdiction under specified provisions."
