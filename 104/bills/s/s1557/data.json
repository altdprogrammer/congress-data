    "text": "Economic Security Act of 1996 - Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to impose penalties upon individuals and corporations that engage in economic espionage, or that attempt, conspire, or solicit others to do so, in order to aid foreign nations, governments, corporations, institutions, instrumentalities, or agents. Provides for the forfeiture of any property that is used to commit, or that constitutes or is derived from any proceeds obtained as the result of, such violation. Authorizes: (1) the President to prohibit for a period of up to five years the importation into, or exportation from, the United States of any product produced, made, assembled, or manufactured by a person convicted of any such offense; and (2) the Attorney General to impose a civil penalty (after notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record) not to exceed five times the value of the exports or imports involved or $100,000, whichever is greater, against any person who knowingly violates any such presidential order. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) extraterritoriality; (2) construction with other laws; (3) confidentiality; and (4) law enforcement and intelligence activities. Includes economic espionage among the offenses with respect to which the Attorney General may authorize an application for, and a Federal judge may grant, an order authorizing interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications."
