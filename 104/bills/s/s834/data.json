Subtitle B: Welfare Block Grant Program - Replaces various specified current welfare programs, including the cash aid component of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, child welfare and nutrition programs, the food stamp and supplemental security income programs, and housing, energy, and job training programs, with a single program of block grants to the States to provide: (1) aid to low-income households in the State, with food assistance provided, at the strong encouragement of the Congress, through food commodities directly purchased by the State, while providing for the Medicaid-eligibility of low-income individuals; (2) appropriate services and activities to discourage out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and (3) care for the children of such pregnancies. Sets forth special rules and reporting requirements regarding the use of program funds, including a prohibition on their use for abortion to plan families and aid to noncitizen and fugitive felons and probation or parole violators.

(Sec. 403) Recommends that a State providing direct cash assistance from welfare block grant funds to an AFDC equivalent family, in determining eligibility for such assistance, consider as income of the applicant family, any rent or housing subsidy provided by the State, to the extent that the value of such subsidy is equivalent to the amount for housing included in the maximum amount payable to a family of the same composition with no other income. Title V: Child Support Enforcement - Establishes a national system for reporting information on employee child support obligations through modified W-4 form reporting.
