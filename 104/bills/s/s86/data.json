Prohibits a nursing facility from receiving reimbursement under the Medicare program under title XVIII, the Medicaid program, or any other Federal program for services furnished with respect to any beds first operated by such facility on or after the date of the enactment of this Act, unless a certificate of need is issued by the State with respect to them. Allows a State to issue such a certificate of need with respect to a geographic area only if the ratio of the number of nursing facility beds in such area to the total area population likely to need such beds is below the ratio included in guidelines the State must establish, with the approval of the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
