Directs the Secretary of Defense to allocate necessary reductions in authorizations of appropriations as a result of such limitation so as not to jeopardize the military readiness of the Armed Forces or the quality of life of Armed Forces personnel. Requires application of savings from such reductions to reduce the budget deficit for FY 1997."
