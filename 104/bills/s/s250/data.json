    "text": "Amends the Federal judicial code to require the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to prepare an analysis of each bill or resolution reported by any congressional committee which shall include: (1) estimates of the litigation costs to the Federal and State courts, attorney fees, and increased liability incurred by Federal, State, and local government agencies and by the private sector that would result from enactment of such legislation in the fiscal year in which it is to become effective and in each of the four fiscal years thereafter; (2) the basis for each estimate; and (3) a description of each method for establishing a Federal financial commitment contained in such legislation. Makes such provisions inapplicable to any private legislation or legislation reported by the Appropriations Committees of each House. Requires: (1) the Director to submit the analysis to each appropriate committee, to the greatest extent practicable, before the committee files the applicable legislation reported by the committee; and (2) the committee to include the analysis in the committee report accompanying the applicable reported bill or resolution. Requires the Director, at the request of a Senator, to provide an analysis for any legislation not reported by a committee to be considered by the Senate and any amendment to be offered in the Senate. Specifies that it shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any legislation (other than private legislation) that is not reported by a committee and is to be considered by the Senate, and any amendment to be offered in the Senate other than one relating to appropriations, for which an analysis prepared by the Director has not been submitted to the appropriate committee or the Secretary of the Senate. Allows this provision to be waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members."
