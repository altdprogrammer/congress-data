Establishes in the Treasury an Architect of the Capitol, Capitol Buildings and Grounds, Capitol Visitor Center, Gifts and Donations account. Authorizes the: (1) AOC to enter into contracts, using noncompetitive procedures, to carry out this Act with respect to the Center; and (2) Commission to establish and delegate its functions under this Act to a Special Committee which shall provide the AOC with all necessary oversight and direction.
