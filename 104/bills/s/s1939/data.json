Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) make information available to the public concerning livestock slaughtered or marketed in the United States, and captive market transactions; (2) monitor antitrust and anticompetitive activities among packers and stockyards; and (3) collect and disseminate marketing information on a national, regional, and local basis. (Sec. 5) Amends the Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967 to make it an unfair trade practice to fail to act in good faith with producer cooperatives. (Sec. 6) Amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act with respect to grade labeling of imported meat. (Sec. 7) Directs the Secretary to establish a livestock industry commission."
