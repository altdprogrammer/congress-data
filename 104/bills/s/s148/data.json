    "text": "Investment Advisers Integrity Act - Authorizes appropriations to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to enforce the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 with respect to investment advisers who manage more than $5 million in assets. Exempts from SEC registration requirements investment advisers who, during the preceding 12 months, managed less than $5 million in assets, if they are registered with their State securities regulator. Authorizes the SEC to impose registration requirements upon investment managers who, during the preceding 12 months, had more than $1 million but less than $5 million in assets under management if it determines such action is necessary to effectuate the purposes of the Act. Authorizes the SEC to investigate allegations of fraud against an investment adviser regardless of the adviser's exception from registration requirements. Directs the SEC to censure or restrict the activities of all convicted felons, or to disqualify them from registration."
