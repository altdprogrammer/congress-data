Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on the assessment and a plan setting forth proposed actions to address each identified risk. (Sec. 102) Eliminates Federal grants to States for development of a one-call (before digging) notification system that informs a pipeline facility operator of activity in the vicinity that could threaten the facility's safety. (Sec. 103) Authorizes the Secretary to participate in international forums that establish or recommend pipeline safety standards for transporting natural gas and hazardous liquids. Provides that the Secretary is not required to prescribe a standard identical to or less stringent or more stringent than a standard adopted by an international authority, or otherwise limit his or her discretion in issuing such standards. (Sec. 104) Authorizes the Secretary to enter into grants, cooperative agreements, and other transactions with any person, agency, or U.S. instrumentality, any State or local government, any educational institution, and any other entity to further pipeline safety, including the development, improvement, and promotion of one-call damage prevention programs, research, risk assessment, and mapping. (Sec. 105) Repeals the requirement for the Secretary's annual report concerning natural gas and hazardous liquid safety. (Sec. 106) Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Aviation Tariff Amendment - Repeals the Secretary's authority and responsibility to be custodian of aviation tariff records. Requires the Secretary to ensure that such tariff records be made available to the public on a permanent basis. Title III: Hazardous Materials Amendments - Revises the requirement that a person who is required to provide a shipping paper to a carrier when offering hazardous material for transportation in commerce, and a carrier to which such paper is provided, retain a paper or electronic image copy of such paper for one year after the material is no longer in transportation. Changes the retention period to one year from the date the shipping paper has been provided to the carrier."
