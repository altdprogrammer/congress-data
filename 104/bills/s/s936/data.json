    "text": "Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act of 1995 - Revises provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act regarding the Chesapeake Bay to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) continue the Chesapeake Bay Program; and (2) maintain a Chesapeake Bay Program Office. Requires the Office to support the Chesapeake Executive Council (signatories of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement to protect the Bay) by: (1) implementing activities that support the Program; (2) making available information pertaining to the environmental quality and living resources of the Bay; (3) assisting the signatories in implementing action plans; (4) assisting in the development of strategies to improve Bay water quality and living resources; and (5) implementing outreach programs. Establishes a Chesapeake Bay Federal Agencies Committee to coordinate Federal activities relating to Bay restoration. Directs: (1) the Administrator, at the request of a State affected by the interstate management plan developed pursuant to the Program, to make a grant to implement management mechanisms contained in the plan if the State has approved and committed to implement all or substantially all aspects of the plan; and (2) Federal agencies that own or operate facilities within the Bay watershed to assess the facilities to ensure Program compliance and include a plan or program for addressing such impacts in the report to the President. Requires the Administrator to: (1) establish a habitat restoration program in the watershed to develop and demonstrate cost-effective techniques for restoring wetlands, forest riparian zones, and other Bay habitats (and authorizes grants to public or private entities to carry out such programs); and (2) develop a basinwide toxics reduction strategy, as well as research and monitoring to improve understanding of intermedia transfers of toxic pollutants and the ultimate fate of the pollutants within the Bay ecosystem (and authorizes financial assistance for specified activities). Directs the Administrator to study and report to the Congress: (1) evaluating implementation of the Agreement; (2) determining whether Federal environmental programs and other activities adequately address the priority needs identified in the Agreement; (3) assessing the priority needs required by the Program management strategies and how the priorities are being met; and (4) making recommendations for improved Program management. Authorizes appropriations."
