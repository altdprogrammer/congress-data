(Sec. 3) Authorizes appropriations. Title I: Streamlining and Consolidation - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) any budget savings realized through elimination or consolidation of programs under this title should be reinvested in the national job training (or workforce development) system; and (2) elimination or merging of programs should be done without reducing the Federal commitment or level of effort to improve education, employment, and earnings of all workers, particularly hard-to-serve individuals. (Sec. 102) Repeals the provisons of various Federal laws for certain employment training programs, including specified ones under the Food Stamp Act of 1977, Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965, Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Federal Transit Act, Displaced Homemaker Self-Sufficiency Assistance Act, Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act, Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), and Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. (Sec. 103) Repeals provisions for certain adult job training and employment programs under the JTPA, Wagner-Peyser Act, Trade Act of 1974, Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980, and Older Americans Act of 1965. Requires any State receiving an implementation grant (to develop an integrated workforce development system) to include the components of these repealed programs and activities in such system. Allows any such State to include additional programs in such system, under certain conditions. (Sec. 104) Directs the National Workforce Development Board (established under title II) to advise on consolidation of workforce development programs through: (1) recommendations to the President and the Congress for the elimination of Federal workforce development programs, or programs whose functions should be subsumed under other Federal programs; (2) a report and recommendations for proposed reforms to specified congressional committees based on its analysis of the experience of leading edge States and the progress toward establishing an integrated workforce development system; and (3) a draft of a joint resolution to the Congress with provisions to develop a streamlined, integrated, federally supported workforce development system, from listed programs and any other appropriate Federal program (including recommendations for standard program measures and a description of how the new system will maintain services to hard-to-serve populations). (Sec. 105) Directs the President to establish an expedited process to consider and act on requests by States for waivers of laws and regulations for specified programs for: (1) two years to facilitate provision of assistance for workforce development, for States not receiving implementation grants; or (2) the duration of the implementation grant, for States receiving such grants. Title II: Market Building Activities - Subtitle A: Federal Level Activities - Establishes the National Workforce Development Board (the Board).

Directs the Board to review development, implementation, and matching incentive grant proposals. Terminates the Board after it submits to the President and the Congress the joint resolution to develop a streamlined, integrated, federally supported workforce development system required by title I. Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to repeal the establishment of the National Commission for Employment Policy. Replaces references to such Commission with references to the Board.

Directs the Secretary to use specified information clearinghouses and other entities to: (1) collect and disseminate information to help States and localities to streamline and reform their job training systems; and (2) facilitate exchange of information and ideas among States and localities carrying out job training reform initiatives. Requires the Board to determine whether any proposed Federal job training legislation complies with data reporting, common definitions, and common funding cycles provisions under this Act. Makes it out of order for the Senate or House of Representatives to consider any bill or resolution concerning workforce development that would not comply with the national workforce development system, as determined by the Board. Requires a three-fifths affirmative vote to waive or suspend such requirement in the Senate or House. (Sec. 204) Establishes a quality assurance system. Directs the Secretaries of Labor, of Education, and of Health and Human Services to jointly develop common terms and definitions and a placement accountability system and adjust existing program performance standards. Directs the Board to recommend a system of performance standards in its joint resolution to the Congress that includes standard outcome measures relating to employment, job retention, earnings, and nonemployment outcome measures (such as learning and competency gains). Requires each workforce development program that receives Federal funds to collect, and report to the Governor and State Council, specified information relating to each participant's: (1) quarterly employment status and earnings for one year after no longer receiving program assistance; (2) economic and demographic characteristics; (3) services received and spending for them; (4) program outcomes; and (5) other data that may be added as the Board develops other standard definitions. Requires that program monitoring under these provisions supplant existing monitoring and reporting requirements for program participants. Directs each Federal department and agency with responsibility for a workforce development program to report to the Board on its progress in adopting common terms and definitions for program participants, service activities, and outcomes by program operators and grant recipients. Directs the Board to make recommendations to: (1) the Secretaries and heads of other agencies operating workforce development programs, on common definitions for other terms; and (2) the Congress, on legislative action if any of the proposed common definitions require amendment to existing laws. Establishes a placement accountability system for all federally funded workforce development programs. Requires each such program to: (1) monitor its own performance by measuring quarterly employment status and earnings of each participant for one year after he or she no longer receives program assistance; and (2) provide required information on participants, to be matched by information from the State agency for labor market information which shall be reimbursed by the requesting program with Federal funds. Directs the State agency to submit the results of the matching to the State Council. Requires the Governor to ensure submission of matched data to the State Council, the Board, the Secretary (of Labor), and other Federal entities.
