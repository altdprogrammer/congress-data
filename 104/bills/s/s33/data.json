    "text": "Amends the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to revise general financial responsibility requirements for offshore facilities. Requires responsible parties (except as provided in provisions regarding deepwater ports) to maintain financial responsibility as described by this Act with respect to offshore facilities seaward of the U.S. coastline that are used for drilling for, producing, or processing oil or that have the capacity to transport, store, transfer, or handle more than 1,000 barrels of oil at any one time. Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to determine the amount of financial responsibility based on an assessment of the facility's risk to meet the amount of liability for oil pollution to which a responsible party could be subjected in a case in which the party would be entitled to limit liability. Requires such amount to range from $35 million to $150 million. Provides that in cases where a person is the responsible party for more than one facility, evidence of responsibility need be established only to meet the maximum liability applicable to the facility having the greatest maximum liability."
