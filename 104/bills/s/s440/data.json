Authorizes the Secretary to make modifications proposed by a State that meet the criteria established for, and that enhance the national transportation characteristics of, the NHS. Directs the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees for approval modifications to the NHS that are proposed by a State that consist of connectors to major ports, airports, international border crossings, public transportation and transit facilities, interstate bus terminals, and rail and other intermodal transportation facilities. Permits such modifications to take effect only if approved by law. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) interim eligibility of such an intermodal connector for NHS funds pending such approval; and (2) approval of subsequent modifications by the Secretary. Requires, in proposing modifications: (1) a State to cooperate with local and regional officials; and (2) local officials in urbanized areas to act through the metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) designated for such areas. Requires the Secretary, upon the completion of feasibility studies, to add to the NHS any congressional high priority corridor or segment thereof established by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) which was not identified on the NHS. Title II: Transportation Funding Flexibility - Directs the Secretary to allocate among the States specified sums for FY 1996 and 1997 for projects eligible for assistance under Federal-aid highway provisions. Specifies allocation percentages by State. Provides that such allocations shall not affect a State's minimum allocation of Federal-aid highway funds or specified allocations under ISTEA. Sets forth provisions regarding the apportionment of such funds, the applicability of obligation limitations of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, a special rule for determining the percentage of an allocation for obligation in urbanized areas with a population of over 200,000, and limits on the percentage of an allocation that may be used for planning expenditures. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 203) Rescinds funds from specified previously authorized projects and from unobligated balances of funds previously made available and derived from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). Reduces the authorized funding levels for certain magnetic levitation and highway safety programs funded from the HTF. Transfers certain funds derived from the HTF made available for the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program to carry out projects eligible for assistance under Federal-aid highway provisions. (Sec. 204) Directs the Secretary: (1) to notify each State of the total amount of the reduction in authorized funds for FY 1996 that would have been allocated and apportioned to such State as a result of specified ISTEA provisions; and (2) in determining such amount, to deduct the amount allocated to each State in FY 1996 to carry out Federal-aid highway projects under this Act. Requires: (1) each State to designate unobligated balances of funds apportioned or allocated on or before September 30, 1995, and which are subject to the obligation ceiling, that may be made available to carry out Federal-aid highway projects; and (2) the Secretary to make such funds available to the States. Prohibits unobligated balances of funds attributed to urbanized areas with a population of over 200,000 from being designated by the State without the written concurrence of the MPO designated for such area.

(Sec. 348) Prohibits the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from requiring adoption or implementation by a State of a test-only I-M240 enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance program as a means of compliance with specified provisions of the CAA, but permits the Administrator to approve such a program if a State chooses to adopt the program as a means of compliance with such provisions. Bars the Administrator from disapproving or applying an automatic discount to a State implementation plan revision on the basis of a policy, regulation, or guideline providing for a discount of emissions credits because the inspection and maintenance program in such plan revision is decentralized or is a test-and-repair program. Authorizes a State to submit an implementation plan revision proposing an interim inspection and maintenance program under the CAA.
