Revises the definition of \"visual depiction\" to include data stored on computer disk or by electronic means which is capable of conversion into a visual image. Increases and expands the scope of penalties for sexual exploitation of children. Revises provisions regarding activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors, including providing enhanced penalties for offenders having a prior conviction. Amends the Privacy Protection Act of 1980 to authorize certain searches and seizures of work product materials and other documents if an offense involves the production, possession, receipt, mailing, sale, distribution, shipment, or transportation of child pornography, or the sale or purchase of children. Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act of 1996 - Modifies code provisions regarding aggravated sexual abuse and sexual abuse of a minor, including by: (1) setting penalties for crossing a State line with intent to engage in a sexual act with a person under age 12; and (2) providing for life imprisonment (unless the death penalty is imposed) for violation of such provisions if the defendant has previously been convicted of specified Federal or State offenses involving aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse of a minor."
