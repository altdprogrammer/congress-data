    "text": "Pipeline Safety Enhancement Act of 1995 - Amends Federal pipeline safety law to direct the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe minimum standards: (1) for toughness for new pipes installed in gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities (with particular attention to new pipes in high-density population areas); (2) that require the marking of pipelines in class three and four locations to identify hazardous liquid pipeline facilities and high-pressure pipelines; and (3) that require operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities to conduct periodic inspections or tests for identifying damage caused by corrosion and other time-dependent damage that may be detrimental to the safe operation of the pipeline and necessitate remedial action, in order to determine the adequacy of such pipeline to operate at established maximum allowable operating pressure. Requires the Secretary to conduct biennial assessments of the aforementioned safety programs. Requires the Secretary to expedite the study by the Research and Special Programs Administration of the Department of Transportation concerning the methods to reduce public safety risks in the siting of pipeline facilities."
