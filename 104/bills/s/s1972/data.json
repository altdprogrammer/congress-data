Authorizes the Assistant Secretary on Aging to waive or exempt certain Act reporting requirements for applicants serving Indian populations in geographically-isolated areas or applicants serving small Indian populations. Requires the Assistant Secretary, when considering approval of applications for nutrition services expenditures under the Act, to provide maximum flexibility to applicants seeking to take into account subsistence needs, local customs, and other characteristics unique to Indian populations. Requires, in determining Act compliance, that applicants provide only a narrative description of the area to be served and assurances of non- duplicative services."
