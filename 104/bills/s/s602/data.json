    "text": "NATO Participation Act Amendments of 1995 - Amends the NATO Participation Act of 1994 to expand eligibility for participation in a program to assist in transition to full North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership to European countries emerging from communist domination (currently, countries emerging from communist domination that are participating in the Partnership for Peace program). (Sec. 4) Revises conditions on such assistance to permit participation only if the President reports to designated congressional committees that the country: (1) has made significant progress toward establishing shared values and interests, a democratic government (currently, democratic institutions), a free market economy (as currently required), civilian control of the police and intelligence services (as well as of the military, as currently required), adherence to the Helsinki Final Act of the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and more transparent defense budgets and is participating in the Partnership for Peace defense planning process; (2) has made public commitments regarding NATO; (3) is not ineligible for foreign assistance with respect to the transfer of defense articles to states supporting terrorism; and (4) could, within five years, be in a position to further the principles of NATO and contribute to its own security and that of the North Atlantic area. Prohibits the appropriation of funds for activities associated with the Partnership for Peace program or the Warsaw Initiative until the President designates at least one country to participate in the transition program. Adds economic support fund, peacekeeping operations, and Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund assistance to the list of assistance available to participants in the NATO transition program. Adds to such list, as well, authority for the Department of Defense to pay excess defense articles costs for countries designated for both grant lethal and nonlethal excess articles, and authority to convert Foreign Military Financing Program (FMF) loans to grants, and grants to loans, for eligible countries. Earmarks international military education and training assistance for the placement of additional military personnel from designated countries at U.S. military education institutions, and for the placement of U.S. instructors at military educational centers in eligible countries. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the President to expend a specified amount of foreign assistance funds in support of countries designated to receive assistance for transition into NATO membership. (Sec. 6) Sets forth conditions under which the President may terminate a country's eligibility, unless the Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving such action."
