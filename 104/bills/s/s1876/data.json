Eliminates coverage for departing Members of Congress. Repeals all of the above on and after the date on which a statute has been enacted that: (1) makes health coverage for U.S. citizens portable by limiting exclusions for preexisting conditions; (2) guarantees availability of health insurance to U.S. citizens; and (3) guarantees renewability of health insurance coverage to employers and individuals."
