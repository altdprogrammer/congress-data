    "text": "Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act of 1995 - Directs: (1) the Secretary of Transportation to provide for the establishment of a nationwide toll-free telephone number system to be used by State one-call notification systems; and (2) each State to consider whether to adopt a comprehensive statewide one-call notification program as described in this Act to protect underground facilities from damage due to excavation. Sets forth provisions regarding program elements, including 24-hour coverage for emergency excavation, effective mechanisms for penalties and enforcement, a fair schedule of fees to cover the costs of providing for, maintaining, and operating the State program, and an opportunity for citizen suits to enforce such program. Requires States to consider establishing specified civil penalties for violations by excavators or facilitiy operators. Requires the Secretary to: (1) make grants to States, or to operators of one-call notification systems in such States, to establish and maintain a State program pursuant to this Act; (2) review and report to the Congress on the extent to which any policies, programs, and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) could be used to achieve the purposes of this title; (3) develop and make available to States a model State program; and (4) consult with other agencies as to the availability and affordability of technologies which will help relocate pipelines from above-ground and remote locations."
