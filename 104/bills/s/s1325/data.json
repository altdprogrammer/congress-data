Permits such beneficiaries to further request a review of such a bill by the appropriate fiscal intermediary or carrier under contract to administer Medicare benefits for any billing irregularities. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to require such entities to take all appropriate measures to recover amounts inappropriately paid because of such irregularities. Subjects providers submitting fraudulent billings to a certain civil money penalty in addition to any other penalties that may be prescribed by law. Provides for antifraud incentive payments (out of collected penalties) to Medicare beneficiaries who request itemized billings later found to contain irregularities of a negligent or fraudulent nature."
