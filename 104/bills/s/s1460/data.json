    "text": "International Dolphin Protection and Consumer Information Act of 1995 - Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to allow authorizations for the incidental taking of marine mammals during commercial yellowfin tuna fishing. Removes provisions requiring that, for purse seine yellowfin fishing, the goal of reducing incidental kill or serious injury to insignificant levels approaching zero be satisfied by the best safety techniques and equipment economically and technologically practicable. Modifies requirements regarding export by another nation to the United States of yellowfin tuna harvested with purse seine nets in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Exempts a U.S. citizen from the Act in specified circumstances. Changes requirements regarding the issuance of general permits for the taking of marine mammals. Amends the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act regarding the circumstances in which tuna products may be labeled \"Dolphin Safe,\" including allowing such labeling if (among other qualifying circumstances) with regard to harvesting outside the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, the vessel's captain (or in certain circumstances the captain and an observer) state that no purse seine net was intentionally deployed on or to encircle dolphins during the voyage. Mandates implementing regulations. (Sec. 5) Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to declare that it is U.S. policy to support the International Dolphin Conservation Program and to ensure that the U.S. market does not act as an incentive to tuna harvesting that is not in compliance with the Program. Mandates regulations to authorize and govern the incidental taking of marine mammals in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Authorizes emergency regulations in certain circumstances. Authorizes undertaking or supporting scientific research to further the Program's goals. Mandates specified other research. Authorizes appropriations for the mandated research. Repeals existing research program provisions. Repeals provisions relating to bans on imports from countries failing to implement a moratorium on purse seine harvesting of tuna. Replaces provisions concerning permits for taking dolphins with provisions mandating issuance of a permit to a U.S. vessel authorizing participation in the Program. Prohibits U.S. vessels from encircling dolphins with purse seine nets while fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean without such a permit. Authorizes permit sanctions for violations of prohibited acts provisions of the Act. Modifies the list of prohibited acts. (Sec. 6) Amends the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950 to modify the composition of the U.S. representation on the International Commission for the Scientific Investigation of Tuna and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission. Modifies requirements regarding a related advisory committee."
