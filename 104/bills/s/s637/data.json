    "text": "Adoption Antidiscrimination Act of 1995 - Prohibits any entity (including a State) that receives Federal funds and is involved in adoption or foster care placements from: (1) denying to any person the opportunity to become an adoptive or foster parent on the basis of race, color, or national origin of either the person or the child; or (2) delaying or denying the placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or discriminating in making a placement decision on the basis of such factors. Sets forth penalties for violations of this Act. Precludes State immunity under the 11th Amendment to the Constitution for violations of this Act. Exempts the Indian Child Welfare Act from the application of this Act. Repeals specified provisions of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (regarding racial matching in the child adoption process)."
