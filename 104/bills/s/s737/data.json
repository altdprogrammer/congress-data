    "text": "Federal Power Act Amendments of 1996 - Exempts certain transmission line facilities associated with the El Vado Hydroelectric Project in New Mexico from Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licensing requirements. Amends the Federal Power Act (FPA) to prescribe circumstances under which certain hydroelectric projects in Alaska having a power production capacity of 5,000 kilowatts or less shall be subject to the licensing authority of the State in lieu of FERC. Grants the licensee of a currently FERC-licensed project the discretion to subject such project to the State's authorizing authority. Subjects any State authorization for a project located on Federal lands to the approval of the Secretary with jurisdiction over such lands, and to such terms and conditions as that Secretary may prescribe. Declares that nothing shall preempt the application of Federal environment, natural, or cultural resources protection laws according to their terms. Excludes from FERC voluntary licensing jurisdiction any hydroelectric projects upon fresh waters in Hawaii, unless a license would be required because: (1) the waters are navigable; or (2) the projects affect interstate commerce, are located on Federal lands, or use water from a government dam. Directs FERC to extend for three consecutive two-year periods, upon request of a certain licensee, the time required to commence construction of specified hydroelectric projects in the State of Illinois. Suspends certain FPA use and occupancy fees for a five-year period with respect to a State of Montana political subdivision that accepts the terms of a FERC license for a specified hydroelectric project in Granite and Deer Lodge Counties. Requires payment of such fees in an amount up to $20,000 for any year, after the five-year period, for as long as such subdivision holds such license."
