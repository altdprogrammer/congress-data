Declares it to be congressional policy to provide the necessary resources, leadership, and coordination to take certain actions, such as to develop and implement effective methods of preventing and reducing youth violence and to encourage parental involvement in treatment and alternative disposition programs. (Sec. 102) Replaces the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention with an Office of Youth Violence Reduction, headed by an Administrator. Modifies provisions regarding State plans to require a State, to be eligible to receive formula grants under the Act, to take specified steps, such as: (1) ensuring that not less than 75 percent of certain funds made available to the State are used for prevention and non-incarcerative intervention and for other specified purposes; and (2) addressing prevention efforts to reduce the proportion of minority juveniles detained or confined in secure detention facilities, jails, and lockups. Revises the Act to: (1) make the National Institute for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention a part of the Office of Justice Programs, supervised and directed by a Director of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention; (2) direct the Institute to make grants and enter into contracts to evaluate programs established and funded with State formula grants, research and demonstration projects funded by the National Institute of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency, and discretionary funding of the Office of Youth Violence Reduction; and (3) authorize appropriations. (Sec. 103) Authorizes appropriations for the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. (Sec. 104) Repeals provisions regarding: (1) a special study and report on obstacles for individuals with legal custody in recovering children from parents who have taken them in violation of law; and (2) incentive grants for local delinquency prevention programs. Title II: Amendments in Other Law - Repeals provisions of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 regarding: (1) drug abuse education and prevention; and (2) an investigation and report by the Comptroller General of the United States on the extent to which valid and invalid court orders are used to place juveniles in secure detention and correctional facilities and in jails and lockups for adults. (Sec. 202) Amends the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 to authorize appropriations. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Attorney General to enter into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study concerning crime and violence by juveniles, including the status of research and information on causes and responses. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations."
