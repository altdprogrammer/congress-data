Mandates: (1) periodic revisions to regulations to ensure the prevention of the introduction and spread of ANS into the Hudson River; (2) multilingual education and technical assistance measures to encourage guideline compliance; (3) studies, regarding the Chesapeake Bay and other U.S. waters, on trends in ballast water releases and the attributes and patters of ANS invasions from ballast water releases; and (4) a ballast water management program for the seagoing fleet of the Navy to limit ANS invasion risk. Authorizes appropriations to develop and implement provisions relating to prevention of unintentional introductions of ANS."
