    "text": "Amends the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (Goals 2000) to eliminate the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (the Council). Eliminates the requirement that the National Education Goals Panel review and approve model or national content standards, national student performance standards, or national opportunity-to-learn standards. Terminates funding for: (1) the Council; (2) opportunity-to-learn development grants; and (3) assessment development and evaluation grants. Revises Goals 2000 provisions for State improvement plans to eliminate Federal requirements with respect to: (1) the composition, duties, and procedures of the broad-based State panel which is to develop such plans in cooperation with the State educational agency and the Governor; (2) establishment of opportunity-to-learn standards and strategies; and (3) peer review and approval by the Secretary of Education of such plans and their amendments. Revises provisions for the Secretary's review of State educational agency applications for Goals 2000 funds to eliminate certain conditions of approval. Revises provisions for Goals 2000 subgrants for local reform and professional development to eliminate certain requirements with respect to local panel appointments, composition, and procedures in developing local plans. Authorizes the Secretary to bypass any State that does not participate in the Goals 2000 program and use its allotment to award competitive grants to local educational agencies in such State with applications approved by the Secretary. Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the General Education Provisions Act, and the Education Amendments of 1978."
