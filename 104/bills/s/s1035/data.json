Authorizes health care practitioners to provide any method of treatment to such an individual: 1) if there is no evidence that the treatment is a danger to the individual; and 2) if the treatment has not been approved, the individual has been informed that the treatment has not been approved and the food, drug, or device contains a warning to that effect. Requires a practitioner, after administering such treatment and discovering it to be a danger to an individual, to submit a report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Requires the Secretary to properly disseminate information with respect to the danger of the medical treatment. Requires a practitioner to immediately report to the Office of Alternative Medicine the positive effects of an unconventional medical treatment for a life-threatening medical condition including: 1) the nature of such treatment; 2) the results of such treatment; and 3) the protocol of such treatment."
