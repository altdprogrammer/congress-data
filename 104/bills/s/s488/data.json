(Replaces current income tax procedures for individuals.) Increases the basic standard deduction and includes an additional standard deduction (limited to dependents only), with inflation adjustments. Limits charitable contributions to $2,500 ($1,250 in the case of married individuals filing separately). Limits the deduction for interest paid on a home mortgage to the amount of acquisition indebtedness, with limitations. Replaces the current tax on corporations with a tax on every person engaged in a business activity equal to 20 percent of the business taxable income of such person. Makes the person engaged in the business activity liable for the tax."
