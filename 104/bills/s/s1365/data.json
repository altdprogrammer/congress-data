    "text": "Endangered Species Habitat Protection Act of 1995 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow landowners of qualified acreage a credit, for agreement to manage such lands for the preservation of endangered species, in an amount equal to the lesser of: (1) the applicable acreage rate of the qualified acreage; or (2) $50,000. Provides for recapture of the credit if the taxpayer transfers the qualified acreage without also transferring the obligations for such acreage. Prohibits making a payment to an owner under capital gain and loss provisions if that owner has indicated an intention to claim an income tax credit or deduction for participation. Provides for a deduction for the donation of property as a conservation easement. Provides for the valuation of property which provides for the protection of endangered species. Provides an additional deduction on State and local real property taxes paid or accrued on property subject to an endangered species conservation agreement. Prohibits the deduction in certain cases. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to cooperate fully with the appropriate States, tribes, and other non-Federal persons, including consultation with such persons before the acquisition or interest of any land or water for the conservation of endangered and threatened species. Sets forth provisions providing for the Secretary to enter into a cooperative management agreement with non-Federal persons for the management of: (1) endangered and threatened species or group of species; or (2) a candidate species or group of candidate species. Directs that a cooperative management agreement shall remain in effect and not be required to be amended to include subsequent listing of endangered or threatened species not applicable to such agreement. Allows the Secretary to provide a habitat conservation grant to certain non-Federal persons for the purpose of conserving, preserving, or improving the habitat of endangered and threatened species. Allows a grant to be transferred to subsequent property owners."
