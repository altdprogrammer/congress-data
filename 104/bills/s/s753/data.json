    "text": "Authorizes contributions toward cooperative work in forest investigations or protection, management, and improvement of the National Forest System to be covered into a special Treasury fund and paid for such purposes and for refunds of amounts paid in excess of a contributor's share of the cost. Authorizes payment for such purposes to be made from any Forest Service appropriation that is available for similar work if a written agreement so provides and reimbursement will be provided by a cooperator in the same fiscal year as the expenditure by the Service. Requires a reimbursement received from a cooperator that covers his or her proportionate share of the cost of the work to be deposited to the credit of the Service's appropriation from which the payment was initially made or, if the appropriation is no longer available, to the credit of the Service's appropriation that is available for similar work. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish: (1) criteria to determine whether the acceptance of contributions under this Act would adversely affect the ability of a Department of Agriculture officer or employee to carry out his or her duty or program in a fair and objective manner; and (2) written rules that protect the Service's interests in cooperative work agreements."
