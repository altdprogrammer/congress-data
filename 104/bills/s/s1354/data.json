    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Injurious Pricing and Countermeasures Title II: Other Provisions Shipbuilding Trade Agreement Act - Declares that the Congress approves the Agreement Respecting Normal Competitive Conditions in the Commercial Shipbuilding and Repair Industry (the Agreement) and the related understanding on Export Credits for Ships (collectively a reciprocal trade agreement resulting from negotiations under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, entered into on December 21, 1994). Title I: Injurious Pricing and Countermeasures - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to impose an injurious pricing charge upon the foreign producer of a vessel sold to U.S. buyers at less than fair value if the U.S. International Trade Commission determines that as a result of the sale an industry in the United States: (1) has been materially injured, or is threatened with material injury; or (2) the establishment of an industry in the United States is or has been materially retarded. (Sec. 101) Prescribes procedural guidelines for: (1) an injurious pricing investigation by an administering authority (Secretary of Commerce, or any other Federal officer to whom such responsibilities are transferred); (2) collection of such an injurious pricing charge; and (3) imposition of countermeasures. Prescribes guidelines for: (1) a comparison between export price and normal value in order to determine whether a subject vessel has been sold at less than fair value; (2) determinations on the basis of available facts; (3) conduct of investigations; and (4) injurious pricing petitions by third countries. Instructs the U.S. Trade Representative to consult with certain congressional committees if a dispute settlement panel finds that a Commission action is not in conformity with U.S. obligations under the Shipbuilding Agreement. (Sec. 102) Directs the Customs Service to deny any request for a permit to lade or unlade passengers, merchandise, or baggage from or onto vessels appearing on a countermeasures list pursuant to this Act. (Sec. 103) Provides for judicial review in injurious pricing and countermeasure proceedings. Title II: Other Provisions - Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to include a Shipbuilding Agreement vessel within its guidelines on construction-differential and operating-differential subsidies. Revises guidelines for: (1) Federal ship mortgage insurance; and (2) vessel equipment and repair. (Sec. 204) Precludes any private right of action under the Shipbuilding Agreement. (Sec. 206) Amends the Trade Act of 1979 to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to monitor the compliance of each Shipbuilding Agreement Party with the Shipbuilding Agreement."
