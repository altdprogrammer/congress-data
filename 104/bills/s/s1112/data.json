Makes the collection of overissuance of coupons from Federal pay or Federal tax refunds (as authorized by this section) mandatory. Authorizes suspension of a store pending administrative and judicial review. (States that the Secretary shall not be liable for lost sales during such period.) Provides for disqualification of a store that is disqualified from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Provides for permanent disqualification of a store that knowingly submits a falsified application. Establishes criminal forfeiture penalties for specified program violations."
