    "text": "Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1995 - Provides that, in any civil action, a biomaterials supplier (one who supplies components or raw materials used to manufacture implants) may raise any defense provided under this Act. Exempts a biomaterials supplier (supplier) from liability for harm to a claimant caused by an implant, with exceptions in the case of a supplier who: (1) is a registered manufacturer of the implant; (2) is a seller of the implant and who held title to the implant at the time of sale; or (3) furnishes raw materials or components that fail to meet applicable contractual requirements or specifications. Provides grounds for liability with respect to each exception. Outlines procedural guidelines for the dismissal of civil actions against suppliers, including the submission of appropriate affidavits in support of, or in defense to, a claim. States that a supplier may be considered a manufacturer of an implant, for purposes of such civil actions, only if the supplier has registered with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and included the implant on a list of devices filed pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Requires claimant payment of attorney's fees if the court finds the claim to be without merit and frivolous."
