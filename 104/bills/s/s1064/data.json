Authorizes the President to suspend for up to six months at a time specified provisions of law which prohibit foreign and United Nations assistance to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the receipt or expenditure of PLO funds, and PLO membership in the International Monetary Fund, upon certification to specified congressional committees that: (1) such waiver is in the national interest; (2) the PLO continues to abide by commitments made in letters to Israel and the Foreign Minister of Norway and under the Declaration of Principles signed in September 1993; and (3) specified funds provided under this Act and other Acts have been used for the purposes for which they were intended. Prohibits the provision of such assistance until the President certifies to the Congress that: (1) the Palestinian Council has disavowed the articles of the Palestine National Covenant which calls for Israel's destruction; (2) the PLO has exercised its authority to prosecute and imprison terrorists; and (3) it has not provided support for acts of terrorism against Israel."
