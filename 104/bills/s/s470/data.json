    "text": "Children's Protection from Violent Programming Act of 1995 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to make it unlawful for any person to: (1) distribute to the public any violent video programming during hours when children are reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion of the audience; or (2) knowingly produce or provide material for such distribution. Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to promulgate regulations to implement this Act. Authorizes the FCC, as part of its rulemaking proceeding, to exempt programming (including news programs, documentaries, educational programs, and sporting events) the distribution of which does not conflict with the objective of protecting children from the negative influences of violent video programming. Exempts premium and pay-per-view cable programming. Requires the FCC to immediately repeal the license of any person who repeatedly violates this Act and to consider, in its review of an application for renewal of a license, whether the licensee has complied with this Act."
