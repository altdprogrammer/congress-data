Declares that all patents in force on June 8, 1995, are entitled to the full benefit of the Uruguay Act and any extension granted before such date under certain patent provisions. Requires that, notwithstanding specified patent provisions, the term of a patent be extended for any patent that encompasses within its scope of composition of matter known as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug if certain circumstances exist. Expresses the sense of the Senate regarding the concluding of litigation under this Act."
