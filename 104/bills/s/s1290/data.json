    "text": "Responsible Deficit Reduction Act of 1995 - Amends House Concurrent Resolution 67, 104th Congress to revise the definition of \"discretionary spending limit\" so as to reduce and specify new budget authority and outlay levels only for FY 1996 through 2000 (H. Con. Res. 67 covered through FY 2002). (Sec. 3) Modifies the deficit reduction assumptions in the conference report on that resolution. (Sec. 4) Declares that, notwithstanding any other law governing sales of electric power by the Alaska Power Marketing Administration, the Bonneville Power Marketing Administration, the Southern Power Marketing Administration, the Southeastern Power Marketing Administration, or the Western Area Power Marketing Administration (each referred to as \"the Administration\"): (1) offers of power sales by the Administration shall be made on a nonpreferential basis to public bodies and cooperatives and private persons; (2) sales of power by the Administration shall be made to the persons offering the highest price; and (3) the Administration shall not be required to acquire for sale to any public body or cooperative or any other person any amount of power in excess of that generated by the projects from which the Administration sells power. Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to: (1) require annual inflation adjustment of storage fees; and (2) establish deadlines for the payment of principal and interest on storage fees. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to modify license application competitive bidding requirements. Removes provisions terminating the authority of the Federal Communications Commission to grant a license or permit under specified provisions. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to end the authority to provide price support for sugar beets and sugarcane. Removes provisions relating to security interests obtained by the Commodity Credit Corporation resulting from security agreements by sugar beet and sugarcane processors. Amends the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act to exclude sugar beets and sugarcane from the general power of the Commodity Credit Corporation to support agricultural commodity prices. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act to repeal marketing quota provisions relating to information reporting by sugarcane processors, cane sugar refiners, sugar beet processors, manufacturers of crystalline fructose, and producers of sugarcane or sugar beets. Prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from making price support available (in the form of loans, payments, purchases, or other operations) for sugar beets or sugarcane under any law, except for settling outstanding loans under specified provisions. Amends the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to repeal provisions mandating a commodity export market promotion program and provisions mandating a commodity export enhancement program."
