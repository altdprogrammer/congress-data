Prohibits a member of the armed forces from being so tried while subject to trial by court-martial for the same conduct. Prohibits persons employed by the armed forces outside the United States from being so tried if such persons are not nationals of the United States. Prohibits prosecution for such an offense in the United States if a foreign government has prosecuted such person for the conduct constituting such offense. Authorizes specified Federal officials to approve a prosecution which is otherwise prohibited under the grounds of prosecution by the foreign government in certain instances. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to designate a member of the armed forces serving in a law enforcement position to apprehend and detain outside the United States any person reasonably believed to have engaged in conduct which constitutes a criminal offense in the United States. Specifies conditions under which such person may be delivered to foreign authorities."
