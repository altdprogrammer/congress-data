Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to select appropriate designs for the reverse and obverse sides of the dollar. Prohibits Federal Reserve banks from issuing any one-dollar Federal Reserve notes after one-dollar coins have been placed in circulation. Authorizes the Secretary, after such time, to produce one-dollar Federal Reserve notes only when the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may order such notes from time to time to meet the needs of collectors of that denomination."
