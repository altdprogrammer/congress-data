    "text": "Narcotics National Emergency Sanctions Act of 1995 - Prohibits specified types of development, economic support, military, and investment and export financing assistance to Colombia. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. executive directors of the multilateral development banks to vote against assistance to Colombia. Prohibits appropriated funds from being obligated or expended for: (1) licensing the commercial export of items on the U.S. Munitions List to Colombia; and (2) carrying out military activities in Colombia or that benefit Colombia. Withdraws certain trade preferences for Colombia under the Andean Trade Preference Act and the Trade Act of 1974. Makes Colombia ineligible to receive preferential trade treatment under any other program. Bars Colombia from being: (1) extended tariff or quota treatment equivalent to that accorded to members of the North American Free Trade Agreement; or (2) allowed to participate in the discussion or implementation of a free trade agreement involving Western Hemisphere countries. Requires the President to ensure that public officials in Colombia who are implicated in drug-related corruption, their immediate relatives, and their business partners are not permitted entry into the United States. Applies such requirement until the completion by the Colombian Government of an investigation into the drug-related corruption of the official that is satisfactory to the Secretary of State and the Attorney General and is so certified to the President. Makes sanctions listed under this Act inapplicable during February 6, 1996, to February 5, 1997, if the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the Government of Colombia has made progress in specified matters regarding investigation and law enforcement regarding drug trafficking and has: (1) reformed the penal code to increase penalties for drug traffickers and to remove opportunities for traffickers to enter into plea bargains; (2) created an investigation unit to bring to prosecution individuals who engage in corrupt activities related to drugs; (3) enacted legislation to implement the statute prohibiting money laundering that was enacted in 1994; and (4) destroyed 44,000 hectares of coca and poppy plants by January 1, 1996. Authorizes the President to impose other sanctions on Colombia if the Colombian Government is not cooperating with the United States in counter-drug activities. Lists conditions under which sanctions will be terminated, including that the Colombian Government has: (1) enacted legislation to implement the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances; (2) destroyed all remaining hectares of illicit crops; and (3) constructed an installation for the Colombia Coast Guard on San Andres Island to provide surveillance of airplane and ship traffic that departs from the island. Subjects presidential determinations regarding the termination of sanctions to congressional approval. Requires the President to transmit determinations and certifications under this Act in lieu of those required under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 in fiscal years in which sanctions are imposed on Colombia."
