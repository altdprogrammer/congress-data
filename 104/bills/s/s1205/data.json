    "text": "Mentor Schools Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to not more than 100 eligible local educational agencies for the planning and operation of one or more mentor schools. Prohibits the Secretary from awarding more than one such grant to support a particular mentor school. Requires each local educational agency receiving such a grant to establish a mentor school advisory board. Encourages each local educational agency operating such a mentor school to employ teachers with alternative teaching certificates, including participants in the Troops to Teachers Program. Sets forth requirements for: (1) applications; (2) selection of grantees; and (3) non-Federal evaluating agencies' evaluations and reports (in contract with the Comptroller General). Authorizes appropriations."
