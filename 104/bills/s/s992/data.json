    "text": "Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1995 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase, effective December 1, 1995, the rates of and limitations on veterans' disability compensation, additional compensation for dependents of certain disabled veterans, the clothing allowance for certain service-disabled veterans, dependency and indemnity compensation, and supplemental dependency and indemnity compensation for children. Increases each such rate by the same percentage as the increase in benefit amounts under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act. Provides that the rate increase in dependency and indemnity compensation paid to a surviving spouse that is predicated on the death of a veteran before January 1, 1993, shall equal 50 percent of the rate increase in dependency and indemnity compensation otherwise payable to a surviving spouse. Authorizes the Secretary to adjust administratively the rates of disability compensation payable to persons who are not in receipt of compensation for service-connected disability or death. Requires the Secretary to publish such increases in the Federal Register at the same time that percentage increases under title II of the Social Security Act are required to be published. Extends to September 30, 2000, the limitation on pension benefits for veterans institutionalized in a Medicaid-covered nursing home. Extends the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to obtain information from the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Secretary of the Treasury until September 30, 2000. Extends the Internal Revenue Service rule pertaining to disclosure of return information to Federal, State, and local agencies administering veterans' benefits until September 30, 2000."
