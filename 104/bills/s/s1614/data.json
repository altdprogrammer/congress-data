    "text": "Coeur d'Alene River Basin Environmental Restoration Act of 1996 - Establishes in the Treasury the Coeur d'Alene Trust Fund for transfer of funds to the Secretary of the Army for use by the State of Idaho, in conjunction with the Coeur d'Alene River Basin Commission (established by this Act), in developing an action plan to support and enhance natural recovery of the Coeur d'Alene River basin. Requires submission to the Secretary of a completed action plan by the Governor of Idaho by June 1, 1997. Establishes the Coeur d'Alene River Basin Commission. Limits liability, with exceptions, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Solid Waste Disposal Act for damages attributable to activities in the basin undertaken before enactment of this Act. Exempts persons from liability under these Acts for damages attributable to a release or potential release of a hazardous substance resulting from a mining-related activity in the basin engaged in on or before enactment of this Act if such release was caused solely by an act or omission of a third party. Permits entrance by the Secretary into cooperative agreements with the Governor and the Commission. Authorizes appropriations."
