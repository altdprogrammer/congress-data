    "text": "Employment Nondiscrimination Act of 1996 - Defines \"employee\" to exclude uncompensated volunteers. Defines \"employer\" to: (1) mean an employer with 15 or more employees; and (2) exclude a bona fide private club. Prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by covered entities, including an employing authority to which specified provisions of the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991 or the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 apply. Declares that: (1) this Act does not apply to the provision of employee benefits for the benefit of an employee's partner; and (2) a disparate impact does not establish a prima facie violation of this Act. Prohibits quotas and preferential treatment. Declares that this Act does not apply to: (1) religious organizations (except in their for-profit activities); (2) the armed forces; or (3) laws creating special rights or preferences for veterans. Provides for enforcement. Disallows State immunity. Makes the United States liable for all remedies (except punitive damages) to the same extent as a private person. Allows recovery of attorney's fees. Prohibits retaliation and coercion. Requires posting notices for employees and applicants."
