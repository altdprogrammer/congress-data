    "text": "Restitution and Responsibility Act - Authorizes the Attorney General to provide grants to enable the States to: (1) collect data on victim restitution over a specified period as determined by the Attorney General; (2) create or expand automated data systems to track restitution payments; (3) make improvements in the manner in which restitution is ordered and collected; and (4) enhance and expand methods of enforcement of restitution orders. Requires a State, to be eligible, to certify that it has a victim advocacy program that provides assistance to crime victims throughout the judicial process and provides courts with a victim impact statement prior to sentencing. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) application requirements (including descriptions of the State's victim advocacy program, the method by which the State compiles data on restitution, the State's plan to improve the ordering of restitution and collection of restitution payments, how the State will enforce such payments, and the establishment of a community restitution fund); (2) waivers; (3) grant period; (4) reporting requirements; and (5) grant evaluation. Authorizes appropriations."
