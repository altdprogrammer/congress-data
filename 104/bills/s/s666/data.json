Amends Federal law regarding Treasury-approved surety firms to require them to: (1) notify a bond applicant of the status of his or her application within ten days of its receipt; and (2) provide a statement of specific reasons to each applicant whose bond application has been denied. Cites activities which constitute unlawful discrimination under this Act. Makes a surety corporation liable to the applicant for civil penalties for violations of this Act."
