Defines \"potential to emit\" as the potential of a facility to emit during a one-year period under maximum realistic operation. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in determining the maximum realistic operation of an agriculture-related facility, to consider: (1) the cyclical or seasonal nature of the facility; and (2) the maximum hours of operation of the facility that actually occurred during any of the preceding five years in the case of a facility in operation on the date of determination. Requires the Administrator to consider the effect of control equipment and techniques in lowering the potential to emit of an agriculture-related facility. Exempts a source from permitting requirements if the source is not a major source and is subject to emissions standards for new stationary sources or requirements for stationary sources of hazardous air pollutants."
