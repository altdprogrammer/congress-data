    "text": "Electronic Freedom of Information Improvement Act of 1996 - Amends the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to require Federal agencies, via computer telecommunications or other electronic means, to: (1) publish all information required to be published in the Federal Register; (2) make available a list of statutes relied on by the agency to withhold information; and (3) make available (unless promptly published) for public inspection and copying final opinions, policy statements, administrative staff manuals, an index of all major information systems containing agency records, and an index of all records made available to any person, as well as copies of all records likely to become subject to subsequent requests. Requires agencies to provide requesters records in the form or format in which they are maintained. States that, if, at any agency's request, the Comptroller General determines that the agency annually has either provided responsive documents or denied requests in substantial compliance with FOIA requirements, then one-half of the fees collected from FOIA requests shall be credited to the collecting agency and expended to offset compliance costs. Extends from ten to 20 days the length of time allowed an agency to decide whether to comply with a FOIA request. Requires an agency not in compliance with specified time limits to demonstrate to a court that its delay is warranted under the circumstances. Defines as unforeseen the \"exceptional circumstances\" of a delay allowing a court to permit an agency additional time to review its records, and excludes from \"exceptional\" delays resulting from a predictable workload (including an ongoing backlog) in the ordinary course of processing record requests. Requires each agency to process requests on a first-in, first-out basis. Authorizes an agency to establish separate processing tracks for simple and complex requests. Provides for expedited access to records for persons demonstrating specified compelling need. Declares that, where a reasonably segregable portion of a record is provided to a requester after FOIA-exempt portions are deleted, the extent of any deletions shall be indicated on the released portion of the record at the place where they were made."
