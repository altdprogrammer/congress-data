(Sec. 102) Amends SSA title XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services) to entitle each State to funds to establish, operate, and support adult-supervised group homes for custodial parents under age 19 and their children. Sets forth provisions for payments of allotments to States, payments to Indian tribes, receipt of payments by such homes, and submission of recommendations on usage of Government surplus properties for such homes. (Sec. 103) Requires completion of high school or other training for teenage parents as a condition of receiving AFDC. Allows a State the option of requiring some or all custodial parents and pregnant women who have not attained 19 years of age (or at the State's option, 21) and who are receiving AFDC to participate in a program of additional monetary incentives and penalties. (Sec. 104) Requires drug treatment and counseling as part of the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) program under AFDC. Title II: Parental Responsibility - Amends SSA title IV part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) to provide performance-based incentive adjustments to the Federal matching rate for statewide paternity establishment efforts. Provides for Federal financial participation for all of a State's paternity establishment services. (Sec. 202) Adds to the statutorily prescribed procedures to improve effectiveness of child support enforcement, which a State is required to have in order to receive part D matching funds, procedures under which the State may withhold or suspend various sorts of licenses. (Secs. 203) Revises part D requirements for State laws: (1) concerning paternity establishment; and (2) providing expedited procedures. (Sec. 205) Provides for outreach for voluntary paternity establishment, through part D State plan requirements, enhanced Federal matching funds, and State outreach as part of voluntary consent procedures. Directs the Departments of Education and of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Public Health Service to develop and implement a substantial outreach program and media campaign to reinforce paternity establishment's importance and promote parenting as a joint right and responsibility. Authorizes appropriations for such program. Title III: Combating Teenage Pregnancy - Amends SSA title IV part A (AFDC) to allow each State agency to provide for eligible entities' operation of projects to reduce teen pregnancy. Allows Indian tribes and Alaska native entities to apply to the Secretary of HHS to operate such projects. Directs the Secretary of HHS to study and report to the Congress annually on the effectiveness of different approaches used in such projects. Authorizes appropriations. Entitles each State to a specified payment of the Federal share of the cost of such projects. (Sec. 302) Directs the Secretaries of Education and of HHS and the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National and Community Service to establish a National Clearinghouse on Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Programs. Authorizes appropriations. Title IV: Financing - Sets forth SSA uniform eligibility criteria for aliens to qualify for Federal and federally-assisted public assistance under AFDC, supplemental security income (SSI), and Medicaid programs. Allows State and local governments to make an alien ineligible for any of their assistance programs based on need unless such alien is a qualified alien under such SSA criteria. (Sec. 402) Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to extend the duration of a specified formula covering State retention of certain amounts recovered."
