Conditions eligibility to receive such grants, in the case of a State that on the enactment date of this Act practices indeterminant sentencing, on the State submitting an application that includes a demonstration that average times served for the offenses of murder, rape, robbery, and assault in the State exceed by at least ten percent the national average of time served for such offenses in all of the States. (Sec. 102) Repeals specified provisions of the VCCLEA concerning the punishment of young offenders. (Sec. 103) Repeals specified VCCLEA provisions regarding the civil rights of institutionalized persons. Amends the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act to prohibit any civil action for deprivation of rights from being brought by an adult convicted of a crime confined in any correctional facility until available plain, speedy, and effective administrative remedies are exhausted. Specifies that such exhaustion of administrative remedies may not be required unless the Attorney General has certified or the court has determined that such remedies are in substantial compliance with specified minimum acceptable standards (as under current law) or are otherwise fair and effective. Requires the court to dismiss any such action if satisfied that the action fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted or is frivolous or malicious. Repeals a provision requiring that the minimum standards provide for an advisory role for employees and inmates in the formulation, implementation, and operation of the system. Requires the Attorney General to develop a procedure for the prompt review and certification of systems for the resolution of grievances of adults confined in any correctional or pretrial detention facility if such systems are in substantial compliance with the minimum standards (current law) or are otherwise fair and effective. Authorizes the Attorney General to suspend or withdraw certification at any time he has reasonable cause to believe that such procedure is no longer in substantial compliance or is no longer fair and effective. Amends the Federal judicial code to authorize the court to request an attorney to represent a person financially unable to employ counsel (current law) at any time. Requires (current law authorizes) the court to dismiss the case if the allegation of poverty is untrue, or if satisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious. Requires: (1) a prisoner in a correctional institution who files an affidavit of indigence to include a statement of all assets such prisoner possesses; and (2) the court to make inquiry of the institution for information relating to the extent of the prisoner's assets and to require full or partial payment of filing fees according to the prisoner's ability to pay. (Sec. 104) Requires the Attorney General to submit a report to the Congress that describes a strategy for employing more Federal prison inmates. (Sec. 105) Repeals specified VCCLEA provisions requiring the Bureau of Prisons to provide residential substance abuse treatment. Requires the Bureau's report to the Congress to include a full examination and evaluation of the effectiveness of the treatment in reducing drug use among prisoners. Title II: State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance - Amends the VCCLEA to replace provisions of title I setting forth the Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 with a State and local law enforcement block grant program. Directs the Attorney General to make grants to States for use by State and local governments to: (1) hire, train, and employ on a continuing basis, new law enforcement officers and necessary support personnel; (2) pay overtime to currently employed officers and personnel; (3) procure equipment, technology, and other material that is directly related to basic law enforcement functions; and (4) establish and operate cooperative programs between community residents and law enforcement agencies for the control, detection, or investigation of crime or the prosecution of criminals. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) law enforcement trust funds; (2) allocation and distribution of funds; (3) fund disbursement; (4) application requirements; and (5) limitations on the use of funds. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Federal Emergency Law Enforcement Assistance Act - Amends the VCCLEA to increase the authorization of appropriations for: (1) the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); (2) U.S. Attorneys; and (3) the Drug Enforcement Administration. Title IV: Criminal Penalties - Makes serious juvenile drug offenses Armed Career Criminal Act predicates. (Sec. 402) Provides for adult prosecution of serious juvenile offenders. Repeals VCCLEA provisions directing the court, in determining whether to transfer a juvenile to adult status, to consider the extent to which the juvenile played a leadership role in an organization or otherwise influenced others to take part in criminal activities involving the use or distribution of controlled substances or firearms. Requires a juvenile who was 13 years of age or older on the date of the commission of specified crimes of violence to be prosecuted as an adult in Federal court. Prohibits the incarceration of any such juvenile in an adult prison. Specifies that if a juvenile prosecuted under such provision is convicted, the juvenile shall be entitled to file a petition for resentencing pursuant to applicable sentencing guidelines when the juvenile reaches age sixteen. Direct the U.S. Sentencing Commission (Commission) to promulgate or amend existing guidelines to carry out such provisions. Authorizes the Commission, for such resentencing determinations, to permit sentencing adjustments that provide for supervised release for defendants who have clearly demonstrated an exceptional degree of responsibility for the offense and a willingness and ability to refrain from further criminal conduct. Repeals specified VCCLEA provisions regarding the prosecution as adults of such juveniles for crimes of violence, including a prohibition against prosecuting as adults certain persons subject to the criminal jurisdiction of an Indian tribal government for an offense the Federal jurisdiction for which is predicated solely on Indian country. (Sec. 403) Authorizes the court to impose a specified term of supervised release, or a fine that would be authorized if the juvenile had been convicted as an adult, for juvenile offenders. (Sec. 404) Requires that juveniles found guilty of certain offenses be fingerprinted and photographed, with such fingerprints and photographs sent to the FBI's Identification Division. Directs the court to transmit to such division information concerning the adjudication. (Sec. 405) Amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to: (1) set a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years' imprisonment of a person age 21 or older who is convicted of employing persons under age 18 in drug operations; and (2) make such mandatory minimum sentence life imprisonment for that offense after a prior conviction of such offense. Prohibits the court from placing on probation or suspending the sentence of any such person. Revises CSA provisions to apply specified penalties for distribution to persons under age 18 (currently, under 21) and to increase such penalties, except for offenses involving five grams or less of marijuana. Repeals a VCCLEA provision directing the Commission to provide an appropriate penalty enhancement for a defendant convicted of drug dealing in a drug-free zone. Increases penalties for such offense, except where the offense involves five grams or less of marijuana. (Sec. 406) Repeals specified VCCLEA provisions regarding the applicability of mandatory minimum penalties in certain cases. Directs the court, notwithstanding the requirement of a mandatory minimum sentence, to impose a sentence in accordance with this section and the sentencing guidelines and any pertinent policy statement issued by the Commission if specified circumstances exist (e.g., that the defendant does not have any criminal history points under the sentencing guidelines, the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury, and the Government certifies that the defendant has timely and truthfully provided it with all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense). Authorizes the Commission to make such amendments as necessary and appropriate to harmonize the sentencing guidelines and policy statements with, and promulgate policy statements to assist the courts in interpreting, this section. Directs the Commission to amend the sentencing guidelines, if necessary, to assign specified drug offenses to which a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment applies, a guideline level that will result in the imposition of a term at least equal to the mandatory term that is currently applicable, unless a downward adjustment is authorized under this section. (Sec. 407) Increases mandatory minimum sentences for using firearms during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. (Sec. 408) Repeals specified VCCLEA provisions concerning arson. Increases penalties and extends the statute of limitations for arson. (Sec. 409) Includes within the offense of kidnapping travel in interstate or foreign commerce, or using the mails or a facility in such commerce, in furtherance of the offense. Title V: Federal Criminal Procedure Reform - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that, in a criminal proceeding, any attorney who files in a U.S. court a brief, motion, answer, pleading, or other signed document that the attorney knows to contain a false statement of material fact or a false statement of law, shall be found guilty of obstruction of justice. (Sec. 502) Specifies that Federal rules of conduct adopted by the Attorney General shall govern the conduct of prosecutions in Federal court. (Sec. 503) Revises rule 24(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to entitle a defendant tried alone to six, but defendants tried jointly to ten, peremptory challenges. (Sec. 504) Amends the Federal judicial code to provide that on each committee that makes recommendations concerning rules that affect criminal cases, the number of members who represent or supervise the representation of defendants in the trial, direct review, or collateral review of criminal cases shall not exceed the number who represent the Government or a State. (Sec. 505) Sets forth provisions regarding the reimbursement of attorney fees in certain cases involving current or former attorneys, agents, or employees of the Department of Justice or the Federal Public Defender who are the subject of criminal or disciplinary investigations. (Sec. 506) Provides for mandatory restitution to victims of violent crimes. Permits a court, in addition to ordering restitution of the victim of the offense of which a defendant is convicted, to order restitution of any person who was harmed physically or pecuniarily by unlawful conduct of the defendant during the criminal episode during which the offense occurred, or the course of a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of unlawful activity related to the offense. Directs the court to order restitution to a victim in the full amount of the victim's losses as determined by the court without consideration of the economic circumstances of the offender or the fact that a victim has received or is entitled to receive compensation with respect to a loss from insurance or any other source. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the form of payments of a restitution order; (2) multiple offenders and multiple victims; (3) setoffs against amounts later recovered as compensatory damages; (4) the effect of a restitution order (constitutes a lien against the offender's property); (5) payment schedules; (6) enforcement of restitution orders; and (7) procedures for issuing such orders. (Sec. 507) Amends the Federal criminal code to place the burden of proving (by a preponderance of the evidence) that a confession was not voluntary on the defendant. Provides that evidence: (1) obtained as a result of a search or seizure that is otherwise admissible in a Federal criminal proceeding shall not be excluded in a proceeding in a U.S. court on the ground that the search or seizure was in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution; and (2) shall not be excluded in a proceeding in a U.S. court on the ground that it was obtained in violation of a statute, an administrative rule, or a rule of court procedure unless exclusion is expressly authorized by statute or by a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court. Amends the Federal judicial code to make the United States liable for damages resulting from a search or seizure conducted by an investigative or law enforcement officer, acting within the scope of the officer's office or employment, in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. Provides for the award of actual and punitive damages, subject to specified limitations. Subjects such an officer to appropriate discipline in the discretion of the Federal agency employing the officer if that agency determines, after notice and hearing, that the officer conducted the search or seizure lacking a good faith belief that the search or seizure was constitutional. Makes the remedy under this section the exclusive civil remedy for such Fourth Amendment violations. Sets forth provisions regarding attorney fees and costs and the applicability of other tort claims procedures. (Sec. 508) Amends the Federal judicial code to establish a one-year statute of limitations for habeas corpus actions brought by State prisoners. Specifies that: (1) there shall be no right of appeal from a final order in a habeas corpus proceeding; and (2) unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of probable cause, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State or Federal court. Permits such certificate to issue only if the petitioner has made a substantial showing of the denial of a Federal constitutional right. Requires the certificate to indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing. Provides that if the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings, the Federal court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless: (1) the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable or on a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence; and (2) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the underlying offense or eligible for the death penalty under State law. Requires that a second or successive motion be certified by a panel of the appropriate Federal Court of Appeals to contain: (1) newly discovered evidence sufficient to undermine the court's confidence in the factfinder's determination of the prisoner's guilt of the offense or offenses for which the sentence was imposed; or (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable. Sets further limitations on second or successive petitions. (Sec. 510) Sets forth special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases. Requires (with exceptions): (1) a district court to render a final determination of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought in a capital case within 180 days after the date on which the petition is filed; and (2) a court of appeals to hear and render a final determination of any appeal of an order granting or denying such a petition within 120 days after the date on which the reply brief is filed and to decide whether to grant a petition or other request for rehearing en banc within 30 days after the date on which the petition for rehearing is filed. Sets forth provisions regarding failure to render a timely determination. Requires the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts to submit to the Congress an annual report on the compliance by the district courts and courts of appeals with the time limitations under this section. Title VI: Prevention of Terrorism - Amends the Federal criminal code to set penalties for: (1) willful violation of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) security regulations; and (2) threatening to assault, kidnap, or murder former Federal officials in the performance of official duties. (Sec. 603) Grants the Attorney General wiretap authority for alien smuggling and related offenses. Makes alien smuggling a predicate to a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). (Sec. 604) Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) authorization for interceptions of communications in certain terrorism-related offenses; (2) participation of foreign and State government personnel in interceptions of communications; and (3) disclosure of intercepted communications to foreign law enforcement agencies. (Sec. 607) Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to establish procedures to apply whenever the Attorney General certifies under seal to a special court (established pursuant to this section) that: (1) the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General has approved of the proceeding; (2) an alien terrorist is physically present in the United States; and (3) removal of such terrorist by deportation proceedings would pose a risk to national security because such proceedings would disclose classified information. Directs the Chief Justice of the United States to publicly designate up to seven judges to hear and decide such cases. Sets forth procedures for a special removal hearing, including provision for appointment of counsel and appeals. (Sec. 608) Declares that the territorial sea of the United States (extending to 12 miles) is part of the United States, subject to its sovereignty, and for purposes of Federal criminal jurisdiction, is within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.
