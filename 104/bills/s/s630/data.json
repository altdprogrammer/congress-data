Sets forth such sanctions, including prohibition, with specified exceptions, of U.S. Government procurement from such persons or issuance of export licenses to them. Waives the requirements of this Act if the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that Iran has: (1) substantially improved its adherence to internationally recognized standards of human rights; (2) ceased its efforts to acquire a nuclear explosive device; and (3) ceased support for acts of international terrorism. Requires the President to transmit a specified report to appropriate congressional committees."
