    "text": "Prison Construction Block Grant Amendments Act - Repeals provisions of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 regarding grants for correctional institutions which require States, to be eligible for such grants, to include in their application to the Attorney General assurances that they have a comprehensive correctional plan which represents an integrated approach to the management and operation of correctional facilities and programs and which includes diversion programs, community corrections programs, a prisoner screening and security classification system, appropriate professional training for corrections officers in dealing with violent offenders, prisoner rehabilitation and treatment programs, prisoner work activities and job skills programs, educational programs, a pre-release prisoner assessment to provide risk reduction management, post-release assistance, and an assessment of recidivism rates. Mandates assurances that the States require: (1) each inmate to perform not less than 48 hours of work per week which shall not be waived except as required by security conditions, disciplinary action, or medical certification of a disability that would make it impracticable for prison officials to arrange useful work for the inmate; (2) each inmate to engage in not less than 16 hours of organized educational activities per week; and (3) that prison officials not provide to any inmate failing to meet such requirements specified privileges, including access to television, bodybuilding or weightlifting equipment, or recreational sports, unmonitored telephone calls (with exceptions), or dress, hygiene, grooming, and appearance privileges other than those allowed as standard in the prison."
