Prescribes requirements for such a system, including benefit denial for certain periods of time per offense for any individual identified under the system as receiving or attempting to receive multiple benefits. Establishes criminal penalties for any person who knowingly and intentionally makes or obtains any unauthorized disclosure of data collected and maintained by a State fingerprint identification system."
