Mandates that the design of the coins be a reproduction of the original five-cent coin designed by James Earle Fraser and minted from 1913 to 1938, depicting on one side a profile of a Native American, and on the reverse side a buffalo. Requires the Secretary to pay surcharges from the sale of such coins to the National Park Foundation for deposit in the Park Maintenance and Upkeep Fund, to be used solely and exclusively for the maintenance, repair, and general upkeep of facilities within the units of the National Park System."
