(Sec. 204) Requires indexing, based on the gross national product deflator, of the adjusted basis of certain assets (corporate stock and tangible property that is a capital asset of property used in a trade or business) that have been held for more than one year at the time of sale or other transfer, solely for the purpose of determining gain or loss. (Sec. 205) Provides for indexing the limitation on capital losses of noncorporate taxpayers. Title III: Neutral Cost Recovery - Allows the depreciation deduction to be computed based on a neutral recovery basis for property placed in service after December 31, 1994.

Title V: Cap on Federal Spending and Establishment of Commission to Reduce Federal Spending - Establishes the Spending Reduction Commission to: (1) recommend specific reductions in Federal activities to assure that spending does not grow at a rate in excess of two percent per year beginning after FY 1995; and (2) take actions required by this title to achieve such reductions. (Sec. 504) Sets forth procedures for the Office of Management and Budget for making budget outlay reduction recommendations to the appropriate congressional committees and the Commission. Provides for the President to review such recommendations. (Sec. 505) Provides for congressional consideration of approved recommendations as submitted by the President through a joint resolution. (Sec. 506) Declares all budget reductions made under this title to be permanent. (Sec. 509) Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to set forth sequestration procedures when the increase in annual Federal spending exceeds the amount resulting from an annual rate of inflation of two percent. Title VI: Elimination of Social Security Earnings Test - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to remove the limitation on the amount of outside income which beneficiaries who have attained retirement age may earn without incurring a reduction in benefits."
