Gives such program the stated purpose of increasing State flexibility in operating a program with mandatory work and education requirements (as well as certain penalties against adult family members on TEA assistance who refuse to work) as well as adult- supervised living arrangements for unmarried teenage parents designe: o: (1) provide certain time-limited assistance to needy families with minor children that enter into a personal responsibility contract with the State, with certain exceptions involving minor children and hardship situations; (2) provide job preparation and opportunities for such families, including opportunities to participate in State-approved job placement agency services; and (3) prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies. Denies TEA assistance for fugitive felons and probation and parole violators. (Sec. 101) Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) each State operating a TEA program is encouraged to assign the highest priority to requiring adults in two-parent families and adults in single-parent families that include older preschool or school-age children to be engaged in work activities; and (2) prevention of out-of-wedlock pregnancy and reduction in out-of-wedlock births are very important Government interests and the policy contained in the provisions of this title is intended to address the crisis. Establishes in the Treasury a revolving Federal Loan Fund for State Welfare Programs for loans to any loan-eligible State for conducting welfare anti-fraud and other specified activities. Outlines program audit and data collection and reporting as well as certain study requirements. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct research, evaluations, and national studies with regard to programs funded under this title.
