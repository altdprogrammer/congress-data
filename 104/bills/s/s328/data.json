(Current law requires such States to submit such revision within two years of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.) Authorizes such revision to require employers in such areas to increase average passenger occupancy per vehicle in commuting trips between home and workplace during peak travel periods. (Current law requires specified increases in average passenger occupancy.) Authorizes (current law requires) the revision to require employers subject to a vehicle occupancy requirement to submit a compliance plan."
