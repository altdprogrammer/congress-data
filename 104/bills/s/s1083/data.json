Declares that if there is a negative determination the President shall reserve the U.S. right to withhold extension of the application of the WTO Agreement between the United States and the country. Declares that the WTO Agreement shall not apply between the United States and such country until: (1) the President certifies to the Congress that the country is fulfilling its obligations under the New York Convention; or (2) enactment into law of a bill approving extension of the application of the WTO Agreement between the United States and that country."
