Provides that during such extensions, the rights in the extended patents shall be the same as those that existed before their expirations, thereby guarding against patent infringements during the extensions. Requires: (1) the patentee to notify the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks of such patent extended number; and (2) the Commissioner to confirm the patent extension by placing a notice thereof in the official file of the patent and to publish an appropriate notice in the Official Gazette of the Patent and Trademark Office."
