    "text": "Federal Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the circumcision, excision, or infibulation of the entire, or part of the, labia majora, labia minora, or clitoris of a female under the age of 18. Penalizes an individual violating the provision with a fine, a term of not more than five years' imprisonment, or both. Exempts a licensed medical practitioner performing the operation if the procedure is necessary to the female's health or is performed for medical purposes on a female in labor or who has just given birth. Provides that no account shall be taken of the operation being required as a matter of custom or ritual. Prohibits discrimination in medical care or services because a female has undergone the procedure or requested that any person undergo the procedure. Authorizes the punishment by a fine, up to one year imprisonment, or both, for such discrimination. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to compile data regarding the number of females living in the United States who have undergone genital mutilation, identify specific communities that practice such mutilation, conduct outreach activities to educate individuals of the health effects of the procedure, and develop recommendations for educating medical school students about genital mutilation."
