Requires States and territories to be reimbursed at four cents per voter for the costs incurred in placing the advisory question on ballots in November 1996. Authorizes appropriations for such reimbursement. Requires tabulation and certification of the election results under customary procedures. Makes the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate responsible for transmitting such results to each Member. Requires the results to be taken under advisement by the House and the Senate Judiciary Committees, with recommendations for response reported back to the Congress within six months of the general election. Requires the State election agencies to forward to the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate their comments or suggestions regarding changes or improvements in procedures for conducting national nonbinding referenda in future general elections."
