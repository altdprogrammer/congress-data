Establishes the White House Compliance Board as an independent establishment within the executive branch. (Sec. 3) Provides that each Federal law governing employment in the private sector that is enacted later than 12 months after this Act is enacted shall be deemed to apply to employing offices and covered employees unless such law specifically provides otherwise and expressly cites this Act. (Sec. 4) Amends the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991, as redesignated by the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, to repeal rights, protections, and remedies with respect to employment of presidential appointees."
