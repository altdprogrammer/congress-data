Makes any such disbursements subject to appropriations. Directs, with respect to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, that estimates of unfunded aviation authorizations and net aviation receipts be made annually and that adjustments be made if unfunded authorizations exceed receipts. Sets forth similar provisions for both the Inland Waterways Trust Fund and the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund."
