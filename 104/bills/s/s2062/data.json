(Sec. 103) Replaces the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention with an Office of Youth Violence Reduction (the Office), headed by an Administrator. Eliminates presidential appointment of the Administrator. Renames the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention as the Coordinating Council on Youth Violence Reduction. (Sec. 104) Requires the Administrator to submit to the President, specified congressional leaders, and the Governor of each State a report containing: (1) a detailed summary and analysis of the most recent data available regarding the rate at which juveniles are taken into custody, the numbers of juveniles taken into custody, repeat offenders, juveniles using weapons, and juvenile and adult victims, and trends; (2) descriptions of activities funded, State compliance with State plan requirements of the Act, and exemplary programs and practices; and (3) a summary of specified programs and activities for which assistance is provided, an evaluation of each such program and activity, and a determination of the feasibility and advisability of replacing such program and activity in other locations. (Sec. 105) Authorizes: (1) specified initiatives, including improving juvenile court and law enforcement records (including fingerprints and photographs) and education programs such as funding for extended hours for libraries and recreational programs which benefit all juveniles; and (2) the Administrator to use specified funds to establish and maintain a clearinghouse to disseminate to the States information on juvenile delinquency prevention, treatment, and control and to provide training and technical assistance to improve State juvenile justice system administration. (Sec. 106) Revises the formula for the allocation of funds. (Sec. 107) Requires State plans to provide assurances that in each secure facility located in the State, there is no commingling in the same cell or community room of, or any other regular cell contact between, any juvenile and any adult detained or confined for any period of time in that facility. Repeals various mandates for State plans (as conditions of receiving Federal funds), including requirements regarding: (1) juvenile justice advisory groups; (2) analysis of juvenile crime problems and juvenile justice and delinquency prevention needs; (3) assurances involving approaches designed to strengthen the families of delinquent and other youth; and (4) arrangements to protect the interests of employees affected by the Act. (Sec. 108) Repeals various Act programs, including provisions regarding the National Institute for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, special emphasis prevention and treatment programs, State challenge activities, treatment for juvenile offenders who are victims of child abuse or neglect, mentoring, boot camps, and the White House Conference on Juvenile Justice. Title II: Incentive Grants for Accountability-Based Reforms - Amends the Act to direct the Administrator to provide juvenile delinquent accountability grants to States that have: (1) policies and programs that ensure that juveniles who commit an act after attaining age 14 that would be a serious violent crime if committed by an adult are treated as adults for prosecution purposes; (2) graduated sanctions for juvenile offenders; and (3) a specified system of records relating to juveniles under age 15 who are adjudicated delinquent for conduct that if committed by an adult would constitute a serious violent crime. Makes such States eligible for additional sums upon demonstrating compliance with specified \"accountability-based youth violence reduction practices,\" such as mandatory victim restitution, public access to juvenile court proceedings, and zero tolerance for truancy and for deadbeat juvenile parents. Title III: General Provisions - Modifies the Act to authorize appropriations through FY 2001 for the Office, for block grants for State and local programs, and for incentive grants for accountability-based reforms. Specifies that the source of such appropriations may be the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund."
