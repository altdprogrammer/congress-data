    "date": "1995-01-04", 
    "text": "Alaska Wetlands Conservation Credit Procedures Act of 1994 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to provide that specified guidelines for disposal sites for the discharge of dredged and fill material into navigable waters for States with substantial conserved wetlands areas: (1) shall not include requirements or standards for mitigation to compensate for wetlands loss and adverse impacts to wetlands; (2) may include requirements or standards for minimization of such adverse impacts; and (3) may include standards or requirements for avoidance of impacts only if the discharge permit applicant is not required to establish that upland alternative sites do not exist. Directs the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers and at the request of a State with substantial conserved wetlands areas, to issue general permits for such States which contain a regulatory standard for such discharges that is no greater than the standard contained in the guidelines described above. Makes the discharge of dredged or fill material in connection with the following activities exempt from regulation under related provisions governing permits: (1) airport safety in a State with substantial conserved wetlands areas and in any case necessary for public safety; (2) construction and maintenance of log transfer facilities; (3) construction of tailings impoundments utilized for treatment facilities; and (4) construction of ice pads and ice roads and for snow storage and removal purposes. Requires the Secretary to issue individual and general permits pursuant to the standards and requirements of this Act for a State with substantial conserved wetlands areas. Directs the Secretary, for permits issued for economic base lands (specified lands conveyed to or owned by Alaska Native entities or the State of Alaska), to: (1) balance the standards and policies of this Act against U.S. obligations to allow such lands to be used to create and sustain economic activity; (2) give substantial weight to the social and economic needs of Alaska Natives; and (3) account for regional differences in the abundance and value of wetlands. Requires the Secretary, for lands owned by Alaska Native villages, to issue general permits for disposition of dredge and fill material for critical infrastructure in rural villages without a determination that activities authorized by such a permit cause only minimal adverse environmental effects."
