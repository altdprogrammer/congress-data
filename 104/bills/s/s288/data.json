    "text": "Amends the Metropolitan Washington Airports Act of 1986 to abolish the Board of Review of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (Airports Authority). Requires certain Airports Authority decisions to remain in effect and not be set aside solely by reason of a judicial order invalidating certain functions of the Board of Review. Expresses the sense of the Senate the Airports Authority: (1) should not provide free reserved parking areas to Members of Congress, Government officials, or diplomats; and (2) should establish an airport parking policy that provides equal access to the public. Increases the number of members (including those the President must appoint with the advice and consent of the Senate) on the board of directors of the Airports Authority. Requires eight votes (currently, seven) to approve bond issues and the annual budget. Staggers the terms of presidential appointees to such board. Requires the board of directors, including any members appointed under this Act, to continue to meet and act until necessary conforming changes in State law are made in order that the reconstituted board functions without interruption. Declares that nothing in this Act shall affect: (1) the treatment of the Airports Authority under Federal, State, or local tax law; or (2) the number or distribution of operational slots at National Airport."
