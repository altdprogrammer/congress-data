    "text": "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Commercialization Act of 1995 - Instructs the Secretary of Energy to conduct a hydrogen energy research, development, and demonstration-commercialization program relating to production, storage, transportation and use of hydrogen, in order to demonstrate its feasibility for industrial, institutional, residential, transportation, and utility applications. Requires the Secretary to survey private sector hydrogen activities and take steps to ensure that Federal activities do not displace or compete with privately funded hydrogen activities of U.S. industry. Sets forth a proposal solicitation schedule. Directs the Secretary to require a specified cost-sharing commitment from non-Federal sources. Allows the Secretary to reduce the non-Federal requirement if: (1) necessary and appropriate considering the technological risks involved in the project; and (2) such reduction is necessary to serve the purposes of the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 (the Act). Sets as a prerequisite to Federal financial assistance certification by: (1) the Secretary that such assistance is consistent with a specified Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures approved in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act; and (2) industry participants that they have made reasonable efforts to obtain non-Federal funding for the entire cost of the project, and that such non-Federal funding could not be reasonably obtained. Prohibits the Secretary from implementing activities that unnecessarily duplicate activities implemented elsewhere by either the Federal or private sectors. Directs the Secretary to assist in the development and operation of a demonstration-commercialization project. Directs the Secretary to: (1) foster technology transfer activities between the Federal, industrial, and academic sectors; (2) report annually to the Congress; (3) coordinate with other Federal agencies involved in similar hydrogen research activities; and (4) consult with the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel established under the Act. Authorizes appropriations."
