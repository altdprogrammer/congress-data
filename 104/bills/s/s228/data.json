Provides for the deduction and withholding of seven percent (currently, eight and seven and a half percent, respectively) of the basic pay of a Member or congressional employee under CSRS, thus making such deduction and withholding equivalent to that of a Federal employee. Makes deductions and withholding under FERS for Members and congressional employees conform to those of Federal employees as well. Makes provisions of this Act regarding: (1) COLA adjustments and Member annuities applicable to annuities commencing on or after November 6, 1996; (2) computation of annuities and years of service applicable to service performed after such date; and (3) contribution rates applicable in the first pay period beginning on or after such date."
