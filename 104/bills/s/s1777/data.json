Requires specific authorization by law for designs that exceed such amount. (Sec. 3126) Authorizes the use of DOE funds for planning, design, and construction activities for any DOE national security program that must proceed expeditiously in order to protect public health and safety, meet the needs of national defense, or protect property. Requires the Secretary to report to the defense and appropriations committees when funds are so used. (Sec. 3127) Makes funds for management and support activities and for general plant projects under this Subtitle available for all DOE national security programs. Subtitle C: Program Authorizations, Restrictions, and Limitations - Requires the Secretary to make a final decision during FY 1997 on the technologies to be utilized, and the accelerated schedule to be adopted, for tritium production in order to meet the requirements of a certain Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Memorandum. Requires a report to the Congress. Earmarks funds authorized under this title for such activities. (Sec. 3132) Directs the Secretary to carry out activities to modernize and consolidate the tritium recycling facilities at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina. Provides funding.

Requires a plan and report with respect to such program. Provides funding. (Sec. 3134) Prohibits FY 1997 DOE funds from being used for certain research and development or technology transfer purposes unless such activities support the DOE national security mission. Requires an annual report. (Sec. 3135) Directs the Secretary to accelerate the schedule for the isolation of high-level nuclear waste in glass canisters at the Defense Waste Processing Facility at the Savannah River Site if the Secretary determines that such acceleration will achieve cost savings and the removal and isolation of such waste from the long-term storage tanks there. (Sec. 3136) Earmarks funds authorized under this title for the processing of high-level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel rods. Requires the updating of an implementation plan concerning such waste under a prior defense authorization Act. (Sec. 3137) Earmarks funds for conducting the fellowship program for the development of skills critical to the ongoing mission of the DOE nuclear weapons complex as required under prior law. Requires 21 days' advance notification to the Congress before funds may be obligated or expended for such program.

(Sec. 3158) Redesignates the Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Program as the Defense Nuclear Waste Management Program. Redesignates the Assistant Secretary in charge of such Program as the Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense Nuclear Waste Management. Redesignates a related Account. Directs the Secretary to report to the defense and appropriations committees on such redesignations. (Sec. 3159) Establishes the Commission on Maintaining United States Nuclear Weapons Expertise to develop and report to the Congress a plan for recruiting and retaining within the DOE nuclear weapons complex the appropriate scientific, engineering, and technical personnel necessary to permit DOE to maintain a safe and reliable nuclear weapons stockpile without engaging in underground testing. Terminates the Commission 30 days after its report. Provides Commission funding. (Sec. 3160) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President: (1) should consult closely with the Congress concerning U.S. policy and practices for ensuring the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile; and (2) if he determines that a safety or reliability problem cannot be corrected within the stockpile stewardship program, to notify the Congress of such problem, together with a plan for corrective action.
