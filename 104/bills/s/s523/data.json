Directs the Secretary to submit a planning report concerning the program to the appropriate congressional committees. Prohibits the Secretary from expending funds for any such implementation program before the expiration of 30 days after the Secretary submits such report. Authorizes appropriations. Allows for the implementation of the program under this Act only to the extent and in such amounts as provided in advance in appropriations Acts."
