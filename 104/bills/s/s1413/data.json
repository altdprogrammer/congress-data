Makes an exception regarding an application for a license for an activity that will occur or affect waters located within a river basin that is subject to an interstate compact, a decree of the Supreme Court, or an Act of Congress that specifically allocates the rights to use such water. Specifies that this Act shall apply to any application made on or after January 1, 1991, unless the application has been granted and is no longer subject to judicial review."
