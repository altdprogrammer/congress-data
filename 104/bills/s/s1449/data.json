    "text": "Agricultural Promotion Accountability Act of 1995 - Defines a \"promotion program\" to mean any coordinated program of promotion, research, industry information, and consumer information funded by mandatory assessments on producers and designed to maintain and expand markets and uses for an agricultural commodity. Prohibits a board or council established by a promotion program from using any funds it collects to: (1) influence legislation or governmental action or policy (except for amendments to the promotion program); or (2) enhance the image of an industry (except for promoting a product image with the express intent of stimulating demand and sales). Regulates board or council contracts and agreements. Declares that it is the policy of the Congress that boards and councils should use competitive bidding in awarding contracts and grants. Regulates board or council membership and the use of assessed funds regarding influencing government action. Mandates an annual review of board or council arrangements with any entity that engages in activities to influence governmental action. Mandates referenda at least every five years to determine whether to approve or terminate the order under the promotion program and whether refunds should be made under the order."
