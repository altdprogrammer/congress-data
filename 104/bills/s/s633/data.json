    "text": "Bank Customer Confidentiality and Protection Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to declare that it is unlawful for an insured depository institution which sponsors, sells, or solicits the purchase of a nondeposit investment product to represent that such product is either federally approved or guaranteed, or FDIA-insured. Sets forth customer disclosure requirements for such products, including: (1) that such products carry risk of a loss of principal; (2) the nature of the relationship between the insured depository institution and the broker or dealer, and any higher or special compensation the broker or dealer would receive for the sale of certain types of nondeposit investment products; (3) any fees incurrable in connection with the product; and (4) a written customer acknowledgment of such disclosures. Permits a one-time referral fee paid to an insured depository institution employee who refers a bank customer to securities salespeople if the fee is not based upon customer purchase. Mandates prominent written disclosures to customers that the joint marketing of nondeposit investment products on the premises of the insured depository institution is separate and distinct from such institution and is not insured. Places restrictions upon the advertising and solicitation of nondeposit investment products by an insured depository institution, including the use of nonpublic customer information. Directs the appropriate Federal banking agencies and the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate regulations to reflect this Act and to coordinate their enforcement methods."
