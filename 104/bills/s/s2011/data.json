    "text": "Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure that no funds appropriated by the Congress are used to maintain and operate golf courses on real property under control of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for the maintenance and operation of such golf courses by entering into: (1) 20-year leases with Department employee associations, other non-Federal nonprofit organizations, or private entities; or (2) enhanced use leases. Requires golfing revenues generated from such property use to be retained by the Department for uses deemed appropriate by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary, before leasing a Department golf course, to consider the option of excessing the golf course to the General Services Administration so that such property may be screened for redeployment by another executive agency."
