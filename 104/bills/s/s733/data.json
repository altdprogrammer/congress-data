Grants congressional consent to States with an interest in a specific form, route, or corridor of intercity passenger rail service (including high speed rail service) to enter into interstate compacts to promote such service. Makes construction of and operational improvements for intercity passenger rail facilities, operation of intercity passenger rail trains, and acquisition of rolling stock for intercity passenger rail service eligible projects for funding under the National Highway System. Authorizes States to obligate congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program funds for such projects. Revises the term \"mass transportation\" to cover intercity passenger rail transportation. Makes such transportation projects eligible for Federal mass transportation funding. Requires grants for intercity passenger rail service to be used to preserve the maximum choice of passenger modes in non-urbanized areas."
