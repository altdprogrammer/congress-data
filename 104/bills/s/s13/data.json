Amends rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate to make it out of order in the Senate to consider a report accompanying a public bill or joint resolution reported by any committee (except the Committees on Appropriations and the Budget) if it does not contain a CBO evaluation of the cost to State and local governments of complying with any Federal mandates in the measure."
