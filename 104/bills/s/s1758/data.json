Exempts certain small dealers or market agencies from such provision. States that: (1) a dishonored payment instrument shall not constitute a sale (with resultant loss of trust benefit); (2) third-party purchaser rights shall not be affected by such livestock dealer trust; and (3) jurisdiction for related civil matters shall be in U.S. district courts. Revises certain business recordkeeping requirements, including elimination of fine and imprisonment provisions. Includes formula-priced cattle in the definition of captive supply for data collection purposes."
