Allows the transfer of up to two percent of agency funds for priority financial management system improvements for an agency with a remediation plan. Requires a report by the Director of OMB if an agency fails to bring its financial management systems into compliance within the specified time period. Directs the: (1) Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House, jointly, to study and submit a report to the Congress on how the Congress and the legislative branch may achieve compliance; and (2) Chief Justice of the United States to study and submit a report to the Congress on how the judiciary may achieve such compliance.
