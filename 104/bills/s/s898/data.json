    "text": "Helium Disposal Act of 1995 - Amends the Helium Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter into agreements with private parties for the recovery, disposal, and sale of helium on Federal lands. Mandates that all proceeds received from such transactions be deposited into the Treasury. Repeals the Secretary's authority to acquire lands, interests, or options (including oil or gas leases), and to construct or acquire facilities, for helium production. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) dispose of helium only in accordance with this Act; (2) monitor and prepare periodic reports on helium production and reserves; (3) store, transport, and withdraw crude helium, and to maintain and operate existing crude helium storage at the U.S. Bureau of Mines Cliffside Field, together with related helium transportation and withdrawal facilities; and (4) impose fees for providing storage, transportation, and withdrawal services. Establishes the Helium Reserve Management Fund to cover the costs of this Act. Directs the Secretary to cease producing, refining, and marketing refined helium within three years after the date of enactment of this Act. Prescribes helium facility disposal guidelines. Exempts from such guidelines any facilities, equipment, or property necessary for crude helium storage or transportation, or any equipment needed to maintain quality control and assurance of helium in the Bureau of Mines Cliffside Field. Terminates existing helium sales contracts as of the date on which the Secretary has ceased producing, refining, and marketing refined helium pursuant to this Act. States that contract termination costs shall be paid from the Helium Production Fund, or, after its abolishment, from the Helium Reserve Management Fund. Prescribes guidelines under which the Secretary shall sell crude helium to reduce federally-held reserves. Abolishes the Helium Production Fund upon completion of the disposal of Federal helium facilities, equipment, and property. Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to cancel outstanding Federal helium debt. Repeals intragovernmental cooperation guidelines. Sets a deadline by which the Secretary shall sell helium reserves stored in the Bureau of Mines Cliffside Field."
