Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of title IV of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, as well as the Internal Revenue Code, to require: (1) a State, as a condition for receiving Federal child support funds, to prescribe procedures requiring any State court or administrative agency that issues or modifies a child support order to transmit an abstract of the order to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); (2) a State to prescribe procedures requiring an individual with the right to collect child support to be presumed to have assigned such right to the IRS (unless the individual affirmatively elects to retain such right); and (3) prescribe guidelines under which the IRS shall collect child support through tax withholding procedures. Declares that child support obligations will be treated as taxes for purposes of penalties and interest."
