    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: National Crime Records Database Title II: Liability for Early Release of Violent Felons Violent Crime Intervention Act of 1995 - Title I: National Crime Records Database - Directs the Attorney General of the United States to issue guidelines establishing specific requirements for a State to qualify as a fully participating member of the Interstate Identification Index of the Department of Justice. Specifies that such guidelines shall require that: (1) all arrest reports and final disposition orders be submitted to the State records repository within seven days; (2) the State repository enter such records and orders into the State database within 24 days after receiving the information; (3) the State conduct and report to the Attorney General on annual audits to ensure that State criminal records contain correct and complete information about every felony arrest; and (4) the State certify to the Attorney General on January 1 of each year that the law enforcement agencies, courts, and records officials of the State are in compliance. Authorizes the Attorney General to establish limitations on the purposes for which the Index may be used and allow a State to prohibit the use of information provided by the State for searches unrelated to law enforcement. Requires a State that does not qualify as a fully participating State pursuant to such guidelines to pay a user fee for each identification request made to the Index. Title II: Liability for Early Release of Violent Felons - Grants the victim of a violent crime (or in the case of a homicide, the family of the victim) a Federal cause of action in any district court against a State if the individual committing the crime previously had been convicted by the State of a violent offense, was released from incarceration prior to serving his or her full sentence, and committed the violent crime before the original sentence would have expired. Makes a State liable to the victim in an action brought under this title for the actual damages resulting from the violent crime, but not for punitive damages."
