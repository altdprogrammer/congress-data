    "text": "Lake Champlain Zebra Mussel Control Act of 1995 - Amends the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 to: (1) require the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force to study whether aquatic nuisance species threaten the ecological characteristics and economic uses of Lake Champlain; (2) require the designated chairpersons to invite representatives of the Lake Champlain Basin Program to participate as ex officio members of the Task Force; and (3) include Lake Champlain among the waters with respect to which the aquatic nuisance species and zebra mussel demonstration programs apply. Requires, within one year: (1) the Task Force to develop and submit to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating voluntary guidelines for controlling the spread of the zebra mussel through recreational activities, including boating and fishing; and (2) the Secretary to issue voluntary guidelines that incorporate the guidelines developed by the Task Force. Revises the Act to provide for the preparation and submission of a comprehensive management plan and a public facility management plan by the Governor of each State (as under current law) or the appropriate official of a watershed organization. Defines \"watershed organization\" to mean an entity with jurisdiction over the management of a watershed pursuant to applicable Federal and State law. Amends the National Sea Grant College Program Act to direct the Secretary to designate the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont, as a sea grant college under the Act. Authorizes appropriations."
