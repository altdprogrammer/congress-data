Authorizes the University to submit to the Secretary a list of selected properties to be received under the conditions of this grant. Limits the selections to 385,000 acres. Requires the Secretary to notify the University of the acceptance of or objection to each selection, including reasons for objections. Prohibits the Secretary from approving or conveying under this grant any Federal lands: (1) which are included in a Conservation System Unit; or (2) validly selected but not conveyed to Alaska or the corporations organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Restricts land conveyance to the University to the extent that the State of Alaska conveys or has conveyed an equivalent amount of acreage to the University after June 7, 1996."
