Directs that the Rockwell Ranch, Timberline Lake, and Cameron Pass Lands acquired by the United States under this Act be added to and administered as part of the Roosevelt National Forest. Modifies the boundary of the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests to provide for more efficient administration of certain Federal lands adjoining such Forests."
