    "text": "Base Transition Acceleration Act of 1995 - Amends the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 to direct the Secretary of Defense, with respect to the disposal of buildings and property located at military installations approved for closure under such Act after January 1, 1995, to ensure that final determinations regarding whether another Federal department or agency has identified a use for, or will accept a transfer of, any portion of such an installation are completed no later than 60 days after the date of approval of closure of the installation. Requires publication in the Federal Register of the results of such determinations. Requires the redevelopment authority (RA) for such installation, within 180 days after the completion of such determinations, to prepare and submit to the Secretary a redevelopment plan for the installation that addresses the buildings and property that are not claimed for use or transfer by another Federal department or agency. States that an RA shall consist of such State, local, or tribal governments, or citizens residing in the vicinity, of such installation. Requires the Secretary to accept or reject a redevelopment plan within 60 days of its submission, with appropriate notification to the RA. Allows an RA whose plan has been rejected to submit a revised plan for consideration within 90 days after such notification, and requires the Secretary to accept or reject such revised plan within 30 days of submission, with appropriate RA notification. Provides for disposal of an installation's buildings and property to another Federal department or agency, or in accordance with an accepted redevelopment plan, as appropriate. Allows the Secretary to postpone or extend any deadline provided under this Act if determined to be in the best interests of the communities affected by the closure of the installation."
