    "as": "Reported to Senate amended",

    "text": "Umatilla Basin Project Completion Act - Amends the Umatilla Basin Project Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to complete construction of, and to operate and maintain, the Umatilla River basin project, Oregon, including specified water pump exchange projects. Authorizes the Secretary to construct a third and final phase of such project to provide additional water flows into the Umatilla River for anadromous fish through a water exchange with the Westland Irrigation District. Requires a feasibility study prior to such construction. Requires the execution of an exchange agreement with such District to allow the use of Columbia River water in exchange for an equal amount of Umatilla River or McKay Reservoir water. Allows additional exchange agreements with other water users to be executed prior to water delivery, requiring such agreements to incorporate the water delivery scheduling optimation, conservation, water transfer, and other technical operational measures recommended in the feasibility study. Requires the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) to provide for project power necessary to effect the phase III water exchange. Requires facilities authorized under the Act to be integrated and coordinated into the existing Umatilla Basin Project. Adjusts the boundaries of four Umatilla Basin irrigation districts, including the Westland District. Directs the Secretary to participate in any discussions with Oregon regarding the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation's water claims and other water needs in the Umatilla River basin. Directs the Secretary to continue to participate in any efforts undertaken by Oregon, the Confederated Tribes, the irrigation districts, the BPA, and the affected public toward developing a water management plan for restoring the Umatilla River basin's anadromous fishery. Requires appropriate agreements to provide funding for the monitoring and administration of such plan. Authorizes the Secretary to provide specified funds to the Tribes for the construction of an offstream storage reservoir, to be located on or near the Tribes' Reservation, under specified conditions Authorizes appropriations. Protects existing water rights. Expresses the sense and expectation of the Congress that construction and operation of phase III, the perpetual operation of the integrated basin project, and the construction and operation of the reservoir will fulfill all Federal obligations to provide the Tribes with water for fishery purposes in the Umatilla River below the mouth of McKay Creek, as recognized under the Tribes' treaty with the United States."
