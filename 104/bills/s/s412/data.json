    "text": "Bottled Water Standards Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, after the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency promulgates a national primary drinking water regulation for a contaminant under the Safe Drinking Water Act, to issue a regulation for that contaminant in bottled water or make a finding that a regulation is not necessary to protect the public health because the contaminant is not present in bottled water. Requires the relevant maximum contaminant level or treatment technique for the contaminant in bottled water to be as stringent or protective as that for the contaminant in drinking water systems. Makes the drinking water regulation the standard for bottled water if the Secretary fails to establish a regulation."
