Prohibits the expenditure of Federal funds for costs associated with such a facility unless the Secretary of the Army determines that the funds are not required to cover eligible operation and maintenance (O&M) costs assigned to commercial navigation. Limits to $25 million the Federal share of such O&M costs for a fiscal year. Defines eligible O&M costs associated with such a project. Requires the amendment of existing agreements to conform with changes made under this Act."
