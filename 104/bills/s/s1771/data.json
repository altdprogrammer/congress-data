    "text": "Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to proscribe any fee assessment for certain customs services provided in connection with the arrival of any passenger on board a commercial vessel traveling only between ports within the customs territory of the United States. Provides that specified fee exemptions do not apply in the case of the arrival of any passenger on board a commercial vessel whose journey originates and terminates at the same place in the U.S. if there are no intervening stops. Mandates a one-time only assessment of certain customs fees for each passenger in the case of a commercial vessel making a single voyage involving two or more United States ports with respect to which the passengers would otherwise be charged a fee."
