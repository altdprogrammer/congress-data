Provides that a State shall not be considered to have made provision for effective control of the erection and maintenance of signs along the Interstate and primary systems: (1) unless it maintains and annually submits to the Secretary an inventory of all signs in the State for which the effective control is required, including a specification of whether each sign is illegal, nonconforming, or conforming under State law; and (2) if it carries out or permits the removal of vegetation in, or other alteration of, certain right-of-ways for the purpose of improving the visibility of any sign located outside the right-of-way. Requires such State inventory to identify each sign that is located along a highway on the Interstate or Federal-aid primary system designated as a scenic byway."
