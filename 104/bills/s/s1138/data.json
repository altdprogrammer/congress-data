    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1995-08-09", 
    "text": "Medicare Consumer Protection Act of 1995 - Revises title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to modify the prohibition against selling or issuing a health insurance policy to an individual entitled to benefits under part A or enrolled under part B with the knowledge that such policy duplicates health benefits to which the individual is otherwise entitled under such title or title XIX (Medicaid). Exempts Medicare supplemental policies from such prohibition. Requires the duplication to be substantial before the prohibition applies. Makes such prohibition inapplicable to: (1) a health insurance policy providing for benefits payable to or on behalf of an individual without regard to other health benefit coverage of such individual; or (2) a health insurance policy, or a rider to an insurance contract which is not a health insurance policy, providing benefits only for long-term, nursing home, home health, or community-based care, or any combination thereof, that prevents duplication by coordinating against or excluding items and services available or paid for under medicare, and such coordination or exclusion is disclosed in the policy's outline of coverage. Modifies the prohibition against selling or issuing a Medicare supplemental policy to an individual entitled to benefits with the knowledge that such policy duplicates health benefits to which the individual is entitled under another Medicare supplemental policy. Declares that a seller (who is not the issuer) of such a policy shall not be considered to have violated this prohibition if the policy is sold in compliance with specified requirements and the statement indicates on its face that the sale will not duplicate health benefits to which the individual is otherwise entitled under another Medicare supplemental policy. Repeals: (1) the exemption from such prohibition of certain group policies or plans sold or issued to employees or former employees or members or former members of labor organizations; and (2) specified disclosure requirements with respect to duplication of benefits. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) limitations on legal actions including causes of action that arose before specified dates; and (2) exclusivity of remedies available with respect to this Act's non-duplication requirements."
