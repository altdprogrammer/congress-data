    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1995-07-21", 
    "text": "Southeast Alaska Jobs and Communities Protection Act of 1995 - Amends the Tongass Timber Reform Act (TTRA) and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA) to add provisions relating to jobs and communities. Sets forth Tongass Land Management Planning (TLMP) requirements. Requires that sufficient timber volume be made available from the Tongass National Forest to provide timber industry related jobs at the 1990 level. Considers all Tongass lands to be in the TLMP process except those designated as wilderness under ANILCA. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, if reducing the volume of timber available for harvesting from that needed to protect jobs at the 1990 level, to provide: (1) a jobs impact statement showing that the reduction of the jobs from the 1990 level and the adverse impacts on timber dependent communities are outweighed by the environmental gains to be achieved by the reductions; and (2) equivalent substitute timber volume. Prohibits withdrawal of timber to maintain plant or animal diversity unless the Secretary: (1) makes a written determination that such action is necessary to prevent the species from becoming threatened or endangered; (2) provides the jobs impact versus environmental benefits review, and the substitute timber; (3) consults the State of Alaska about controlling predators which prey upon the species of concern; and (4) terminates all nonsubsistence uses of the species. Directs the Secretary to manage second growth timber stands to maximize future timber production and make second growth timber suitable for deer habitat and for other species. Allows such timber substitution process to be done without a National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) review. Requires courts to find a revised TLMP plan, meeting such requirements, to be consistent with other specified laws pertaining to national forests. (Sec. 2) Requires the Secretary to: (1) meet market demand with a supply of mid-market timber on an annual and planning cycle basis; (2) monitor the timber supply and demand from the Tongass National Forest; and (3) report to the public annually, explaining how the Secretary intends to reconcile market demand with other requirements of law (with such determination to be used in setting timber sale volume and offering levels for the Tongass National Forest). Prohibits the reduction of timber volumes available for harvest, unless the Secretary determines that the timber job reductions and resulting adverse impacts upon timber dependent communities are outweighed by the environmental benefits to be achieved, and an equivalent volume of lands economically suitable for timber production is substituted in a specified manner. Provides that a court shall not find that a sale or offering of timber on the Tongass National Forest, which complies with this Act, is inconsistent with other laws providing for forest management. (Sec. 3) Makes certain provisions of the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) consistent with this Act (and prohibits use of such provisions to delete volume from the Tongass National Forest unless substitute timber is provided). (Sec. 4) Requires the Secretary to provide an annual volume of 80 million board feet of timber to small business concerns, and to better tailor timber sales to their needs. (Sec. 5) Provides a direct cause of action to persons and communities adversely affected by the Secretary's actions under this Act. Requires prior notice of a violation to the Secretary before filing of such a suit. (Sec. 6) Requires the Secretary to: (1) request annual appropriations sufficient to provide at least a three-year supply of unharvested timber; and (2) publish quarterly reports to the public concerning that timber. (Sec. 7) Allows a purchaser of Tongass National Forest timber to lay out timber sales pursuant to the Record of Decision signed by the Contracting Officer following completion of a NEPA analysis for that sale. Authorizes the Forest Service to modify or approve such a layout. (Sec. 8) Repeals specified provisions of the TTRA which require proportionality for timber offerings made pursuant to the long term contracts. (Sec. 9) Directs the Secretary, under TTRA, to reschedule the timber sales and offerings which were deferred because of proposed designation habitat conservation areas (HCAs) and goshawk reservation area withdrawals by the Forest Service. (Sec. 10) Revises specified ANILCA provisions to define withdrawal of public lands in Alaska (except for designated wilderness land) to include temporary reservations or deferrals of use of Federal forest lands for any reason for a period of more than 60 days. (Sec. 11) Prohibits the export of all sawlogs, pulp logs, utility logs and chips from Alaska under specified conditions. Permits the State of Alaska to establish incentives for in-State processing of timber from State lands administered by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. (Sec. 12) Directs the Secretary to study, and report to specified congressional committees on, the prospects for encouraging value added manufacturing utilizing Tongass National Forest timber resources."
