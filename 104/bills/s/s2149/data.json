    "text": "Transitional Health Insurance for Workers Changing Jobs Act of 1996 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to add a new title XXVIII (Health Insurance for Workers Changing Jobs) under which the Secretaries of Labor and of Health and Human Services are required to establish a joint program to award grants to States with approved plans to enable them to provide temporary health insurance premium assistance for eligible individuals and their families in accordance with specified guidelines. Makes appropriations. Expresses the sense of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate that the joint program established by this Act should be financed in a budget neutral manner by offsetting revenues derived from eliminating undeserved corporate tax breaks, especially tax breaks that encourage American corporations to move jobs overseas and that reward book-keeping transactions that artifically place corporate income overseas for tax purposes."
