(Sec. 102) Specifies that: (1) there shall be no right of appeal from a final order in a habeas corpus proceeding; and (2) unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, any appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State or Federal court. Permits such certificate to issue only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. (Sec. 104) Provides that if the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings, the Federal court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless: (1) the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable or on a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence; and (2) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable fact finder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense. (Sec. 105) Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the statute of limitations for motions; and (2) limits on second or successive applications. (Sec. 107) Sets forth special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases. Requires (with exceptions): (1) a district court to render a final determination of an application for habeas corpus brought in a capital case not later than 180 days after the date on which the application is filed; and (2) a court of appeals to hear and render a final determination of any appeal of an order granting or denying such petition within 120 days after the date on which the reply brief is filed and to decide whether to grant a petition or other request for rehearing en banc within 30 days after the date on which the petition for rehearing is filed. Requires the Administrative Office of United States Courts (Administrative Office) to submit to the Congress an annual report on the compliance by the courts of appeals with the time limitations under this section. (Sec. 108) Amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to allow the court, upon a finding that investigative, expert, or other services are reasonably necessary for the representation of a defendant in a criminal action in which a defendant is charged with a crime punishable by death and in certain post-conviction proceedings, to authorize the defendant's attorneys to obtain such services and order the payment of fees and expenses. Prohibits any ex parte proceeding, communication, or request (proceeding) from being considered unless a proper showing is made concerning the need for confidentiality. Requires that any such proceeding be transcribed and made a part of the record available for appellate review. Title II: Justice for Victims - Subtitle A: Mandatory Victim Restitution - Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 - Amends the Federal criminal code to require the court to order restitution of the victim when a convicted defendant is being sentenced for specified offenses (see Sec. 204). Authorizes the court to order restitution in certain other cases. Makes specified procedures (see Sec. 206) applicable to all orders of restitution. (Sec. 203) Requires the court to provide, as an explicit condition of a sentence of probation, that the defendant make restitution as ordered, pay the assessment imposed, and notify the court of any material change in his or her economic circumstances that might affect his or her ability to pay restitution, fines, or special assessments. Repeals certain restrictions on the court's authority to order the making of restitution. (Sec. 204) Directs the court to order, in addition to any other penalty authorized by law, that the defendant make restitution to the victim of the offense or, if the victim is deceased, to the victim's estate. Defines \"victim\" as a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered, including any person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of an offense that involves a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity. Permits a legal guardian or the representative of the victim's estate (other than the defendant), another family member, or any other person appointed as suitable by the court to assume the victim's rights in the case of a victim who is under age 18, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) restitution to persons other than the victim; (2) the form and amount of restitution; and (3) plea agreements not resulting in a conviction. Requires restitution in all sentencing proceedings for convictions of, or plea agreements relating to charges for, any offense: (1) that is a crime of violence, an offense against property (including fraud), or an offense relating to tampering with consumer products; or (2) in which an identifiable victim has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss. Makes exceptions where the number of identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable or where determining complex issues of fact or the amount of the victim's losses would create an excessive burden on the sentencing process. (Sec. 205) Authorizes the court, when sentencing a defendant convicted of specified CSA offenses, to order that the defendant make restitution to any victim of such offense. Specifies that a participant in an offense may not be considered a victim of the offense. Directs the court, in determining whether to order restitution, to consider the amount of the loss sustained by each victim as a result of the offense, the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant's dependents, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate. Permits the court to decline to order restitution upon determining that the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from fashioning such an order outweighs the need to provide restitution to any victims. Sets forth provisions regarding situations in which there is no identifiable victim. Directs that an order of restitution in such case be based on the amount of public harm caused by the offense. Limits the amount of such restitution ordered to the amount of the fine ordered for the offense charged in the case. Directs that such restitution be distributed as follows: 65 percent to the State entity designated to administer crime victim assistance in the State in which the crime occurred and 35 percent to the State entity designated to receive Federal substance abuse block grant funds. Directs: (1) that certain penalty assessments or fines take precedence over a restitution order; (2) that requests for community restitution be considered in all plea agreements negotiated by the United States; and (3) the United States Sentencing Commission (the Commission) to promulgate guidelines to assist courts in determining the amount of restitution that may be ordered. Prohibits: (1) the court from making an award if it appears likely that such award would interfere with a forfeiture under the Federal criminal code or the CSA; and (2) any restitution from being ordered under this section until such time as the Commission promulgates its guidelines. Makes conforming changes to the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and to telemarketing fraud provisions of the Federal criminal code. (Sec. 206) Revises procedures for the issuance and enforcement of restitution orders. Directs the court to: (1) order the probation officer to obtain and include in the presentence report, or in a separate report, information sufficient for the court to exercise its discretion in fashioning a restitution order (including a complete accounting of the losses to each victim, any restitution owed pursuant to a plea agreement, and information relating to the economic circumstances of each defendant); and (2) disclose to both the defendant and the attorney for the Government all portions of the report pertaining to such matters. Directs the probation officer to inform the court if the number or identity of victims cannot be reasonably ascertained, or if other circumstances exist that make such requirement impracticable. Makes specified provisions of the Federal criminal code and Rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure the only rules applicable to proceedings for the issuance and enforcement of restitution orders. Directs: (1) the attorney for the Government, upon the request of the probation officer but not later than 60 days prior to the date initially set for sentencing and after consulting (to the extent practicable) with all identified victims, to promptly provide the probation officer with a listing of the amounts subject to restitution; and (2) the probation officer, prior to submitting the presentence report, to provide specified notice to identified victims and provide each victim with an affidavit form to submit. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) each defendant preparing and filing with the probation officer an affidavit fully describing the defendant's financial resources; (2) the court's authority to require additional documentation or hear testimony; (3) the privacy of any records filed or testimony heard; (4) final determination of the victim's losses and subsequent discovery of further losses; (5) court referral of issues arising in connection with proposed restitution orders to a magistrate judge or special master; and (6) resolution of disputes as to the proper amount or type of restitution. Directs the court to order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim's losses as determined by the court without consideration of the defendant's economic circumstances. Sets forth further requirements, including provisions regarding the form of payments, situations involving multiple defendants, a prohibition on considering the fact that a victim has received compensation with respect to a loss from insurance or any other source in determining the amount of restitution, notification of material changes in the defendant's economic circumstances, and such adjustment of the payment schedule as the interests of justice require. Specifies that: (1) a defendant's conviction for an offense involving the act giving rise to a restitution order shall estop the defendant from denying the essential allegations of that offense in any subsequent Federal civil proceeding or State civil proceeding, to the extent consistent with State law, brought by the victim; (2) a restitution order may be enforced by the United States, as specified; and (3) an order of in-kind restitution in the form of services shall be enforced by the probation officer. Directs the clerk of the court, at the request of a victim named in a restitution order, to issue an abstract of judgment certifying that a judgment has been entered in favor of such victim in the amount specified in the order. Specifies that upon registering, recording, docketing, or indexing such abstract, it shall be a lien on the property of the defendant, subject to specified limitations. Specifies that a sentence that imposes an order of restitution is a final judgment notwithstanding the fact that such sentence can be subsequently corrected, appealed and modified, amended, or adjusted under specified provisions, or that the defendant may be resentenced. (Sec. 207) Amends Rule 32(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to require that: (1) a presentence investigation and report, or other report containing information sufficient for the court to enter an order of restitution, be required in any case in which restitution is required to be ordered; and (2) a presentence report contain, in appropriate cases, information sufficient for the court to enter an order of restitution. Adds restitution to existing provisions governing the imposition of a fine in Federal criminal cases. Directs the court to impose a fine or other monetary penalty only to the extent that such fine or penalty will not impair the ability of the defendant to make restitution required to a victim other than the United States. Sets forth provisions regarding payment schedules, notification to the court of material changes in the defendant's economic circumstances, and default on a restitution fine or payment. Adds restitution provisions to provisions governing the post sentence administration of fines, including collection. Makes it the responsibility of each victim to notify the Attorney General or the appropriate court entity of any change in the victim's mailing address while restitution is still owed. Directs that the confidentiality of any information relating to a victim be maintained. Sets priorities for the disbursement of money received from a defendant. Revises provisions regarding civil remedies for satisfaction of an unpaid fine to authorize the United States to enforce a judgment imposing a fine in accordance with the practices and procedures for the enforcement of a civil judgment under Federal or State law. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the enforcement of such judgments; (2) termination of liability; (3) liens and the effect of filing notice of a lien; (4) inapplicability of the discharge of debt in bankruptcy proceedings; and (5) applicability of specified provisions to the enforcement of an order of restitution. Authorizes the court, upon a finding that the defendant is in default on a payment of a fine or restitution, to revoke probation or a term of supervised release, modify the terms or conditions of a probation or a term of supervised release, resentence a defendant, hold the defendant in contempt of court, enter a restraining order or injunction, order the sale of property of the defendant, accept a performance bond, enter or adjust a payment schedule, or take any other action necessary to obtain compliance with the order of a fine or restitution. Allows any hearing arising out of such default to be conducted by a magistrate judge, subject to de novo review by the court. Requires that proceedings in which the participation of a defendant who is confined in a correctional facility is required or permitted be conducted by telephone, video conference, or other communications technology without removing the prisoner from the facility. Prohibits incarcerating a defendant solely on the basis of inability to make payments because of indigency. (Sec. 209) Requires the Attorney General to ensure that: (1) in all plea agreements negotiated by the United States, consideration is given to requesting that the defendant provide full restitution to all the victims; and (2) restitution orders are enforced to the fullest extent of the law. (Sec. 210) Doubles the special assessments on persons convicted of a felony in Federal cases. Subtitle B: Jurisdiction for Lawsuits Against Terrorist States - Amends the Federal judicial code to make exceptions to: (1) foreign sovereign immunity for certain cases in which money damages are sought against a foreign government for personal injury or death caused by an act of torture, extra judicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision of material support or resources to terrorists (but sets a ten-year statute of limitation, subject to equitable tolling principles, and directs the court to limit discovery that the Attorney General certifies will interfere with a criminal investigation or prosecution, or a national security operation, related to the incident that gave rise to the cause of action, subject to specified restrictions); and (2) immunity from attachment with respect to a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of such state. Subtitle C: Assistance to Victims of Terrorism - Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 1996 - Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VCA) to authorize the Director of the Office of Justice Assistance to make supplemental grants to States: (1) to provide compensation and assistance to State residents who, while outside U.S. territorial boundaries, are victims of a terrorist act or mass violence and are not eligible for compensation under the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986; and (2) for eligible crime victim compensation and assistance programs to provide emergency relief, including crisis response efforts, assistance, training, and technical assistance, for the benefit of victims of terrorist acts or mass violence occurring within the United States and funding to U.S. Attorney's Offices for use in coordination with State victims compensation and assistance efforts in providing emergency relief. Revises provisions of such Act to: (1) authorize the Director, if the sums available in the Crime Victims Fund are sufficient to fully provide grants to the States, to retain any portion of the Fund that was deposited during a fiscal year that was in excess of 110 percent of the total amount deposited in the Fund during the preceding fiscal year as an emergency reserve; (2) prohibit such reserve from exceeding $50 million; and (3) permit the emergency reserve to be used for supplemental grants and to supplement the funds available to provide grants to States for compensation and assistance in years in which supplemental grants are needed. Amends such Act to: (1) permit any amount awarded as part of a grant that remains unspent at the end of a fiscal year in which the grant is made to be expended for the purpose for which the grant is made during the two succeeding fiscal years, at the end of which period any remaining unobligated sums in excess of $500,000 shall be returned to the Treasury (with any remaining unobligated sums in an amount less than $500,000 to be returned to the Fund); and (2) define \"base amount\" for purposes of crime victim assistance to mean $500,000 and for the territories of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Republic of Palau, $200,000, with the latter's share governed by the Compact of Free Association between the United States and the Republic of Palau. (Sec. 233) Amends the VCA to provide for the compensation of victims of terrorism. Designates the Federal building at 1314 LeMay Boulevard, Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, as the Cartney McRaven Child Development Center. (Sec. 234) Amends the VCA to: (1) prohibit payments to delinquent criminal debtors by State crime victim compensation programs; and (2) exclude victim assistance from income for purposes of determining eligibility for Federal benefits. (Sec. 235) Directs the trial court in criminal cases where the venue is moved out of State more than 350 miles from the location in which those proceedings originally would have taken place, to order closed circuit televising of the proceedings for viewing by such persons whom the court determines have a compelling interest and who are otherwise unable to view the proceedings by reason of the inconvenience and expense caused by the change of venue. Limits access to such broadcast. Specifies that: (1) the signal so transmitted shall be under the control of the court at all times and shall only be transmitted subject to the terms and conditions imposed by the court; (2) no public broadcast or dissemination shall be made of that signal (and, in the event any tapes are produced in carrying out such provision, such tapes shall be the property of the court and kept under seal); and (3) any violations shall be punishable as contempt of court. Authorizes the Administrative Office to accept donations to enable the courts to carry out such provision Title III: International Terrorism Prohibitions - Subtitle A: Prohibition on International Terrorist Fundraising - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to authorize the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) and the Attorney General, to designate an organization as a terrorist organization upon finding that the organization is a foreign organization that engages in terrorist activity and such activity threatens the security of U.S. nationals or U.S. national security.
