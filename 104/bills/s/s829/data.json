    "text": "Educational Opportunity Demonstration Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish an educational opportunity demonstration program to provide waivers for the establishment of educational opportunity schools, in order to: (1) allow experimentation with same gender classes for low-income, educationally disadvantaged students; (2) determine whether such classes make a difference in the educational achievement and opportunities of such individuals; and (3) involve parents in the educational options and choices of their children. Directs the Secretary to waive for up to five years (but only to the extent the Secretary determines necessary to ensure the development and operation of same gender classes) any statutory or regulatory requirement of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, specified provisions of the Education Amendments of 1974 and of the Revised Statutes, and any other law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex, for up to ten local educational agencies that have applications approved and for any educational opportunity school established by such an agency. Requires each local educational agency receiving such a waiver to establish an educational opportunity advisory board. Sets forth requirements for applications and selection of waiver grantees. Directs the Secretary to study and report to the appropriate congressional committees on such waivers, comparing the educational and behavioral achievement of those students choosing same gender classes and those students choosing the coeducational option at such schools. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the availability, under title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, of remedies to overcome the effects of past discrimination on the basis of sex."
