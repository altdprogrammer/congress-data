    "text": "Voluntary Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal judicial code to authorize each U.S. district court to: (1) encourage litigants in appropriate cases to use voluntary alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures, whether offered in the private sector or sponsored by the court; and (2) establish such voluntary ADR programs as the court determines appropriate. Provides that the ADR procedures may include mediation, early neutral evaluation, minitrials, summary jury or bench trials, and non-binding judicial arbitration. Authorizes a Federal court to establish appropriate voluntary ADR procedures and encourage voluntary use of ADR services offered in the private sector. Specifies that: (1) an ADR program under this Act shall not infringe on a litigant's right to trial de novo and shall impose no penalty on participating litigants; and (2) nothing in this Act is intended to interfere with any ADR program authorized under any other provision of law, including court annexed non-binding arbitration."
