    "date": "1995-10-31", 
    "text": "Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1995 - Allows a professional boxing match to be held in the United States only if: (1) the State in which the match is to be held has a State boxing commissioner a contract with a private organization to carry out the duties of a commission or the match promoter has entered into an agreement with the chief administrative officer (CAO) of another State that has a commission to oversee the match; (2) a licensed practicing physician, paid by the promoter, is continuously present at ringside; (3) the promoter has provided for physical examinations by a licensed practicing physician to ensure that each boxer is physically fit to compete and for an ambulance to be continuously present at the site (or, if State law does not require an ambulance and the promoter does not provide one, the promoter shall provide 24 hours' notice of the match to the nearest available ambulance service); and (4) the commission has established procedures to carry out registration, review, insurance, and reporting requirements under this Act. Requires a State to provide for continual monitoring and regular evaluations of a private organization under contract to carry out the duties of a commission. Authorizes the CAO of that State to cancel a match without consulting the organization: (1) upon determining that such organization is not performing its obligations in a satisfactory manner; or (2) to protect public health, safety, or welfare. (Sec. 5) Requires each professional boxer to register with the commission (or organization under contract) of the State in which such boxer resides or, in the case of a boxer who is a resident of a foreign country or a State in which there is no such commissioner organization, the commission of any State that has a commission (or organization). Directs a commission (or organization) to issue to each professional boxer who registers in accordance with such provisions an identification card that contains: (1) a recent photograph of the boxer; (2) the social security number of the boxer (or, in the case of a foreign boxer, any similar citizen identification number or professional boxer number from the boxer's country of residence); and (3) the personal identification numbers assigned to the boxer by the boxing registries certified by the Association of Boxing Commissioners. Requires each professional boxer to: (1) renew his or her identification card at least every three years; and (2) present such card to the appropriate commission or organization not later than the time of the weigh-in for a match. Declares that nothing in this Act shall prevent States from applying additional registration requirements. (Sec. 6) Directs each commission and organization to establish procedures to: (1) evaluate the professional records of each boxer participating in a match in the State; (2) ensure that no boxer is permitted to box while under suspension from any commission due to injury or other medical-related reason, including a recent knockout, injury, or requirement for a medical procedure, failure of a drug test, poor boxing skills or inability to compete safely, the use of false aliases, or falsifying or attempting to falsify official identification cards or documents; and (3) ensure that if such commission or organization is considering permitting a boxer, promoter, manager, or other licensee to participate in a match while the individual is under suspension from any State for reasons other than those stated above, such commission or organization shall notify and consult with the CAO of the State that ordered the suspension prior to approving such participation. (Sec. 7) Requires each State, acting through the State commission or organization, to require that a promoter provide insurance coverage for each boxer to cover an injury sustained while engaged in that match. (Sec. 8) Requires the results of a match and the suspension of a boxer, promoter, or manager ordered by a commission to be reported to each professional boxing registry certified by the Association of Boxing Commissions and to the Florida State Athletic Commission within 48 business hours. Specifies that if the State of Florida ceases to publish and circulate a national suspension list at no cost to other States on a frequent basis, the Association shall select a different public or private entity to voluntarily undertake to compile and circulate a suspension list to all commissions at no cost to the States. (Sec. 9) Authorizes the U.S. Attorney to bring a civil action in U.S. district court requesting relief to restrain a person or entity from continuing to engage in, or to sanction, a match in violation of this Act. Imposes criminal penalties on each manager, promoter, matchmaker, and licensee who knowingly and willfully violates this Act. Directs the Attorney General for each State to designate a U.S. Attorney that has an office in that State to serve as a liaison to respond to allegations concerning violations of this Act and as a coordinator for any enforcement activity conducted pursuant to this Act that is carried out by any U.S. Attorney in that State. (Sec. 10) Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) notification to the designated U.S. Attorney by each promoter that intends to hold a match in a State that does not have a commission; and (2) consultation with State boxing officials by the Attorney General. (Sec. 12) Directs the Secretary of Labor to study and report to the Congress on the feasibility and cost of a national pension system for professional boxers, including potential funding sources. (Sec. 13) Sets forth requirements regarding the conduct of matches on Indian reservations."
