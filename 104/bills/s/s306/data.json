    "text": "Television Violence Reduction Through Parental Empowerment Act of 1995 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require that any television with a screen of at least 13 inches which is manufactured, or imported for use, in the United States be equipped with circuitry designed to enable viewers to block the display of channels, programs, time slots, and all programs with a common rating. Prohibits shipping in interstate commerce, manufacturing, assembling, or importing any such television except pursuant to rules prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Requires such rules to provide performance and display standards for such blocking technology. Directs the FCC, as new video technology is developed, to ensure that blocking service continues to be available to consumers."
