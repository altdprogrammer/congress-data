Directs that, in any fiscal year, a non-Federal entity have either a single audit or a program-specific audit if such entity expends a total Federal award amount equal to or in excess of $300,000 or such other specified amount. Sets forth audit requirements and exceptions. Requires a non-Federal entity to transmit a reporting package to a Federal clearinghouse and make it available for public inspection within a specified time frame."
