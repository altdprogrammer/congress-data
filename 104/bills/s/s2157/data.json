    "text": "Lead-Acid Battery Recycling Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit persons from disposing of lead-acid batteries (batteries) in a landfill, by incineration, or in any manner other than by return of spent batteries to one of the following authorized recipients: (1) a retail or wholesale seller of such batteries; (2) a regulated lead smelter; (3) an automotive dismantler or scrap dealer; (4) a collection entity designated to accept such batteries; or (5) a manufacturer of batteries of the same general type. Specifies respective authorized recipients of returns from retailers, wholesalers, dismantlers, collection entities, and manufacturers. Requires retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers of batteries (with an exception for a low number of sales) to accept spent batteries of the same general type as those sold in a quantity approximately equal to the number of batteries sold. Requires retailers to post a clearly visible notice informing the public of the legal requirement to recycle batteries. Sets forth labeling requirements, preempting State or local requirements inconsistent with this Act. Permits export of a spent battery for recycling purposes. Imposes civil penalties for violations of this Act and permits the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to commence an action for appropriate relief, including injunctions."
