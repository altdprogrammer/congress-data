    "text": "Old Faithful Protection Act of 1995 - Declares that any use, production, exploration, or development of any new or existing geothermal well within the boundary of the Yellowstone Protection Area risks adverse effects upon the thermal features of Yellowstone National Park. (Sec. 104) Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from issuing any geothermal lease for lands within the boundary of the Area. (Sec. 105) Places a moratorium upon the use, production, development or exploration of any new wells within the Area. Directs the Secretary to take the steps necessary to protect the Park's thermal systems and features. (Sec. 106) Directs the National Park Service to research, inventory, and report to the Congress at least every five years on the current and potential effects of hydrothermal or geothermal development upon protected systems and features. Mandates the exclusive use of nonintrusive methodologies. (Sec. 107) Prescribes guidelines under which the States of Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho are encouraged to implement federally approved State management programs for regulated resources outside Yellowstone National Park. Prohibits any use (including research), production, exploration, or development of any regulated resources on non-Federal lands within the Area except as authorized by permit issued by a State agency implementing a federally approved State program. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho and with the Secretary of Agriculture to fulfill the purposes of this title. (Sec. 108) Declares that the water rights compact entered into by the United States and the State of Montana on January 31, 1994, shall be considered an approved State program for regulation of groundwater resources within Yellowstone Protection Area. (Sec. 109) Makes certain land restrictions, the moratorium on new well activity, and other requirements of this Act ineffective with respect to the Area within Idaho and Wyoming for two years if the Governor of the State notifies the Secretary that the State will prohibit any permit or other approval action involving regulated resources within the Area during such period. Authorizes either State to submit a State program during such period. Activates such restrictions and requirements and the moratorium at the end of the two-year period upon approval or disapproval of the respective State program. (Sec. 110) Provides for judicial review of administrative procedures relating to this Act. (Sec. 112) Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 114) Prescribes guidelines for the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire by exchange certain lands and interests in lands owned by the Church Universal and Triumphant located in the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area and Corwin Springs Known Geothermal Resource Area of the Gallatin National Forest."
