Revises OPO requirements, including requiring an OPO to be a member of and abide by the rules of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. (Sec. 103) Replaces certain provisions relating to the Network with provisions mandating a contract for the operation of the Network.

Requires the Network to report continuing noncompliance with Network policies, rules, and requirements. Allows the Network to assess a patient registration fee and a data management fee. Grants the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Comptroller General access to all data collected. Revises Network requirements. Requires a plan to implement the access recommendations of the evaluation mandated by this Act. (Sec. 104) Revises requirements regarding the terms and conditions of contracts under PHSA organ transplant provisions. (Sec. 105) Modifies requirements regarding a Public Health Service administrative unit that deals with organ procurement activities. Requires that unit to oversee the Network and to oversee the scientific registry mandated by this Act. (Sec. 106) Mandates a contract for an evaluation and a report to the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee regarding: (1) the role and impact in the oversight and support of solid-organ transplantation, the Network, and the scientific registry; (2) access to membership on the Network's board and committees. (Sec. 108) Authorizes appropriations to carry out specified organ transplant provisions. Title II: Bone Marrow Donor Program - Bone Marrow Transplantation Program Reauthorization Act of 1996 - Makes the primary purpose of the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry (Donor Registry) increasing unrelated donor marrow transplants.

Requires evaluations and a report to the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on: (1) the feasibility of integrating or consolidating all federally funded bone marrow transplantation scientific registries; and (2) all federally funded bone marrow transplantation research to be conducted under the National Institutes of Health's peer review system.
