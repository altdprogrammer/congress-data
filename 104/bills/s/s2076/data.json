Prescribes procedural guidelines under which the Secretary of Transportation shall notify the owner or operator of one or more foreign-flag vessels that he shall terminate the authorization for the foreign-flag vessel to provide passenger transportation upon a showing by the owner or charterer of a U.S. cruise vessel that the U.S. vessel is offering such passenger service pursuant to a Certificate of Financial Responsibility for Indemnification of Passengers for Nonperformance of Transportation. States that coastwise privileges granted a foreign-flag cruise vessel under this Act shall expire on the 365th day following receipt of the Secretary's termination notification."
