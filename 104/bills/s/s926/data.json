Prohibits a Federal agency from issuing or renewing any such license of an individual who is delinquent in the payment of child support, with exceptions. (Sec. 102) Prohibits Federal benefits, loans, guarantees, and employment for individuals owing child support arrearages exceeding $1,000, with exceptions. (Sec. 103) Authorizes the Secretary of State to refuse, revoke, or restrict passports in cases where the applicant or holder is a noncustodial parent subject to a State arrest warrant for nonpayment of child support under specified circumstances. (Sec. 104) Amends the Consumer Credit Protection Act to allow appropriate State agencies to obtain from credit reporting agencies information for establishing and modifying child support awards. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) establish a system of reporting of new employees by requiring employers to provide a copy of every new employee's W-4 form to the State child support enforcement agency; and (2) modify such form to include whether a child support obligation is owed (and if so, to whom and the amount of the obligation), whether payment of such obligation is to be by income withholding, and whether such employee has health insurance. (Sec. 106) Prohibits the use of Federal funds to provide assistance to, or on behalf of, a child in a family that includes an individual whom the agency responsible for administering such assistance determines is not cooperating in establishing the paternity of such child, or in establishing, modifying, or enforcing a support order with respect to such child. (Sec. 107) Revises the SSA to make moneys from or payable by the United States or the District of Columbia to an individual subject to withholding in accordance with State law to enforce the legal obligation of such individual to provide child support or alimony. (Sec. 108) Provides for the enforcement of child support obligations of members of the armed forces. Title II: Interstate Child Support Enforcement - Amends the Federal judicial code to provide for full faith and credit of child support and parentage orders. Title III: Hiding Assets - Amends the SSA to condition certain grants on States having laws which require the use of procedures: (1) requiring that, in any case related to child support, any transfer of property by an individual who owes a child support arrearage be presumed to be made with the intent to avoid payment of the arrearage, subject to rebuttal by evidence to the contrary; and (2) that allow the State to void fraudulent conveyances of property that are made in an attempt to avoid child support obligations. Title IV: Effective Date - Makes this Act effective with respect to calendar quarters beginning on or after October 1, 1995. Specifies that in the case of a State that the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines requires legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) to meet the additional requirements imposed by this Act, the State shall not be regarded as failing to comply before the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the close of the first regular session of the State legislature that begins after this Act's enactment date."
