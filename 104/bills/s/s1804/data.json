    "text": "Amends the Compact of Free Association Act of 1985 to: (1) extend, upon request of the Government of the Marshall Islands, certain agricultural and food assistance programs for the Bikini and Enewetak people, for another five years; and (2) ensure that the commodities provided reflect the population changes that have occurred since the effective date of the Compact. (Sec. 2) Repeals the mandate that the Secretary of the Interior transfer administration of the American Memorial Park (in Saipan) to the government of the Northern Mariana Islands. (Sec. 3) Makes technical changes to the Education Amendments of 1972 with respect to Territorial Land Grant Colleges (thus providing separate land grant status to the College of Micronesia--FSM, the College of the Marshall Islands, and the Palau Community College). Requires that the land grant trust fund amount attributable to a specified appropriation authorized for Micronesia be divided equally among the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau for the benefit of the College of the Marshall Islands, the College of Micronesia-FSM, and the Palau Community College. (Sec. 4) Amends the Organic Act of Guam to provide for transfer of Federal excess real property by the Administrator of General Services to the Government of Guam. (Sec. 5) Repeals a limitation upon the use of specified land conveyed to the Government of Guam. (Sec. 6) Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safety Streets Act of 1968 to extend State treatment with respect to certain drug enforcement programs to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. (Sec. 7) Amends the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands to provide that: (1) an absence of the Governor or Lieutenant Governor from the territory while on official business shall not be a \"temporary absence\" involving a surrender of authority and power; and (2) Virgin Islands revenue bonds, instead of the current priority for payment, shall have a parity lien with every other subsequently issued obligation. (Sec. 8) Establishes the Commission on the Economic Future of the Virgin Islands to make recommendations to the President and the Congress on policies and programs for a secure and self-sustaining future for the local economy of the Virgin Islands through 2020, as well as the Federal role in providing for that future. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 9) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to report to the Congress on alternatives to provide adequate hospital services to the population of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. (Sec. 10) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide, on a nonreimbursable basis, technical and training assistance to the Government of the Marshall Islands to carry out direct radiation related medical surveillance and treatment programs under the Compact. (Sec. 11) Amends the Housing Community Development Act of 1980 to make a lawful resident alien of the United States and its territories and possessions (including the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau) eligible for certain housing assistance. (Sec. 12) Authorizes the President to negotiate an amendment to the Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Marshall Islands for the Implementation of Section 177 of the Compact to limit eligibility for radiological monitoring, medical surveillance, and other treatment to persons who were directly affected by the U.S. nuclear testing program in the Marshall Islands between June 30, 1946, and August 18, 1958. Requires the Secretary of Energy to make a specified inflation adjustment to the annual grant to the Government of the Marshall Islands for health and medical programs, if such Government agrees to this Agreement amendment."
