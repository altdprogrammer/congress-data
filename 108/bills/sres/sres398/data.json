    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should: (1) mobilize necessary economic and scientific support to establish a Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise (a virtual consortium to accelerate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine development by enhancing coordination, information sharing, and collaboration globally); (2) urge members of the Group of Eight (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to garner support from their own communities for the development of an HIV vaccine; and (3) establish a second vaccine research and development center in the United States. Expresses the sense of the Senate that such countries should: (1) leverage financial contributions from the international philanthropic community to provide funding to promote the development of an HIV vaccine; (2) include the scientific and political leadership of the countries most affected by HIV and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic; and (3) develop a plan for furthering such efforts at their June 2005 meeting. Urges the President to generate global support for the establishment of a Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise by carrying out an initiative that includes: (1) coordinating and partnering with member countries, the private sector, and other countries; (2) encouraging Group of Eight countries to act swiftly to mobilize resources; (3) following a strategic plan to prioritize the challenges to be addressed, to coordinate research and product development, and to encourage greater use of information-sharing networks and technologies; and (4) encouraging the establishment of coordinated global HIV vaccine development centers."
