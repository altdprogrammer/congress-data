Declares the sense of the Senate that: (1) the Senate strongly supports the nonproliferation programs of the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the Department of State (Federal nonproliferation programs), which are intended to reduce the worldwide threat posed by nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that remain unsecured in the Russian Federation and elsewhere; (2) the Russian Federation should continue to improve U.S. access to key facilities, and the sharing of information with the United States, so as to bring a successful and timely conclusion to various nonproliferation programs and activities; and (3) the United States should redouble its efforts to achieve full implementation of the Federal nonproliferation programs under effective management, and make full use of all funds that Congress appropriates or otherwise makes available for such programs."
