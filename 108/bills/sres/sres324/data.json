Recommends that the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) appoint an independent panel of expert scientists and engineers inside and outside of NASA to examine all possible options for safely carrying out the planned servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. Expresses the strong sentiment of the House of Representatives that NASA should continue all planning, preparation, and astronaut training activities for the SM-4 servicing mission without interruption until: (1) the expert panel issues its report; and (2) NASA provides a timetable of compliance with a recommendation of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board report which calls for a fully autonomous capability for all missions, since such compliance will allow both a Hubble servicing mission and missions to the International Space Station to be carried out safely."
