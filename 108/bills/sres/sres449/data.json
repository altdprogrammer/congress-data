    "text": "Denounces the confinement of refugees to a camp or segregated settlement or other deprivation of the refugees' basic rights in a situation that has lasted ten years or more as a denial of basic human rights and a squandering of human potential. Urges the Secretary of State to actively pursue models of refugee assistance that permit refugees to enjoy all the rights recognized in the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Encourages the international community to denounce such practice. Calls upon the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to monitor refugee situations more effectively."
