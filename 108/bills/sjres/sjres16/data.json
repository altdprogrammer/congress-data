(Sec. 102) Directs the United States to provide non-reimbursable technical and training assistance, including training and equipment for postal inspection of illicit drugs and other contraband, to enable the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) to develop and adequately enforce its laws and to cooperate with the United States in the enforcement of U.S. criminal laws. Declares that certain funds appropriated under this title may be used to reimburse State or local agencies providing such assistance. Specifies the auditing authorities of the Comptroller General under the U.S.-FSM Compact. (Sec. 103) Directs the United States to provide the same non-reimbursable technical and training assistance to the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), with the same authority to use certain funds appropriated under this title to reimburse State or local agencies providing such assistance. Cites the Compact of Free Association Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-239), which granted congressional approval of the Compact of Free Association between the United States, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia to recount provisions regarding: (1) the continued availability of certain lands on Ejit to the people of Bikini; (2) the \"Section 177 Agreement\" on U.S. compensation to citizens of the Marshall Islands, or the FSM, or Palau for loss or damage to property or person resulting from the U.S. nuclear testing program between June 30, 1946, and August 18, 1958; (3) additional specified amounts payable to the peoples of Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap, and Utrik who were affected by the U.S. nuclear weapons testing program; (4) ratification and approval of the Section 177 Agreement as full and final settlement of all compensation claims relating to nuclear testing; (5) the Four Atoll Health Care Program; (6) the Enjebi Community Trust Fund and resettlement of the people of Enjebi on Enjebi or elsewhere if Enjebi exceeds radiation standards; and (7) funding of the Bikini Atoll Cleanup.

Makes appropriations: (1) for FY 2004 through 2023 to carry out the planting and agricultural maintenance program on Enewetak; and (2) for FY 2005 as the final contribution of the United States to the Rongelap Resettlement Trust Fund, for purposes of establishing a food importation program. Grants all necessary authorities to the Comptroller General to audit assistance programs under the Compacts. Directs the United States to initiate certain procedures under the U.S.-RMI Compact to resolve expeditiously such nonpayment if the RMI Government fails to pay certain funds to the landowners of Kwajalein Atoll in accordance with the land use agreement dated October 19, 1982. Requires payment by the RMI Government into an interest-bearing escrow account in a U.S. financial institution of any amounts paid to it by the United States in excess of the amounts required to be paid to the Kwajalein landowners, until such time as the RMI Government and the landowners conclude an agreement amending or superseding the existing one. Requires payment of such escrow funds and interest to the landowners whenever a new land use agreement is concluded. Authorizes the President to make loans and grants to the RMI Government to address the special needs of the community at Ebeye, Kwajalein Atoll, and other Marshallese communities within the Kwajalein Atoll pursuant to certain development plans.

Declares that the rights of a bona fide naturalized citizen of the FSM or the RMI to enter the United States, to lawfully engage in occupations there, and to establish nonimmigrant residence shall not be deemed to extend to any such naturalized citizen about whom U.S. officials may reasonably infer that the citizen acquired such status primarily in order to obtain such rights. Declares the sense of Congress that: (1) up to certain amounts of grant assistance to the FSM and the RMI, if mutually agreed between the U.S., FSM, and RMI Governments, be used for the purpose of increasing the machine-readability and security of passports issued by such jurisdictions; and (2) such funds be obligated by September 30, 2004, and in the amount and manner specified by the Secretary of State. Authorizes the U.S. Government to require that passports used for the purpose of seeking admission into the United States under the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact contain the security enhancements funded by such assistance. Declares the sense of Congress that the FSM and RMI Governments develop, before October 1, 2004, the capability to provide reliable and timely information as may reasonably be required by the U.S. Government in enforcing criminal and security-related grounds of inadmissibility and deportability under the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to continue to make the services of the National Health Service Corps available to FSM and RMI residents to the same extent and for so long as they are authorized for persons residing in any other areas within or outside the United States. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Governor of an affected jurisdiction to report annually to the Secretary of the Interior on any adverse consequences from implementation of the Compacts. Authorizes the President, in order to address previously accrued and unreimbursed impact expenses, at the request of the Governor of Guam or the Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and subject to notification of Congress, to reduce, release, or waive all or part of any amounts owed by such Governments (or either government's autonomous agencies or instrumentalities), respectively, to any U.S. department, agency, independent agency, office, or instrumentality. Requires both Governors to report to the Secretary of the Interior substantiating unreimbursed impact expenses claimed for the period from January 14, 1986, through September 30, 2003.

Requires the President to report annually to Congress on the FSM and the RMI, and the Comptroller General to report to Congress on them every five years. Requires the U.S., FSM, and RMI Governments to review every five years the overall political, economic, and security aspects of their relationship, as well as progress in meeting objectives in their respective development plans. Declares that specified provisions of the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact regarding U.S. regulations under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, which would define the terms of admission into the United States of FSM and RMI citizens as nonimmigrant aliens, shall be construed as though any such regulations that would have a significant effect on the admission, stay, and employment privileges shall not become effective until 90 days after their transmission to specified congressional committees.

(Sec. 105) Declares that, except as otherwise provided in this joint resolution, all U.S. Federal programs and services extended to or operated in the FSM or the RMI are and shall remain subject to all applicable criteria, standards, reporting requirements, auditing procedures, and other rules and regulations applicable to such programs when operating in the United States (including its territories and commonwealths).
