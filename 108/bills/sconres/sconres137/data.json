Calls upon the Secretary and the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations to pursue the immediate suspension of Sudan from the UN Commission on Human Rights until it meets its obligations regarding Darfur. Calls upon the Secretary and the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations to take immediate steps to pursue the establishment of a formal UN investigation to determine whether the Government of Sudan's actions in Darfur constitute acts of genocide. Calls upon the member states of the UN Commission on Human Rights to convene a special session to consider the acute human rights situation in Sudan for the purpose of considering whether Sudan should be suspended from Commission membership."
