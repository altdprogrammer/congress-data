Condemns the repressive anti-Bahai policies and actions of the Government of Iran, and expresses concern that individual Bahais continue to suffer from severely repressive and discriminatory government actions. Urges the Government of Iran to permit: (1) Bahai students to attend, and Bahai faculty to teach at, Iranian universities; and (2) the Bahai Open University to continue to function. Urges the Government of Iran to implement fully the recommendations by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on the emancipation of the Iranian Bahai community. Urges the Government of Iran to extend to the Bahai community the rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international covenants of human rights, including the freedoms of thought, conscience, and religion, and equal protection of the law. Calls upon the President to continue to: (1) assert U.S. concerns regarding Iran's human rights practices, including its treatment of the Bahai community; (2) emphasize the importance of human rights practices in the development of U.S.-Iranian relations; and (3) cooperate with international organizations to protect religious minority rights in Iran. Urges the European Union to use its relationship with Iran to address and advance fundamental human rights issues."
