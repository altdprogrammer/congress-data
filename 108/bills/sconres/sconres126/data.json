    "text": "States that Congress reiterates its strongest condemnation of the 1994 attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and honors the victims of this heinous act and expresses its sympathy to the victims' relatives. Underscores U.S. concern regarding the case's continuing delay. Urges the Government of Argentina to continue to provide the resources necessary for its judicial system and intelligence agencies to investigate all areas of the AMIA case. Calls upon the international community to cooperate with the AMIA investigation. Encourages the President to direct U.S. law enforcement agencies to cooperate with the Government of Argentina to expand the investigation into this bombing and suspected terrorist support activities in the tri-border area of Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil. Encourages the President to direct the U.S. Representative to the Organization of American States (OAS) to seek OAS support for the creation of a special task force of the Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism to assist in the AMIA investigation, and urge OAS member countries to designate Hizballah as a terrorist organization. Stresses the need for international pressure on Iran and Syria to extradite for trial individuals and government officials accused of planning or perpetrating the AMIA attack. Expresses desire for a relationship between the United States and Argentina which is built in part on mutual abhorrence of terrorism and commitments to peace, stability, and democracy in the Western Hemisphere."
