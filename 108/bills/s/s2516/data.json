Requires the Secretary of Defense to: (1) prescribe Department of Defense (DOD) policy for providing timely notification to next of kin of the status of members of the Armed Forces who are seriously ill or injured in a combat zone; and (2) transmit a copy of that policy to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. Authorizes FY 2005 appropriations to fund medical equipment and combat casualty technologies for the DOD."
