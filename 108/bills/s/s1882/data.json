Directs the NICS operator, upon receiving this information, to immediately provide the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the terrorist task force and State and local law enforcement in the jurisdiction in which the firearm purchase is being attempted with: (1) the name, date of birth, and any other identifying information reported by the prospective transferee; (2) the time and place of the attempted firearm purchase; and (3) the type of weapon, if known, that the prospective transferee attempted to purchase. Requires the NICS operator to also immediately provide that information to the agency that placed the name of the suspected terrorist on the terrorist watch list."
