Authorizes the Secretary, upon the request of an accreditation body, to issue a limited provisional certificate to an entity to enable it to conduct examinations for educational purposes while an onsite visit from an accreditation body is in progress (72-hour maximum). Authorizes appropriations for the mammography facilities certification program through FY 2005."
