Allows the Secretary to require a lessee or operator to submit for examination a copy of a tax return for any taxable year in which the single farm operation of the lessee or operator received irrigation water at less than full cost.Repeals a provision exempting from Federal reclamation ownership and cost pricing limitations district lands held in trust for a beneficiary or beneficiaries whose interests in the lands served do not exceed such limitations.Directs the Secretaries of the Interior, the Treasury, and Agriculture to enter into a memorandum of understanding to permit the Secretary of the Interior to have access to and use available information collected or maintained by either the Department of the Treasury or Agriculture that would aid in enforcement of the ownership and pricing limitations of Federal reclamation law.Terminates the Uniformed Services University of Health Science.Requires the Secretary of Defense to terminate production of D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles under the D5 submarine-launched ballistic missile program."
