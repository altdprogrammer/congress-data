Directs the President to take specified sanctions against Sudan and its officials if Sudan has not taken actions necessary for such certification. Directs the Secretary of State to require the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations to pursue a Security Council Resolution condemning Sudan for its actions in Darfur and calling for: (1) accountability for those responsible for the atrocities in Darfur; and (2) member states of the United Nations to freeze the assets of senior members of the Government of Sudan, cease importing Sudanese oil, restrict the entry or transit of senior members of the Government of Sudan, and cease selling arms to the Government of Sudan."
