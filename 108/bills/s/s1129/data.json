Directs immigration officers who find UACs at U.S. land borders or ports of entry to permit them to withdraw their applications for admission and return to their country of nationality or last habitual residence if it is determined on a case-by-case basis that such UACs: (1) are nationals or habitual residents of contiguous countries that have an agreement with the United States providing for their safe return and orderly repatriation; (2) do not have a fear of persecution upon their return; (3) would not be endangered upon their return; and (4) are able to make an independent decision to withdraw their application for admission. States that such UACs shall have the right to consult with a consular officer prior to repatriation and with the Office of Refugee Resettlement (the Office) at the Department of Health and Human Services. Gives the Office jurisdiction over the care and custody of all other UACs including trafficking victims, except those charged with or convicted of felonies (excluding offenses proscribed by the Immigration and Nationality Act) or who threaten national security, whose custody and care is vested in the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security (the Directorate) at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security (the Secretary) to notify the Office promptly of the apprehension or discovery of UACs, any claim by an alien in the Directorate's custody that such alien is under the age of 18, or any suspicion that such alien is under the age of 18.

(Sec. 102) Specifies the following order of preference for placing UACs, subject to the discretion of the Director of the Office (the Director) and a suitability assessment by the State of the child's proposed residence or a voluntary agency contracted with the Office: (1) parents; (2) legal guardians; (3) adult relatives; (4) individuals or entities designated by parents or legal guardians; (5) State-licensed juvenile shelters, group homes, or foster care programs; or (6) qualified adults or entities seeking custody of the child when there is no other likely alternative to long-term detention and family reunification is not reasonable. Requires the Director to assess the suitability of placing UACs with a parent or legal guardian who is seeking custody subsequent to placement with other persons or entities and to make a determination on placement within 30 days. Requires the Director to establish policies and programs, including witness protection programs, to ensure that UACs are protected from smugglers, traffickers, or other persons seeking to victimize or otherwise engage them in criminal, harmful, or exploitative activity. Requires officers or employees of the DHS to report persons suspected of such activity to Federal or State prosecutors and, if the person is an attorney, to the appropriate State bar association. Authorizes the Director to make grants to, and enter into contracts with, voluntary agencies for the care and placement of UACs and to reimburse States for any expenses they incur in providing assistance to UACs who are served under the UAC provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA).

Requires the Director and the Secretary to develop procedures prohibiting the unreasonable use of: (1) shackling, handcuffing, or other restraints on children; (2) solitary confinement; or (3) pat or strip searches. States that nothing in this Act's provisions on placement and detention standards shall be construed as superseding procedures favoring the release of children to appropriate adults or entities or placement in the least secure setting possible, as defined in the Stipulated Settlement Agreement under Flores v. Reno. (Sec. 104) Expresses the sense of Congress that, to the extent practicable and consistent with U.S. treaty obligations, the U.S. Government should undertake efforts to ensure that it does not repatriate children in its custody into settings that would threaten their life and safety. Requires the Secretary of State to include in each year's State Department Country Report on Human Rights an assessment of the degree to which each country protects children from smugglers and traffickers. Requires the Directorate to consult that report and the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000: Trafficking in Persons Report in assessing whether to repatriate a UAC to a particular country. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit annual reports to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on efforts to repatriate UACs. (Sec. 105) Requires the Director to develop procedures for promptly determining the age of aliens in the custody of the DHS or the Office when age is at issue.

Requires the Director to enter into contracts with or make grants to nonprofit agencies with relevant expertise in the delivery of immigration-related legal services to children to carry out this Act. Authorizes such nonprofit agencies to enter into subcontracts with or make grants to private voluntary agencies for services. Requires EOIR to develop and implement model guidelines for the legal representation of alien children in immigration proceedings based on the children's asylum guidelines, the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and other relevant domestic or international sources. Directs that such guidelines must be designed to help protect children from individuals suspected of involvement in criminal, harmful, or exploitative activity associated with trafficking or smuggling children while ensuring the fairness of removal proceedings in which such children are involved. Requires counsel for UACs to: (1) represent UACs in all proceedings and matters relating to their immigration status or other actions involving the Directorate; (2) appear in person for all individual merits hearings before the EOIR and interviews involving the Directorate; and (3) owe the same duties of undivided loyalty, confidentiality, and competent representation to such children as is due adult clients. States that counsel shall: (1) have reasonable access to UACs; (2) be given 24 hours advance notice of a transfer absent compelling and unusual circumstances; and (3) except in emergency situations involving the child's physical safety, be given prompt and adequate notice of all immigration matters affecting or involving UACs.

Title III: Strengthening Policies for Permanent Protection of Alien Children - (Sec. 301) Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to specify that: (1) aliens seeking special immigrant juvenile (SIJ) status must be 18 years of age and under on the date of application; (2) court orders declaring such aliens dependent on a juvenile court located in the United States or placing them in the custody of a State entity due to abuse, neglect, abandonment or similar grounds shall be binding on the Secretary for purposes of SIJ adjudications; and (3) the Office must certify to the Director that SIJ classifications with respect to alien children in Federal custody have not been made solely to provide immigration benefits. Excludes presence without admission or parole as a ground for inadmissibility with regard to aliens seeking SIJ status. Authorizes the Secretary to waive the additional grounds of prostitution and commercialized vice in the case of an offense which arose as the consequence of an alien child being unaccompanied. Renders children granted relief under SIJ provisions eligible for the assistance made available to refugee children until they exceed the age of eligibility for such assistance or are placed in a permanent adoptive home, whichever occurs first. States that children described in SIJ provisions who filed an application for a visa before enactment of this Act and who were 19, 20, or 21 years old on the date of such application shall not be denied a visa after enactment on the basis of their age.

Calls upon the EOIR to adopt such guidelines in its handling of children's asylum claims before immigration judges and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). Requires the Secretary to provide periodic comprehensive training under such guidelines to asylum officers, immigration judges, members of the BIA, and immigration officers who have contact with children. States that voluntary agencies shall be allowed to assist in such training. (Sec. 402) Adds an analysis of the worldwide situation faced by unaccompanied refugee children to the list of information to be shared with House and Senate Judiciary Committee members by the administration during required consultations on annual refugee admissions.
