(Sec. 1002) Amends the WRDA of 1996 to authorize the Secretary to engage in activities (including contracting) in support of other Federal agencies, international organizations, or foreign governments to address problems of national significance to the United States. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 1003) Authorizes the Secretary to include individuals from the private sector in training classes and courses offered by the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) if that it is in the Government's best interest. (Sec. 1004) Amends the WRDA of 1999 to make permanent the demonstration recreation fee program for the Corps. Allows: (1) the Corps to retain 100 percent of the recreation fees it collects (currently just those above a baseline of $34 million per fiscal year); and (2) the fees to be used for planning. Requires: (1) 80 percent of the fees collected to be made available for expenditure by the Corps district in which they are collected; (2) the Secretary to charge and collect fees for admission or for the use of outdoor recreation sites, facilities, visitor centers, equipment, and services; and (3) fees to be based on the fair market value of the admission or use. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into contracts, including reasonable commissions, to provide visitor services; and (2) accept volunteer services to collect fees.

Requires the Secretary, in collaboration with the Water Resources Planning Council (established under the next section), to revise the Corps' planning guidelines, regulations, and circulars within 18 months and every five years thereafter to improve the analysis of water resources projects, including the integration of new and existing analytical techniques that properly reflect the probability of project benefits and costs. Lists cost-benefit analysis requirements. Limits the duration of feasibility reports to two years (normally), but in no case to longer than three years. (Sec. 1009) Directs the Secretary to establish within the civil works function of the Department of the Army the Council to integrate planning policies that guide the use of economics, environmental, engineering, scientific, and technical information to support the recommendations of the Chief for implementation of water resources projects, including peer review of such information. Includes among the Council's duties to provide: (1) technical and managerial assistance to district engineers for project planning, development, and implementation; and (2) independent peer reviews of new major scientific, engineering, or economic methods, models, or analyses that will be used to support the Secretary's decisions regarding feasibility studies.

Sets forth provisions regarding cost sharing and concurrent mitigation. Directs the Secretary to establish a mitigation tracking system. (Sec. 1012) Amends the Flood Control Act of 1970 to rename project cooperation agreements as partnership agreements, allow district engineers to enter into such agreements, and allow partnership agreements to provide for liquidated damages. Requires that if the Secretary determines that a project needs to be continued for public health and safety purposes, the non-Federal interest shall pay the increased project costs up to 20 percent of the original estimated project costs and in accordance with the statutorily determined cost share, and the Secretary shall pay all increased costs remaining. (Sec. 1013) Amends the WRDA of 1974 to authorizes the Secretary, at the request of a governmental agency or non-Federal interest, to provide technical assistance at Federal expense, up to $10 million a fiscal year.
