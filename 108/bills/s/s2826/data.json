(Sec. 322) Provides that the Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative of 1998, also known as Initiative 59, approved by the electors of the District on November 3, 1998, shall not take effect. (Sec. 323) Provides that nothing in this Act may be construed to prevent the Council or the Mayor of the District of Columbia from addressing the issue of the provision of contraceptive coverage by health insurance plans. Expresses the intent of Congress that any legislation enacted on such issue should include a \"conscience clause\" which provides exceptions for religious beliefs and moral convictions. (Sec. 324) Requires the Mayor to report quarterly to specified congressional committees on the following District issues: (1) crime; (2) access to substance and alcohol abuse treatment; (3) management of parolees and pre-trial violent offenders; (4) education; (5) improvement in basic District services, including rat control and abatement; (6) application for and management of Federal grants; and (7) indicators of child well-being. (Sec. 326) Prohibits the funds contained in this Act from being used to issue, administer, or enforce any order by the District of Columbia Commission on Human Rights relating to docket numbers 93-030-(PA) and 93-031-(PA) (In The Matter Of: Roland D.

(Sec. 330) Amends the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 to repeal certain reporting requirements for the inspectors general of Federal agencies regarding the promptness of payments to the District for water and sanitary sewer services. (Sec. 331) Amends the District of Columbia Code to repeal the authority of the Joint Committee on Judicial Administration to approve the bonds of fiduciary employees with the D.C. court system. Repeals: (1) requirements that the Executive and Fiscal Officers in the D.C. court system give bond with two or more sureties with the Joint Committee's approval, in an amount prescribed by the Joint Committee on Judicial Administration in the District of Columbia; and (2) similar requirements with respect to the Auditor-Master and the Register of Wills of the Superior Court. (Sec. 332) Provides that travel under Federal supply schedules is authorized for the travel of D.C. court personnel on official business, subject to requirements, conditions, and restrictions prescribed by the Joint Committee. (Sec. 333) Amends the District of Columbia Home Rule Act with respect to the District's emergency cash reserve fund and contingency cash reserve fund. Changes from February 15 to October 1 the deadlines for mandatory annual cash deposits into such funds by the Mayor. Reduces from four percent of operating expenditures to two percent of such expenditures the minimum balance in the emergency cash reserve the Mayor must maintain. Increases from three to four percent of operating expenditures the minimum balance in the contingency cash reserve fund the Mayor must maintain. (Sec. 334) Requires the CFO, for FY 2005, to recalculate such reserve funds (as amended by this Act). Authorizes the CFO, after such recalculation, to transfer funds: (1) between the reserve funds to reach the required percentages; and (2) from them to the General Fund of the District to the extent that such funds are not necessary to meet their established requirements. Bases cash reserve requirements for both funds upon prior year actual expenditures, rather than the proposed expenditures of the current budget year. Extends the replenishment requirement from one year to two years. Prohibits the CFO from transferring funds from the emergency or the contingency reserve funds to the extent that such a transfer would lower the FY 2005 total percentage below seven percent. (Sec. 335) Amends the Policemen and Firemen's Retirement and Disability Act Amendments of 1957 to allow payment of associated administrative expenses from appropriations made to the District to reimburse its retirement and disability benefit payments to or for members of the U.S. Park Police force, the U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division, and the U.S. Secret Service Division. (Sec. 336) Appropriates for the Office of the Inspector General (IG) such amounts in local funds, as are consistent with the IG's annual estimates for the expenditures and appropriations necessary for the operation of the Office for FY 2005. (Sec. 337) Extends through FY 2005 the CFO's authority with respect to personnel, procurement, and the preparation of fiscal impact statements during a control period. (Sec. 338) Amends the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 1999 to require that the funds provided for establishment of a scholarship fund for D.C. children of adoptive families, and for post high school education and training of D.C. children without parents due to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, once obligated by the District to establish the scholarship fund, remain obligated and be retained by the District for 25 years to allow for any individual within the class to be assisted to reach post high school, and to present expenditures to be extinguished by the fund. (Sec. 339) Amends the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2001 to authorize a recipient (eligible nonprofit corporation) of a grant from the Credit Enhancement Fund for Public Charter Schools in the District to use such funds to carry out activities to assist D.C. public charter schools in establishing regulations for administering lease guarantees to such schools through the credit enhancement fund. Amends the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2003 to place the Office of Public Charter School Financing and Support under the Mayor's authority in lieu of the Department of Banking and Financial Institutions. (Sec. 340) Amends the District of Columbia School Reform Act of 1995 to declare that a petition to establish a public charter school in the District or to convert a District public school or an existing private or independent school into a public charter school, is a public document. (Sec. 341) Reduces from two-thirds to 51percent the minimum number of full-time teachers employed in a school necessary to endorse a petition to convert a District public school or an existing private or independent school into a public charter school. Grants a teacher employed at a D.C. public school that converts to a public charter school the option of remaining at the charter school during the school's first year of operation after receiving an extended leave of absence. Provides that, after this one-year period, the teacher may continue in such employment at the sole discretion of the public charter school, or shall maintain current status within the D.C. public school system. Modifies the preference in leasing or purchasing former D.C. public school property for a public charter school to require the Mayor and the District government to give a right of first offer (currently, first preference) to be annually reinstated with respect to any facility or property not previously disposed of, or under contract to be disposed of, to an eligible applicant or Board of Trustees. Modifies the requirement of the Mayor's jurisdiction over such facility or property. Requires the Mayor to have jurisdiction on the effective date of this Act or the Mayor or any successor agency to gain jurisdiction after such date. Requires the purchase or lease to: (1) be negotiated by the Mayor; (2) include rent or an acquisition price, as applicable, that is at least 25 percent less than the appraised value of the property (based on use of the property for school purposes); and (3) include a lease period, if the property is to be leased, of not less than 25 years, renewable for additional 25-year periods as long as the eligible applicant or Board of Trustees maintains its charter. Grants a D.C. public school approved to become a conversion public charter school the right to exclusively occupy the facilities the school occupied as a D.C. public school under a lease for a period of not less than 25 years, renewable for additional 25-year periods as long as the school maintains its charter at the non-profit rate, or if there is no non-profit rate, at 25 percent less than the fair market rate for school use. (Sec. 342) Requires an eligible chartering authority to ensure that each public charter school complies with annual reporting requirements, including submission of the audited financial statement.
