    "text": "HRIFA Improvement Act of 2004 - Amends the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1998 (HRIFA) to remove document fraud as a ground of inadmissibility for qualifying Haitians who apply for adjustment of status under HRIFA. Requires determinations regarding derivative status for the children of such qualifying Haitians to be made using the age of the child as of the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes parents or guardians of children seeking derivative status to file an adjustment application on the child's behalf if the child is physically present in the United States on the date of filing. Permits qualifying Haitians seeking benefits pursuant to this Act to file new status adjustment applications and motions to reopen. Extends to those who file such new applications or motions the same protection from exclusion, deportation, removal, or enforcement of a voluntary departure order as currently applies to HRIFA beneficiaries."
