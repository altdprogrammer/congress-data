    "text": "Environmental Health Research Act of 2003 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to make grants for the development and operation of not more than six centers to conduct multidisciplinary research on environmental factors that may be related to the development of women's health conditions. Requires each center to conduct basic and clinical research, develop training protocols, conduct training, develop model continuing education programs, and disseminate information to professionals and the public, with priority to prevention activities. Requires each center to: (1) collaborate with community organizations; and (2) use the facilities of a single institution or be formed from a consortium of institutions. Limits support to five years but allows extensions under specified circumstances. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to establish a comprehensive research program on the impact and occurrence of hormone disrupting chemicals as they affect human, ecological, and wildlife health. Requires the program to: (1) compile scientifically valid information, with an emphasis on the effect of low doses during critical life stages and the extent of human and wildlife exposure; (2) research the mechanisms by which such chemicals interact with biological systems as well as their screening and tracking; and (3) include the participation of the U.S. Geological Survey. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish the Hormone Disruption Research Interagency Commission. Establishes a Hormone Disruption Research Panel within the Institute."
