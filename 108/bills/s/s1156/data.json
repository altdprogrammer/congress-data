    "text": "Veterans Health Care, Capital Asset, and Business Improvement Act of 2003 - Title I: Health Care Authorities and Related Matters - (Sec. 101) Removes the requirement that former prisoners of war must have been detained or interned for at least 90 days in order to be eligible for veterans' outpatient dental care. Exempts former prisoners of war from any required copayments under the Department of Veterans Affairs (Department) pharmacy program. (Sec. 102) Makes a veteran who participated in a test conducted by the Department of Defense Deseret Test Center as part of a program for chemical and biological warfare testing from 1962 through 1973 (including the program designated as Project Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHAD) and related land-based tests) eligible for hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care, notwithstanding that there is insufficient medical evidence to conclude that such illness is attributable to such testing. Terminates such eligibility after December 31, 2005. (Sec. 103) Directs (current law authorizes) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish hospital and nursing home care and medical services for any illness or injury that is a service-connected disability of any Commonwealth Army veteran or new Philippine Scout who is residing in the United States and is a citizen or lawfully admitted alien for permanent residence. (Sec. 104) Expands the rehabilitative services authorized to be provided to ill or disabled veterans to include work skills training and development, employment support, and job development and placement. (Sec. 105) Authorizes the Secretary, in furnishing nursing home care, adult day health care, or extended care services to veterans, to enter into agreements for the furnishing of such care or services with authorized service providers under title XVIII (Medicare) or XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act. (Sec. 106) Extends through 2008 the period for the provision of veterans' noninstitutional extended-care services and required nursing home care. (Sec. 107) Amends the Veterans' Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act to allow the Secretary to carry out a pilot program for veterans for long-term care and assisted living in one additional designated health care region of the Department as selected by the Secretary. Terminates such additional authority three years after commencement of the provision of such services. (Sec. 108) Increases and extends through FY 2006 a Department program for the provision of specialized mental health services to veterans. Directs the Secretary, in allocating program funds, to ensure specified amounts for programs: (1) identified by the Mental Health Strategic Health Care Group and the Committee on Care of Severely Chronically Mentally Ill Veterans; (2) on post-traumatic stress disorder; and (3) on substance abuse disorder. Title II: Construction and Facilities Matters - Subtitle A: Program Authorities - (Sec. 201) Increases from $4 million to $7 million the threshold cost of a major medical facility project above which funds for such project must be specifically authorized by law. (Sec. 202) Revises the Secretary's authority to enter into enhanced-use leases for the Department to: (1) reduce, from 90 to 45 days after congressional notification, the required waiting period before entering into such a lease; (2) require each notification to include a summary of a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed lease; (3) repeal a congressional reporting requirement with respect to such leases; (4) remove the requirement that the Secretary request the Administrator of General Services to dispose of property no longer needed under such a lease (thereby allowing the Secretary to make such disposition); (5) reduce, from 90 to 45 days after congressional notification, the required waiting period before disposing of such property; and (6) allow the Secretary to use lease proceeds to reimburse applicable appropriations of the Department for any expenses incurred in the development of additional enhanced-use leases. (Sec. 203) Removes certain information requirements from a required report from the Secretary to the congressional veterans' committees regarding Department long-range health planning. Subtitle B: Project Authorizations - (Sec. 211) Authorizes the Secretary to carry out: (1) construction of long-term care facilities in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and Beckley, West Virginia; (2) construction of a new bed tower to consolidate two inpatient sites of care in inner city Chicago; (3) seismic corrections to strengthen Medical Center Building 1 of the Department health care system in San Diego, California; (4) renovation of all inpatient care wards and establishment of a consolidated medical research facility at the Department's West Haven, Connecticut, facility; and (5) construction of a Department of Veterans Affairs-Department of the Navy joint venture comprehensive outpatient medical care facility on the grounds of the Pensacola, Florida, Naval Air Station. (Sec. 212) Authorizes the Secretary to enter into leases for outpatient clinic facilities in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Boston, Massachusetts. (Sec. 213) Authorizes the Secretary to carry out advance planning for major medical facility projects in: (1) Denver, Colorado; (2) Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; (3) Las Vegas, Nevada; (4) Columbus, Ohio; and (5) East Central Florida. (Sec. 214) Authorizes appropriations for FY 2004 for the Construction, Major Projects, account and the Medical Care account. Subtitle C: Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services Initiative - (Sec. 221) Authorizes the Secretary to carry out major construction projects as specified in the final report of the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services Commission 45 days after reporting to the veterans' and appropriations committees on the projects proposed to be carried out in connection with the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services Initiative. Prohibits the Secretary from entering into any contract for such a project after the end of FY 2006. (Sec. 222) Requires the Secretary, if approving a recommendation resulting from the above Initiative, to notify Congress before taking any action that would result in: (1) a medical facility closure; (2) an administrative reorganization; or (3) a medical facility consolidation. Requires a waiting period following such notification. (Sec. 223) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary should take steps to ensure that an appropriate mix of facilities and clinical staff is available for health care for veterans residing in rural areas. Subtitle D: Plans for New Facilities - (Sec. 231) Directs the Secretary to develop a plan: (1) to establish an inpatient facility to meet veterans' hospital care needs in southern New Jersey; (2) for hospital care needs of veterans who reside in far south Texas; and (3) for meeting future hospital care needs of veterans who reside in north central Washington and the Pensacola, Florida, areas. Requires reports on each plan from the Secretary to the veterans' committees. (Sec. 232) Requires the Secretary to examine and report to the veterans' committees on the feasibility of coordination of the Department's needs for veterans' inpatient hospital, medical, and long-term care services with the pending construction of a new university medical center at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, South Carolina. Subtitle E: Designation of Facilities - (Sec. 241) Designates the Department's: (1) medical center in Prescott, Arizona, as the Bob Stump Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center; (2) health care facility on South Damen Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, as the Jesse Brown Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center; (3) medical center in Houston, Texas, as the Michael E.

Wahlen Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center; (5) outpatient clinic in New London, Connecticut, as the John J. McGuirk Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic; and (6) outpatient clinic in Horsham, Pennsylvania, as the Victor J. Saracini Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic.
