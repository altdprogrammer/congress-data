    "text": "Provo River Project Transfer Act - (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey to the Provo River Water Users Association (Association), ownership of the Provo Reservoir Canal (Canal) in the State of Utah. Conditions such conveyance on the Secretary's acceptance of future arrangements with specified Utah agencies for the operation, ownership, financing, and improvement of the Canal. Directs the Secretary to convey to the Association ownership of the Pleasant Grove Property in Utah. Directs the Secretary to: (1) convey to the Metropolitan Water District of Salt Lake & Sandy (District) in Utah, ownership of the Salt Lake Aqueduct; (2) grant to the District permanent easements to the National Forest System land on which the Salt Lake Aqueduct is located and certain land of the Aqueduct Division of the Provo River Project for the use, operation, maintenance, repair, improvement, or replacement of the Salt Lake Aqueduct by the District; (3) determine the boundaries of such easements; and (4) transfer administrative jurisdiction over certain land of the Aqueduct Division of the Provo River Project to the Secretary of Agriculture. Requires the Association and the District to pay the Secretary for land conveyed under this Act and for certain costs incurred in making such conveyances. Requires the Secretary to comply with certain environmental and other laws before making land conveyances.
