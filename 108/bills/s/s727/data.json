Prescribes conditions and criteria for the authorization of appropriations for a clean coal power initiative program. Instructs the Secretary to: (1) fund coal energy generation projects that advance efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness well beyond the level of technologies in operation as of the date of enactment of this Act; and (2) award competitive, merit-based grants to universities for the establishment of Centers of Excellence for Energy Systems of the Future. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prescribe credits against tax for: (1) production from a qualifying clean coal technology unit; and (2) production from and for investment in a qualifying advanced clean coal technology unit. Prescribes guidelines for the treatment of persons not able to use the entire credit relating to clean coal technology."
