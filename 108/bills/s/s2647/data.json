Title II: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - (Sec. 201) Reestablishes in the Department of Commerce (what already exists under Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), headed and administered by the Administrator, who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. (Sec. 207) Directs the Administrator to submit to Congress a plan and budget that sets forth a proposal for NOAA programs and NOAA's reorganization that considers the recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and that will provide improved services to the Nation. (Sec. 208) Directs the Administrator to develop a 20-year integrated research plan for NOAA that sets forth its scientific goals and priorities. (Sec. 209) Establishes within NOAA a Science Advisory Board which shall provide advice to the Administrator and, upon request, Congress on long-range and short-range strategies for research, education, and the application of science to resource management and environmental assessment and prediction. (Sec. 210) Repeals Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970. (Sec. 211) Directs the Administrator to report biennially to Congress on the status and condition of the Nation's ocean and atmospheric environments, including current and foreseeable trends in the quality, management and utilization of such environments and their effects on the social, economic, ecological, and other requirements of the Nation. Title III: Federal Coordination and Advice - Subtitle A: Council on Ocean Stewardship - (Sec. 301) Establishes in the Executive Office of the President a Council on Ocean Stewardship which shall provide a forum for improving Federal coordination and action, particularly with respect to nonpoint source pollution, ecosystem-based conservation and management, ocean education, and monitoring, research and technology development for oceans and the atmosphere. (Sec. 305) Directs the President to report biennially to Congress on all Federal ocean and atmospheric programs, priorities, and accomplishments. (Sec. 306) Authorizes the President to establish a Presidential Panel of Advisers on Oceans, Atmosphere, and Climate Change which shall advise the President and the Chairman of the Ocean Stewardship Council in identifying and fostering policies to protect, manage, and restore ocean and atmospheric environments and resources, both on a regional and national level.

Subtitle B: Interagency Science Coordination - (Sec. 321) Establishes a National Ocean Science Committee to: (1) improve cooperation among Federal agencies with respect to ocean science budgets, programs, operations, facilities, and personnel; and (2) coordinate U.S. government activities with those of other nations and with international ocean observing efforts, research and technology and education. (Sec. 322) Directs the Chair of the National Science and Technology Council to develop, and to submit to Congress, a National Strategy for Ocean Science, Education and Technology which shall establish for a ten-year period the scientific goals and priorities for research, technology, education, outreach, and operations which most effectively advance knowledge and provide usable information for ocean policy decisions. Subtitle C: Federal Programs - (Sec. 341) Directs the President to submit to Congress recommendations on, and a plan and proposed schedule for: (1) the transfer of relevant oceanic or atmospheric programs, functions, and associated resources to NOAA from other Federal agencies; and (2) NOAA's reorganization."
