    "text": "National Cancer Act of 2003 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop an information-sharing plan for State cancer registries. Modifies provisions concerning preventive health measures with respect to breast and cervical cancers to permit priority to be given to certain projects involving: (1) colorectal cancer screening and outreach; and (2) treating uninsured women diagnosed with cancer during such screening. Authorizes specified waivers of the direct services requirement for breast and cervical cancer screening grants. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to eligible entities to educate cancer patients and their families about medical techniques to reduce and prevent pain, survivorship care and support programs, and related community resources. Requires a national cancer research center to have a practitioner education program that includes pain and symptom management and survivorship care. Amends various provisions of the Act to emphasize the importance of pain and symptom management throughout the nation's cancer programs. Establishes within the National Cancer Institute (the NCI) an Office on Cancer Survivorship. Authorizes the Director of NCI to co-fund grant projects for various cancer programs. Expresses the sense of the Senate with respect to: (1) cancer survivorship; and (2) institutional review board procedures."
