    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2003-09-16", 
    "text": "Consumers, Schools, and Libraries Digital Rights Management Awareness Act of 2003 - Prohibits the Federal Communications Commission, except as specifically authorized by Congress, from requiring a person manufacturing, importing, or offering for sale or license in the United States a device, machine, or process that is designed, manufactured, or marketed for rendering, processing, transmitting, receiving, or reproducing a digital media product to incorporate access control or redistribution control technology into the design of such device, machine, or process. Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to establish an advisory committee to inform the FTC about: (1) the ways in which access control and redistribution technology may affect consumer, educational institution, and library use of digital media products based on their legal and customary uses of such products; and (2) how awareness of such technologies in the digital media products they purchase or legally own may be achieved. Prohibits a person from offering for sale, license, or use by a consumer, educational institution, or library an access- or redistribution-controlled digital media product unless the product contains a notice of the restriction such technology may have on the product's use. Prohibits an Internet access service from being compelled to make available to a manufacturer of a digital media product the identity or personal information of a subscriber or user of its service for use in enforcing the manufacturer's right relating to the use of such product. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) secondary market rights for used digital media products; and (2) FTC enforcement of this Act."
