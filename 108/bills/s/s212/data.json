Requires the Panel to consult with the Association of American State Geologists and the Western States Water Council.Requires that 50 percent of the funds appropriated to carry out the Program be allocated equally by the Secretary for the participation of State and local agencies and institutions of higher education within each of the participating States. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants from such funds based on proposals that have been recommended by a Governor and reviewed by the Panel. Requires proposals for multistate activities to be recommended by the Governors of all the affected States.(Sec. 4) Requires the Secretary to: (1) include reports on the Program in the annual budget documents for the Interior Department (the initial report to contain a Program plan developed with the concurrence of the Review Panel); and (2) submit an interim and final status report to the Governors of the High Plains Aquifer States.(Sec. 5) Authorizes appropriations."
