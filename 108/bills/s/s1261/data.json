Revises provisions relating to an Executive Director, a General Counsel, and certain Associate Executive Directors for various CPSC Offices. Authorizes CPSC to take certain actions otherwise required of a manufacturer, retailer, or distributor with respect to a product if: (1) CPSC staff makes a preliminary hazard determination that a product presents a substantial product hazard classified as a Class A or B product hazard, or CPSC makes a substantial product hazard determination classified as a Class A or B product hazard with respect to such a product; and (2) CPSC finds that notification of the hazard is in the public interest, and that the manufacturer, retailer, or distributor is financially unable to provide adequate notification. Authorizes appropriations for such CPSC-financed recalls. Increases the maximum amount of certain civil penalties under the Act."
