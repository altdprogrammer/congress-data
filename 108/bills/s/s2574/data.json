Permits officers in such force to be appointed without regard to the standard maximum age limits under Federal law, with officers appointed above a standard maximum age limit not counted as law enforcement officers for purposes of retirement benefits. Authorizes NIH Police officers to: (1) carry firearms; (2) serve warrants and subpoenas; (3) make arrests; (4) conduct investigations within the United States; and (5) protect within the United States the Director and other NIH officials as authorized by the Director. Allows NIH Police officers to exercise such powers on all NIH properties and on other properties occupied by NIH, as determined by the Director. Confers upon NIH Police the same pay and benefits as provided to other Federal law enforcement officers."
