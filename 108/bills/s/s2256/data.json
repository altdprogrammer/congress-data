    "text": "Revises the mandatory work requirements of part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act with respect to the limitation on the number of persons in a State who may be treated as engaged in work by reason of participation in educational activities. Removes two-parent families from the formula for such limitation. Creates an exception to the limitation for education in preparation for sector-specific, high-skill occupations to meet employer demand. Defines sector-specific, high-demand, high-skill occupation to meet employer demand as an occupation that: (1) has been identified by the State workforce investment board or by the State agency administering the State TANF program as within State needs with regard to current and projected employment opportunities in specific industry sectors; (2) requires occupational training; and (3) provides a wage of at least 75 percent of the State median hourly wage."
