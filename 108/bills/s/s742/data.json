Requires such assistance, to the maximum extent feasible, to be provided through nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and, as appropriate, through governments to establish appropriate norms, standards, and policies related to rehabilitation and issues affecting such individuals. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to: (1) conduct programs in foreign countries related to individuals with disabilities, including victims of landmines and other victims of civil strife and warfare; and (2) provide grants to NGOs to carry out research, prevention, public awareness, and assistance programs in foreign countries related to such individuals. Requires any such programs in foreign countries to be carried out only in coordination with the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and upon approval by the Secretary of State. Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide: (1) advice and expertise on prosthetics, orthotics, physical and psychological rehabilitation and treatment, and disability assistance to other Federal agencies for implementation of assistance programs under this Act; and (2) technical assistance on a reimbursable basis to private voluntary organizations for planning, development, operation, and evaluation of such landmine assistance, research, and prevention programs."
