Exempts such operators, specifically, from the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a rulemaking proceeding to determine whether granting such an exemption is not in the public interest and would have a significant adverse impact on the safety of commercial motor vehicles. Redefines agricultural commodity to reflect the definition in the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978."
