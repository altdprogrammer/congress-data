Extends from December 31, 2004, through December 31, 2009, the commercial space transportation (CST) indemnification program under which the Secretary of Transportation shall pay successful third-party claims against CST licensees, contractors, subcontractors, or transferees for catastrophic losses resulting from licensed space launch activities, to the extent such claims exceed mandatory insurance (including self-insurance) coverage. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to report to Congress on the need for a distinct regulatory regime for suborbital vehicles taking into account their unique characteristics and purposes."
