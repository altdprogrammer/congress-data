Precludes a person convicted of a felony or under active criminal investigation from program participation.Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Department of Homeland Security must ensure the permanence of PortPASS in its transition from the Department of Justice to the Department; (2) all land PortPASS programs should utilize interoperable technology to offer participants increased commuter lane access; (3) the Secretary of Homeland Security should increase SENTRI program staff, training, and resources; and (4) the Secretary should create a pre-inspection low-risk commuter lane for pedestrian land border crossers."
