    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "2003-05-02", 
    "text": "Aviation Investment and Revitalization Vision Act - Title I: Reauthorizations; FAA Management - (Sec. 101) Amends Federal transportation law to authorize appropriations out of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for FY 2004 through 2006 for: (1) the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), including the Airport Improvement Program (earmarking amounts for certain administrative-related expenses) and the Airway Facilities Improvement Program; (2) specified FAA aviation research and development (R&D) projects; and (3) other specified aviation programs. (Sec. 102) Requires the Administrator of the FAA to report biannually to specified congressional committees on the ten largest air navigation facilities and equipment programs, including any changes in the budget for such programs, the program schedule, and technical risks associated with the programs. (Sec. 103) Directs the Administrator of the FAA, in conjunction with the submission of the U.S. budget for FY 2004, to report to specified congressional committees on the overall air traffic controller staffing plan, including strategies to address anticipated retirement and replacement of air traffic controllers. (Sec. 106) Directs the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to establish an Air Traffic Services Committee to: (1) review, approve, and monitor the strategic plan for the air traffic control system; (2) review and approve methods to accelerate air traffic control modernization and improvements in aviation safety related to air traffic control, including procurements of air traffic control equipment; (3) review operational functions of the air traffic control system; (4) review and approve FAA management of the air traffic control system; and (5) review and approve the FAA's budget as it relates to the air traffic control system. Provides for the transition of members of the Air Traffic Services Subcommittee of the Management Advisory Council to the Air Traffic Services Committee. Title II: Airport Development - (Sec. 201) Directs the Secretary to identify certain airports with delays that significantly affect the national air transportation system. Makes an airport that has been recommended for the construction or reconfiguration of runways, and that does not take action to initiate a planning and environmental assessment process for the construction or reconfiguration of such runways, ineligible for: (1) Federal airport improvement planning and expansion funds; and (2) approval of a passenger facility fee for a specified period of time. Authorizes the Secretary, in response to a petition from an airport sponsor, or in the case of a congested airport covered by the FAA's Airport Capacity Benchmarks study, to designate an airport development project as a national capacity project if the Secretary determines that the designated project will significantly enhance the capacity of the national air transportation system. Directs the Secretary to implement an expedited, coordinated environmental review process for national capacity projects. Authorizes the Secretary to make airport improvement grants to States and units of local government for land use compatibility plans for national capacity projects. Authorizes the Secretary to consider prescribing flight procedures to avoid or minimize potentially significant adverse noise impacts of a national capacity project that involves the construction of new runways or the reconfiguration of existing runways during the environmental planning process. Directs the Secretary to initiate a five-year program for environmental review at national capacity projects. Authorizes the Secretary to hire additional environmental specialists and attorneys to process environmental impact statements in connection with airport construction projects and to serve as project coordinators and environmental impact team members with respect to national capacity projects. (Sec. 202) Directs the Secretary to report to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on the categorical exclusions currently recognized, and provide a list of proposed additional categorical exclusions, from the requirement that an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement be prepared under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for airport projects. Requires the Secretary to include in such list other projects the Secretary determines should be categorically excluded in order to ensure that Department of Transportation (DOT) environmental staff resources are not diverted to lower priority tasks, and are available to expedite the environmental reviews of airport capacity enhancement projects at congested airports. (Sec. 203) Requires the Secretary: (1) within 30 days after identifying an airport capacity enhancement project at a congested airport, to publish a notice in the Federal Register requesting comments on whether reasonable alternatives to the project exist; and (2) within 90 days after the comment period ends, to determine whether reasonable alternatives do exist. Makes such a determination binding on all persons, including Federal and State agencies, acting under or applying Federal laws when considering the availability of alternatives to the project. Exempts from these requirements: (1) any alternatives analysis required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; or (2) a project at an airport whose sponsor requests, in writing, that these requirements not apply. (Sec. 204) Requires the Secretary to use at least 35 percent (currently, 34 percent) of amounts available to the discretionary fund for each fiscal year for certain grants for airport noise compatibility planning for a national capacity project, and for noise compatibility programs (as under current law). Requires the Secretary to use at least that amount for noise mitigation projects approved in an environmental record of decision for an airport development project that has been designated as a national capacity project. (Sec. 205) Requires the Secretary to provide, and submit to specified congressional committees, a list of: (1) planned air traffic and airport-capacity projects at congested Airport Capacity Benchmark airports the completion of which will substantially relieve congestion at such airports; and (2) options for expanding capacity at eight such airports at which the most severe delays are occurring. (Sec. 206) Sets forth requirements authorizing an airport sponsor to award a design-build contract (for both design and construction of a project by a contractor) for a national capacity project. (Sec. 207) Declares that nothing in this title shall be construed to: (1) preclude the application of any provision of this Act to the State of Illinois or any other sponsor of a new airport proposed to be constructed in the State of Illinois; or (2) preempt the authority of the Governor of Illinois as of August 1, 2001, to approve or disapprove airport development projects. (Sec. 209) Revises requirements for the passenger facility fee program. Establishes a pilot program to test alternative procedures for authorizing small airports to impose passenger facility fees. (Sec. 210) Requires the Secretary to report quarterly to specified congressional committees on the status of construction of each major runway project undertaken at the largest 40 commercial airports in terms of annual enplanements. (Sec. 211) Revises requirements with respect to airport noise disclosures. Requires Federal regulatory entities to prohibit certain lending institutions from making a loan secured by residential real estate or a mobile home located in the vicinity of an airport in which the operator has submitted a noise exposure map, unless the loan applicant's purchase agreement provides notice that the property is within the area of the noise contours on the noise exposure map. (Sec. 212) Prohibits the Secretaries of Transportation or of Homeland Security from requiring airport sponsors to provide building construction, maintenance, utilities and expenses, or space in airport sponsor-owned buildings to the FAA or the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) without cost for services relating to air traffic control, air navigation, aviation security, or weather reporting. (Sec. 213) Authorizes the Secretary to apportion airport improvement funds to certain airports with declining boardings for FY 2004 in the same amount apportioned to such airports for FY 2002. Increases the Government's share of allowable costs for a grant made in FY 2004 for an airport improvement project from 90 percent to not more than 95 percent. (Sec. 214) Requires that an agreement between the Government and a qualified entity allowing the entity to operate an airport facility relieves the Government from any liability arising out of, or related to, acts or omissions of entity employees in operating such facility. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2004 through 2006 for the air traffic control contract program. Increases the maximum Federal share of costs for the construction of an air traffic control tower from $1.1 million to $1.5 million. (Sec. 215) Includes within the definition of \"public agency\" for purposes of the administration of airport improvement funds the Department of the Interior with respect to an airport owned by the Department that is required to be maintained for commercial aviation safety at a remote location. (Sec. 216) Revises certain airport funding requirements to authorize a sponsor of a nonprimary airport in Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands to make an agreement with the Secretary waiving the sponsor's claim to any part of airport improvement funds apportioned for the airport if the Secretary agrees to make the waived amount available for a grant for another public-use airport in the same State or geographical area as such airport. Authorizes the Secretary to decide that costs of revenue producing aeronautical support facilities (including fuel farms and hangars) are allowable costs for an airport development project at a nonprimary airport and for which the Government's share is paid only with airport improvement funds apportioned to the airport's sponsor if the Secretary determines that the airport's sponsor has made adequate provision for financing airside needs of the airport.
