    "text": "Title I: Minor Use and Minor Species Health \u0096 Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act of 2004 - (Sec. 102) Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding the development of new animal drugs intended for a minor use (defines \"minor use\" as the intended use of a drug in a major species for an indication that occurs infrequently and in only a small number of animals, or in limited geographic areas and in only a small number of animals annually) or for use in a minor species (any species other than cattle, horses, swine, chickens, turkeys, dogs, and cats). Allows the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to award three years of market exclusivity, with full approval, for any new animal drug that requires research to be conducted in the targeted minor species to support such approval. Creates a conditional approval process for new animal drugs intended for a minor use or for use in a minor species. Requires the same standards for approval as the full approval, except that there must only be a reasonable expectation that the drug is effective for use. (Full approval requires adequate and well-controlled studies to demonstrate by substantial evidence that a new animal drug is effective.) Requires sponsors to commit to conducting additional investigation to meet the full requirements for the demonstration of effectiveness within five years. Establishes that a conditional approval is renewable annually for up to four additional one-year terms upon submission of a request for renewal. Requires labels of such drugs to bear a statement identifying the new animal drug as conditionally approved. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an index of legally-marketed, unapproved new animal drugs for use in minor species. Provides that this index lists drugs that are not FDA-approved and that are either: (1) not intended for use in animals that will be consumed by humans or by food-producing animals; or (2) not intended for use in early, non-food life stages of food-producing minor species, unless safety for humans has been adequately demonstrated. Specifies labeling requirements for indexed drugs. Allows the Secretary, before submission of an application for drug approval, to designate new minor use or minor species animal drugs.
