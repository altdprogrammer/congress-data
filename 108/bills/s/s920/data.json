    "text": "Federal Judgeship Act of 2003 - Directs the President to appoint specified additional: (1) permanent circuit judges for the first, second, sixth, and ninth circuit courts of appeals, and temporary circuit judges for the ninth circuit; and (2) permanent district judges for various districts in Alabama, California, Florida, Missouri, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington, and temporary district judges for California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, New Mexico, New York, and Utah. Amends the Federal judicial code to establish Article III courts in the Northern Mariana Islands (with court held at Saipan) and in the Virgin Islands (with court held in Christiansted for the Saint Croix Division, and in Charlotte-Amalie for the Saint Thomas and Saint John Division). Authorizes the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to assign judges of courts of record of the Northern Mariana Islands or Guam to serve temporarily as a judge in the U.S. district court for the district of the Northern Mariana Islands whenever necessary. Grants such judges the powers of magistrate judges. Includes the district courts of the Northern Mariana Islands and the Virgin Islands within the scope of provisions regarding participation in judicial conferences and regarding annuities for survivors of judicial officials. Amends the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands to grant the District court of the Virgin Islands exclusive jurisdiction over all criminal and civil proceedings in the Virgin Islands with respect to income tax laws applicable to the Virgin Islands, with exceptions."
