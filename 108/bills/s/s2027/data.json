    "text": "Driver Education and Licensing Improvement Act of 2004 - Modifies eligibility requirements for grants for support of alcohol-impaired driving countermeasures to require a multiple-stage graduated licensing system for young drivers that: (1) authorizes the issuance of an initial license or learner's permit no earlier than the driver's 16th birthday; (2) prohibits a person under age 21 with a blood alcohol concentration of .02 percent or greater from operating a motor vehicle; (3) provides for a learning stage and an intermediate stage of at least six months each; (4) limits the numbers of passengers; (5) limits nighttime driving, and (6) applies special penalties for violations of system restrictions and of other State motor vehicle laws. Establishes a National Office of Driver Training in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Includes among the Office's functions to develop and make available to the States a recommended curriculum that incorporates best practices in driver education and licensing. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to carry out grant programs to provide financial assistance to: (1) States to support the improvement of motor vehicle driver education programs and the establishment and improved administration of graduated licensing systems; and (2) eligible recipients to carry out campaigns to increase public awareness of, and training on, State law authority and procedures to provide for organ donation through a declaration recorded on a driver license. Directs the Secretary to carry out a study to determine whether the establishment and imposition of nationwide minimum standards of driver education would improve national highway traffic safety."
