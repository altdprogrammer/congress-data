Directs the Secretary of State to submit a report on the conflict in Uganda which shall include information on: (1) individuals or entities that are providing support for the Lord's Resistance Army, including a description of any such support provided by the Government of Sudan or by senior officials of such Government; (2) activities of the Lord's Resistance Army that prohibit the provision of humanitarian assistance or the protection of the civilian population in Uganda; (3) practices employed by the Ugandan People's Defense Forces in northern and eastern Uganda to ensure that children and civilians are protected; and (4) actions carried out by the United States, Uganda, or the international community to protect displaced civilians, especially women and children."
