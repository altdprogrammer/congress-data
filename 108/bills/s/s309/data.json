Directs the NASA Administrator to provide specified congressional committees a plan for the implementation of such initiatives.Directs the NASA Administrator to establish NASA aeronautics scholarships for U.S. citizens enrolled in accredited Masters degree programs in aeronautical engineering at institutions of higher education.Directs the Administrators of NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to participate in a national initiative to define and develop an air traffic management system that meets national long-term aviation security, safety, and capacity needs. Sets forth certain things that the system shall do, including that it ensure seamless global operations for system users.Provides for grants from the FAA Administrator for university-based Centers for Research on Aviation Training.Authorizes appropriations for certain FAA research and development projects and activities.Requires certain aviation-related studies and assessments."
