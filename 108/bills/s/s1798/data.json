    "text": "American Home Fire Safety Act - Requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to evaluate and report to Congress on: (1) the interaction of bedclothing with the mattress in a fire and methodologies to improve the fire resistance of these products; (2) the current risk candles create as an ignition source in the home and the effectiveness of and level of compliance with the ASTM International Standard Specification for Fire Safety for Candles. Requires the Commission, if it has not promulgated a rule to improve the fire retardancy of upholstered furniture by June 1, 2005, to transmit a report to Congress explaining why such rule was not issued. Requires the Commission, if it has not issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding fire safe mattresses by June 1, 2005, to: (1) initiate a study to evaluate methodologies to improve fire resistance of such mattresses by June 30, 2005; (2) perform a comparative cost-benefit analysis of a mattress standard that would mandate 30-, 45-, and 60-minute flashover prevention; and (3) report its findings and recommendations to Congress. Directs the Commission to create a registry of fire-retardant chemicals by June 1, 2005. Requires the registry to include: (1) a list of manufacturers producing fire-retardant chemicals for sale or use in or on Commission-regulated products sold or used in the United States; (2) a list of such chemicals for each manufacturer; (3) a ranking of sales of such chemicals by each manufacturer measured by volume of chemicals sold; and (4) a list of studies and reports on the human impact of such chemicals performed by those manufacturers. Requires the Commission to submit an annual report to Congress on the results of the registry. Authorizes appropriations."
