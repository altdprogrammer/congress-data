    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "2004-05-19", 
    "text": "Salt Cedar Control Demonstration Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary), acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation and in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Defense to carry out a salt cedar (Tamarix spp) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) assessment and demonstration program to: (1) assess the extent of the infestation by salt cedar and Russian olive trees in the western United States; (2) to demonstrate strategic solutions for the long-term management of such trees and the reestablishment of native vegetation; and (3) assess economic means to dispose of biomass created as a result of removal of those trees. Requires the Secretary to complete an assessment of the extent of the infestation on public and private land. Provides that, in addition to describing the acreage of and severity of infestation, the assessment shall: (1) consider existing research on methods to control salt cedar and Russian olive trees; (2) consider the feasibility of reducing water consumption by such trees; (3) consider methods of and challenges associated with the revegetation or restoration of infested land; and (4) estimate the costs of destruction of such trees, related biomass removal, and revegetation or restoration and maintenance of the infested land. Instructs the Secretary to identify and document long-term management and funding strategies that could be implemented by Federal, State, and private land managers in addressing the infestation and should be tested as components of the demonstration projects specified below. Directs the Secretary to establish a program that selects and funds at least five projects proposed by and implemented in collaboration with Federal agencies, units of State and local government, national laboratories, Indian tribes, institutions of higher education, individuals, organizations, or soil and water conservation districts to demonstrate and evaluate the most effective methods of controlling salt cedar and Russian olive trees. Lists project requirements and control methods. Directs the Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, to complete an analysis of economic means to use or dispose of biomass created as a result of removal of salt cedar and Russian olive trees. Requires such analysis to: (1) determine conditions under which removal of biomass is economically viable; (2) consider and build upon existing research by the Department of Agriculture and other agencies on beneficial uses of salt cedar and Russian olive tree fiber; and (3) consider economic development opportunities, including manufacture of wood products using biomass resulting from the demonstration projects under this Act as a means of defraying costs of control. Sets monetary limits on costs of: (1) the assessment; (2) the identification and documentation of long-term management strategies; (3) the Federal cost of each project (including planning, design, implementation, maintenance, and monitoring costs); and (4) the analysis. Provides for the assessment, the identification and documentation of long-term management strategies, projects or parts of projects that are carried out on Federal land, and the analysis to be carried out at full Federal expense. Limits the Federal cost share of any project funded under this Act that is not carried out on Federal land to: (1) 75 percent for each of the first five years of the project; and (2) for the purpose of long-term monitoring, 100 percent for each of such five-year extensions as the Secretary may grant. Permits the non-Federal share of the costs of such a project to be provided as in-kind contributions, including services provided by a State agency or any other public or private partner. Directs the Secretary to subject the assessment, the identification and documentation of long-term management strategies, the projects, and the analysis to independent review. Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress annual reports describing the results of carrying out this Act, including a synopsis of any such review and details of the manner and purposes for which funds are expended. Instructs the Secretary to facilitate public access to all information that results from carrying out this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
