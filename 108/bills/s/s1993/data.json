    "text": "National Highway Safety Act of 2003 - Requires the Secretary of Transportation to carry out a highway safety improvement program to reduce traffic fatalities and serious injuries on public roads. Requires a State, to receive funds under this Act, to have in effect a highway safety improvement program under which the State: (1) develops and implements a strategic highway safety plan that identifies and analyzes highway safety problems and opportunities; (2) produces a program of projects or strategies to reduce identified safety problems; and (3) evaluates the plan regularly to ensure the accuracy of the data and the priority of proposed improvements. Sets forth provisions regarding State plan requirements, eligible projects, and the Federal share. Provides for a reduction of funds to a State that fails to have in effect a primary safety belt law or that fails to demonstrate that the safety belt use rate in the State is at least 90 percent. Provides for a restoration of funds if, within three years, the State meets those requirements. Provides for reallocation of apportioned funds. Sets formulas for apportionment of highway safety improvement program funds. Requires at least $200 million of funds authorized and expended under this Act be available each fiscal year for the elimination of hazards and the installation of protective devices at railway-highway crossings."
