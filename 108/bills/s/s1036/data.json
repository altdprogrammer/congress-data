Requires the Secretary of the Interior to develop a grant program to allocate funds to the State agency responsible for wildlife management to develop and implement long-term management strategies to address such disease. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a computer modeling program to predict the spread of chronic wasting disease in deer and elk. Directs the Secretary of the Interior (through the U.S. Geological Survey) and the Secretary of Agriculture (through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) to conduct surveillance and monitoring programs on Federal lands to identify: (1) the rate of infection in wild herds of deer and elk; (2) the cause and extent of the spread of the disease; and (3) areas promoting the disease. Directs the Secretary of Interior to develop and maintain a web site that displays surveillance and monitoring program data and modeling information. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) develop guidelines for the collection of animal tissue samples, and a protocol for assessing samples in the laboratory; (2) develop a program for the inspection of laboratories conducting chronic wasting disease tests; (3) provide for the upgrading of Federal laboratories approved to process such samples; and (4) expand and accelerate research on the disease through the Agricultural Research Service and Cooperative State Research grant program. Requires the Secretaries of Agriculture and of the Interior to enter a cooperative agreement for the purpose of coordinating actions and disbursing funds authorized under this Act."
