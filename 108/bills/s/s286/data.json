Requires the Secretary to conduct research on and promote the prevention of birth defects and disabilities and to support a National Spina Bifida Program to prevent and reduce suffering from the nation's most common permanently disabling birth defect. Modifies Center reporting requirements, including requiring such report to contain information on: (1) individuals living with birth defects and disabilities or developmental disabilities, and recommendations for improving the health and quality of life of such individuals; and (2) recommendations from all birth defects research conferences sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including conferences related to spina bifida. Requires that the members of the advisory committee appointed by the Director of the National Center for Environmental Health that have expertise in birth defects, developmental disabilities, and disabilities and health be transferred to and advise the Center. Authorizes appropriations through FY 2007 for the Center. (Sec. 3) Amends the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 to revise appropriation allotment provisions for State developmental disabilities councils. (Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Education to jointly report on specified surveillance activities under the Children's Health Act of 2000 respecting autism and other developmental disabilities."
