    "text": "U.S.A. Jobs Protection Act of 2004 - Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to prohibit a contract that is entered into by the head of an executive agency from being performed outside the United States except to meet a requirement of that agency for the contract to be performed specifically at a location abroad. Prohibits funds appropriated for financial assistance for a State from being disbursed to or for such State during a fiscal year unless that State's chief executive has transmitted to the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, by April 1 of the preceding fiscal year, a written certification that (except as provided above) none of those funds will be expended for the performance of State contracts outside the United States. Makes an exception where the State's chief executive certifies in advance to the Administrator that such expenditure is for a contract that cannot be performed within the United States. Makes this Act inapplicable to disbursements of funds to a State during the first two fiscal years of its enactment."
