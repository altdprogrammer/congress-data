    "text": "Belarus Democracy Act of 2003 - Authorizes the President to support primarily indigenous Belarusian groups that are committed to the support of democratic processes in various activities that may include: (1) observation of elections and the promotion of free and fair electoral processes, including the development of democratic political parties; (2) development of independent media supported by nonstate-controlled printing facilities; (3) support of human rights; and (4) establishment of international exchanges and advanced professional training programs for leaders and members of democratic forces that foster the growth of civil society. Authorizes appropriations for each fiscal year for Voice of America and RFE/RL, Incorporated (Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty) for radio broadcasting to the people of Belarus in languages spoken in that country. Places economic sanctions on Belarus and bars senior Belarusian leaders and their immediate relations from entering the United States. Allows sanctions to be lifted only if the Belarusian Government meets specific democratic conditions. Affirms solidarity with the democratic forces in Belarus and calls upon the Government of Belarus to permit basic freedoms and allow free, fair and transparent presidential and parliamentary elections. Calls upon the Russian Government to use its influence to encourage democratic development in Belarus so that it can become an independent state that is integrated into Europe."
