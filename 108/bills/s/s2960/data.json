Prohibits funds apportioned under this Act from being obligated for an urbanized area with a population greater than 300,000 until such time as a regional traffic incident management plan is developed for the urbanized area. Requires an urbanized area that receives funds under this Act to engage in certain regional collaboration and coordination activities to develop a prescribed regional traffic incident management plan. Prescribes an apportionment formula for funds distribution among the States to implement this Act."
