Requires such applications, any resulting ex parte orders, and requests to booksellers and libraries to specify that there are specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe that the person to whom the records pertain is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Amends the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 to terminate as of December 31, 2005, specified authority for FBI investigative requests for telephone toll and transactional records as well as financial records and consumer reports."
