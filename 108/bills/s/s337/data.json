    "text": "Arsenic-Treated Residential-Use Wood Prohibition Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to: (1) list CCA-treated wood (wood treated with a pesticide that is an inorganic arsenical or chromated copper arsenical) as a hazardous waste; (2) require disposal of discarded CCA wood, notwithstanding regulations exempting certain solid wastes from the definition of hazardous waste, in a lined landfill with a leachate system and groundwater monitoring system; (3) require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct an assessment of the risks of CCA-treated wood production, processing, and use; and (4) direct the Administrator to promulgate regulations for the cessation and prohibition of production of such wood, with exceptions. Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to require the Administrator to promulgate regulations prohibiting the use of CCA-treated wood (for FIFRA purposes, wood treated with a pesticide that is a chromated copper arsenical) in the manufacture, production, or use of any product that may be used for or by children or for mulch, compost, a soil amendment, or any other residential or occupational purpose. Requires the Administrator to: (1) develop and conduct an educational program to assist consumers, State and local governments, school systems, and other institutions in testing arsenic levels and making decisions concerning CCA-treated wood containment, removal, and decontamination; and (2) establish a pilot program of grants and technical assistance to assist school systems in removal of playground and other equipment containing CCA-treated wood and remediation activities."
