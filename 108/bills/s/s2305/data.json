Defines \"Greater Middle East and Central Asia'' as the 22 nations of the Arab world (Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine/West Bank/Gaza, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen), Afghanistan, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Secretary of State and the heads of other Government agencies should consider new approaches for the coordination of political and economic support for the countries of the Greater Middle East and Central Asia; and (2) the Secretary should consider appointing a Coordinator for Assistance to the Greater Middle East and Central Asia. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require congressional notification of fund obligations under this Act."
