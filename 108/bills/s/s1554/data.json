    "text": "Pathways for All Students to Succeed Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to establish a program that will provide grants to State educational agencies (SEAs) and, through them, subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to establish reading and writing programs to improve overall reading and writing performance among students in middle school and secondary school. Requires LEAs receiving a subgrant to hire literacy coaches (at least one for every 20 teachers) to work with classroom teachers to: (1) incorporate reading and writing instruction in all subject areas; (2) identify and refer to remediation services any students with reading and writing problems; (3) provide reading and writing professional development for all middle school and secondary school teachers, administrators, and paraprofessionals; and (4) procure and implement programs and instructional materials based on reading and writing research. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a program of grants to SEAs and, through them, subgrants to LEAs that: (1) enables a secondary school receiving assistance under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Act of 1965 to hire a sufficient number of academic counselors (at least one for 150 students) to develop personal six-year plans defining career and education goals for each student at the school, including students with limited English proficiency; (2) involves parents in the development and implementation of such plans; and (3) provides academic counselors and staff at the schools receiving grants under this Act the opportunity to coordinate with other programs and services, including those supported by Federal funds, to ensure that students have access to the resources and services necessary to fulfill their personal plans. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to SEAs and, through them, subgrants to LEAs to promote school improvement and student achievement in low performing secondary schools through specified programs and activities."
