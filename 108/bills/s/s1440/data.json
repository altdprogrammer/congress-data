    "text": "Federal Bureau of Investigation Reform Act of 2003 - Expands the types of disclosures that trigger Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) whistle-blower protections to include disclosures to the Inspector General for the Department of Justice (DOJ), Congress, a supervisor of the employee, or the Special Counsel of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)) that the employee reasonably believes evidence misconduct. Makes procedural protections of the Administrative Procedure Act applicable in cases where a complaint of retaliation was made by an FBI employee. Provides an individual right of action before the MSPB. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) establish policies and procedures for the effective management of persons serving in FBI security positions; (2) establish a counterintelligence screening polygraph program for the FBI; and (3) report to Congress on the existing and recommended legal authority for all FBI programs and activities. Requires the FBI Director: (1) to ensure that the Attorney General's policies established in accordance with this Act are implemented through the FBI at both the headquarters and field office levels; and (2) to appoint a Director of Security and, acting through such Director, establish a security career program board. Applies provisions governing adverse actions against members of the Senior Executive Service to removals from the civil service or suspensions for any length of time (currently such provisions apply to a removal or suspension for more than 14 days). Requires annual reports on Office of Professional Responsibility investigations. Authorizes appropriations to DOJ for increased security, emergency preparedness, security compliance review, and the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review."
