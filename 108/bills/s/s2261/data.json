States that such preferential treatment shall be: (1) for the first year, 1.5 percent of the aggregate square meter equivalents of all apparel articles imported into the United States during the 12-month period beginning October 1, 2002; and (2) for each of the succeeding years, a quantity of apparel articles equal to the product of the percentage applicable during the previous 12-month period plus 0.5 percent (but not over 3.5 percent) and the aggregate square meter equivalents of all apparel articles imported into the United States during the 12-month period ending on September 30 of such year. Applies such provisions to goods entered or withdrawn from a warehouse for consumption on or after October 1, 2003, including a retroactive application to certain warehouse entries or withdrawals made between such date and the date of enactment of this Act."
