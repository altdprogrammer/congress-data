    "text": "Enhanced 911 Emergency Communications Act of 2003 - Amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to direct the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department of Commerce to establish the Emergency Communications Task Force to facilitate coordination between Federal, State, and local emergency communications systems, emergency personnel, and public safety organizations. Directs the Task Force to provide advice and recommendations with respect to methods to improve coordination and communications between agencies and organizations involved in emergency communications, including 911 services to enhance homeland security and public safety. Requires annual reports from the Assistant Secretary to Congress on Task Force activities. Directs the Assistant Secretary to provide grants to State and local governments and tribal organizations for enhancing emergency communications services through planning, infrastructure improvements, equipment purchases, and personnel training and acquisition. Establishes a 50 percent matching funds requirement. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Federal Communications Commission to review at least twice a year: (1) the State and local taxes, fees, or other charges appearing on telecommunications customers' bills that are designated for emergency communications improvements; and (2) the use of derived revenues. Requires each State to certify, annually, that no part of derived revenues is being used for a purpose for which taxes, fees, or charges are not designated or presented. Requires the Commission to publish in the Federal Register and notify specified congressional committees of the identity of each State or political subdivision that has failed to make such certification and the revenues being used for such other purposes. Authorizes the withholding of grant funds from States that do not comply."
