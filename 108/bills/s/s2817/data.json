    "text": "Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial 1-Cent Coin Redesign Act - Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue 1-cent coins during 2009, in accordance with the following design specifications: (1) the obverse of the 1-cent coin shall continue to bear the Victor David Brenner likeness of President Abraham Lincoln; and (2) the reverse of the coins shall bear four different designs each representing a different aspect of the life of Abraham Lincoln.. Mandates that: (1) beginning at the start of each calendar quarter of 2009, the redesigned Lincoln cents bear one of such four designs; and (2) the design on the reverse of the 1-cent coins issued after 2009, bear an image emblematic of President Lincoln's preservation of the United States of America as a single and united country. Expresses the sense of Congress that the original Victor David Brenner design for the 1-cent coin was a dramatic departure from previous American coinage that should be reproduced, using the original form and relief of the likeness of Abraham Lincoln, on the 1-cent coins issued in 2009."
