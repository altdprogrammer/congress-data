Authorizes the Secretary to waive the requirement that a person receiving such an appointment be a citizen of the United States in the case of a person lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence when the Secretary determines that the national security so requires, but only for an original appointment in a grade below major or lieutenant commander.
