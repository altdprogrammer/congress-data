Requires the Trade Representative, before initiating an investigation (as under current law), to seek consultations with each foreign country identified in the report as engaging in priority foreign country practices, for the purpose of reaching a satisfactory resolution of such priority practices. Requires initiation of an investigation only if a satisfactory resolution of such practices has not been reached. Modifies the composition of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to include a Chief Enforcement Negotiator to recommend investigating and prosecuting cases before the World Trade Organization and under trade agreements to which the United States is a party."
