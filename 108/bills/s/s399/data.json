Prohibits involvement in a Campus CORT of any student deemed to be a danger to the community.Directs the Attorney General to make grants to qualified universities and colleges, the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, the National Drug Court Institute, and other associations and experts to assist in establishing campus drug courts and provide training and technical assistance in support of the program."
