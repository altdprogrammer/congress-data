States that to facilitate such evaluation the terms of nonproducing leases in the Badger-Two Medicine Area (U.S. Forest Service land) shall be suspended for a three-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to submit to congressional committees a report on such evaluation."
