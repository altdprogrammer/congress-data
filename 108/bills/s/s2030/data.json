    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to repeal the nonrefundable income tax credit for employment-related dependent care expenses and replace it with a refundable 50 percent income tax credit, reduced (but not below 20 percent) as the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $15,000 (adjusted for inflation). Limits the dollar amount of such credit to $3,000 ($6,000 if two or more qualifying individuals). Includes within the scope of the new credit up to $1,200 ($2,400 if two or more qualifying individuals) of respite care expenses incurred for the taxpayer's spouse and dependents who are physically or mentally incapable of self-care."
