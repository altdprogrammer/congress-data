Revises the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act to require the responsible official to obtain from a sex offender who is required to register: (1) information regarding the offender's anticipated future residence, employer's name and address, license plate number and vehicle, and student enrollment; and (2) fingerprints and a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sample, unless they were obtained within the previous three months.

Grants the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives authority to conduct certain undercover investigative operations and to inspect records and cigarettes of cigarette sellers who ship, sell, distribute, or receive any quantity in excess of 10,000 cigarettes within a single month.

Protecting Intellectual Rights Against Theft and Expropriation Act of 2004 - Amends copyright law to authorize the Attorney General to: (1) commence a civil action against any person who engages in conduct constituting copyright infringement; (2) collect damages and profits resulting from such infringement; and (3) collect statutory damages.
