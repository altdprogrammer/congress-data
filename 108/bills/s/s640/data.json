Extends LEO benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees' Retirement System to Federal prosecutors, including Assistant United States Attorneys (AUSAs), and such other attorneys in the Department of Justice (DOJ) as may be designated by the Attorney General. Exempts Federal prosecutors from mandatory retirement provisions for LEOs under the civil service laws.Requires DOJ to provide notice to incumbent Federal prosecutors of their rights under this Act. Allows incumbents to opt out of the LEO retirement program. Sets forth provisions governing the crediting of prior service by incumbents. Provides for make-up contributions for prior service of incumbents to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.Gives incumbents the option of either contributing to their own share of any make-up contributions or receiving a proportionally lesser retirement benefit. Allows the Government to contribute its share of any make-up contribution ratably over a ten-year period."
