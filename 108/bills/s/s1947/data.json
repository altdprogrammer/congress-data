Authorizes a Federal financial institution regulatory agency to prescribe regulations establishing additional limitations on the application for and receipt of credit and on the application and receipt of residential mortgage loans, after consulting with each other Federal financial institution regulatory agency. Excludes from the meaning of financial institution covered by this Act a credit union, a Federal Reserve Bank, a Federal home loan bank, or a depository institution holding company. Declares that the term \"loan\" does not include any credit card account established under an open end consumer credit plan, or a loan secured by residential real property that is the principal residence of the examiner, if certain requirements are met."
