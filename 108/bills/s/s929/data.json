(Sec. 3) Requires: (1) an applicant private operator of over-the-road buses to submit to the Secretary a security improvements plan; and (2) an applicant for a grant for security improvements within a terminal owned and operated by an entity other than the applicant to demonstrate to the Secretary that the applicant has coordinated such improvements for the terminal with the entity. (Sec. 4) Defines \"over-the-road bus\" as a bus characterized by an elevated passenger deck located over a baggage compartment. (Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees a preliminary report that includes an assessment of the over-the-road bus security grant program. (Sec. 6) Authorizes appropriations for FY 2003 and 2004."
