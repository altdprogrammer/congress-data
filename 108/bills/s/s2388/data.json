    "text": "Amends the Mosquito Abatement for Safety and Health Act to allow Indian tribes to apply for grants to: (1) assess the need for mosquito control programs to prevent and control mosquito-borne disease; (2) develop plans for carrying out such programs; and (3) operate such programs. Allows an Indian tribe located on a low-income reservation to receive a grant without conducting an assessment to determine the immediate need for a control program. Defines \"low-income reservation\" as one on which not less than 40 percent of residents are from families with incomes below the poverty line established annually by the Office of Management and Budget."
