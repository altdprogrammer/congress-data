    "text": "Fuels Security Act of 2003 - Amends the Clean Air Act to require that gasoline contain a specified volume of renewable fuel. Provides for annual increases in the applicable volume through 2012. Establishes a ratio for determining the volume required from 2013 onward.Defines renewable fuel to include motor vehicle fuel produced from biomass (e.g. grain) or natural gas produced from a biogas (e.g. landfill) source.Establishes a system of credits for gasoline which contains more renewable fuel than required.Requires studies concerning these renewable fuel requirements, specifically: (1) seasonal variations in renewable fuel availability; (2) the impact on consumers; and (3) the impact on small refineries.Establishes a system of waivers for States claiming and proving economic or environmental hardship.Establishes a Federal agency ethanol-blended gasoline and biodiesel purchasing requirement.Establishes a commercial byproducts from municipal solid waste loan guarantee program.Requires data collection concerning the monthly consumption of renewable fuels.Federal Reformulated Fuels Act of 2002 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to permit the use of the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund for methyl tertiary butyl ether (MBTE) remediation purposes.Amends the Clean Air Act to revise guidelines pertaining to: (1) water quality protection from fuels; (2) oxygen content requirements for reformulated gasoline; (3) public health and environmental impacts of fuels and fuel additives; (4) analyses of motor vehicle fuel changes; (5) additional opt-in areas under the reformulated gasoline program; and (6) Federal enforcement of State fuels requirements.Requires a joint study of Federal, State and local requirements concerning motor vehicle fuels.Requires a review of Federal procurement initiatives relating to use of recycled products and fleet and transportation efficiency."
