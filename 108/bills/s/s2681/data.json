    "text": "Iran Freedom and Support Act of 2004 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) it should be U.S. policy to support regime change for the Islamic Republic of Iran and to promote the transition to a democratic government; (2) contacts with democratic Iranian opposition groups that have pledged to adhere to nonproliferation should be expanded, and official meetings with representatives of the Iranian Government should be terminated; and (3) the President should designate at least one democratic opposition group eligible for assistance within 90 days of enactment of this Act. Authorizes the President to provide assistance to foreign and domestic pro-democracy groups opposed to the Government of Iran, including the award of grants to qualified pro-democracy radio and television broadcasting organizations. Requires presidential notification to specified congressional committees prior to any such obligation of assistance."
