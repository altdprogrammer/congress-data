    "text": "Strengthen AmeriCorps Program Act - Revises the manner in which the Corporation for National and Community Service (Corporation) approves, and records obligations relating to, national service positions (positions) under the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (NCSA) and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (DVSA). Directs the Corporation to approve a position at the time it: (1) enters into an enforceable agreement with an individual participant to serve in the Civilian Community Corps (under NCSA) or Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program (under DVSA); or (2) awards a grant to or enters into a contract or cooperative agreement with an entity to carry out a program for which such a national service position may be approved under NCSA. Requires the Corporation to record as an obligation an estimate of the net present value of the national service educational award associated with the position, based on a formula, determined in consultation with the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, that takes into consideration historical rates of enrollment in, and of earning and using such awards for, such a program. Directs the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation to report annually and certify to Congress that the Corporation is in compliance with this Act's requirements for position approval and obligation recording.Applies such requirements to each position that the Corporation approves: (1) during FY 2003 (before or after the date of enactment of this Act); and (2) during any subsequent fiscal year.Directs the Corporation to establish a reserve account within the National Service Trust and, to ensure the availability of adequate funds to support the awards of approved positions for each fiscal year, place into such account: (1) during FY 2003, a portion of the funds that were appropriated for FY 2003, or that remain available from a previous fiscal year, to carry out specified national service programs; and (2) during FY 2004 or a subsequent fiscal year, a portion of the funds that were appropriated for that fiscal year and made available to carry out such programs. Prohibits the Corporation from obligating reserve account funds until it: (1) determines that such funds will not be needed to pay awards associated with previously approved national service positions; or (2) obligates the funds to pay such awards for such previously approved positions.Requires annual independent audits of Corporation accounts relating to the appropriated funds for approved positions and the records demonstrating the manner in which the Corporation has recorded estimates as obligations.Requires, with a specified exception, all amounts included in the National Service Trust to be available for payments of national service educational awards under NCSA."
