    "text": "Chemical Facilities Security Act of 2004 - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to promulgate regulations requiring owners or operators of chemical sources identified pursuant to this Act to: (1) conduct an assessment of the source's vulnerability to a terrorism-related chemical release; and (2) prepare and implement a site security plan to address such vulnerabilities. Directs the Secretary to provide owners and operators with relevant threat information. Requires owners and operators to certify (and regularly review and recertify) completion of assessments and implementation of plans to the Secretary and to submit copies of such assessments and plans. Authorizes the Secretary to endorse existing regulations. Requires the Secretary to develop a list of existing chemical sources. Authorizes the Secretary to designate, exempt, and adjust threshold quantities of chemical substances of concern. Exempts information provided pursuant to this Act from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and comparable State or local laws. Prescribes criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosures. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) order compliance with certification and submission provisions of this Act; (2) disapprove assessments or plans, providing written notification of such disapproval; (3) bring civil actions or issue administrative orders to compel action in the event of an \"emergency threat\" (an imminent threat beyond the scope of the plan); and (4) provide training to State and local government officials and owners and operators. Sets forth civil and administrative penalties for violations of this Act. Establishes a business security grant program for small agricultural businesses listed as chemical sources."
