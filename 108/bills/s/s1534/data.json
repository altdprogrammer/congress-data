    "text": "Rural Post Office and Community Preservation Act of 2003 - Amends Federal postal law to prohibit the U.S. Postal Service from closing or consolidating a post office in a city, town, or unincorporated area with a population of 20,000 people or less (rural community), unless the Service determines that it will have a positive economic impact on that rural community and enhance its quality of life. Requires the Service, before such closing or consolidation takes effect, to develop a plan, in consultation with people in the rural community, to provide for the rehabilitation and use of the post office for purposes favored by the people of the community. Authorizes the Service to award grants to State and local governments, private organizations, or individuals to provide for the rehabilitation of any closed post office in a rural community. Requires the Service to transfer the real property (including all buildings and improvements) located at 415 5th Street in Ely, Nevada, and occupied by the closed post office, to the local county government of Ely County, Nevada."
