    "text": "Investing in America's Future Act of 2004 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop public service announcements to promote the allied health professions. Requires the Secretary to award grants to promote the allied health professions, including by: (1) increasing education opportunities; (2) expanding enrollment into allied health programs; and (3) developing retention strategies. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, to provide for faculty loan funds to increase the number of qualified allied health faculty. Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide scholarships to individuals seeking allied health education who agree to provide service in rural and other medically underserved areas with personnel shortages; (2) develop a system for collecting and analyzing workforce data to determine practitioner shortages and project future needs; and (3) include allied health schools among the schools eligible to receive grants to support Centers of Excellence in health professions education for underrepresented minority individuals. Directs the Comptroller General to establish a Health Workforce Advisory Commission to review the impact Federal workforce policies have on the health care system, analyze the implications of an internationally trained workforce, and make recommendations concerning health workforce policy issues. Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) a Rural States Physician Recruitment and Retention Demonstration Program for ameliorating physician shortage, recruitment, and retention problems in rural States; and (2) a State-specific health professions database to track the licensing and training of health professionals in each demonstration State."
