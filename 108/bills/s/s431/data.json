    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2003-02-24", 
    "text": "Municipal Solid Waste Interstate Transportation and Local Authority Act of 2003 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit a facility that received municipal solid waste (MSW) before this Acts's enactment from receiving out-of-State MSW for disposal unless the waste is received pursuant to a new or existing host community agreement or certain other State authorization. Sets forth requirements regarding the effect of host community agreements and receipt of waste by other facilities. Bars the receipt of such waste at any time the State determines that a facility is not in compliance with specified laws and regulations. Authorizes States in which facilities received more than 650,000 tons of out-of-State MSW in 1993 to establish limits on the quantity of such waste authorized to be received by facilities receiving such waste in 1993 in declining percentages of the 1993 quantity. Requires notification of such limits by a State to each State from which MSW was received in 1993. Prohibits a State from exercising the authority for general MSW limits if it exercises the authority for limits provided under this paragraph. Allows States to impose cost recovery surcharges on the processing of out-of-State MSW in the State. Imposes requirements regarding temporary waste storage. States conditions for: (1) permit denial; (2) State-imposed annual limitations, including on construction and demolition waste; and (3) the exercise of State or local flow control authority (directing materials to particular facilities). Prohibits a State or political subdivision from requiring any person to transport such waste or materials to any active portion of an MSW landfill if its contamination is a basis for listing on the National Priorities List established under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, unless the person has been indemnified by the government or the owner-operator against all liability with respect to such materials. Provides for the enforceability of certain legally binding interim contracts that obligate the delivery of a minimum quantity of MSW or recyclables to a designated facility and obligate the government to pay or be liable for such materials."
