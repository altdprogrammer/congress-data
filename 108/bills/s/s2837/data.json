    "text": "Continuing Care for Recovering Families Act - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code to allow an eligible individual to elect continuation coverage for group health benefits as provided for in the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) during the 120-day period that begins on the later of the date of enactment of this Act or the date on which the individual experiences a terrorism-related loss of coverage. Provides that: (1) the maximum period required for such coverage shall not be less than the period during which the individual is an eligible individual; and (2) the period between the loss of coverage and the first day of the election period shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the waiting period for coverage of preexisting conditions. Defines an \"eligible individual\" as an individual who: (1) is a child or spouse of an individual who suffered physical harm or death as a result of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; (2) that has experienced a terrorism-related loss of health benefits coverage associated with the death, injury, or loss of employment of such an individual; and (3) is not otherwise covered under a health benefits plan or entitled to Medicare benefits."
