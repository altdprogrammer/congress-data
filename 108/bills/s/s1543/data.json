Authorizes the Secretary to award incentive grants to States for exemplary performance in carrying out integrated training programs.

Amends the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act with respect to adult education and literacy services to assist immigrants who are not proficient in English in improving their reading, writing, speaking, and mathematics skills and acquiring an understanding of the American free enterprise system, individual freedom, and the responsibilities of citizenship. Authorizes the national leadership activities of the Secretary of Education to include awarding grants to communities experiencing large increases of individuals with Limited English Proficiency for the purpose of providing English language and civics education programs."
