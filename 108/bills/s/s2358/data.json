    "text": "American Neighborhoods Taking the Initiative--Guarding Against Neighborhood Gangs Act of 2004 (ANTI-GANG Act) - Amends Federal criminal code provisions regarding criminal street gangs. Prohibits specified acts regarding recruitment and retention in a gang, participation in gang activities, and witness intimidation. Requires a certification by the Attorney General or specified other officials for Federal prosecution of a crime that is otherwise exclusively chargeable under State law. Authorizes the Attorney General to designate high intensity interstate gang activity areas. Provides for coordination of anti-gang activities with anti-drug trafficking activities. Authorizes grants to: (1) develop community based programs that provide crime prevention, research, and intervention services for gang members and at-risk youth; and (2) fund technology, equipment, and training for State and local sheriffs, police agencies, and prosecutor offices to improve the investigation and prosecution of gangs. Expands the Federal witness relocation and protection program to cover gangs. Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to State and local prosecutors and the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia to provide short-term protection to witnesses in trials involving gangs. Directs the Comptroller General to report on the costs and benefits associated with expanding Federal authority to prosecute offenders under age 18 who are gang members who commit criminal offenses. Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to provide for a student loan repayment program for prosecutors and public defenders."
