Amends provisions pertaining to record keeping regarding imported covered products. States that the Secretary shall not have to store records in cases in which qualifying individuals have imported a covered product. Amends provisions regarding the testing of imported covered products. Declares that specified tests, including ones involving authenticity and degradation of products, shall not be required unless the importer is a wholesaler. Requires such tests to be conducted by the importer unless a product is a prescription drug subject to the provisions of this Act pertaining to counterfeit-resistant packaging. (Currently either the importer or the manufacturer may conduct such tests). Eliminates the sunset date current law establishes for the provisions pertaining to the importation of covered products. Classifies prescription drugs as misbranded if they do not incorporate specified counterfeit-resistant technologies in packaging."
