Requires the OMB report to include assessments of: (1) the capability of the listed entities to prepare annual financial statements and have them independently audited; (2) how to reduce the costs of preparing the financial statements and performing independent audits; and (3) the benefits of improved financial oversight encompassing the executive branch, including the feasibility of preparing annual financial statements and independently audited statements for certain executive branch entities.
