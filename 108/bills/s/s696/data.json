States that the limitation to the general business credit, based on the amount of tax, shall not be reduced by the amount of the marginal oil and gas well credit.Allows both geological and geophysical expenditures on domestic oil and gas exploration and development and delay rental payments, at the taxpayer's election, to be deducted from gross income at the time incurred."
