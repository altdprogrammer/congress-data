Requires the member to designate the dependent(s) to whom such assistance is being transferred as well as the number of months being transferred. Allows such members to make, revoke, or modify such transfers at any time. Requires a pro rata repayment of transferred assistance for any of the four-year service period not successfully served by the member (with exceptions in the case of member death or release or discharge for a service-connected disability, for hardship, or for a physical or mental condition)."
