Establishes a violation as: (1) a predicate offense under the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act; and (2) an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commision Act. Requires any person sending unsolicited bulk commercial e-mail to provide to its recipients a clear and conspicuous opportunity to request not to receive future unsolicited e-mail."
