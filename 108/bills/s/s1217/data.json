Directs the Secretary to conduct and support research to: (1) improve the identification of older adults who have a high risk of falling; (2) improve data collection and analysis to identify fall risk and protective factors; (3) design, implement, and evaluate the most effective fall prevention interventions; (4) tailor effective strategies to reduce falls to specific populations of older adults; (5) maximize the dissemination of proven, effective fall prevention interventions; (6) improve the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of elderly fall victims; and (7) assess the risks of falls occurring in various settings. Requires the Secretary to: (1) conduct research concerning the barriers to the adoption of proven fall prevention interventions; (2) conduct research to develop, implement, and evaluate the most effective approaches to reduce falls among high-risk older adults living in long-term care facilities; and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of community programs to prevent assisted living and nursing home falls among older adults. Requires the Secretary to provide professional education for physicians and allied health professionals in fall prevention. Directs the Secretary to oversee and support certain demonstration and research projects by qualified organizations, institutions, or consortia of qualified organizations and institutions, including: (1) a multistate demonstration project assessing the utility of targeted fall risk screening and referral programs; (2) programs utilizing multicomponent fall-intervention approaches; (3) programs designed to maximize independence and quality of life for older adults targeted at newly discharged fall victims; and (4) private sector and public-private partnerships to develop technology to prevent falls among older adults and to prevent or reduce injuries if falls occur. Requires the Secretary to award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to: (1) design, implement, and evaluate fall prevention programs using proven intervention strategies in residential and institutional settings; (2) carry out a multistate demonstration project to implement and evaluate fall prevention programs designed for multifamily residential settings with high concentrations of older adults; and (3) conduct evaluations of the effectiveness of such demonstration projects. Directs the Secretary to review and report to Congress on the effects of falls on health care costs, the potential for reducing falls, and the most effective strategies for reducing health care costs associated with falls."
