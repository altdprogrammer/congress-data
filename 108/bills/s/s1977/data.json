    "text": "Small Manufacturers Assistance, Recovery, and Trade Act or SMART Act - Establishes in the Department of Commerce the position of Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Manufacturing to: (1) identify and address the concerns of U.S. manufacturers; (2) develop policies that promote the viability and expansion of U.S. manufacturing; (3) review policies that adversely impact manufacturers; and (4) identify and address issues unique to small manufacturers and those that are exacerbated by the size or limited capital of small manufacturers. Establishes an Interagency Manufacturing Task Force to maximize, improve, and coordinate Federal agency resources in assisting the manufacturing industry. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to establish the position of Assistant United States Trade Representative for Small Business. Directs the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to establish a Small Business Manufacturing Task Force to evaluate and identify whether SBA programs and services are sufficient to serve the needs of small manufacturers. Requires the SBA Office of Entrepreneurial Development to develop: (1) new outreach and training programs for small manufacturers and small businesses in the manufacturing supply chain; (2) manufacturing workshops; and (3) programs and services to strengthen small business vendors and suppliers in the manufacturing supply chain. Amends the Small Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to include small business manufacturing within the SBA loan and international trade programs."
