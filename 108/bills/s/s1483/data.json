    "text": "(NOTE - S.1940 & S.1483, unlike H.R.2210, do not provide for State demonstration programs that allow States to administer their allotment of Federal Head Start funds.) Head Start Coordination and School Readiness Act - Amends the Head Start Act to reauthorize through FY 2008 and revise Head Start programs. Requires expanded coordination and collaboration among Head Start and other agencies. Requires States that receive Head Start quality improvement and collaboration grants (currently collaboration grants) to establish: (1) State Head Start Quality Improvement and Collaboration Offices; and (2) State advisory councils on collaboration on early care and education activities for children. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue regulations requiring Head Start agencies to implement certain policies and procedures for enrollment of eligible homeless children. Revises requirements for the Secretary's designation of Head Start agencies, as well as those for quality standards. Requires annual Head Start program self-assessments, reports, and improvement plans. Requires Head Start agencies to have: (1) a program meeting all quality standards; (2) capacity to serve eligible children with scientifically based curricula and other interventions and support services that promote school readiness; (3) outreach to schools, local educational agencies (LEAs), local businesses, community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, museums, and libraries; and (4) coordination with LEAs, particularly on ways to increase participation of underserved populations. Revises requirements for Early Head Start grant programs to include: (1) consideration of homeless infants and toddlers; (2) migrant and seasonal Head Start programs; (3) grants to applicants in communities which have experienced a large percentage increase in limited English proficient (LEP) children and families; and (4) professional development to increase program participation for underserved populations. Establishes increased staff qualification requirements for Head Start programs. Requires individuals receiving financial assistance under the Act to pursue a degree to qualify as Head Start staff to: (1) teach or work in a Head Start program for at least three years after receiving the degree; or (2) repay the assistance received. Requires every Head Start agency and program to create a professional development plan for employees providing direct services to children. Establishes programs to: (1) attract and retain high-quality Head Start classroom teachers; and (2) improve literacy in Head Start programs. Directs the Secretary to contract with the Board on Children, Youth, and Families of the National Research Council and the Board on Testing and Assessments of the National Academy of Sciences to establish expert, independent panels to study, report, and make recommendations on: (1) the assessment of school readiness in young children; and (2) the Head Start reporting system."
