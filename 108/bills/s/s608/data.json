Requires PDPs to use such grants to: (1) develop preservice teacher education for SEs; or (2) create or support professional development schools that provide specified services. Authorizes the Secretary to make competitive grant and contract awards to eligible entities (partnerships of LEAs and State-approved SE personnel preparation programs, and additional entities) to provide professional development, leadership training, and collaborative opportunities for general educators to ensure they have skills and knowledge to meet the needs of, and improve results for, children with disabilities.Revises requirements: (1) for personnel preparation to improve services and results for children with disabilities; and (2) to benefit children with high-incidence disabilities to include those with emotional or behavioral disorders."
