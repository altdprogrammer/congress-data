Authorizes the Superintendent of the Recreation Area to issue a permit to the Corporation for the use of the Recreation Area for temporary construction and staging areas required for the construction of the enlarged pipeline. Requires the Corporation to comply with all requirements for certification by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that are necessary to permit the increase in pipeline size. Prohibits the Secretary from granting additional increases in the diameter of, or easements for, the pipeline within the boundary of the Recreation Area after the date of enactment of this Act."
