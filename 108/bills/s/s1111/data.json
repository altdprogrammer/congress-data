States that such guidelines shall not apply in 2003 for grazing activities for which the Secretary is unable to provide alternative arrangements in specified allotments on the Lassen, Plumas, Tahoe, Stanislaus, and Sierra National Forests.Authorizes the Secretary to provide certain environmental exclusions for such alternative grazing arrangements without first administratively establishing an applicable category of excluded actions."
