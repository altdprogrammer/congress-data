    "text": "Child Modeling Exploitation Prevention Act - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to prohibit an employer from employing a child model in exploitive child modeling. Defines \"exploitive child modeling\" as modeling involving the use of a child under 17 years old for financial gain without the purpose of marketing a product or service other than the child's image, regardless of whether the employment relationship of the child is direct or indirect, contractual or non-contractual, or is termed that of an independent contractor. Provides that such term does not apply to an image which, taken as a whole, has serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.Sets penalties for violations. Includes employment of a minor in violation of such provision within the definition of \"oppressive child labor.\"Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit displaying or offering to provide the image of an individual engaged in exploitive child modeling, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, with the intent to make a financial gain, except with respect to an image which has serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value."
