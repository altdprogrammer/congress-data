Permits termination or non-renewal of such franchise relationships by the franchisor in good faith and in the normal course of business if the franchisor decides to withdraw from the marketing of the lubricating oil in the relevant geographic market in which the oil is distributed, and: (1) the decision is made after the date on which the franchise is entered into or renewed, and on the basis of a change in relevant facts or circumstances relating to the franchise that occurs after such date; and (2) the termination or nonrenewal is not for the purpose of converting any accounts subject to the franchise to the franchisor's account."
