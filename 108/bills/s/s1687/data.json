Instructs the Secretary to: (1) evaluate, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, the compatibility of designating one or more sites within the study area as an NPS unit with maintaining the security, productivity, and management goals of the Department of Energy (DOE) and public health and safety; and (2) consider existing research by DOE on the historical significance and feasibility of preserving and interpreting the various sites and structures in such area. Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress a report on the findings of the study and the conclusions and recommendations of the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations."
