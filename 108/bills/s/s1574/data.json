Declares the intention of Congress that: (1) the National Memorial on Midway Atoll be given equal consideration with concerns over the preservation of wildlife in all matters related to the administration, development and preservation of the Atoll; (2) Midway's airport remain in use as an alternative emergency site in order to ensure the safety of civilian and military aircraft in the northern Pacific region; and (3) the public continue to have meaningful access to the Atoll so as to experience and benefit from its status as both a National Memorial to the Battle of Midway and a National Wildlife Refuge."
