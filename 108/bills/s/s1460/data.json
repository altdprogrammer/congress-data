Defines \"critical antimicrobial animal drug\" and \"nontherapeutic use.\" Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make payments to livestock or poultry producers to defray the costs of reducing such drugs' use, with priority given to family-owned or small farms and ranches. Amends the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary to provide grants for university research and demonstration programs to phase out the nontherapeutic use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs in livestock or poultry. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require manufacturers of a critical antimicrobial animal drug or an animal feed for food-producing animals containing such a drug to report annual sales information."
