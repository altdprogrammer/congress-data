Prohibits: (1) a somatic cell nucleus from being transplanted into a human oocyte (egg) that has undergone or will undergo fertilization; (2) an unfertilized blastocyst from being maintained after more than 14 days from its first cell division, not counting storage times at temperatures less than zero degrees centigrade; (3) an oocyte from being used in nuclear transplantation research unless donated voluntarily with the donor's informed consent; (4) an oocyte or unfertilized blastocyst from being acquired, received, or transferred for valuable consideration in interstate commerce; or (5) the conduct in a laboratory of nuclear transplantation in which human oocytes are subject to assisted reproductive technology treatments or procedures."
