Prohibits the Council from: (1) taking any action relating to a matter within the authority of the United States Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution or the Federal Mediation Service without the consent of the Institute or Service; or (2) duplicate or interfere with the activities and responsibilities of the Institute or Service. Requires: (1) the Institute or Service to respond to a Council consent request within 30 days; and (2) the Council, Institute, and Service to consult with one another to identify opportunities for collaboration in fulfilling their respective purposes and programs. Vests Council powers in a Board of Directors. Prohibits any Director from being a Federal officer or employee, including a Member of Congress. Provides for a Council President appointed by the Board. Requires the Council to report annually to the President and each House of Congress on prior-year activities and audits. Prohibits the Council from engaging in lobbying activities or being a client.
