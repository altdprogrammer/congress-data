    "text": "Parental Responsibility Obligations Met through Immigration System Enforcement Act or PROMISE Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to render aliens inadmissible for nonpayment of child support if arrearages exceed a specified amount unless payments are satisfied or the alien is in compliance with an approved payment agreement. Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to parole such inadmissible aliens into the United States if parole is essential to the fulfillment of child support and the alien is placed in removal proceedings, has authorized employment, and is otherwise admissible. Prohibits entry of a final removal order against such aliens during the pendency of State court child support proceedings. Adds nonpayment of child support to the INA's list of conduct barring a finding that an alien is a person of good moral character unless support payments are satisfied or the alien is in compliance with an approved payment agreement. Authorizes immigration officers to serve process in child support or paternity cases on aliens seeking admission. Amends the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, upon request by the Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, or Secretary of State, to provide authorized persons with information that may aid alien child support delinquency determinations. Prohibits the further disclosure of such information other than for Federal law enforcement purposes. Authorizes disciplinary action and civil penalties for unauthorized disclosures."
