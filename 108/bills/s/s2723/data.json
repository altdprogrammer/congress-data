Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to construct a system of defensible fuel profile zones between the wilderness boundary and community boundary around Cascade Locks and Government Camp. Authorizes the Secretary to provide grants to communities that are gateways to Mount Hood Wilderness areas, villages surrounding Mount Hood, and appropriate county governments in Oregon. Withdraws wilderness areas designated under this Act from all forms of: (1) appropriation; (2) disposal under public law; (3) location, entry, and patent under mining law; and (4) disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing or mineral materials. Designates specified parts of Hood River, Zigzag River, Eagle Creek, and Fifteenmile Creek in Mount Hood National Forest as components of the national wild and scenic rivers system. Establishes the National Commission on Urban National Forests to examine the role urban national forests play in enriching the lives of urban populations served by such forests. Directs the Secretary to: (1) identify the winter recreation area between Timberline and Government Camp and around Trillium Lake, Summit Meadows, and Multipor Mountain to be used for specified winter recreation and designate such area as Mount Hood National Forest Southside Winter Recreation Area; and (2) designate the Mount Hood Pedaler's Demonstration Experiment Area around Hell Roaring Creek, Shellrock Mountain, and Fifteenmile Creek and to monitor the effect of mountain biking on such Area's ecology and surrounding communities. Authorizes the Secretary to provide specified amounts to: (1) Cascade Locks and Hood River County to bury ground power lines adjacent to or within Mount Hood Wilderness areas; and (2) Clackamus County to replace four culverts on the wild and scenic river segments in that County. Excludes the part of Oregon State Highway 35 that is adjacent to wilderness areas in Mount Hood National Forest from wilderness under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to provide funds from Forest Service roads to improve access to wilderness over highway 26. Provides for a land exchange between the Secretary and Clackamus County.
