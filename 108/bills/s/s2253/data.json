Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to enter into contracts or cooperative agreements directly with any service and conservation corps or State department of natural resources, agriculture, or forestry to carry out projects to prevent fire and suppress fires, rehabilitate public land affected or altered by fires, and provide disaster relief. Directs the Secretaries to give priority to certain projects, including projects that will: (1) reduce hazardous fuels on public lands; (2) restore public land affected or threatened by disease or insect infestation; (3) rehabilitate public land affected or altered by fires; (4) assess public land at a high risk of reburn; and (5) address public land located near a municipal watershed and water supply."
