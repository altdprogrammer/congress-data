    "text": "Armenian Victims Insurance Fairness Act - Authorizes States to: (1) require an insurance company conducting business in the State to disclose and make publicly available details regarding certain covered policies issued by that company or by any related company; and (2) provide penalties and sanctions for noncompliance. Defines a \"covered policy\" as a life, property, liability, health annuity, dowry, educational, or casualty insurance policy issued to a policyholder domiciled in the area of Europe or Asia that was occupied or controlled by the Ottoman Empire and that was in effect at any time between 1875 and 1923. Declares that Congress explicitly disapproves any Executive branch policy or agreement that preempts State efforts to collect insurance information to resolve outstanding claims concerning such policies."
