    "text": "Water Infrastructure Revitalization Act - Directs the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to establish a program to provide environmental assistance to non-Federal interests in North Dakota, which may be provided in the form of design and construction assistance for water-related environmental infrastructure and resource protection and development projects. Requires projects to be publicly owned as a prerequisite for assistance. Directs the Secretary to enter into local cooperation agreements with non-Federal interests for project design and construction. Sets the Federal share of project costs under local cooperation agreements at 75 percent. Requires a reduction in the non-Federal share of the cost of constructing projects under this Act, using a Federal formula for water rate affordability, where the rate for affordability relating to the project area exceeds the average State-wide rate by a specified percentage. Sets the non-Federal share of operation and maintenance costs for projects constructed with assistance under this Act at 100 percent."
