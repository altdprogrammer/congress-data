Declares that the supply of vaccines should be sufficient to provide for adults and children, for a six-month period, all vaccinations routinely recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Directs the Secretary to require a manufacturer of a vaccine included in such supply to provide a one-year notice to the Secretary of a discontinuance of the manufacture of the vaccine or of other factors that may impede the supply of the vaccine. Permits a reduction of the period of notice for good cause. Authorizes appropriations through FY 2009."
