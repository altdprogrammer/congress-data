Authorizes the President to provide reconstruction services for any country or region for which such Director has been designated. Authorizes the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development to establish an Office of International Emergency Management for such reconstruction services. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense should present to the North Atlantic Council a proposal to establish within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) an Integrated Security Support Component to train and equip selected units within NATO to assist in providing security in countries or regions requiring reconstruction services; and (2) if such a Component is established, the President should commit U.S. personnel to participate in it, after appropriate consultation with Congress. Authorizes the President to commit U.S. personnel to participate in an Integrated Security Support Component if the North Atlantic Council establishes one. Instructs the Secretary of State to establish within the Department of State an interagency Training Center for Post-Conflict Reconstruction Operations."
