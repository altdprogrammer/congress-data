Sets penalties for knowingly and intentionally: (1) placing in U.S. waters a device or substance likely to destroy or damage a vessel or its cargo or likely to interfere with safe navigation or maritime commerce; (2) discharging or releasing into U.S. navigable water or adjoining shoreline any substance that would endanger human life, health, or welfare or the marine environment; (3) transporting aboard any vessel explosive, biological, chemical, or radioactive or nuclear material to be used to commit a Federal crime of terrorism. Sets penalties for: (1) transporting aboard any vessel a terrorist or terror suspect; (2) willfully causing destruction of a vessel or maritime facility; (3) imparting or conveying false information concerning an attempt made to commit certain criminal acts; and (4) knowingly carrying a weapon, explosive, incendiary device, or loaded firearm on a vessel or at a seaport. Requires the Attorney General to issue regulations to require the reporting of cargo theft. Expands the scope of a prohibition against theft of interstate or foreign shipments. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to increase penalties for noncompliance with manifest requirements."
