    "text": "Provides that, if a veteran claimant's filing of a notice of disagreement (a notice of the belief that a veteran's claim decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs is incorrect, together with a request for its appeal) meets minimum statutory requirements, then the notice will be deemed a notice of disagreement with full rights of appeal through the Board of Veterans' Appeals and the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, notwithstanding its rejection by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Allows for the reevaluation of notices which were found to be defective during the period beginning on March 15, 2002, and ending on the date of enactment of this Act."
