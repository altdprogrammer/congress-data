Revises corridor eligibility requirements to authorize the Secretary to make allocations with respect to certain identified high priority corridors that connect to the border between the United States and Mexico or the United States and Canada. Authorizes necessary funding for the national corridor planning and development and coordinated border infrastructure programs."
