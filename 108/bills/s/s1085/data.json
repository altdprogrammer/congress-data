    "text": "Reclamation Rural and Small Community Water Enhancement Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to undertake a program to investigate and identify opportunities for ensuring safe and adequate regional rural water supply systems (serving areas with populations not exceeding 40,000, with exceptions) for use in small communities and rural areas through the construction of new regional systems and the enhancement of existing ruralsystems. Limits participation in such program to the States and areas (and Indian reservation lands within such States and areas) referred to in the Reclamation Act of 1902. Requires the Secretary to: (1) submit to specified congressional committees a report setting forth the status of all rural water projects within the Secretary's jurisdiction authorized prior to enactment of this Act and the Secretary 's plan for completing such projects within their respective time frames; and (2) take steps to complete such projects within such time frames. Authorizes the Secretary to undertake appraisal investigations to identify opportunities for the construction of new systems and enhancement of existing systems for small communities and rural areas; and (2) participate with appropriate Federal, State, tribal, regional, and local authorities in studies to determine the feasibility of such projects where such an investigation so warrants."
