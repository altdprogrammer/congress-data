Establishes the Long Island Sound Stewardship Coordinating Committee to evaluate applications: (1) from owners or other controlling parties to have qualifying land within the Region designated as \"stewardship sites\" for purposes of awarding preservation funds; and (2) from government or nonprofit organizations qualified to hold conservation easements for funds to purchase land or development rights for stewardship sites. Requires the Committee to develop and publish a management plan that describes the current status of Long Island Sound, the Committee's role in protecting it, and details of the stewardship site designation program."
