Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to prohibit a consumer reporting agency from including or maintaining information concerning any transaction involved in the identity theft with respect to which such no-fault letter has been issued. Cites duties of a consumer reporting agency with respect to other creditors and credit reporting agencies following receipt of such State-issued no-fault letter. Amends the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to set forth the duties of a debt collector following receipt of such a State-issued no-fault letter. Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to shield a person from liability for any electronic fund transfer with respect to which such no-fault letter has been issued. Cites duties of a financial institution following receipt of such State-issued no-fault letter."
