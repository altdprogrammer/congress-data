Subtitle D: Other Matters - (Sec. 131) Requires the Secretary, upon determining to convey, lease, or dispose of all or part of the Louisville Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Kentucky, to engage in negotiations for such conveyance, lease, or disposal solely with the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Limits the duration of such requirement to one year after the commencement of such negotiations. Requires such negotiations to address the utilization of such Center for the primary purpose of the provision of services for veterans and related activities. Title II: Benefits Matters - (Sec. 201) Exempts veterans receiving hospice care from certain Department copayment requirements. (Sec. 202) Makes permanent (currently terminates at the end of 2004) the Department's authority to provide counseling and treatment to veterans suffering from an incident of sexual trauma that occurred during service. Expands such authority to include members of the reserves suffering from an incident that occurred during training. (Sec. 203) States that Department per diem payments to States for the care of veterans in State nursing homes shall not be considered a liability of a third party or otherwise utilized to offset or reduce any other payment made to assist veterans. (Sec. 204) Authorizes the Secretary to provide up to 14 days of care following birth for the newborn child of a woman veteran receiving maternity care furnished by the Department if the child was delivered in a Department facility or a Department-contracted facility.
