Sets forth specified funding authorities, including funding for: (1) security assistance; (2) an institute for reform in Asia; (3) law enforcement; (4) promotion of competitive elections; (5) political transitions; and (6) Taiwan and the Republic of Korea. Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to deny entry visas to public or private individuals who have impeded human rights, the rule of law, and economic freedom in North and South East Asia. Directs the Secretary of State to maintain a database of individuals who may be denied entry. Expresses the sense of Congress that any democracy fund established by the United Nations (UN) in response to the September 21, 2004, speech by President George W. Bush to the UN General Assembly should be known as the ``Daw Aung San Suu Kyi Democracy Fund.\""
