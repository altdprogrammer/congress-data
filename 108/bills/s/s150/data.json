    "text": "Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act - (Sec. 2) Amends the Internet Tax Freedom Act to extend the ban on State taxation of Internet access and on multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce until November 1, 2007. Changes the definition of \"tax on Internet access\" to: (1) mean a tax on Internet access regardless of whether such tax is imposed on a provider of Internet access or a buyer of Internet access and regardless of the terminology used to describe the tax; and (2) exclude a tax levied upon or measured by net income, capital stock, net worth, or property value. Changes the definition of \"Internet access service\" to exclude telecommunications services (current law), except to the extent such services are purchased, used, or sold by an Internet access provider to provide Internet access. (Sec. 3) Extends: (1) through November 1, 2007, the Internet access taxing authority of States that had a tax on Internet access prior to October 1, 1998; and (2) through November 1, 2005, the Internet access taxing authority of States that had a tax on Internet access as of November 1, 2003. Terminates after November 1, 2006, the authority of a State to tax Internet access with respect to a State telecommunications service tax: (1) enacted by State law on or after October 1, 1991, and imposing a tax on telecommunications service; and (2) applied to Internet access through administrative code or regulation issued on or after December 1, 2002. (Sec. 4) Permits subjecting Internet access charges to taxation if they are aggregated with telecommunications service charges and the provider cannot identify them from regular business records. (Sec. 5) Specifies that nothing in this Act shall prevent the imposition of fees to preserve and advance Federal universal service (or similar State programs) or 911 or E-911 services. (Sec. 6) Specifies that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect any Federal or state regulatory proceeding that is not related to taxation or the imposition of a tax on a charge for voice or similar service utilizing Internet Protocol or any successor protocol (except for services that are incidental to Internet access, such as voice-capable e-mail or instant messaging). (Sec. 6A) Exempts the State of Texas, or its political subdivisions, from the Internet tax moratorium with respect to the imposition or collection of the Texas municipal access line fee. (Sec. 7) Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to specified congressional committees on the impact of the Internet tax moratorium on State and local government revenues and on the deployment and adoption of broadband technologies for Internet access throughout the United States."
