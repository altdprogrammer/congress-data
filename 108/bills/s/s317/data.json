Sets forth: (1) procedures for employer discontinuance of, or employee withdrawal from, certain of such programs; and (2) prohibitions against coercion.Amends the Federal bankruptcy code to grant third priority (allowed unsecured claims for wages, salaries, or commissions) in bankruptcy proceedings to claims relating to compensatory time off.Amends the Congressional Accountability Act to provide congressional employees with such options for compensatory time, biweekly work, and flexible credit hours programs."
