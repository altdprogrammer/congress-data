Sets forth: (1) criteria for making that determination; and (2) priorities in making grants, with preference to rural communities. Repeals the continued dumping and subsidy offset program (under which sums are distributed to affected domestic producers). Establishes the Community Trade Readjustment and Development Enhancement Trust Fund, which shall be available for the payment of readjustment assistance to communities."
