Title II: DC Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 2003 - DC Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 2003 - (Sec. 4) Requires the Secretary of Education to provide five-year grants on a competitive basis to educational entities of the District of Columbia Government, nonprofit organizations, and consortia of nonprofit organizations (eligible entities) with approved applications to carry out activities to provide expanded school choice opportunities to students who are DC residents and who come from households with incomes not exceeding 185 percent of the poverty line (eligible students). Authorizes the Secretary to award a single grant or multiple grants, depending on the quality of applications submitted and the priorities of this title. Requires the Secretary and the Mayor of the District to enter into a memorandum of understanding regarding the design of, selection of eligible entities to receive grants under, and implementation of, a program assisted under this Act. (Sec. 6) Requires the Secretary to give priority to applications from eligible entities who will most effectively: (1) give priority to eligible students who, in the school year preceding the school year for which they are seeking a scholarship, attended an elementary or secondary school identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring; (2) target resources to students and families that lack the financial resources to take advantage of available educational options; and (3) provide students and families with the widest range of educational options. (Sec. 7) Requires a grantee: (1) under specified conditions, to use the grant funds to provide the students with scholarships to pay the tuition, fees, and transportation expenses, if any, to enable them to attend the DC private elementary or secondary school of their choice; and (2) to ensure that the amount of any tuition or fee charged by a participating school in the grantee's program to a participating eligible student does not exceed the amount of tuition or fees that the school customarily charges to a nonparticipating student. Authorizes the Secretary to award scholarships in larger amounts to students with the greatest need. Limits scholarships to $7,500 per student for any academic year. Allows an eligible entity to award a scholarship for the second time or any succeeding year of an eligible student's participation in a program under this Act, to a student who comes from a household whose income does not exceed 200 percent of the poverty line. (Sec. 8) Prohibits an eligible entity or a school participating in any program under this title from discriminating against program participants or applicants on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex. Makes the prohibition on sex discrimination inapplicable to a participating school that is operated by, supervised by, controlled by, or connected to a religious organization to the extent that the application is inconsistent with the religious tenets of the school. Allows a parent to choose and a school to offer a single-sex school, class, or activity. Provides that nothing in this title may be construed to alter or modify the provisions of IDEA. Authorizes schools participating in programs under this Act that are operated by, supervised by, controlled by, or connected to, a religious organization to exercise their discretion in matters of employment consistent with title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, including the exemptions in such title. Declares that funds made available under this Act to eligible students that are received by a participating school, as a result of their parents' choice, shall not, consistent with the first amendment of the Constitution: (1) necessitate any change in such school's teaching mission; (2) require the school to remove religious art, icons, scriptures, or other symbols; or (3) preclude them from retaining religious terms in its name, selecting its board members on a religious basis, or including religious references in its mission statements and other chartering or governing documents. Requires a scholarship (or any other form of support provided to parents of eligible students) under this title to be considered as assistance to the student and not to the school that enrolls the student. Provides that the amount of such scholarship or other form of support shall not be treated as income of the parents for purposes of Federal tax laws or for determining eligibility for any other Federal program. (Sec. 9) Requires the Secretary, directly or by grant, contract, or cooperative agreement, to: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of the voucher program, using the strongest possible design, addressing specified issues; and (2) disseminate information on the impact of the programs in increasing the student academic achievement of participating students, as well as other appropriate measures of student success, and on the impact on DC students and schools. Requires annual interim reports by the Secretary, and a final report within one year after the final year for which a grant is made. Limits expenditures for such evaluation and reporting requirements for any fiscal year to three percent of the total amount appropriated to carry out this title for the fiscal year. (Sec. 10) Sets forth reporting requirements for: (1) grantees receiving funds under this title; (2) participating schools with respect to parents of participating children; and (3) the Secretary with respect to congressional committees on the findings of such reports. (Sec. 11) Requires each participating school to ensure: (1) that participating eligible students receive comparable academic assessments in the same grade levels as those provided to DC public school students; (2) to the maximum extent possible, that the assessment results are capable of being compared to determine the relative achievement levels between participating eligible students and DC public school students in the same grades; and (3) that academic assessment results containing any personally identifiable information shall be disclosed only to the parents of the student taking the assessment. (Sec. 13) Authorizes appropriations. Title III: District of Columbia Funds - Appropriates specified sums out of the District's general fund and/or other funds for the current fiscal year for: (1) operating expenses (with limitations); (2) governmental direction and support; (3) economic development and regulation; (4) public safety and justice; (5) the public education system (including transfer of funds); (6) human support services (including transfer of funds); (7) public works; (8) the Emergency and Contingency Reserve Fund; (9) repayment of certain loans and interest; (10) payment of interest on short-term borrowing; (11) for principal and interest payments on the District's Certificates of Participation, issued to finance the ground lease underlying the building located at One Judiciary Square; (12) refunds and the payment of legal settlements or judgments that have been entered against the District government; (13) the John A. Wilson Building; (14) workforce investments; (15) certain non-departmental agency costs; (16) emergency planning and security costs; (17) transportation assistance; (18) pay-as-you-go capital in lieu of capital financing; (19) a Tax Increment Financing Program; (20) the Cash Reserve; (21) making refunds associated with disallowed Medicaid funding; (22) the Water and Sewer Authority; (23) the Washington Aqueduct; (24) the Stormwater Permit Compliance Enterprise Fund; (25) the Lottery and Charitable Games Enterprise Fund; (26) the Sports and Entertainment Commission; (27) the District of Columbia Retirement Board; (28) the Washington Convention Center Enterprise Fund; (29) the National Capital Revitalization Corporation; and (30) capital outlay (including rescissions).
