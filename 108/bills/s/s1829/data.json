    "text": "Better Eating for Better Living Act of 2003 - Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (CNA) and the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (NSLA) to revise school lunch programs with respect to reimbursement rates, nutrition guidelines, milk guidelines, and funds for nutrition education and training. Amends NLSA to increase the reimbursement rate for school lunches by 20.5 cents per meal (from 10.5 to 31). Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) to evaluate nutrition guidelines for school meals, and issue any necessary revised guidelines, every five years. Revises milk guidelines. Requires schools, at a minimum, to offer students a choice of low fat or nonfat fluid milk. Allows schools, in addition, to offer any other varieties of fluid milk that are: (1) consistent with expressed preferences of the student population; and (2) reasonably equivalent in calcium, protein, vitamin A, and vitamin K content and cost. Amends CNA to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer to the Secretary specified amounts of funds for implementing and administering nutrition education and training programs. Requires grants to each State from such amounts to be: (1) based on a rate of 1/2 cent per average daily number of meals served; and (2) allocated among State, district, and school food service and health education authorities, as determined by the Secretary. Sets a minimum grant amount."
