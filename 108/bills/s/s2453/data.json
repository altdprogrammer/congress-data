    "text": "Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 - (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary of Transportation to enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to define and clarify the respective public transportation security roles and responsibilities of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Requires DOT's Federal Transit Administration to submit all public transportation security assessments to DHS and the Secretary of Homeland Security to review and augment such assessments. (Sec. 4) Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish security improvement priorities and to update them annually; (2) conduct assessments of all transit agencies considered to be at greatest risk of a terrorist attack, of local bus-only public transportation systems, and of selected rural transportation systems; and (3) use information collected to establish the process for developing security guidelines. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary to award grants directly to public transportation agencies for allowable capital security improvements (including tunnel and perimeter protection systems, and surveillance and communications equipment); and (2) operational security improvements (including security training for transit employees, drills, public awareness campaigns, and canine patrols for chemical, biological, or explosives detection). Requires grantees that have used grant funds for purposes other than for grant purposes to return any amount so used to the Treasury. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to: (1) ensure that DOT receives appropriate and timely notification of all credible terrorist threats against U.S. public transportation assets; and (2) award grants for research, development, and demonstration of technologies and methods to reduce and deter terrorist threats or mitigate damages resulting from such attacks. Requires DHS to fund the reasonable costs of an Information Sharing and Analysis Center for Public Transportation. Directs the Secretary to require public transportation agencies that have been determined to be at significant risk of terrorist attack to participate in the ISAC. Encourages other public transportation agencies to participate in the ISAC, without charge of a fee. (Sec. 8) Directs the Secretary to report: (1) to specified congressional committees on the implementation of this Act and on the state of public transportation security in the United States; and (2) to the governor of each State in which a transit agency that has received a grant is operating on the amount of the grant and its use. (Sec. 9) Authorizes appropriations for FY 2005 for: (1) the Capital Security Assistance Program; (2) the Operational Security Assistance Program; (3) intelligence; and (4) research."
