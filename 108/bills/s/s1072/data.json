Sets forth certain requirements for distribution (including in certain cases denial of distribution) of the obligation limitation for Federal-aid highway amounts for specified Federal highway programs, including certain transportation research programs. Provides for the redistribution of any unused obligation limitation on Federal-aid Highways amounts (including certain authorized funds) to the States. Increases the apportionment of Federal-aid highway funds for each fiscal year for the National Highway System to the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. (Sec. 1103) Modifies the amounts authorized for administrative expenses of the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) and the Appalachian Regional Commission in administering specified Federal-aid highway programs through FY 2009. Increases the set-aside of Federal-aid highway funds for metropolitan planning to 1.5 percent. Reauthorizes appropriations for the Alaska Highway through FY 2009. (Sec. 1104) Revises Federal highway funding minimum guarantee provisions to establish the Equity Bonus Program (effectively replacing the Minimum Guarantee Program). Requires the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary), for each of FY 2004 through 2009, to allocate among the States amounts sufficient to ensure that no State: (1) receives a percentage of the total apportionments for the fiscal year for specified Federal-aid highway programs that is less than a specified formulated percentage; (2) before making the allocations, receives a combined total of such allocated amounts, apportionments for specified Federal-aid highway programs, and amounts allocated under this section, that is less than 110 percent of the average for FY 1998 through 2003 of the annual apportionments for the State for certain Federal-aid highway programs; and (3) receives a percentage of apportionments for the fiscal year for specified Federal-aid highway programs that is less than 90.5 percent of the percentage share of the State of estimated tax payments attributable to highway users in the State paid into the HTF in the most recent fiscal year for which data are available. Prohibits metropolitan planning set-aside requirements from applying to such State allocations. Authorizes appropriations from the HTF for FY 2004 through FY 2009. (Sec. 1105) Changes the calculation of Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA). Continues the RABA for FY 2006 and each fiscal year thereafter. Subtitle B: New Programs - (Sec. 1201) Directs the Secretary to establish and implement an infrastructure performance and maintenance program under which a State may obligate funds allocated to the State only for projects eligible under the Interstate Maintenance Program, the NHS Program, the STP, the Highway Safety Improvement Program, the Highway Bridge Program, and the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, that will: (1) preserve, maintain, or otherwise extend, in a cost-effective manner, the useful life of existing highway infrastructure elements; or (2) provide operational improvements (including traffic management and Intelligent Transportation System strategies and limited capacity enhancements) at points of recurring highway congestion. Makes specified funds available for obligation without further appropriation. Directs that funds allocated to a State be obligated within 180 days after the apportionment date. Provides for the redistribution of unallocated funds. (Sec. 1202) Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a complete investigation and study of the current condition and future needs of the U.S. surface transportation system; and (2) develop a conceptual plan, with alternative approaches, for the future. Describes specific issues to be addressed, including the current condition and performance of the Interstate System, and requires the study to be made available to specified congressional committees and to the public. (Sec. 1203) Directs the Secretary to establish a freight transportation gateways program to improve productivity, security, and safety of freight transportation gateways, while mitigating congestion and community impacts. Requires each State to: (1) ensure that intermodal freight transportation, trade facilitation, and economic development needs are adequately considered and fully integrated into the project development process; and (2) designate a freight transportation coordinator. Encourages States and localities to adopt innovative financing strategies for freight transportation gateway improvements. Authorizes a State to obligate funds apportioned to it for publicly-owned intermodal freight transportation projects that provide community and highway benefits by addressing economic, congestion, system reliability, security, safety, or environmental issues associated with freight transportation gateways. Lists eligible projects. Provides for a 90 percent Federal cost share for projects supporting an NHS intermodal freight connection or strategic highway network connector to a strategic military deployment port. Directs States with respect to certain Federal vehicle length limitations to update the list of Federal-aid system highways to which they shall apply to include: (1) strategic highway network connectors to strategic military deployment ports; and (2) NHS intermodal freight connections serving military and commercial truck traffic going to major intermodal terminals. (Sec. 1204) Replaces provisions regarding priority primary routes with a requirement that the Secretary carry out a program for construction of ferry boats and ferry terminal and maintenance facilities, at an 80 percent Federal cost share. Directs the Secretary to give priority in the allocation of Federal-aid highway funds to ferry systems, and public entities responsible for developing ferries, that: (1) carry the greatest number of passengers and vehicles; (2) carry the greatest number of passengers in passenger-only service; or (3) provide critical access to areas that are not well-served by other modes of surface transportation. Authorizes appropriations from the HTF (other than the Mass Transit Account) for each fiscal year. (Sec. 1205) Designates Interstate Highway 86 in New York State, extending from the Pennsylvania border near Lake Erie through Orange County, as the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Interstate Highway. (Sec. 1206) Directs the Administrator of the FHA to collect, and report annually to Congress on, any bid price data that is necessary to make State-by-State comparisons of highway construction costs. Subtitle C: Finance - (Sec. 1301) Modifies provisions regarding determination of the Federal share and increased Federal share applicable to certain Federal-aid highway projects. Authorizes a State to determine a lower Federal share that is otherwise applicable to such projects. Authorizes the Federal share to be increased for projects and activities in each State in which is located nontaxable Indian land, public land (reserved or unreserved), a national forest, or a national park and monument. Provides that the Federal share for such States shall be increased by a percentage of the remaining cost that is equal to the percentage that the area of all such land in a State bears to the total area of the State, but does not exceed 95 percent of the total cost. Directs the Secretary to adjust the Federal share for such States as necessary, based on data provided by the Federal agencies that are responsible for maintaining the data. (Sec. 1302) Authorizes the transfer of: (1) transit funds or transportation planning for highway projects (subject to a limitation), and highway funds or transportation planning for transit projects; (2) funds that are derived from the HTF to another Federal agency under specified circumstances, such as if a State transportation department consents to the transfer of funds; and (3) funds apportioned or allocated to the State to another State, or to the Federal Highway Administration, at the request of a State, for the purpose of funding one or more specific projects. (Sec. 1303) Amends the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) to expand the scope of projects eligible for TIFIA assistance. Allows a group of related projects to be eligible (each of which individually might not meet the threshold requirements to apply for TIFIA credit assistance). Lowers the threshold for eligible projects to $50 million. Allows a project to be eligible when project costs are anticipated to equal or exceed 20 percent of the Federal highway funds apportioned to that State in the most recently completed fiscal year. Provides that the amount of a secured loan shall not exceed the lesser of 33 percent of the reasonably anticipated eligible project costs or the amount of the senior project obligations. Excludes reasonably required financing reserves from interest, with respect to lines of credit. Replaces provisions regarding project servicing with a requirement that the Secretary establish a uniform system to service Federal credit instruments. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) establish fees at a level to cover all or a portion of the costs to the Government of servicing such instruments; (2) appoint a financial entity to assist the Secretary in servicing such instruments; and (3) retain the services of expert firms, including counsel, in the field of municipal and project finance to assist in the underwriting and servicing of such instruments. Reauthorizes appropriations from the HTF through FY 2009, with a limit on administrative costs. Repeals a reporting requirement regarding the financial performance of projects or assistance received. (Sec. 1304) Authorizes the Secretary to provide assistance to any State that is participating in the International Registration Plan and International Fuel Tax Agreement that serves as a base jurisdiction for motor carriers that are domiciled in Mexico, to assist with administrative costs. (Sec. 1305) Establishes the National Commission on Future Revenue Sources to Support the Highway Trust Fund and Finance the Needs of the Surface Transportation System to study alternatives to replace or supplement the fuel tax as the principal revenue source to support the HTF. Authorizes appropriations from the HTF for FY 2004. (Sec. 1306) Amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) to extend the State infrastructure bank program to any State that seeks to establish such a bank. (Sec. 1307) Authorizes the Secretary to undertake a pilot program to demonstrate the advantages of public-private partnerships for critical capital development projects, including highway, bridge, and freight intermodal connector projects. (Sec. 1308) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to repeal provisions: (1) prohibiting a person from engaging in the business or trade of wagering until they have paid a special tax imposed on such wagering; (2) requiring such persons to register with the internal revenue district; and (3) regarding the disclosure of returns and return information with respect to special taxes imposed on wagering. Imposes a $10,000 penalty on persons who are involved in the sale of certain special fuels for which a tax is imposed and who fail to register with the Secretary. Subtitle D: Safety - (Sec. 1401) Replaces provisions regarding the development of a national scenic and recreational highway with a Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), aimed at achieving a significant reduction in traffic fatalities and serious injuries on public roads. Requires that, to receive funds, a State have in effect a State highway safety improvement program under which the State: (1) develops and implements a State strategic highway safety plan that identifies and analyzes highway safety problems and opportunities; (2) produces a program of projects or strategies to reduce identified safety problems; (3) evaluates the plan on a regular basis to ensure the accuracy of the data and priority of proposed improvements; and (4) submits to the Secretary an annual report that describes certain locations in the State as exhibiting the most severe safety needs and contains an assessment of potential remedies to the identified hazardous locations.
