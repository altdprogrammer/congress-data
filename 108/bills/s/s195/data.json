    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on March 5, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Underground Storage Tank Compliance Act of 2003 - (Sec. 2) Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to distribute to States at least 80 percent of the funds authorized to be appropriated under this Act from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund to pay the reasonable costs incurred under cooperative agreements of: (1) certain corrective actions and compensation programs; (2) directly related administrative expenses; or (3) enforcement of State or local requirements regulating underground storage tanks (USTs). Allows undistributed funds to be used for enforcing UST regulations. Provides for allocation and distribution of such funds to States. (Sec. 3) Requires the Administrator or a State with an approved program to require compliance inspections of USTs at least once every two years. (Sec. 4) Directs the Administrator to publish operator training guidelines and States to develop and implement a training strategy consistent with stated requirements. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the use of funds made available for the petroleum response program to carry out corrective actions with respect to methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) releases. (Sec. 6) Authorizes the use of funds for inspections, orders, or enforcement by a State in accordance with State authorities under the petroleum response program acting under an approved prevention and compliance program or similar State requirements or by the Administrator. Requires States to submit to the Administrator implementation reports on State- or local-owned USTs. Provides additional funds to States that develop the reports. Permits the consideration of an owner or operator's violation history when a State or the Administrator enforces compliance. Authorizes a State or the Administrator to prohibit the delivery of regulated substances (motor fuels) to non-compliant tanks. Provides temporary relief for certain tanks in remote locations. Requires States and Indian tribes to maintain a current list of regulated USTs. (Sec. 7) Includes underground storage tank systems and release response activity (as well as underground storage tanks) that are under Federal jurisdiction under the UST control and abatement requirements. Requires implementation reports by any Federal agency responsible for USTs which list the USTs and describe compliance actions. (Sec. 8) Requires the Administrator and Indian Tribes to correct UST releases on Indian lands, treating those posing the greatest threat to human health or the environment first. (Sec. 9) Permits States to establish requirements more stringent than the Federal requirements. (Sec. 10) Authorizes appropriations for FY 2004 through 2008 and 2009."
