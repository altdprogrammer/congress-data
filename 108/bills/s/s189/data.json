    "text": "21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act - (Sec. 2) Requires the President to implement a National Nanotechnology Program to: (1) establish the goals, priorities, and metrics for evaluation for Federal nanotechnology research, development, and other activities; (2) invest in Federal research and development programs in nanotechnology and related sciences to achieve those goals; and (3) provide for interagency coordination of Federal nanotechnology activities undertaken pursuant to the Program. Requires the Program's activities to include: (1) developing a fundamental understanding of matter that enables control and manipulation at the nanoscale; (2) providing grants to investigators; (3) establishing a network of advanced technology user facilities and centers; (4) establishing, on a merit-reviewed and competitive basis, interdisciplinary nanotechnology research centers; (5) ensuring U.S. global leadership in the development and application of nanotechnology; (6) advancing U.S. productivity and industrial competitiveness through investments in long-term scientific and engineering research in nanotechnology; (7) accelerating the deployment and application of nanotechnology research and development in the private sector; (8) encouraging interdisciplinary research and ensuring that processes for solicitation and evaluation of proposals under the Program encourage interdisciplinary projects and collaboration; (9) providing effective education and training for researchers and professionals skilled in the interdisciplinary perspectives necessary for nanotechnology to foster an interdisciplinary research culture; (10) taking specified steps to ensure that ethical, legal, environmental, and other appropriate societal concerns are considered during the development of nanotechnology; and (11) encouraging research on nanotechnology advances that utilize existing processes and technologies. Requires the National Science and Technology Council to oversee the planning, management, and coordination of the Program. Directs the Council to: (1) establish Program goals and priorities; (2) establish Program component areas that reflect such goals and priorities; (3) oversee interagency coordination of the Program including coordination with the activities of the Defense Nanotechnology Research and Development Program and the National Institutes of Health; (4) develop, within 12 months of enactment of this Act, and update every three years thereafter, a strategic plan for the Program; (5) propose a coordinated interagency Program budget to the Office of Management and Budget; (6) exchange information with academic, industry, State and local government, and other appropriate groups conducting research on and using nanotechnology; (7) develop a plan to utilize Federal programs, such as the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer Research Program, in support of activities to accelerate the deployment and application of nanotechnology research and development in the private sector; (8) identify and address research areas that are not addressed adequately by the agencies' current research programs; (9) encourage progress on Program activities through the use of existing facilities and infrastructures; (10) in carrying out the foregoing responsibilities, take into consideration the recommendations of the Advisory Panel established by this Act, suggestions or recommendations developed through public participation, and the views of academic, State, industry, and other appropriate groups conducting research on and using nanotechnology; and (11) prepare an annual report on the Program and submit such report to the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, the House Science Committee, and other appropriate committees. (Sec. 3) Requires the President to establish a National Nanotechnology Coordination Office (NNCO), with a Director and full-time staff, to: (1) provide technical and administrative support to the Council and the Advisory Panel created by this Act; (2) serve as the point of contact on Federal nanotechnology activities; (3) conduct public outreach, including dissemination of Advisory Panel findings and recommendations, as appropriate; and (4) promote access to and early application of the technologies, innovations, and expertise derived from Program activities to agency missions and systems across the Federal Government and to U.S. industry, including startup companies. Requires the NNCO to be funded through funds currently available for interagency funding. Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to report to the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and the House Science Committee on the funding of the NNCO within 90 days of enactment of this Act. (Sec. 4) Requires the President to establish or designate a National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel, composed primarily of members from academic institutions and industry, to advise the President and Council on matters relating to the Program, including an assessment of: (1) trends and developments in nanotechnology science and engineering; (2) progress toward Program implementation; (3) necessary Program revisions; (4) the balance among Program components, including component area funding levels; (5) whether the Program component areas, priorities, and technical goals developed by the Council are helping to maintain U.S. leadership in nanotechnology; (6) the management, coordination, implementation, and activities of the Program; and (7) whether societal, ethical, legal, environmental, and workforce concerns are addressed adequately by the Program. Requires the Advisory Panel to report to the President at least once every two years on such assessments and its recommendations for Program improvements and to transmit copies of each such report to the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, the House Science Committee, and other appropriate committees. Provides travel expenses for non-Federal members of the Advisory Panel. Exempts the Advisory Panel from the sunset provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. (Sec. 5) Requires the Director of the NNCO to enter into an arrangement with the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a triennial evaluation of the Program, including: (1) an evaluation of the Program's technical accomplishments; (2) a review of the Program's management and coordination across agencies and disciplines; (3) a review of funding levels at each agency for the Program's activities; (4) an evaluation of the Program's success in transferring technology to the private sector; (5) an evaluation of whether the Program has successfully fostered interdisciplinary research and development; (6) an evaluation of the extent to which the Program has considered adequately ethical, legal, environmental, and other appropriate societal concerns; (7) recommendations for new or revised Program goals; (8) recommendations for new research areas, partnerships, coordination and management mechanisms, or programs to achieve the Program's stated goals; (9) recommendations on policy, program, and budget changes with respect to nanotechnology research and development; (10) recommendations for improved metrics to evaluate the success of the Program; (11) a review of the performance of the NNCO and its efforts to promote access to and early application of technologies, innovations, and expertise derived from Program activities to agency missions and systems across the Federal Government and U.S. industry; (12) an analysis of the relative position of the United States relative to other nations with respect to nanotechnology research and development; and (13) an analysis of the current impact of nanotechnology on the U.S. economy and recommendations for increasing its future impact. Requires the NRC, as part of the first triennial evaluation, to conduct one-time studies to: (1) determine the technical feasibility of molecular self-assembly for the manufacture of materials and devices at the molecular scale; and (2) assess the need for standards, guidelines, or strategies for ensuring the responsible development of nanotechnology.
