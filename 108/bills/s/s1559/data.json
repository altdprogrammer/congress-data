Authorizes the Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to make awards: (1) to faculty of schools of medicine or osteopathic medicine to support the development of high quality curricula to assist interested individuals in learning the principles and practices of preventing, managing, and controlling tuberculosis; and (2) to support the career development of clinically trained professionals committed to pulmonary infection research. Authorizes the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of NIH to work to develop a tuberculosis vaccine. Requires the John E. Fogarty International Center for Advanced Study in the Health Sciences to carry out an international training program regarding tuberculosis."
