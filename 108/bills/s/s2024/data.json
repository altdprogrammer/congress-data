Requires the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) launch a consumer information program relating to child safety in rollover crashes; (2) submit a report to Congress that evaluates technologies designed to reduce motor vehicle-related injuries and deaths to children and improve the performance of safety belts for four- to eight-year-olds; (3) complete a pending rulemaking to require technologies to prevent the accidental closing of motor vehicle windows by children; and (4) establish a publicly available database that collects information on injuries and deaths in nontraffic, noncrash events involving motor vehicles."
