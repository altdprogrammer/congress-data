Prescribes criminal penalties for falsely certifying compliance with applicable employer standards or for intentionally using information obtained for purposes other than determining suitability for employment as a private security officer.Authorizes: (1) the FBI Director to collect fees to process such background checks; (2) a State to assess a fee on an employer for the costs of administering this Act; and (3) a State to opt out from participation in such background check system."
