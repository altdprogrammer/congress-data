    "text": "Great Lakes Community Restoration Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make grants to local governments of States bordering the Great Lakes (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) for restoring or preventing the deterioration of: (1) coastal resources of national significance or lighthouses that are associated with the Great Lakes System; or (2) the quality of coastal waters in the Great Lakes area. Requires the Secretary to allocate funds among the eligible States based on the mileage of Great Lakes shoreline in each State and the population living along that shoreline. Establishes a four-to-one ratio for the Federal-to-non-Federal share of costs for funded projects."
