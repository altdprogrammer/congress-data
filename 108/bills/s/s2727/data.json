Includes support for instructors of less commonly taught languages among activities of national language and area centers and programs. Makes undergraduate students eligible for fellowships for foreign language and area or international studies (in addition to graduate students under current law). Allows a portion of funds for undergraduate international studies and foreign language programs to be used for subgrants to undergraduate students for educational programs abroad that promote foreign language literacy and cultural knowledge and are closely linked to grant program goals. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to support data collection, analysis, and dissemination that helps achieve part A purposes. Extends and increases the authorization of appropriations for part A."
