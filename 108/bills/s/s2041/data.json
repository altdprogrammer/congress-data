Varies the mandatory pay rate reduction from five percent, if it takes effect in a calendar year that does not immediately follow another calendar year in which a reduction was made, to ten percent, if it takes effect in a calendar year that immediately follows another calendar year in which a reduction was made. Specifies conditions for restoration of the original pay rate, together with otherwise scheduled adjustments. Vests authority in the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to make determinations of whether or not a deficit exists in any fiscal year."
