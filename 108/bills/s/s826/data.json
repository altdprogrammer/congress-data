    "text": "Amends the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 to require the Attorney General to award grants to States, units of local government, Indian tribes, and other organizations to carry out programs to provide short-term housing assistance and related support services to minors, adults, and their dependents: (1) who are homeless, or in need of transitional housing or other housing assistance, as a result of fleeing a situation of domestic violence; and (2) for whom emergency shelter services or other crisis intervention services are unavailable or insufficient. Limits the duration of such assistance to an 18-month period, except that a grant recipient may extend such assistance for an additional six-month period with respect to any minor, adult, or dependent who has been unable to acquire permanent housing despite a good-faith effort to do so."
