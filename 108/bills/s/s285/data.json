(Sec. 105) Requires a project to integrate program services into a single, comprehensive program using an automated clinical information system. Permits funds to be used for the information system. (Sec. 109) Requires the Secretary to cooperate with the Secretaries of Labor, the Interior, Education, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation, and the Attorney General who shall enter into an interdepartmental memorandum of agreement for the implementation of approved plans. Makes the Indian Health Service the coordinating agency (rather than the Bureau of Indian Affairs). (Sec. 110) Prohibits the reduction of Federal funds available to an Indian tribe involved in any project under this title as a result of the enactment of this title. (Sec. 111) Provides for interagency fund transfers. (Sec. 112) Permits commingling of all administrative costs and entitles Indian tribes that carry out a demonstration program to reimbursement of all such costs under the approved plan. Exempts Indian tribe excess administrative funds from Federal audit. (Sec. 114) Requires the Secretary of HHS to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the program and any statutory barriers to services integration. (Sec. 115) Makes any State with an alcohol and substance abuse or mental health program targeted to Indian tribes eligible to receive no-cost Federal personnel assignments if it would help the program's success. Title II: Reauthorization of Certain Indian Alcohol And Substance Abuse Prevention And Treatment Programs - (Sec. 201) Amends the Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1986 to reauthorize appropriations for FY 2004 through 2008 to provide for: (1) technical assistance in the development of a Tribal Action Plan; (2) grants for in-school training programs; (3) publication of an alcohol and substance abuse newsletter; (4) development and implementation of pilot programs to determine the effectiveness of summer youth programs; (5) emergency shelters and halfway houses for emergency care of Indian youth; (6) investigation and control of illegal narcotics traffic on the Tohono O'odham Reservation along the border with Mexico, the St. Regis Band of Mohawk Indians of New York on the St. Regis Reservation along the border with Canada, and the Makah Indian Tribe Reservation of Washington; (7) Bureau of Indian Affairs tribal law enforcement and judicial personnel training in the investigation and prosecution of offenses relating to illegal narcotics and in alcohol and substance abuse prevention and treatment; and (8) juvenile detention centers."
