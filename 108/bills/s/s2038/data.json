Requires a manufacturer of a vaccine that receives Federal authority to distribute such vaccine to provide the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with advance notice of such manufacturer's intent to stop marketplace distribution of the vaccine. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) establish a vaccine manufacturing facilities investment tax credit (20 percent of qualifying property per year) for property placed in service by December 31, 2008; and (2) define \"vaccine manufacturing facilities property.\""
