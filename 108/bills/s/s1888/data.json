Directs the President to certify to Congress that the Government of Saudi Arabia is fully cooperating with the United States in investigating and preventing terrorist attacks, has closed permanently all Saudi-based terror organizations, has ended funding for any offshore terror organization, and has made all efforts to block funding from private Saudi citizens and entities to offshore terror organizations. Requires the President to prohibit certain exports to Saudi Arabia and restrict travel of certain Saudi diplomats if the President cannot certify that the Government of Saudi Arabia has taken the measures required by this Act to combat terrorism. Allows the President to waive such sanctions if the President determines that it is in the national security interest to do so."
