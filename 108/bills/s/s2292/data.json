(Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary of State to report by November 15, 2004, on acts of anti-Semitism around the world, including a description of: (1) acts of physical violence against, or harassment of, Jewish people, and acts of violence against, or vandalism of, Jewish community institutions; (2) governmental responses to such actions, including enactment and enforcement of laws protecting the right to religious freedom of Jewish people, and efforts to promote anti-bias and tolerance education; and (3) governmental and nongovernmental media that attempts to justify or promote violence against Jewish people. (Sec. 5) Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to direct the Secretary to establish within the Department an Office to Monitor and Combat anti-Semitism, to be headed by a Special Envoy for Monitoring and Combating anti-Semitism. States that the Office shall assume primary responsibility for: (1) monitoring and combating foreign acts of anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic incitement; and (2) coordinating and assisting in the preparation of that portion of the reports relating to acts of anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic incitement for inclusion in the annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and in the Annual Report on International Religious Freedom. (Sec. 6) Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, respectively, to include in Department of State annual human rights and religious freedom reports information concerning acts of anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic incitement and governmental responses."
