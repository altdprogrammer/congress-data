Sets forth certain guidance requirements, including training in the proper conduct of a cabin search and explosive recognition. Requires each air carrier to develop a flight and cabin crew training program in accordance with such guidance and submit it to the Administrator for approval. Requires each air carrier, within 180 days after the Administrator approves the air carrier's training program, to complete the training of all flight and cabin crews in accordance with such program."
