However, because action occurred on the measure, the summary has been expanded.)Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2003 - (Sec. 2) Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants or cooperative agreements to an agency or organization capable of operating on a statewide basis (an eligible recipient) to develop coordinated respite care programs. Defines respite care to mean planned or emergency care provided to a child or adult with a special need in order to provide temporary relief to the family caregiver of such child or adult.Instructs the Secretary to work cooperatively with existing Federal respite program officers to ensure coordination of services for family caregivers. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants or cooperative agreements to eligible recipients who submit an application containing certain information, including: (1) the extent and nature of the respite care needs of the population; and (2) how the proposed respite care activities will make use of other Federal, State, and local funds, programs, and other resources.Directs the Secretary to establish a review panel to make recommendations on applicants. Gives priority to applicants with the greatest likelihood of implementing or enhancing lifespan respite care statewide.Requires grant funds to be used for the development of lifespan respite care at the State and local levels (unless such a program already exists). Defines lifespan respite care as a system of accessible, community-based respite care services. Permits the use of funds for respite care services and training programs once a statewide program is in place and evaluated. Limits grants to five years. Permits a grant to be renewed. Requires funding to supplement, not supplant, existing government funds. Authorizes appropriations.Directs the Secretary to provide for the establishment of a National Resource Center on Lifespan Respite Care to maintain a national database and provide training, technical assistance, and information. Authorizes appropriations."
