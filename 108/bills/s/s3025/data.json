Amends the Violence Protection Act of 2000 to: (1) include a country's efforts to reduce international sex tourism within its borders among the criteria for determining whether a country is taking serious steps to eliminate trafficking in human beings; and (2) state that nothing in such Act shall be construed to require any federally-funded nongovernmental organization that investigates foreign trafficking activities to notify foreign governments or targets of such investigation's funding source."
