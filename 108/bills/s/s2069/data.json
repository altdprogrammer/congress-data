Provides for S nonimmigrant status for specified family members of such aliens in appropriate circumstances. Increases the numerical limitation on S nonimmigrant visas to 3,500 per fiscal year. Establishes a Weapons of Mass Destruction Informant Center within the Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection of the Department of Homeland Security, which shall : (1) receive and report to specified Federal agencies all information provided by aliens granted S nonimmigrant status under this Act; (2) ensure that aliens who have provided WMD-related information are given the highest consideration for S nonimmigrant visas; (3) educate consular officers and immigration inspectors and examiners regarding the expanded visa classification; (4) facilitate, receive, and evaluate visa requests submitted pursuant to this Act and facilitate the issuance of visas when requests are approved; (5) facilitate the cooperation with the U.S. Government of aliens receiving WMD-related S nonimmigrant visas; (6) ensure that aliens who receive such visas comply with visa terms; and (7) ensure that such visas are not used to gain entry into the U.S. for purposes other than those outlined in this Act."
