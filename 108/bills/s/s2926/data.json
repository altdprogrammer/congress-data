    "text": "Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2004 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business tax credit for up to 50 percent of qualified remediation expenditures for contaminated sites (property used in a trade or business on which there has been a release (or threat of release) or disposal of any hazardous substance) in certain poverty-rated areas. Defines \"qualified remediation expenditures\" as expenditures for: (1) the abatement or control of any hazardous substance, petroleum, or any petroleum by-product at a contaminated site in accordance with a State-approved remediation and redevelopment plan; (2) the complete demolition of a structure; (3) the removal and disposal of property; and (4) the reconstruction of utilities on a contaminated site. Requires States to allocate credit amounts under an allocation plan that considers specified criteria, including: (1) poverty rates: (2) location of a contaminated site; and (3) the amount of new employment expected to result from redevelopment. Imposes a ceiling on the State environmental remediation credit and limits the national environmental remediation credit for each calendar year to $1 billion. Sets forth special rules for: (1) allocating unused environmental remediation credit carryover amounts among States: (2) adjusting the limitation on the national environmental remediation credit for inflation; (3) assigning portions of the credit; and (4) recapturing credit amounts if a taxpayer fails to properly complete environmental remediation under a State approved remediation and redevelopment plan."
