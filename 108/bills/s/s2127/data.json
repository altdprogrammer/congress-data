(Sec. 4) Expresses the sense of Congress respecting specified steps to improve stabilization and reconstruction activities. (Sec. 5) Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to furnish assistance and permit the export of goods and services to assist in stabilizing and reconstructing a country or region that is in, or is in transition from, conflict or civil strife. Authorizes: (1) $100 million for such assistance; and (2) appropriations as necessary to replenish such initial authorization. (Sec. 6) Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to direct the Secretary of State to establish within the Department of State an Office of International Stabilization and Reconstruction, to be headed by a Coordinator. Sets forth Office functions, including: (1) monitoring political and economic instability, and planning for stabilization and reconstruction responses: (2) developing interagency coordination; (3) identifying appropriate State, local, and private sector personnel; and (4) coordinating joint military-civilian planning. (Sec. 7) Authorizes: (1) the Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of USAID, to establish a Response Readiness Corps (up to 250 personnel to serve in the Corps, and such other personnel as the Secretary may designate from the Department of State and USAID) to provide stabilization and reconstruction activities in foreign countries or regions that are in, or are in transition from, conflict or civil strife; and (2) the Secretary to establish a Response Readiness Reserve of Federal and non-Federal personnel to augment the Corps. Directs the Secretary to report on efforts to establish the Response Readiness Corps and the Response Readiness Reserve. (Sec. 8) Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to authorize the Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army, to establish a stabilization and reconstruction curriculum for use in programs of the Foreign Service Institute, the National Defense University, and the United States Army War College. (Sec. 9) States that service in stabilization and reconstruction operations overseas, membership in the Response Readiness Corps, and education and training in the stabilization and reconstruction curriculum should be considered among the favorable factors for promotion of employees of executive agencies. Authorizes the creation of incentives and benefits to recognize and reward participants. (Sec. 10) Sets forth personnel provisions. (Sec. 11) Authorizes appropriations for personnel, education and training, equipment, and travel costs. Obligates amounts for the Office of International Stabilization and Reconstruction."
