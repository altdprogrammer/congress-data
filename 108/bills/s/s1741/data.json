Prescribes requirements for appraisal of such property at fair market value to determine the rent. Requires the renovation and modification of the Pavilion Annex to be carried out by the Museum Sponsor and to: (1) be commenced as soon as practicable but within five years after the execution of the occupancy agreement date; (2) sever the walkway to the Old Post Office Building; and (3) enhance and improve the Pavilion Annex consistent with the needs of the Museum and the adjacent structures. Credits any expenses incurred by the Museum Sponsor for such renovation and modification against the first rent payment due five years after the execution of the occupancy agreement date. Provides that, if the Administrator is unable to fully execute an occupancy agreement within 120 days of the enactment of this Act, then within 30 days thereafter, the Administrator shall report to specified congressional committees a summary of remaining unresolved issues. Declares that nothing in this Act limits the authority of the National Capital Planning Commission."
