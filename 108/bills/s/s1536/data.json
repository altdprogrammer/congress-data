Includes lawful spouses, as specified. Sets forth documentation, petition, determination, and payment procedures. States that such payments do not create or admit any claim or constitute income for income tax, supplemental security income benefits, and other purposes. Prohibits the assignment or transfer of rights under this title. Limits petitions to one per victim. Terminates the program after five years. Excludes payments from consideration as compensation or reimbursement for a loss as it concerns insurance or worker's compensation."
