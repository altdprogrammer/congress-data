    "text": "Telemarketing Intrusive Practices Act of 2003 - Directs the Federal Trade Commission to: (1) establish and maintain for each State a list of consumers who request not to receive telephone sales calls; (2) provide notice to consumers of the establishment of such list; (3) contract with a State to establish and maintain the lists; (4) contract with a private vendor to establish and maintain the lists, if the vendor has maintained a national listing of consumers who request not to receive such calls; and (5) and charge a reasonable fee for providing the list. Requires a telephone solicitor to maintain a list of consumers who request not to receive telephone sales calls from that particular telephone solicitor. Prohibits a telephone solicitor from knowingly using any method to block or otherwise circumvent the use of a caller identification service or device by a consumer. States that a violation of this Act is an unfair or deceptive trade practice of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Permits a private right of action in State court for an action to enjoin a violation of this Act."
