Authorizes the IG to commence investigations. Requires the IG and other Inspector Generals in the intelligence community to mutually cooperate in the performance of their respective duties. Authorizes the IG to report to the President, DCI, or head of any element of the intelligence community on investigations conducted by the IG, as appropriate. Requires the IG to: (1) submit to the Attorney General a report on information, allegations, or complaints received by the IG regarding violations of Federal criminal law that involve intelligence community programs or operations; and (2) submit biannual reports on the activities of the IG and Office to the congressional intelligence committees."
