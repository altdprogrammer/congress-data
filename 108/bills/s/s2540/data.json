    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2004-06-17", 
    "text": "Educational Radio Protection Act - States that a qualifying educational FM radio station is entitled, upon application by the station's licensee, to: (1) have its license be subject to the same license terms and renewal standards (other than fees) as licenses for full-power class A FM radio stations; and (2) have its licensee accorded primary status as a radio broadcaster so long as the station remains a qualifying FM radio station. Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide written notice of the provisions of this Act to specified licensees of Class D FM radio stations. Prohibits the FCC from awarding or assigning to commercial FM radio stations any portion of the radio spectrum assigned to qualifying educational FM radio stations for which an application is submitted within one year of enactment of this Act and approved. Requires the FCC to restore to educational stations whose applications are successful and not subject to appeal any portion of educational station spectrum previously awarded to commercial stations if the previous award occurred after April 30, 2004, and before the educational station's application was approved."
