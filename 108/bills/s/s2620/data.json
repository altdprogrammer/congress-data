Requires the EPA Administrator to develop school site acquisition guidelines that: (1) take into account the special vulnerability of children to chemical exposure where the potential for site contamination is assessed; (2) include an analysis of means for maximizing transportation choices. Requires the EPA Administrator, in partnership with the Secretary of Education, to carry out an education research program in support of the education-related provisions of this Act. Directs the Comptroller General to review the budget process and develop and submit to Congress an implementation plan for life-cycle costing that identifies and incorporates cost savings that accrue from high-performance green buildings. Requires the Office to establish guidelines for, and carry out, specified demonstration projects at Federal buildings and universities to contribute to the research goals of the Office."
