    "text": "Uniting Neighborhoods and Individuals To Eliminate Racial Profiling Act (UNITE Act) - Prohibits any Federal, State, or local law enforcement agent or agency from engaging in racial profiling. Requires Federal law enforcement agencies to: (1) cease practices that encourage racial profiling; and (2) maintain policies and procedures designed to eliminate racial profiling, including educational training on racial profiling as part of Federal law enforcement training, procedures for responding meaningfully to complaints alleging racial profiling, and procedures to discipline Federal agents who engage in racial profiling. Establishes within the Department of Justice (DOJ) the National Task Force on Racial Profiling to oversee State-based administrative complaint procedures and to establish an education and awareness program. Requires: (1) each State and local law enforcement agency that desires funds under any DOJ-administered grant program to certify that it is developing and implementing a plan to to eliminate racial profiling that meets specified requirements; and (2) each State that desires funding to establish and maintain specified State-based administrative complaint procedures. Authorizes the Attorney General, through the Bureau of Justice Assistance, to make grants to State and local law enforcement agencies to assist them in developing programs to eliminate racial profiling."
