Directs the Administrator to establish an Asbestos Policies Panel to study asbestos and other durable fibers. Directs the Administrator to study the status of the manufacture, processing, distribution, ownership, importation, and disposal of asbestos-containing products and contaminant-asbestos products. Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations within one year which prohibit the manufacturing, processing, or distributing of asbestos-containing products, subject to limited exemption upon petition. Requires the disposal of asbestos-containing products within three years, except as specified. Requires the Administrator to establish a public awareness program concerning the dangers posed by these products and vermiculite insulation. Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expand research programs on diseases caused by asbestos exposure, particularly mesothelioma, asbestosis, and pleural injuries. Establishes and funds mesothelioma disease research and treatment centers."
