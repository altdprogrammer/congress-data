Requires that 95 percent of the proceeds of such bonds be used for the construction, acquisition, rehabilitation, expansion, or operating expenses of Indian tribal prison facilities and that the term of such bonds not exceed ten years. Establishes a national limitation for Indian tribal prison facility bonds in 2005 through 2007, with no limitation after 2007. Allows a carryover of unused bond limitation amounts to succeeding calendar years. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to allocate bond amounts to Indian tribes based upon specified criteria, including overcrowding, the condition of existing facilities, the health and safety of both inmates and prison employees, and other financial resources available to an Indian tribe."
