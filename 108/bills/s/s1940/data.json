    "text": "(NOTE - S.1940 & S.1483, unlike H.R.2210, do not provide for State demonstration programs that allow States to administer their allotment of Federal Head Start funds.) Head Start Improvements for School Readiness Act - Amends the Head Start Act (the Act) to revise and reauthorize Head Start programs. (Sec. 2) Includes educational instruction in prereading skills, pre-mathematics skills, and language among the services to be provided through Head Start programs. (Sec. 3) Sets forth definitions of a homeless child and a limited English proficient (LEP) child. (Sec. 4) Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to provide financial assistance to Head Start agencies for five-year periods. (Sec. 5) Authorizes appropriations for Head Start programs, with specified amounts for research, demonstration, and evaluation activities, including longitudinal studies and impact studies. (Sec. 6) Revises requirements for allotment, and limitations on use, of Head Start funds. Requires the following minimum portions of total funds to be reserved for the following covered programs: (1) four percent of funds for Indian programs; and (2) five percent for migrant and seasonal programs. Modifies such minimum requirements if they reduce the total number of children receiving Head Start services. (Such covered programs reservations are part of the 13 percent reservation from total funds, which is set aside for not only Indian programs and migrant and seasonal programs, but also for services for children with disabilities, territorial programs, training and technical assistance, discretionary payments, and research, demonstration, and evaluation.) Distributes the two percent of funds reserved for training and technical assistance activities as follows: (1) 50 percent to Head Start agencies for complying with specified quality standards and transportation safety regulations, and for certain other uses; and (2) 50 percent to the Secretary support a regional or State system of early childhood education training and technical assistance and to assist local programs in meeting certain quality standards. Reduces from 60 percent to 50 percent the portion of any remaining funds the Secretary must reserve for quality improvement in each of FY 2005 through FY 2009. Includes among quality improvement goals, providing: (1) adequate numbers of qualified staff, with adequate training in developing language skills, pre-mathematics skills, and prereading, and in working with LEP children, children referred by child welfare services, and children with disabilities; (2) salary scales and benefits adequate to attract and retain qualified staff; (3) salary increases for specified purposes; (4) collaboration to increase program participation by underserved populations of eligible children; (5) assistance to complete postsecondary coursework including scholarships or other financial incentives, such as differential and merit pay, to enable Head Start teachers to improve competencies and the resulting child outcomes; and (6) promotion of regular attendance and stability of all Head Start children, especially highly mobile children, including children from migrant and seasonal farmworking families, homeless children, and children in foster care. Revises quality improvement activities to include: (1) prereading development; (2) helping LEP children attain certain knowledge, skills, and development and promoting English language acquisition by such children and families; (3) education and training to improve staff qualifications, particularly assistance to instructors to reach full competency and meet degree requirements under this Act, and support for staff training, child counseling, and other services to address the challenges of children participating in programs, including those from immigrant, refugee, and asylee families, those from families in crisis, those experiencing chronic violence in their communities, and those experiencing substance abuse in their families; (4) outreach to homeless families to increase program participation of eligible homeless children; and (5) outreach to migrant and seasonal farmworking families and families with LEP children. Changes from discretionary to mandatory the Secretary's authority to award grants to assist collaboration among State early childhood education activities under Head Start and other activities carried out in and by the State to benefit low-income children and families, and by Head Start agencies with other State and local planning, resource, and referral agencies. Requires distribution of any remaining funds available, after all mandatory reservations and allotments, as follows: (1) 65 percent, with priority to grant recipients in States serving the smallest percentages of eligible children; and (2) 35 percent, on a competitive basis. Requires collaboration grants to be used to: (1) encourage Head Start agencies to collaborate with entities involved in State and local planning processes to better meet the needs of low-income families and children from birth to school entry; (2) encourage Head Start agencies to coordinate activities with the State agency responsible for administering the State program carried out under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 and entities providing resources and referral services in the State to make full-working-day and full calendar year services available to children; (3) promote alignment of Head Start services with State early learning and school readiness goals and standards; (4) promote better linkages between Head Start agencies and other child and family agencies, including agencies that provide health, mental health, or family services, or other child or family supportive services; and (5) carry out the activities of the State Director of Head Start Collaboration.

Requires regulations to ensure appropriate supervision and background checks of individuals with whom Head Start agencies contract to transport children. Directs the Secretary to conduct annual consultations with tribal governments operating Head Start and Early Head Start programs in each affected Head Start region (under provisions to continue the administrative arrangement responsible for meeting the needs of children of migrant and seasonal farmworkers and Indian children and to assure appropriate funds are provided to meet such needs).
