Revises SSA title III (Grants to States for Unemployment Compensation Administration) to require State unemployment compensation laws, as a condition of State eligibility for such grants, to provide for transfer of unemployment experience upon transfer or acquisition of a business. Directs the Secretary of Labor to study and report to Congress on State implementation of such requirement. Revises SSA title IV part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to disclose information on individuals and their employers in the National Directory of New Hires to a State agency that, for purposes of administering a Federal or State unemployment compensation law, transmits such individuals' names and Social Security account numbers to the Secretary. Requires such disclosure only to the extent that it would not interfere with effective operation of the part D program."
