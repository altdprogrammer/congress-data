    "text": "Rail Transportation Security Act - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to assess the security risks associated with freight and intercity passenger rail transportation and develop prioritized recommendations for: (1) improving the security of rail infrastructure and other areas identified as posing significant rail-related risks to public safety and the movement of interstate commerce; (2) deploying chemical and biological weapon detection equipment; (3) training employees in terrorism response activities; and (4) identifying immediate and long-term economic impact of measures that may be required to address those risks. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to review existing Department of Transportation (DOT) rail regulations to identify areas in which those regulations need to be revised to improve rail safety and security. Directs the Comptroller General to carry out a study of the rail passenger transportation security programs in Japan, member nations of the European Union, and other foreign countries in order to identify effective rail transportation security measures in use in those foreign rail transportation systems, including innovative measures and screening procedures determined effective. Directs the Secretary to: (1) study the cost and feasibility of requiring security screening for all passengers, baggage, mail, express, and other cargo on Amtrak trains; and (2) conduct a pilot program of random security screening of passengers and baggage at a specified number of the busiest passenger rail stations served by Amtrak. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2005 for Amtrak for certain life safety and infrastructure upgrades at specified tunnels."
