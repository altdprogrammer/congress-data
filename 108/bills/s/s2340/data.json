Revises accountability and evaluation. Revises II-B to require equitable distribution of grant and contract awards. Includes among permissible uses of funds teacher preparation in: (1) use and application of universally designed technologies and of assistive technology devices and services; and (2) maximizing access for students with disabilities to participate in the general education curriculum through use of such technology. Directs the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to eligible institutions to establish centers for excellence, under II-C, to ensure that current and future teachers are highly qualified."
