Requires certification of a bargaining representative without election if a majority of the bargaining unit employees have authorized designation of the representative and there is no other individual or labor organization so designated by 30 percent or more of the employees. Repeals the requirement for a secret ballot vote on rescission of the authority of a collective bargaining agreement upon petition by 30 percent or more of covered bargaining unit employees."
