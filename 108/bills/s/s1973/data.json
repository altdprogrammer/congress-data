    "text": "Wireless 411 Privacy Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a provider of commercial mobile services, or any affiliate or agent of such provider (provider), from including the wireless telephone number of any current subscriber in any wireless directory assistance service (WDAS) database unless the provider: (1) provides a conspicuous, separate notice to the subscriber of the right not be listed in any WDAS; and (2) obtains express prior listing authorization from such subscriber, and that authorization has not been withdrawn. Allows a provider to include the wireless telephone information of any new subscriber in a WDAS only if the provider provides: (1) a conspicuous, separate notice to the subscriber, at the time of entering into a service agreement and at least once a year thereafter, of the right not to be listed in any WDAS; and (2) the subscriber with convenient mechanisms to decline or refuse to participate in any WDAS. Allows a provider to connect a calling party from a WDAS to a commercial mobile service subscriber only if: (1) the subscriber is provided prior notice of the calling party's identity and is permitted to accept or reject each call; (2) the subscriber's wireless telephone number information is not disclosed to the calling party; and (3) the subscriber is not an unlisted commercial mobile service subscriber. Prohibits a provider from charging a subscriber for the exercise of any rights under this Act."
