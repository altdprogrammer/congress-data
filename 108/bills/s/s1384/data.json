Requires the Secretary to conduct a study for a project with an estimated total cost of at least $50 million to determine: (1) if a toll facility for such project is feasible; and (2) if privatizing the construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility is financially advisable (while retaining legal and administrative control of the portion of the Interstate route)."
