Subtitle B: Intelligence - (Sec. 312) Amends the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 to increase the threshold amounts for projects for the construction or improvement of a facility used primarily by intelligence community (IC) personnel that must be specifically listed in the President's budget and specifically authorized by Congress. Allows vital or urgent projects to be carried out seven (currently 21) days after notification to the intelligence committees. Allows a project to begin on the date the notification is received if the DCI and the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) jointly determine that: (1) an emergency exists with respect to national security or the protection of health, safety, or environmental quality; and (2) any delay in the commencement of the project would harm any or all of those interests. (Sec. 313) Permits the use of funds designated for intelligence purposes for assistance to the Government of Columbia for: (1) supporting a campaign against narcotics trafficking and against activities by designated terrorist organizations; and (2) protecting human health and welfare in emergency circumstances, including rescue operations.

Prohibits the participation of U.S. armed forces or contractor personnel in any combat operation in connection with such assistance, except for self-defense or rescue purposes. (Sec. 314) Requires the DCI to carry out pilot programs of the feasibility of: (1) permitting IC analysts to access and analyze intelligence from other IC elements, including NSA signals intelligence; and (2) training students for employment as intelligence analysts.

Subtitle D: Reports - (Sec. 331) Requires the DCI and the Secretary to jointly report to specified congressional committees on: (1) national security risks of current computer security practices within elements of the IC and DOD; and (2) the utility and effectiveness of current Federal security background investigations and security clearance procedures. (Sec. 333) Requires the heads of IC elements to jointly report to the intelligence, armed services, and judiciary committees on means of improving the detail or transfer of civilian intelligence personnel between and among various IC elements in order to enhance the flexibility and effectiveness of the IC in responding to changes in requirements for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence. (Sec. 334) Requires the President to report to the intelligence, homeland security, and armed services committees on current policy and regulation impediments to the sharing of classified information across and among Federal departments and agencies, and between Federal departments and agencies and agencies of State and local government and the private sector, for national security purposes, including homeland security.

(Sec. 339) Repeals various intelligence-related report requirements under the National Security Act of 1947, prior intelligence authorization Acts, and other intelligence-related Acts. Subtitle E: Other Matters - (Sec. 351) Amends the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 to extend to a conditional date the suspension of the reorganization of the Diplomatic Telecommunications Service Program Office. (Sec. 352) Amends the Federal criminal code to include a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or other friendly military force who is present in the United States under military orders for training, under an authorized military purpose, or in cooperation with the DCI among those to whom explosive materials may be distributed, possessed, or received in furtherance of such purposes. (Sec. 353) Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide for the naturalization of a person affiliated with the Communist or other totalitarian party if the DCI, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Homeland Security (currently, only with the concurrence of the Attorney General), determines such person has made a contribution to the national security or national intelligence mission of the United States. (Sec. 355) Directs the National Science Foundation and the Office of Science and Technology Policy to jointly sponsor not less than two workshops on the coordination of Federal research on the use of behavioral, psychological, and physiological assessments of individuals in the conduct of security evaluations. Requires such activities to be completed by March 1, 2004. Establishes an interagency advisory group to assist with such coordination. Requires a joint report from the Foundation and Office to Congress. Earmarks funds authorized under this Act for such purposes. Title IV: Central Intelligence Agency - (Sec. 402) Protects CIA personnel authorized to act as special police or to carry firearms, and NSA employees performing special police functions, from tort liability when reasonably acting within the scope of their employment to: (1) protect an individual from a crime of violence; (2) provide immediate assistance to an individual who has suffered or is threatened with bodily harm; or (3) prevent the escape of any individual reasonably believed to have committed a crime of violence in the presence of such personnel. Title V: Department of Defense Intelligence Matters - (Sec. 501) Authorizes the NSA Director to exempt NSA operational files from Federal disclosure requirements. Includes as \"operational files\" files of the Signals Intelligence Directorate and Research Associate Directorate containing the means by which foreign intelligence or counterintelligence is collected through technical systems. Allows limited search and review of such files under specified circumstances. Allows judicial review when a person alleges that the NSA has improperly withheld records under such exemption, with specified exceptions. Requires the NSA Director and the DCI, at least every ten years, to conduct a review to determine whether any exemptions may be removed from a category of files. Requires DCI approval of any determination to remove an exemption."
