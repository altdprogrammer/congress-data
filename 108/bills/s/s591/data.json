    "text": "Moment of Quiet Reflection in Schools Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to require each local educational agency (LEA), if it receives ESEA funds, to ensure that the teacher in charge of each classroom in each school served by the LEA conducts a brief period of quiet reflection for not more than 60 seconds with the participation of all the students assembled in the classroom, at the opening of school on every school day.Prohibits such period from being conducted as a religious service or exercise. Requires such period to be considered as an opportunity for a moment of silent reflection on the anticipated activities of the day.Declares that this Act shall not be construed as prohibiting or restricting constitutionally protected prayer.Requires LEAs, as a condition of receiving ESEA funds, to certify in writing to their State that they are in compliance with this Act."
