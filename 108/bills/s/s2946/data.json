Directs the Internal Revenue Service to implement an educational program to ensure awareness of the tax credit for employee health insurance expenses. Authorizes appropriations for general business loans under the Small Business Act for FY 2005 through 2007. Provides for an inflation adjustment for authorized loan amounts after FY 2007. Establishes new limits for individual small business loans. Extends until taxable year 2008 provisions allowing an increased tax deduction (up to $100,000) for small business assets in the year such assets are placed in service."
