    "text": "Judicially Enforceable Terrorism Subpoenas Act of 2004 - Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the Attorney General, in any investigation concerning a Federal crime of terrorism, to subpoena the production of relevant records or materials or testimony by the custodian concerning those materials. Provides that attendance of witnesses and the production of records may be required from any place subject to U.S. jurisdiction at a designated hearing place, except that a witness may not be required to appear at any hearing more than 500 miles from the place where the subpoena is served. Authorizes the Attorney General, under specified circumstances, to invoke the aid of any U.S. court with jurisdiction to compel compliance with the subpoena. Limits disclosure regarding the receipt of a subpoena or the provision of records if the Attorney General certifies that otherwise a danger to national security may result. Sets forth provisions regarding judicial review and immunity from civil liability for compliance with this Act."
