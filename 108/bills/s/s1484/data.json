Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of funds by those agencies on the procurement of or access to any commercially available database unless that report has been submitted within 60 days. Sets forth report requirements, including information on contracts entered into for the use of, access to, or analysis of databases that were obtained from a nonfederal entity for specified purposes.. Prohibits any Government entity, officer, or employee from conducting a search or other analysis of a database for national security, intelligence, or law enforcement purposes based solely on a hypothetical scenario or supposition of who may commit a crime or pose a threat to national security."
