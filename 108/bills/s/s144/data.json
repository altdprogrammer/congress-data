    "text": "Noxious Weed Control and Eradication Act of 2004 - Amends the Plant Protection Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a grant program to provide financial and technical assistance to weed management entities to control or eradicate noxious weeds. Sets forth criteria for making grants to weed management entities and for the selection for funding of weed eradication projects. Directs the Secretary to give special consideration to States with approved weed management entities established by Indian tribes. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with weed management entities for funding of weed eradication activities that take into consideration various factors, including: (1) the severity of the noxious weeds problem or potential problem; (2) the likelihood that the activities will prevent or resolve the weed problem or increase knowledge about resolving similar problems; (3) the extent to which the activities will provide a comprehensive approach to the control or eradication of noxious weeds; (4) the extent to which the activities will improve the overall capacity of the United States to address noxious weed problems; and (5) the extent to which the activities promote cooperation and participation between States that have a common interest in controlling and eradicating noxious weeds. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a cooperative agreement with weed management entities to enable rapid response to outbreaks of noxious weeds. States that the assistance authorized under this Act is meant to supplement, and not replace, other assistance available for control or eradication of harmful, invasive weeds on public and private lands. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2005 through 2009. Limits funding for administrative costs to five percent of available funds."
