Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) provide technical guidance and assistance to small publicly owned treatment works (those serving a population of fewer than 20,000 persons) on conducting vulnerability assessments and implementing security enhancements; and (2) make grants to a nonprofit organization to improve vulnerability self-assessment methodologies and tools for publicly owned treatment works, including those that are part of a combined wastewater treatment and water supply system. Requires the Administrator to research and review means by which terrorists could carry out harmful intentional acts against these works and alternative processes for conveying, treating, and disposing of wastewater in the event of destruction or disruption. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2004 through 2008."
