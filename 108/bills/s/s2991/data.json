    "text": "New Shipper Review Amendment Act of 2004 - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 with respect to reviews by the administering authority to establish an individual weighted average dumping margin or an individual countervailing duty rate (as the case may be) for a new exporter or producer that: (1) did not export to the United States the merchandise that was the subject of an antidumping duty or countervailing duty order during the investigation period; and (2) was not affiliated with any exporter or producer who did. Suspends for three years the requirement that the administering authority direct the Customs Service to allow, at the option of the importer of such merchandise, the posting, until completion of the review, of a bond or security in lieu of a cash deposit for each entry of the subject merchandise (bonding privileges). Requires the Secretary of the Treasury, the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection to report on: (1) recommendations concerning extension of the suspension period; and (2) assessments of the effectiveness of any administrative measures taken to address the difficulties giving rise to this Act, including problems collecting antidumping duties from new shippers, administrative burdens imposed on the Department of Commerce by new shipper reviews, and the use of the bonding privilege by importers from new shippers to circumvent the effect of antidumping duty orders."
