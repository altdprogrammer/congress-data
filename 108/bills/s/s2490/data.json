    "text": "Ballast Water Management Act of 2004 - Amends the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 to revise certain aquatic invasive species prevention requirements to: (1) apply them to certain U.S. vessels and to certain foreign vessels that are en route to, or have departed from, a U.S. port; and (2) establish ballast water and sediment management standards for vessels of the armed forces. Prohibits, with specified exceptions, a person from uptaking or discharging ballast water and sediment from a U.S. vessel operating in U.S. or non-U.S. waters. Requires a vessel to conduct all its ballast water management operations in accordance with a ballast water management plan that meets the requirements prescribed and approved by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. Requires a vessel before discharging ballast water into U.S. waters to conduct ballast water treatment so that the discharged ballast water will contain no more than a specified level of living organisms or microbes. Prohibits an operator of a vessel, until the vessel conducts such treatment, from uptaking or discharging ballast water unless the operator conducts a ballast water exchange in a manner that results in an efficiency of at least 95 percent volumetric exchange of the ballast water for each ballast water tank. Sets forth certain certification procedures with respect to vessel ballast water management plans and equipment used for ballast water and sediment management. Sets forth civil penalties for persons who violate the requirements of this Act. Urges the Secretary to negotiate with foreign countries to develop and implement an international program for preventing the unintentional introduction and spread of nonindigenous species."
