Authorizes the Tribe or the Environmental Commission established by the Tribe and the State of Colorado to bring a civil action for declaratory or injunctive relief or other enforcement orders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado if any person fails to comply with a final civil order of the Tribe or Commission under specified air quality provisions. Retains the right of any individual to seek injunctive relief to immediately restrain a pollution source which is presenting an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare under the emergency powers provision of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Provides for appellate review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit of any decision by the Commission that would be subject to review if made by the Administrator. States that nothing in this Act modifies the CAA, specified law concerning tribal boundaries and jurisdiction, or related administrative rules or affects or influences past or prospective judicial interpretations of such laws."
