Directs that procedures established under this section provide, at a minimum, for: (1) notifying security personnel that a child is missing; (2) obtaining a detailed description of the child; (3) issuing a Code Adam alert and providing a description of the child using a fast and effective means of communication; (4) establishing a central point of contact; (5) monitoring all points of egress from the building while such alert is in effect; (6) conducting a thorough search of the building; (7) contacting local law enforcement; and (8) documenting the incident.Subtitle E: Child Advocacy Center Grants - (Sec. 381) Amends the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 to extend through FY 2004 and 2005 the authorization of appropriations under such Act.Title IV: Sentencing Reform - (Sec. 401) Requires a court, in sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense involving a minor victim, to impose a sentence within the Federal sentencing guidelines range for that offense unless the court finds that: (1) there exists an aggravating circumstance of a kind or to a degree not adequately taken into consideration by the U.S. Sentencing Commission (Commission) in formulating its guidelines that should result in a sentence greater than that described; (2) there exists a mitigating circumstance of a kind or to a degree that has been affirmatively and specifically identified in the sentencing guidelines or policy statements as a permissible ground of downward departure (imposition of a sentence below the range established by such guidelines) taking into account any amendments to such guidelines or policy statements by Congress, has not been taken into consideration by the Commission in formulating its guidelines, and should result in a different sentence; or (3) the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person that should result in a sentence lower than that described. Requires a court, in determining whether a circumstance was adequately taken into consideration, to consider only the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the Commission, together with any amendments thereto by act of Congress.Amends the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to allow a sentencing court to impose a sentence below the authorized range only if the court finds that there is a mitigating circumstance of a kind or to a degree that: (1) has been affirmatively and specifically identified as a permissible ground of downward departure in the sentencing guidelines or policy statements, taking into account any amendments thereto by act of Congress; (2) has not been adequately taken into consideration by the Commission in formulating its guidelines; and (3) should result in a sentence different from that described.

Directs the Commission: (1) upon request, to make available to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees the written reports and all underlying records accompanying those reports, as well as other records received from courts; and (2) to submit to Congress at least annually an analysis of these documents, any recommendations for legislation that the Commission concludes is warranted by that analysis, and an accounting of those districts that the Commission believes have not submitted the appropriate information and documents required.Considers a defendant to have engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct if, on at least two separate occasions, such defendant engaged in such conduct with a minor. (Current law requires such conduct on at least two separate occasions with at least two different minors.)Provides for specified offense level increases if the offense involved: (1) material that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence (up four levels); and (2) specified numbers of images (up from two to five levels).Requires the Attorney General to report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees: (1) not later than 15 days after a district court's grant of a downward departure in any case other than one involving such a departure for substantial assistance to authorities, setting forth the case, the facts involved, the identity of the district court judge, the district court's stated reasons, whether the court provided the United States with advance notice of its intention to depart, the position of the parties with respect to the departure, and whether the United States has filed or intends to file a motion for reconsideration; and (2) not later than five days after the Solicitor General decides whether to authorize an appeal of the departure, informing the committees of the decision and the basis for it.Requires the Commission to review the grounds of downward departure authorized by the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary, and promulgate: (1) appropriate amendments to ensure that the incidence of downward departures are substantially reduced; (2) a policy statement authorizing a downward departure of not more than four levels if the government files a motion for such departure pursuant to an authorized early disposition program; and (3) any other necessary conforming amendments.Title V: Obscenity and Pornography - Subtitle A: Child Obscenity and Pornography Prevention - (Sec. 502) Allows as an affirmative defense to the charge of virtual child pornography only that: (1) the alleged pornography was produced using only actual persons all of whom were adults; or (2) the alleged pornography was not produced using any actual minors.Prohibits: (1) making a visual depiction that is a digital image, computer image, or computer-generated image of, or that is indistinguishable from an image of, a minor engaging in specified sexually explicit conduct; (2) knowingly advertising, promoting, presenting, distributing, or soliciting through the mails or in commerce, including by computer, any material that is or contains an obscene visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct or a visual depiction of an actual minor engaging in such conduct; (3) knowingly distributing, offering, sending, or providing to a minor any such visual depiction using the mails or commerce, including by computer, for purposes of inducing or persuading a minor to participate in an illegal act; and (4) knowingly producing, distributing, receiving, or possessing with intent to distribute a visual depiction of any kind, including a drawing, cartoon, sculpture, or painting, that, under specified circumstances, depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and is obscene, or depicts an image that is or appears to be of a minor engaging in such conduct and such depiction lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.(Sec. 505) Makes certain information identifying minors depicted in child pornography, other than age, inadmissible and subject to redaction from any otherwise admissible evidence in any prosecution.(Sec. 506) Sets penalties for using or inducing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct outside of the United States in order to produce any visual depiction of such conduct for transportation to the United States.(Sec. 507) Provides enhanced penalties under the Federal criminal code and the Uniform Code of Military Justice for recidivists with respect to child pornography, sexual abuse, and transportation for illegal sexual activity and related crimes.(Sec. 508) Amends the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 to authorize a provider of electronic communication or remote computing services that reasonably believes it has obtained knowledge of facts and circumstances indicating a State criminal law child pornography violation to disclose such information to an appropriate State or local law enforcement official.
