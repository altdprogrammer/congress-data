Declares that nothing precludes certified nurse-midwives and certified midwives from teaching or supervising an intern or resident-in-training. Authorizes payment for such services to a person or entity (or the agent of such person or entity) the certified nurse-midwife (CNM) or certified midwife (CM) may designate under an agreement between the CNM or CM and such person or entity (by implication, including a free-standing birth center)."
