Creates an exception to disclosure for tires that are sold with new vehicles, exempt from testing under Federal standards, or sold for use on vehicles with a gross weight of 10,001 pounds or more. Requires the Secretary, in cooperation with the National Academy of Sciences, to prepare a report to Congress on the effects of age on light vehicle tires."
