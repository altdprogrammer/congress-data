Revises requirements relating to: (1) the eligibility of private organizations; (2) the supplement reimbursement rate for tier II family or group day care homes; (3) the administrative reimbursement rate for family or group day care home sponsoring organizations in rural areas; and (4) management support. Provides for temporary redefinitions of: (1) tier I family or group home in rural areas; and (2) at-risk school children in rural areas. Revises the program for at-risk school children to add Oregon, New York, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Iowa, and Indiana to the limited list of States in which institutions are to receive reimbursement. (Continues the current listing of Illinois, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Delaware, Michigan, and two unspecified States.) Allows emergency shelters to claim reimbursement for resident children not more than 18 years of age. (The current limit is 12.)"
