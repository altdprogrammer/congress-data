    "text": "Homeland Security Federal Workforce Act of 2003 - Title I: Pilot Program for Student Loan Repayment for Federal Employees in National Security Positions - (Sec. 101) Requires the heads of specified Federal agencies to: (1) establish a pilot program under which such agencies may agree to repay the student loans of their employees in national security positions; and (2) coordinate the program with such agencies to recruit or retain employees for those positions. Authorizes such an agency to provide for a program to apply to and be administered with respect to one or more organizational unit of the agency. Provides loan repayment limits of: (1) $10,000 in any year toward toward the remaining balance of the loan for each year that the employee remains in such a position, except that the employee shall remain in such position for at least three years; and (2) a total maximum of $60,000 per employee. Permits an employee to participate in the student loan repayment program and any program under this title at the same time, except that the total amount paid by all agencies for that employee may not exceed: (1) $10,000 in any year; or (2) $60,000 in total. Requires program reports from the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to the appropriate congressional committees including an assessment as to whether the program should be expanded to other agencies or to non-national security positions to improve overall Federal workforce recruitment and retention. Requires the Director of OPM to propose regulations for the criteria to be used by agencies to make determinations of national security positions and to promulgate final regulations for such criteria. Allows such pilot program to remain in effect for an eight-year period and provides for continued payment of benefits of employees recruited under this program through their commitment period. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Fellowships for Graduate Students to Enter Federal Service - (Sec. 201) Amends the David L. Boren National Security Education Act of 1991 to require the the National Security Education Board to establish a program for awarding National Security Fellowships to eligible graduate students who agree to employment with the Government in national security positions. Authorizes the Board to provide for the program to apply to and be administered with respect to one or more organizational units of specified agencies. Requires the Board to: (1) develop criteria for awarding such Fellowships; (2) provide for the wide dissemination of information regarding assisted activities; (3) work with such agencies in hiring and placing fellows in national security positions; and (4) develop and provide to Congress a strategic plan that identifies the skills needed by the Federal national security workforce. Requires 20 percent of such Fellowships to be set-aside for Federal employees who are currently working in such positions to enhance their education and training in areas important to national security. Instructs the Board to consult with the chief human capital officers of participating agencies in carrying out such program. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 202) Amends such Act to direct the Board to create a National Security Service Corps, under the direction of the Board, to provide rotational opportunities for mid-level employees in national security positions within and between specified agencies. Instructs the Board to consult with the chief human capital officers of participating agencies in carrying out such program. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 203) Amends such Act to: (1) designate the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General as members of the Board; (2) requires amounts in the National Security Education Trust Fund to be available for awarding National Security Fellowships under the program established by this Act; and (3) provide for the non-application of certain provisions of such Act to such Fellowships and the National Security Service Corps. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - (Sec. 301) Requires agencies' annual strategic plans to: (1) describe the training required to achieve goals and objectives; and (2) evaluate the extent to which specific skills in human capital are needed to achieve the mission, goals, and objectives of the agency."
