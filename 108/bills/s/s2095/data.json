Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to revise energy reduction goals and performance requirements for Federal buildings. Institutes grant programs for low-income community energy efficiency and energy efficient public buildings. Revises energy conservation standards for: (1) additional consumer products; (2) affordable housing and assisted housing; and (3) Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance incentives for energy efficient housing. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to prescribe incentive payments for renewable energy production facilities. John Rishel Geothermal Steam Act Amendments of 2003 - Amends the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to revamp guidelines governing leasing and permitting for geothermal development of public and National Forest System lands, including those withdrawn for military purposes. Amends the Federal Power Act to prescribe guidelines for hydroelectric licensing proposals for alternative conditions and requirements governing project works within a Federal reservation. Instructs the Secretary of Energy to make incentive payments to promote hydroelectric production. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to make permanent: (1) the authority of the Secretary of Energy to operate the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; and (2) standby energy authorities governing the International Energy Program, including summer fill and fuel budgeting programs. Sets forth a program of production incentives that includes: (1) oil and gas royalties in kind; (2) marginal property production; (3) natural gas production in the gulf of Mexico; and (4) oil and gas leasing in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Directs the President to establish the Office of Federal Energy Project Coordination in the same manner and with the same mission as the White House Energy Projects Task Force established by specified Executive Order. Prescribes implementation guidelines for access to Federal land for: (1) oil and gas leasing; (2) expedited permits; (3) energy rights-of-way and corridors on public and Federal lands; (4) renewable energy on Federal land; and (5) electricity transmission line rights of way on public land. Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act - Requires the President and the Secretaries of the Interior and of Energy to expedite the Federal decision-making process for access to Federal lands for energy projects.
