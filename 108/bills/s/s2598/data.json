Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial assistance to States, local governments, nongovernmental entities, and Indian tribes to rapidly respond to outbreaks of invasive species that are at a stage at which rapid eradication or control is possible. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to submit to Congress a budget analysis of Federal programs relating to invasive species, including a list of general priorities of Federal efforts and programs in prevention, detection, eradication, and control of such species. Authorizes appropriations."
