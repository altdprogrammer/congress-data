Requires the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe regulations requiring such automobiles or trucks to display prominently (including in the owner's manual of each vehicle) information indicating that such vehicles are capable of operating on a flexible fuel mixture. Directs the Secretary to promote the use of a mixture containing at least 85 percent of ethanol by volume with gasoline in motor vehicles in the United States."
