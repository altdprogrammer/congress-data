Provides that the limitation period in cases in which DNA testing implicates a person in the commission of a felony shall not preclude prosecution until an equal period has elapsed following such testing.Amends the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 to cover dating violence.Expresses the sense of Congress that the Paul Coverdell National Forensic Science Improvement Act should be funded in order to improve the quality, timeliness, and credibility of forensic science services for criminal justice purposes."
