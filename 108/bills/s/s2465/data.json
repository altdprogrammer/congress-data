    "text": "Prevention of the Illegally [sic] Importation of Controlled Substances Act of 2004 or the Todd Rode Act - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to require a shipment of controlled substances that is imported into the United States in violation of the Act and that has a value of less than $10,000 to be seized, summarily forfeited to the United States, and destroyed. Declares that: (1) provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding the disposition of refused articles do not authorize the delivery of the substances pursuant to the execution of a bond; and (2) the substances may not be exported. Authorizes the seizure and destruction of such controlled substances without notice to the importer, owner, or consignee of the substances involved. Requires appraisal of such substances only to the extent sufficient to document that the substances are subject to this Act. Requires that procedures promulgated under this Act be designed toward the goal of ensuring that a substantial majority of shipments of such substances are identified, seized, and destroyed. Prohibits controlled substances from being destroyed to the extent that the Attorney General determines that the substances should be preserved as evidence."
