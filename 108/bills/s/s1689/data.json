Chapter 2: Military Construction - Makes appropriations for military construction for the Army and Air Force. Chapter 3: General Provisions, This Title - (Sec. 301) Amends the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 to increase from $300 million to $450 million the aggregate value of authorized assistance to the Government of Afghanistan and eligible foreign countries and international organizations to direct the drawdown of defense articles and services and military education and training.

(Sec. 317) Allows the administering Secretaries, at any time after notifying members of the Ready Reserve that they are to be called or ordered to active duty, to provide to each such member any medical and dental screening and care necessary to meet applicable standards for deployment.

(Sec. 318) Makes each member of the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve who is placed in a mobilization category (subject to being ordered to active duty involuntarily) eligible to enroll in TRICARE and receive benefits for any period that such member: (1) is an eligible unemployment compensation recipient; or (2) is not eligible for health-care benefits under an employer-sponsored health benefits plan. Allows either self alone or self and family TRICARE coverage.

Prohibits simultaneous coverage under both the qualified health plan and TRICARE. (Sec. 320) Sets forth conditions under which a member of the reserves who is issued a delayed-effective-date active duty order shall be treated as being on active duty for more than 30 days and therefore eligible for medical and dental care for active-duty personnel.

(Sec. 325) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) any U.S. citizen who was a prisoner of war or who was used by the regime of Saddam Hussein and Iraq as a so-called human shield during the First Gulf War (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm) should have the opportunity to have any claim for damages caused by Saddam Hussein and Iraq fully adjudicated in the appropriate U.S. district court; (2) any judgment obtained therefrom should be fully enforced; and (3) the Attorney General should enter into negotiations with each such citizen or his or her family to develop a method of providing compensation for such damages, including the use of seized assets of the Hussein regime. (Sec. 326) Directs: (1) the Secretary to report to the defense committees on the utilization of the National Guard and reserves in support of contingency operations during FY 2004; and (2) the Secretary of Homeland Security to report to Congress on the effects of the deployments of the National Guard and reserves on law enforcement and homeland security in the United States. (Sec. 327) Requires quarterly reports, through FY 2004, from the Special Advisor to the Director of Central Intelligence for Strategy and Iraq to the intelligence committees and specified defense subcommittees on the status of efforts of the Iraq Survey Group to account for the programs of Iraq on weapons of mass destruction and related delivery systems.

Requires the application of Federal reemployment rights for such individuals. Terminates such authority at the end of FY 2004. (Sec. 333) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Secretary should, on an expedited basis, issue necessary regulations to implement the award of the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal (based on deployment abroad for 30 days or more in support of Global War on Terrorism operations on or after September 11, 2001) and to ensure that any person who renders qualifying service with the armed forces, including Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, and Noble Eagle, promptly receives such award.

Requires a report from the CG to the appropriations committees on all audit and investigation results. (Sec. 2311) Prohibits the use of available funds from this Act or the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 for paying any costs associated with debts incurred by the former government of Saddam Hussein.

Expresses the sense of Congress that each country that is owed such a debt by Iraq should forgive it. (Sec. 2316) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) arbitrary deadlines should not be set for the dissolution of the CPA or the transfer of its authority to an Iraqi governing authority; and (2) no such dissolution or transfer should occur until the ratification of an Iraqi constitution and the establishment of an elected Iraqi government.
