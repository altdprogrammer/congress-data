    "text": "Enterprise Rancheria Land Restoration Act of 2004 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to place into trust status not to exceed 41 acres of land of the Enterprise Rancheria (one of several Federally recognized tribes of Maidu Indians in California), if the land is approved for trust status. Provides that, to restore the Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 parcel, the Enterprise Rancheria may purchase not to exceed 41 acres of replacement land within the 40 mile radius of Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 parcel and within the aboriginal boundaries of the Estom Yumeka. Allows the Secretary to place the replacement land into trust status, the title to which shall be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of Enterprise Rancheria. Provides that: (1) the acquisition of land above shall be treated as the restoration of land for an Indian tribe that is recognized by the Federal Government; (2) this Act does not limit the authority of the Secretary to approve or deny any land application for trust status; and (3) on the placement of replacement land into trust status, the Enterprise Rancheria shall be considered to have relinquished all equitable compensation claims the Enterprise Rancheria may have against the United States and California arising from the sale of Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 parcel."
