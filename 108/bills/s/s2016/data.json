    "text": "Infant Crib Safety Act - Makes it unlawful for any commercial user to: (1) manufacture, sell, or contract to sell any full-size or nonfull-size crib which is unsafe for any infant; or (2) sell, contract to sell or resell, lease, sublet, or otherwise place in the stream of commerce any such crib which is not new and is unsafe for any infant. Makes it unlawful for any lodging facility to offer or provide such an unsafe crib. Presumes as unsafe a crib which does not conform to specified standards in the Code of Federal Regulations and the American Society for Testing Materials Voluntary Standards, unless labeled as dangerous for an infant and not intended to be used for one. Grants the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) enforcement powers as if this Act were a consumer product safety standard promulgated by it under the Consumer Product Safety Act. Declares a violation of this Act shall be considered a prohibited act within the meaning of the CPSA, and subject to its penalties and remedies."
