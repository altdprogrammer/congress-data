Expresses the sense of Congress regarding the conflict in Sudan, including U.S., United Nations (UN), and international humanitarian and political actions to address the conflict. (Sec. 5) Amends the Sudan Peace Act to authorize the President to assist Sudan to: (1) support the implementation of a comprehensive peace agreement that applies to all regions of Sudan, including the Darfur region (authorizes FY 2005 through 2007 appropriations); and (2) address the humanitarian and human rights crisis in the Darfur region and eastern Chad, provided that no assistance be made available to the Government of Sudan (authorizes FY 2005 appropriations). Makes assistance for a comprehensive peace agreement contingent upon a continuing certification to the appropriate congressional committees that the Government of Sudan is acting to: (1) ensure that the armed forces and militias are not committing atrocities or blocking assistance; (2) demobilize militias; (3) permit humanitarian assistance to all regions of Sudan, including Darfur; (4) cooperate with aid workers and monitoring teams; (5) allow an international investigation of the actions that occurred in Darfur; (6) permit the return of displaced persons and refugees; and (7) install a new coalition government based upon the Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan. Requires suspension of assistance to: (1) the Government of Sudan if it ceases to take such actions; and (2) the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), other that health, education, and humanitarian assistance, if it fails to engage in good faith negotiations or honor agreements. Revises the Secretary of State's annual Sudan report requirements. (Sec. 6) Directs the President to implement specified sanctions in support of peace in Darfur, including blocking the assets of senior Sudanese officials. Authorizes such sanctions' suspension for purposes of national interest, or if Sudan complies with certain actions under the Sudan Peace Act. (Sec. 7) Authorizes the President to to provide non-military assistance to areas that were outside the Government of Sudan's control as of April 8, 2004. (Sec. 8) Amends the International Organizations Immunities Act to replace a reference to \"Organization of African Unity\" with \"African Union.\""
