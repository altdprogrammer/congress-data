Waives such liability protection if: (1) the person's act or omission proximately causing the injury, damage, loss, or death constitutes gross negligence or intentional misconduct; or (2) the person is the manufacturer of such equipment. Preempts State laws to the extent they are inconsistent with this Act, with the exception of those that provide additional protection from liability."
