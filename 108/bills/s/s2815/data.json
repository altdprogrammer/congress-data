Provides that this Act does not create a cause of action or in any other way increase or diminish the liability of any person under any other law. (Sec. 4) Expresses the sense of Congress: (1) commending the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for identifying and creating strategies for addressing asthma within a coordinated school program; and (2) encouraging all schools to review these strategies and adopt policies that will best meet the needs of their student population."
