Authorizes an eligible community to develop a strategic plan for community economic adjustment and diversification. Authorizes the Secretary to award a grant to an eligible community to: (1) develop and implement such plan; and (2) upon its approval, carry out any project or program included in the plan. Provides for award of supplemental grants Requires the Secretary to develop guidelines to ensure that rural communities receive preference in the allocation of resources.
