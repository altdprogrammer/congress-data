Requires the coordinator to: (1) seek to eliminate gaps in the network; (2) work with States to encourage the development of additional network elements and to ensure regional coordination; and (3) act as the nationwide point of contact for network development and for regional coordination of alerts on abducted children through the network. Directs the Coordinator to notify and consult with the Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning each child abduction for which an AMBER Alert is issued.(Sec. 3) Directs the Coordinator to establish minimum standards for the issuance of alerts and for the extent of their dissemination (limited to the geographic areas most likely to facilitate the recovery of the abducted child). Provides that the standards shall be adoptable on a voluntary basis only.Requires the Coordinator to cooperate with the Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Communications Commission in carrying out such activities.(Sec. 4) Requires the Secretary of Transportation to provide grants to States for the development or enhancement of notification or communications systems along highways for alerts and other information for the recovery of abducted children.
