Requires the SBA to set and maintain standards for qualified entities, including standards relating to delinquency, default, liquidation, and loss rates. Makes the SBA's credit enhancement guarantees second-loss guarantees, available only after the full payment of guarantees offered by the qualified entities authorized to act as issuers and managers of pools or trusts of loans. Provides loan pool or trust requirements and credit enhancement limits for FY 2004 through 2006. Directs the SBA to charge and collect a fee from issuers based on the SBA's guaranteed amount of issued securities."
