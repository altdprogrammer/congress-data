Directs the Secretaries of Health and Human Services (HHS) and of Labor to coordinate their application of such standards with respect to group health plans under PHSA and ERISA, respectively. Directs the Secretary of HHS to report on: (1) the unique characteristics of patterns of illness, disability, and injury in children; (2) the development of measures of quality of care and outcomes related to the healthcare of children; and (3) the access of children to primary mental health services and the coordination of managed behavioral health services. Requires the General Accounting Office (GAO) to report on: (1) the structure and performance of non-governmental health plans, Medicaid managed care organizations, and specified plans and programs under the Social Security Act, serving children with special health care needs; (2) the structure and performance of non-governmental plans in serving children as compared to Medicaid managed care organizations; (3) the emphasis that private managed care health plans place on primary care and the control of services as it relates to care and services provided to children with special health care needs; and (4) health plan activities that address the unique health needs of adolescents."
