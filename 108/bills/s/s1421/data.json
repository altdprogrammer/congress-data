Ratifies and confirms prior subdivisions and dedications as of the date of the Secretary's approval. Provides that, except in a case in which a specific interest in such restricted land is dedicated, nothing in this Act terminates, diminishes, or otherwise affects the continued existence and applicability of Federal restrictions against alienation and taxation on restricted land or interests in restricted land (including such subdivided restricted land)."
