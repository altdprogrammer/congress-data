Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) and the Secretary of Defense to jointly conduct a review of the mission, procedures, and administration of the Dose Reconstruction Program of the Department of Defense. Requires appointment of an advisory board for Program review and oversight. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study to determine the appropriate disposition of the Air Force Health Study, an epidemiologic study of Air Force personnel responsible for conducting aerial herbicide spray missions during the Vietnam era. Requires the Secretaries to make specified funds available to the National Academy of Sciences in each of FY 2004 through 2013 for the Academy's Medical Follow-Up Agency of the Institute of Medicine to conduct epidemiological research on military personnel and veterans."
