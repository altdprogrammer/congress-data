Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 to reauthorize and revise requirements for the Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration programs, and to instruct the Secretary of Energy to prepare a comprehensive coordination plan for activities under this Act and under title II of the Hydrogen Future Act of 1996. Renames the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel as the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary on such programs. Requires the National Academy of Sciences to review progress under this Act every four years. Amends the Hydrogen Future Act of 1996 to revise requirements for the program for integration of fuel cells with hydrogen production systems. Instructs the Secretary to: (1) solicit proposals for projects demonstrating hydrogen technologies needed to use fuel cells in Federal, State, and local government stationary and transportation applications; and (2) establish an interagency task force to develop an implementation plan for a fuel cell demonstration program that includes hydrogen-based infrastructure for fleet transportation systems and for distributed power generation. Requires the Secretary to enter into cooperative and cost-sharing agreements with Federal, State, and local agencies for participation in related demonstrations."
