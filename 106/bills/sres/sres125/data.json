    "text": "Recognizes that the creation of a better United States requires the active involvement of fathers in the rearing and development of their children. Urges: (1) each father in the United States to accept his full share of responsibility for the lives of his children, to be actively involved in rearing them, and to encourage their emotional, academic, moral, and spiritual development; (2) the States to hold fathers who ignore their legal responsibilities accountable for their actions and to pursue more aggressive enforcement of child support obligations; and (3) governments and institutions at every level to remove barriers to father involvement and enact public policies that encourage and support the efforts of fathers who do want to become more engaged in the lives of their children. Encourages each father to devote time, energy, and resources to his children, recognizing that children need not only material support, but also, more importantly, a secure, affectionate, family environment. Designates June 20, 1999, as National Father's Return Day. Calls on fathers around the country to use the day to reconnect and rededicate themselves to their children's lives, to spend National Father's Return Day with their children, and to express their love and support for them."
