Supports: (1) continued efforts by the regional peacekeeping force, the Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), to restore peace and security and to defend the democratically elected Government of Sierra Leone; (2) appropriate U.S. logistical, medical, and political support for ECOMOG; and (3) the people of Sierra Leone in their quest for a democratic, prosperous, and reconciled society. Recognizes that basic improvements in ECOMOG's performance regarding human rights and personnel management would improve its effectiveness. Calls for: (1) an immediate cessation of hostilities and respect for human rights; and (2) all members of the conflict to engage in dialogue to bring about a long-term solution."
