Sets forth provisions regarding arguments on such motions and presentations by the House of Representatives and the President. Authorizes Senators to question parties for up to 16 hours. Makes it in order to: (1) consider and debate a motion to dismiss as outlined by the impeachment rules after such questioning; and (2) make a motion to subpoena witnesses and to present evidence not in the record, subject to a debate time limitation, after such debate. Provides for Senate votes on such motions. Requires the Senate, if it agrees to allow the House or the President to call witnesses, to depose such witnesses and decide which witnesses shall testify. Provides for agreement by both leaders to the time for depositions. Makes testimony inadmissible unless the parties have had an opportunity to depose such witnesses. Declares that the parties will proceed to present evidence if the Senate fails to dismiss the case and requires the Senate to vote on each article of impeachment at the conclusion of its deliberations."
