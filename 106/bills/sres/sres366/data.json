Expresses the intent of the Senate to continue to work cooperatively with Mexican authorities to promote the health and welfare of U.S. and Mexican citizens endangered by international drug trafficking, use, and production.Expresses the sense of the Senate that the incoming new governments in both Mexico and the United States must develop and implement a counter-drug program that more effectively addresses the official corruption, increase in drug traffic, and lawlessness that has resulted from illegal drug trafficking, and that a one-year waiver of the requirement that the President certify Mexico is warranted to permit both new governments time to do so."
