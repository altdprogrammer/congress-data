Commends all Chinese citizens who are peacefully advocating for democracy and human rights. Condemns the ongoing human rights abuses by the Chinese Government. Calls on that Government to: (1) release all prisoners of conscience, including those still in prison as a result of their participation in the peaceful prodemocracy protests of May and June 1989, provide just compensation to the families of those killed in those protests, and allow those exiled on account of their activities in 1989 to return and live in freedom in China; (2) end harassment, detention, and imprisonment of Chinese citizens exercising their legitimate rights to the freedoms of expression, association, and religion; and (3) demonstrate its willingness to respect the rights of all Chinese citizens by proceeding quickly to ratify and implement the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which it signed on October 5, 1998."
