    "text": "Calls for the President, through the U.S. Agency for International Development, to: (1) work with law enforcement and judicial agencies of foreign governments to encourage the adoption of legal system reforms that provide for the investigation and prosecution of honor crimes; and (2) make available to local organizations in foreign countries sufficient resources to provide refuge and rehabilitation for women who are victims of such crimes and to sustain their children. Calls for the Secretary of State, when preparing annual country reports on human rights practices, to include information relating to the incidence of honor violence in foreign countries, the steps taken to address such problem, and all relevant actions taken by the United States to reduce the incidence of such violence and to increase investigations and prosecutions of such crimes.Urges the President to: (1) communicate to the United Nations (UN) the concern over the high rate of honor-related violence toward women in foreign countries; and (2) request that the appropriate UN bodies propose actions to be taken to encourage those countries to end such violence. Calls on the President and the Secretary, through direct communication with leaders of countries where honor killings, dowry deaths, and related practices are endemic, to: (1) convey the most serious concerns of the United States about these gross violations of human rights; and (2) urge the leaders of those countries to investigate and prosecute as murders all such acts with a view to punishing the perpetrators to the maximum extent provided under law."
