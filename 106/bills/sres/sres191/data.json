Recognizes the overwhelming expression of such people in favor of independence.Commends: (1) the United Nations (UN) Security Council for passing a resolution authorizing a multinational force to address the security situation in East Timor; (2) Australia for its readiness to lead the multinational force for East Timor (and welcomes the participation of other nations); and (3) UN Mission in East Timor personnel.Expresses: (1) support for a rapid and effective deployment throughout East Timor by the multinational force; and (2) approval for the United States to assist in this effort.Condemns the violent efforts of the East Timor militias and elements of the Indonesian military to overturn the results of the vote. Notes the failure of the Indonesian Government to guarantee the security of the people of East Timor and such Government's responsibility to restrain such elements and paramilitary forces.Calls upon the Government of Indonesia to: (1) recognize its responsibilities as a member of the UN and a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to cooperate with appropriate UN authorities in the restoration of order in East Timor; (2) allow unrestricted access to refugees and displaced persons in West Timor by relief agencies; (3) hold accountable those responsible for the violence, human rights abuses, and atrocities; and (4) cooperate with the international community in establishing an international commission of inquiry to investigate human rights abuses in East Timor."
