Encourages: (1) the Clinton Administration and the international community to provide substantial assistance for the coming elections; and (2) the Government of Haiti to adopt adequate security measures in preparation for such elections. Urges: (1) all elements of Haitian civil society, including Haitian political leaders, to publicly renounce violence and promote a climate of security; and (2) the United States and other members of the international community to continue support towards a lasting and committed transition to democracy in Haiti."
