Supports the aspirations of the Indonesian people in pursuing a transition to genuine democracy. Calls upon: (1) all Indonesian leaders, political party members, military personnel, and the general public to respect the outcome of the elections and uphold that outcome pending the selection of the new president by the Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat (MPR) later this year; and (2) the present ruling Golkar Party to work closely with any successor government in assuring a smooth transition. Calls for the convening of the MPR and the selection of the next president as soon as practicable and in a transparent manner. Urges the present government, and any new government, to continue to work to ensure a stable and secure environment in East Timor by: (1) assisting in disarming and disbanding any militias on the island; (2) granting full access to East Timor to groups such as the United Nations, international humanitarian organizations, human rights monitors, and similar nongovernmental organizations; and (3) upholding its commitment to cooperate fully with the United Nations Assistance Mission for East Timor."
