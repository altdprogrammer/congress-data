Calls on the United Nations Security Council to: (1) condemn such slave raids and bring to justice those responsible; (2) implement the existing air embargo and impose an arms embargo on such Government; (3) implement reforms of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) to enhance the independence of that operation from such Government; (4) determine whether or not such Government's war policy constitutes genocide; and (5) implement the recommendations of UN Special Rapporteur for Sudan, Leonardo Franco, who has called for the posting of human rights monitors throughout Sudan. Calls for the President to: (1) increase support for relief organizations working outside the umbrella of OLS; (2) instruct the Agency for International Development (AID) and other appropriate agencies to provide additional support to nongovernmental relief organizations that work outside the OLS umbrella and to enhance the independence of OLS from such Government; (3) double the funds that are made available through the STAR Program for the promotion of the rule of law to advance democracy and the enhancement of infrastructure in areas in Sudan controlled by the opposition to such Government; (4) instruct AID to provide humanitarian assistance directly to indigenous humanitarian groups in southern Sudan and the Nuba Mountains; (5) intensify and expand U.S. diplomatic and economic pressure on such Government in conjunction with and urging other countries to impose sanctions on such Government that are similar to U.S.-imposed sanctions; (5) continue to enhance the peace process in Sudan supported by the Inter-governmental Authority for Development; and (6) report to Congress on efforts or plans to promote the end of slavery in Sudan."
