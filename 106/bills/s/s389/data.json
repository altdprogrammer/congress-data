    "text": "Troops-To-Teachers Program Improvement Act of 1999 - Transfers from the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard to the Secretary of Education (Secretary) jurisdiction over a program to assist eligible members of the armed forces after their discharge, release, or retirement to: (1) obtain certification or licensing as elementary or secondary school teachers or vocational or technical teachers; and (2) facilitate the employment of such members by local educational agencies identified under this Act. Requires the Secretary to provide information concerning the placement program, and make program applications available, to such members as part of their pre-separation counseling. Directs the Secretary to pay a stipend of $5,000 to each program participant, with a limit of 3,000 of such stipends in a fiscal year. Authorizes the Secretary, in lieu of such stipend amount, to pay a bonus of $10,000 to each participant who agrees to accept full-time employment as a teacher for not less than four years in a high need school. Limits to 1,000 the number of such bonuses in a fiscal year. Mandates that provision of assistance under such program shall not reduce or affect entitlement to benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States, or consortia of States, for operating offices for recruiting eligible members for program participation and facilitating employment of such participants in the schools of such States. Limits to $4 million the total amount of grants in a fiscal year. Limits to five percent of program funds the amount authorized for management infrastructure. Requires the Secretaries involved to complete the jurisdictional transfer of the program no later than October 1, 1999. Requires program reports from the Secretary and the Comptroller General. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Education for FY 2000 through 2004."
