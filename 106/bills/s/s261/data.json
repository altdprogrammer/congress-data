Repeals, similarly, the requirement that such injury be substantial.Declares that imports shall be considered to be a \"cause of serious injury, or threat thereof,\" if a causal link is established between imports and injury to the domestic industry.Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish and implement a steel import permit and monitoring program. Requires: (1) a person to have a steel import permit before he or she can import certain steel products into the United States; and (2) the Secretary to issue such permit to any person who files an application that meets specified requirements. Requires the Secretary to compile and publish certain information with respect to such imported steel."
