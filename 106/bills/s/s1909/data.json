    "text": "Wartime Violation of Italian American Civil Liberties Act - Directs the Inspector General of the Department of Justice to conduct a comprehensive review of the treatment by the Federal Government of Italian Americans during World War II (between September 1, 1939, and December 31, 1945) and to report to Congress on the findings of such review. Requires the findings to include information regarding: (1) Italian Americans who were taken into custody, interned, ordered to move out of designated areas, or arrested for curfew, contraband, or other violations; (2) Federal Bureau of Investigations raids on Italian Americans' homes; (3) restrictions on Italian American fishermen and railroad workers; and (4) civil liberties infringements suffered by Italian Americans during World War II as a result of Executive Order 9066.Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the story of the treatment of Italian Americans during World War II needs to be told; (2) Federal agencies, including the Department of Education and the National Endowment for the Humanities, should support projects such as conferences, seminars, and lectures to heighten awareness of this unfortunate chapter in our nation's history, the refurbishment and payment of all expenses associated with the traveling exhibit \"Una Storia Segreta,\" and documentaries allowing this issue to be presented to the American public; (3) an advisory committee should be established to assist in the compilation, research, and dissemination of information on the treatment of Italian Americans; and (4) financial support should be provided for educating the American public through the production of a documentary film suited for public broadcast.States that the U.S. Government formally acknowledges that these events during World War II represented a fundamental injustice against Italian Americans."
