    "text": "Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to provide that development of recovery plans for the conservation and survival of species that are not indigenous to the United States or waters with respect to which the United States exercises sovereign rights or jurisdiction shall not be required under the Act. Requires the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce, as appropriate, after a final determination that a species is threatened or endangered, to: (1) appoint a recovery team to develop a recovery plan for the species; or (2) determine that such a team shall not be appointed after public notice and comment. Requires the Secretary to perform such duties if a recovery team is not appointed. Establishes a timetable for the publication of final recovery plans. Directs the Secretary to designate any habitat considered to be critical habitat of an endangered or threatened species that is indigenous to the United States or waters with respect to which the United States exercises sovereign rights or jurisdiction. Provides for designation of critical habitat as part of a recovery plan. Requires designation by regulation within three years of a determination that a species is endangered or threatened if the Secretary determines that a recovery plan will not promote species conservation. Requires such designation concurrently with the determination that a species is endangered or threatened if such designation at the time of listing is essential to avoid imminent species extinction. Bases the designation of critical habitat on the best scientific and commercial data available and after consideration of economic impact, impacts to military training and operations, and any other relevant impact. Authorizes civil actions against the Secretary with respect to the designation of critical habitat. Requires the Secretary to develop or revise final recovery plans for species listed as endangered or threatened before this Act's enactment. Provides for a priority ranking system for the development and revision of recovery plans. Establishes a schedule for the revision of plans developed before this Act's enactment, requiring plans for all affected species no later than ten years after this Act's enactment. Prohibits the filing of civil actions alleging failures to develop recovery plans or designate critical habitat before specified time periods have elapsed. Requires the Secretary to review and revise, as necessary, any critical habitat designation made before this Act's enactment date. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
