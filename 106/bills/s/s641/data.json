Requires: (1) creditors making advances under an open end credit plan to annually report certain loan data to the Board; and (2) the Board to compile such data and submit it to certain congressional committees annually. Amends Federal bankruptcy law to permit the discharge in bankruptcy of an individual debt if the creditor has not made the requisite disclosures under this Act. Sanctions the reaffirmation of a dischargeable debt if the reaffirmation agreement contains such disclosures."
