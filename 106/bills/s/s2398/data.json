Requires that the scientific registry of organ transplant recipients also include information respecting donors and patients in transplants involving living donors.Authorizes grants and contracts for travel and subsistence expenses of living donors. Mandates a public education program regarding organ donation (either directly by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or through grants or contracts). Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) make grants for studies and demonstration projects regarding increasing donation rates; and (2) make grants to States for public education and programs to increase the number of donors. Provides for a bronze medal for donors (or, if the donor is deceased, the donor's family). Prohibits States or their subdivisions from establishing or continuing in effect any law, rule, regulation, or other requirement that would restrict the ability of any entity to comply with Network organ allocation policies."
