Requires the protection of information collected through such exceptions.Treats each violations of such requirements and prohibition as an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act.Authorizes a software provider to disclose such information to law enforcement officials or a court under a warrant or court order (requiring that the user be given notice of such request and an opportunity to contest). Requires a court issuing such an order to ensure appropriate safeguards on the use of such information.Provides a private right of action for users for enforcement of this Act.
