    "text": "Indian Tribal Surface Transportation Act of 2000 - Amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) to prohibit the Secretary of Transportation from distributing the obligation authority for Federal-aid highway and highway safety construction programs for FY 2001 through 2003 with respect to amounts authorized for Indian reservation roads under the Federal Lands Highways Program.Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a demonstration project under which all funds made available for Indian reservation roads and highway bridges located on such roads shall be made available to an Indian tribal government, upon its request, for contracts and agreements for planning, research, engineering, and construction of any highway, road, bridge, parkway, or transit facility that provides access to or is located within the reservation or community of the Indian tribe in accordance with the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA).Requires the selection of 12 geographically diverse Indian tribes each fiscal year from an applicant pool described below. Permits two or more tribes to form a consortium to be considered as a single tribe for purposes of becoming part of such pool.Provides for a participating Indian tribe to receive funding equivalent to the funding that it would otherwise receive pursuant to the funding formula established under TEA-21, plus an additional percentage of funds withheld during the fiscal year for the road program management costs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.Requires such applicant pool to consist of each Indian tribe or consortium that: (1) has successfully completed a planning phase that includes legal and budgetary research and internal tribal government and organization preparation; (2) has requested participation in such demonstration project through the adoption of a resolution or other official action by the tribal governing body; and (3) has, during the three-fiscal year period immediately preceding the fiscal year for which participation is being requested, demonstrated financial stability and financial management capability through a showing of no material audit exceptions. (States that evidence that during such period, an Indian tribe had no uncorrected significant and material exceptions in the required annual audit of the tribe's self-determination contracts or self-governance funding agreements with any Federal agency shall be conclusive evidence of the required stability and capability.)Provides that not to exceed six percent of the contract authority amounts made available from the Highway Trust Fund to the Bureau shall be used to pay the administrative expenses for the Indian reservation roads program and administrative expenses related to individual projects associated with such program. Requires that such administrative funds be made available to an Indian tribal government, upon its request, for use for the associated administrative functions assumed by the Indian tribe under contracts and agreements pursuant to the ISDEAA. Permits an Indian tribe or tribal organization to commence road and bridge construction under the TEA-21 that is funded through a contract or agreement under the ISDEAA so long as the Indian tribe or tribal organization has: (1) provided assurances that the construction will meet or exceed proper health and safety standards; (2) obtained advance review of the plans and specifications from a licensed professional who has certified that such plans and specifications meet or exceed such standards; and (3) provided a copy of such certification to the Bureau."
