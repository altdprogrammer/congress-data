    "text": "Regulatory Right-to-Know Act of 1999 - Directs the President, acting through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to submit to the Congress, with the Federal budget each year, an accounting statement and associated report containing: (1) an estimate of the total annual costs and benefits of Federal regulatory programs in the aggregate; by agency, agency program, and program element; and by major rule; (2) an analysis of direct and indirect impacts of Federal rules on Federal, State, local, and tribal government, the private sector, small business, wages, and economic growth; and (3) recommendations to reform inefficient or ineffective regulatory programs or program elements. Requires the accounting statement to cover, at a minimum, the costs and corresponding benefits for the four preceding fiscal years. Requires the Director: (1) before submitting such statement and report, to provide public notice and an opportunity to comment and to consult with the Comptroller General; and (2) to incorporate an appendix to the report addressing public and peer review comments. Requires the Director to: (1) issue guidelines to agencies to standardize most plausible measures of costs and benefits and the format of information provided for accounting statements; and (2) review agency submissions for consistency with such guidelines. Directs the Director to arrange for a nationally recognized public policy research organization with expertise in regulatory analysis and regulatory accounting to provide independent and external peer review of the guidelines and each accounting statement and associated report before such guidelines, statements, and reports are made final."
