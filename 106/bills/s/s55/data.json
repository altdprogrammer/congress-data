Establishes a special rule for a qualified personal service corporation. Requires each S corporation to establish a qualified retained earnings account. Allows qualified distributions from such a qualified retained earnings account to the owners to enable the S corporation shareholder to pay income taxes. Requires regulations to establish a presumption that distributions are to pay income taxes if such distributions do not exceed 34 percent of qualified taxable S corporation income. Provides for an additional tax on nonqualified distributions."
