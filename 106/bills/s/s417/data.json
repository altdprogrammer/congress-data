Makes this provision inapplicable to any discovery or pretrial action in a civil action that is carried out in a manner consistent with reasonable case management principles and due deference to presidential responsibilities. Directs that any discovery matter in such an action: (1) be filed with the court of jurisdiction under seal; and (2) not be available to the public until the President has vacated such office or until all parties to the action agree to release the discovery matter."
