    "text": "Saint Helena Island National Scenic Area Act - Establishes the Saint Helena Island National Scenic Area, upon conveyance of such Island to the United States, to preserve and protect its outstanding resources and values and to provide for the conservation, protection, and enhancement of primitive recreation opportunities, fish and wildlife habitat, vegetation, and historical and cultural resources of such Island.Requires the boundaries of the Hiawatha National Forest to be extended to include such Area. Requires lands acquired by the United States under this Act to be treated as entitlement lands solely for purposes of payments in lieu of taxes to local governments.Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to seek to develop a management plan for the Area as an amendment to the Land and Resources Management Plan for the Hiawatha National Forest.Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed as affecting the jurisdiction or responsibilities of Michigan with respect to fish in the Area.Withdraws the lands within the Area from disposition under U.S. mineral and geothermal leasing laws. Prohibits the Secretary from allowing any mineral development on federally-owned land within the Area, except for construction and maintenance of roads and facilities within the Area.Allows the Secretary to acquire: (1) land and structures within the Area to further the purposes of this Act; and (2) not more than ten acres of land (and improvements) on the mainland to provide access to, and administrative facilities for, the Area.Authorizes appropriations."
