    "text": "Social Security Trust Fund Protection Act of 1999 - Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to provide that the purpose of pay-as-you-go provisions is to ensure that legislation (currently, legislation enacted before FY 2002) affecting direct spending or receipts that results in a net budget increase (currently, increases the deficit) will trigger an offsetting sequestration, except to the extent that the total budget surplus exceeds the social security surplus. Removes an FY 2006 expiration date for specified pay-as-you-go provisions. Defines \"budget increase\" and \"budget decrease\" to mean, for purposes of pay-as-you-go provisions, an increase or decrease, respectively, in direct spending outlays or a decrease or increase, respectively, in receipts relative to the baseline. Requires a sequestration to offset the amount of any net budget (currently, deficit) increase caused by all direct spending and receipts legislation. Applies a sequestration for a fiscal year only to the extent that any surplus, before the sequestration in the total budget (which includes both on- and off-budget Government accounts), is less than the combined surplus for that year in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund."
