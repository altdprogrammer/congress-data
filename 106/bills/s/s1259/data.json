Specifies the exclusive proceeding for refusing registration of such a mark. Applies such amendment only to applications for registration filed on or after January 16, 1996.Authorizes a court to grant injunctive relief for violations of this Act, as well as damages for willful violations, and an order for delivery and destruction of any articles of the defendant which constitute a willful violation.Waives sovereign immunity for the Federal Government to grant private citizens and corporate entities the right to bring an action for trademark infringement against the United States, its agencies, and any entities or persons acting for the United States.Declares that in an action for trade dress infringement, where the matter sought to be protected is not registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the person who asserts trade dress protection has the burden of proving that the trade dress is not functional (that is, not commonly used by similar businesses, and thus eligible for protection)."
