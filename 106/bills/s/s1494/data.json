    "text": "Electronic Commerce Extension Establishment Act of 1999 - Amends the National Bureau of Standards Act to direct the Secretary of Commerce to provide assistance for the creation and support of Regional Centers for the Transfer of Electronic Commerce Technology (Centers). Requires the Centers to be affiliated with any U.S.-based nonprofit institution or organization that applies for and is awarded financial assistance under this Act. Outlines objectives of the Centers, including aiding small businesses, especially those located in rural areas, in identifying and adopting electronic commerce technologies and business practices. Defines \"electronic commerce\" as the ability to buy, sell, and deliver goods and services through computer networks. Requires such Centers to: (1) establish electronic commerce demonstration systems for technology transfer; and (2) transfer and disseminate research findings and Center expertise to companies and enterprises, particularly small businesses. Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial support to a Center for such activities and objectives. Outlines application requirements for such assistance. Requires Centers receiving assistance to be evaluated during the third year of operation by a panel of private experts. Requires a positive finding from such panel before a Center may receive such assistance for its fourth through sixth years. Requires independent review of a Center every two years after the sixth year, to be conducted under procedures established by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology. Provides Center funding limitations. Requires the Secretary to publish a proposal for the assistance program provided under this Act, as well as a final program. Authorizes appropriations."
