Establishes the National Commission on Small Business. Requires the Commission to conduct National and State conferences to bring together individuals concerned with issues relating to small business. Directs the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration to assist in carrying out such conferences. Requires the Commission to appoint a Conference Advisory Committee from participants at the last national conference. Requires the Commission to report to the President and ranking minority members of the congressional small business committees on conference findings, recommendations, and proposals, as well as necessary legislative action to implement such recommendations. Authorizes appropriations to carry out each national and State conference."
