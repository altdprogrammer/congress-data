Requires, not later than 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, the head of each Federal agency that administers such a program to submit to the Secretary: (1) the amount of funds made available for that program for that fiscal year; and (2) for each State recipient of a covered Federal formula grant, the amount distributed as a grant award under that grant to that recipient. Requires the Secretary to determine: (1) the 100 covered Federal formula grant programs that received the greatest amount of funding during the preceding fiscal year; and (2) whether, on the basis of undercounting for the most recent decennial census, any State recipient of a grant award under such a program received an amount less than or greater than the amount that the recipient would have received if an adjustment to such award had been made for that undercounting. Requires the Secretary, upon making such determinations, to prepare a specified annual report for each State identifying grant awards affected."
