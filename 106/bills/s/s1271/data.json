    "text": "Most Favored Rogue States Act of 1999 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to revise the definition of \"major drug-transit country\" by deleting the \"significantly affecting the United States\" requirement.Considers Iran, Syria, and North Korea as major drug-transit countries for purposes of the withholding of bilateral assistance and opposition to the provision of multilateral development bank assistance unless the President certifies to Congress that such countries have cooperated fully with the United States in combating narcotics. Requires the President to notify Congress of his intent to exclude a country that has been determined to be a major drug-transit or major illicit drug producing country.Requires the Secretary of State to report to Congress setting forth a justification for the decision to certify that it is in the national interest of the United States that bilateral assistance not be withheld or the provision of multilateral development assistance not be opposed (waived) with respect to Paraguay.Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the drug-trafficking activities of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)."
