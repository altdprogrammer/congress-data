    "text": "Teacher Technology Training Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to State educational agencies (SEAs) to award grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to provide classroom-related computer training to licensed or certified elementary or secondary school teachers. Requires SEAs to make such grant awards on the basis of an LEA's demonstrated need to strengthen teacher training in using technology in instruction. Limits grant duration to five years. Mandates State and local applications for such grants, but also requires: (1) the SEA to award at least one grant to an LEA that meets criteria established by the Secretary; and (2) the Secretary to award one grant to each SEA in the 50 States, if appropriations are above a specified amount for a fiscal year. Allows LEAs to use grant funds to: (1) strengthen instruction and learning, provide professional development, and pay the costs of teacher training, related to the use of technologies in instruction; and (2) provide such training by LEA personnel on school premises. Directs the Secretary to evaluate within three years these LEA- developed technology training programs for teachers. Authorizes appropriations."
