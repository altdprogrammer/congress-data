Requires a court to issue such an order if it finds by clear and convincing evidence on an individual basis that: (1) the process of obtaining such consent is not in the best interests of the minor petitioner; or (2) the minor petitioner is an emancipated minor. Sets forth procedures regarding confidentiality, filing of the petition, preference over other proceedings, findings, and expedited appellate review."
