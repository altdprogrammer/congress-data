    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1999-02-10", 
    "text": "Indian Gaming Regulatory Improvement Act of 1999 - Amends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to revise definitions and to repeal: (1) provisions regarding the review of tribal gaming ordinances and management contracts; and (2) provisions requiring the Secretary of the Interior to continue to exercise authorities relating to the supervision of Indian gaming. Requires Indian tribes, with respect to class II gaming, and tribes or States (or both), with respect to class III gaming, in a manner that meets or exceeds the minimum Federal standards established under this Act, to: (1) monitor and regulate that gaming; (2) conduct background investigations; and (3) establish and regulate internal control systems. Directs the National Indian Gaming Commission to promulgate regulations for such minimum Federal standards. Revises tribal gaming ordinance provisions to require the approval of any tribal ordinance or resolution concerning the conduct or regulation of class II gaming on the Indian lands within a tribe's jurisdiction if such ordinance or resolution provides that: (1) all contracts for certain supplies, services, or concessions for a contract amount in excess of $100,000 (currently $25,000) annually relating to such gaming shall be subject to annual outside independent audits; and (2) there is an adequate system which includes the issuance of a separate license by the tribe for each place, facility, or location on Indian lands at which such gaming is conducted. Repeals the requirement permitting certain tribes which operate a class II gaming activity to petition the Commission for a certificate of self-regulation and replaces it with a requirement permitting any tribe that operates a class III gaming activity directly or with a management contract to petition the Commission for a fee reduction if the Commission determines that the tribe has complied with specified conditions, including meeting minimum Federal standards. Requires the Commission to establish a schedule of fees to be paid to the Commission annually by each gaming operation that conducts a class II or class III gaming activity."
