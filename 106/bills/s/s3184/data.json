    "date": "2000-10-11", 
    "text": "Genetically Engineered Foods Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue regulations that require a producer of a genetically engineered food, in order to obtain approval to introduce such food into interstate commerce, to use a specified premarket consultation and approval process. Requires: (1) the producer to submit to the Secretary each summary of research, test results, and related materials concerning such food; and (2) such information to be made publicly available. Requires information submitted to be adequate to allow the Secretary to fully assess the safety of the food. Allows the Secretary to issue a proposed rule that exempts from such regulations: (1) a narrowly defined category of specific genetically engineered foods if at least ten foods in such category have been found to be safe; and (2) genetically engineered foods that the Secretary determines are regulated under other Federal law.Requires the Secretary, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Secretary of Agriculture to prepare and submit to the appropriate congressional committees reports on genetically engineered foods and related concerns.Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) a program for the marketplace testing of genetically engineered foods; and (2) a registry for such foods that includes their regulatory status.Prohibits the introduction into commerce of such foods that do not meet the requirements of this Act. Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to require the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a competitive grant program for research on the economic and environmental risks and benefits of using biotechnology in food production."
