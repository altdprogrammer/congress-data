Requires the aggregate amount of fees assessed to be reasonably related to the costs of Commission services provided to Indian tribes. Outlines specified factors to be considered in such determination, including the extent of regulation of the gaming activity by the State or Indian tribe, and the extent of Indian self-regulating activities. Requires the Commission to consult with Indian tribes in establishing the fee schedule.Requires all fees and civil forfeitures collected by the Commission pursuant to the Act to be maintained in separate, segregated accounts and to be expended only for the purposes set forth in the Act.Places class I gaming on Indian lands within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Indian tribes.

Requires an Indian tribe or a State to conduct such activities with respect to class III gaming conducted under a compact entered into with the Commission, or under a related tribal ordinance or resolution.Authorizes the Commission to provide grants and technical assistance to Indian tribes for training and assistance related to Indian gaming."
