    "text": "Accountability to Congress for Nuclear Transfers to North Korea Act of 2000 - Amends the North Korea Threat Reduction Act of 1999 with respect to the prohibition against any agreement for cooperation between the United States and North Korea, or issuance of a license for the export, or approval for the transfer or retransfer, to North Korea of any nuclear material, facilities, goods, services, or technology that would be subject to such agreement, until the President reports to specified congressional committees that: (1) North Korea has come into full compliance with the Agreed Framework Between the United States of America and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (signed in Geneva on October 21, 1994) and other specified nuclear nonproliferation agreements; (2) has permitted the International Atomic Energy Agency full access to certain nuclear sites and material; (3) does not have uranium enrichment or nuclear reprocessing facilities; and (4) does not have nuclear weapons and is making no effort to acquire them.Prohibits any such agreement, export license, or transfer of any such items unless Congress approves the President's report by enactment of a joint resolution.Subjects to the same prohibition and approval requirements any export license for, or transfer or retransfer to North Korea of, any nuclear material, facilities, goods, services, or technology controlled under the Export Trigger List of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.Declares that in supporting the provision of nuclear reactors to North Korea pursuant to the Agreed Framework, neither the President nor any U.S. agency may enter into any international agreement, contract, or other arrangement to impose liability on the U.S. Government for nuclear accidents that may occur at nuclear reactors provided to North Korea."
