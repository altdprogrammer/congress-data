(Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned (Secretary concerned) to pay a special subsistence allowance of $180 for each month in which an enlisted member in pay grade E-5 or below is eligible to receive food stamp assistance.

(Sec. 110) Authorizes the payment of career enlisted flyer incentive pay to military personnel who: (1) are entitled to military basic pay or payment as a member of the National Guard or reserves; (2) hold a military occupational specialty or rating designated as a career enlisted flyer specialty or rating by the Secretary concerned and continue their proficiency in such specialty or rating; and (3) are qualified for aviation service. Provides payment amounts based on years of aviation service. Prohibits such pay for members already receiving either hazardous duty incentive pay of diving duty special pay.

(Sec. 119) Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the two-month extension of the deadline for filing tax returns for certain military personnel serving outside the United States or Puerto Rico at the time of required filing should be codified; and (2) eligible personnel should be able to use such extension without accumulating interest or penalties.

Authorizes a waiver of the repayment requirement when against equity or good conscience or contrary to the best interests of the United States. (Sec. 202) Authorizes, beginning on July 1, 2000, a member serving on active duty and a member of the Ready Reserve in any pay status to participate in the Federal Thrift Savings Plan, with a maximum annual contribution of five percent of basic pay and any special or incentive pay.

(Sec. 203) Authorizes the Secretary concerned to enter into an agreement to make contributions to the Thrift Savings Fund for the benefit of a member who: (1) is in a specialty designated as critical; and (2) agrees to continue to serve on active duty in such specialty for a period of six years. (Sec. 204) Amends Federal employment law to repeal a required reduction in military retired or retainer pay for retired military personnel who become Federal employees. Title III: Montgomery GI Bill Benefits - Increases for FY 2000 the monthly rate of educational assistance paid to veterans pursuing a program of education on a full-time basis under the veterans' educational assistance program (VEAP). (Sec. 302) Terminates a one-year reduction in the basic pay of military personnel who choose not to participate in VEAP. (Sec. 303) Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, when appropriate, to make accelerated payments under VEAP pursuant to an individual's request. (Sec. 304) Authorizes such Secretary to permit individuals entitled to assistance under VEAP to transfer such assistance to the individual's spouse, one or more children, or a combination thereof.

Title V: Report - Directs the Secretary to submit annually to the Congress an assessment of the effects of this Act on military personnel recruitment and retention. (Sec. 502) Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to the Secretary on the policies, procedures, and practices of the military departments for protecting the confidentiality of communications between a dependent of a member of the armed forces who is a victim of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or intrafamily abuse, or who has engaged in such conduct and a therapist, counselor, or other professional from whom such individual seeks advice. Title VI: Miscellaneous - Amends the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) to direct the Secretary to ensure that the health care coverage available through the TRICARE program (a Department of Defense managed health care program) is substantially similar to the health care coverage available under similar health benefits plans offered under the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. Outlines provisions concerning patient management, reimbursement of health care providers, and the authority for military health care facilities to collect from third-party insurers the costs of health care services provided to covered beneficiaries. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress assessing the effects of the implementation of this section. (Sec. 602) Expresses the sense of the Senate urging the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to: (1) review the policies and procedures of the Veterans Benefits Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs to identify areas in which such Administration does not currently process claims for veterans' benefits in a manner consistent with objectives set forth in the National Performance Review; (2) initiate necessary actions to process such claims in such manner; and (3) report to the Congress on measures taken to improve processing time for such claims. (Sec. 603) Adds lung cancer, colon cancer, and tumors of the brain and central nervous system to the list of diseases which will be presumed to be service-connected and, therefore, compensable under veterans' compensation or benefits provisions. (Sec. 604) Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to authorize the Secretaries of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Veterans Affairs (VA) (the administering Secretaries) to establish a demonstration project under which the HHS Secretary reimburses the VA Secretary for Medicare health care services furnished to certain veterans at a VA medical facility. Makes eligible for such services a veteran who has attained age 65, is entitled to Medicare benefits, and was enrolled for Medicare benefits on the date of enactment of the Veterans' Equal Access to Medicare Act. Requires voluntary participation of eligible veterans under the demonstration program. Directs the administering Secretaries to establish a data matching program under which there is an exchange of information between HHS and VA to identify those entitled to such benefits. Allows the administering Secretaries to select up to ten demonstration sites in geographically dispersed areas for program participation. Requires at least one site to: (1) be near a base which was closed under a defense base closure law; and (2) serve a predominately rural population area. Requires the demonstration project to be conducted during the three-year period beginning on January 1, 2000. Authorizes the HHS Secretary to waive certain Medicare requirements in connection with the program. Requires the administering Secretaries to submit to the appropriate congressional committees a copy of the demonstration program agreement. Authorizes the VA Secretary to establish and operate up to four managed health care plans at demonstration sites. Requires such Secretary to submit to the Congress a plan for the use of appropriate sites and entities. Requires certain certifications from the VA Inspector General before a plan may be implemented. Directs the HHS Secretary to reimburse the VA Secretary for demonstration project services at specified rates. Provides for such payments from Medicare trust funds, with an annual limit of $50 million. Authorizes the reduction of such reimbursement payments for VA failure to maintain its effort level for targeted veterans. Directs the administering Secretaries to closely monitor the expenditures made under the Medicare program for targeted veterans during the period of the demonstration project compared to expenditures that would have been made for such veterans if the demonstration project had not been conducted. Requires: (1) an annual report by the Comptroller General during each year of the demonstration project; (2) the administering Secretaries to take certain steps in the case of increased costs under the demonstration project; (3) the administering Secretaries to arrange for an independent evaluation of the demonstration project; (4) annual reports from such independent entity during the demonstration project period; and (5) a report from the administering Secretaries on the possibility of extending the demonstration project, making it permanent, or expanding it to cover additional demonstration sites."
