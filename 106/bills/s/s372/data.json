Allocates amounts (out of those amounts for support for the independent states of the former Soviet Union under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961) for specified international informational and educational exchange programs for the Russian Federation. Authorizes the President to study the feasibility of establishing a foundation for the promotion of democratic institutions in the Russian Federation. Expresses the sense of Congress that such foundation should be known as the Starovoitova Foundation for Russian Democracy in honor of the former member of the State Duma who was assassinated in St. Petersburg in November 1998. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Edmund S. Muskie Fellowship Program with the Russian Federation."
