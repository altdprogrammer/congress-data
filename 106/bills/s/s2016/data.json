    "text": "Nuclear Regulatory Commission Authorization and Improvements Act of 2000 - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to repeal the mandate for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to maintain an office in the District of Columbia for the service of process.(Sec. 4) Restricts the initial duration of a combined construction and operating license to 40 years from the date on which the NRC finds that certain acceptance criteria have been met prior to facility operation.(Sec. 5) Limits to production facilities only the current prohibition against granting either a commercial license or a medical therapy and research and development license to an alien or a corporation or other entity under foreign ownership or domination (thus allowing such licenses for utilization and other kinds of facilities).(Sec. 6) Shields from NRC antitrust scrutiny certain industrial and commercial license applications to construct or operate utilization facilities.(Sec. 7) Confers gift acceptance authority upon the NRC. Establishes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Fund to accept gifts or net proceeds of gift sales.(Sec. 8) Authorizes the NRC to authorize employees of NRC licensees to carry firearms for the protection of licensee property designated of significance to or necessary in the interest of the common defense and security.(Sec. 9) Authorizes the NRC to prescribe and collect cost recovery fees from other Federal agencies.(Sec. 12) Encompasses within NRC police powers: (1) installations subject to its licensing or certification authority; (2) facilities for storage, treatment, or disposal; and (3) facilities for production, utilization, waste storage, treatment and disposal, and uranium enrichment, or nuclear fuel fabrication.(Sec. 14) Directs the NRC to promulgate requirements to ensure that a non-licensee complies fully with any nuclear decommissioning obligation.(Sec. 15) Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to provide for continuation of service until a successor has taken office of an NRC member whose term of office has expired.(Sec. 16) Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to prohibit commencement of administrative or judicial actions regarding source, special nuclear, or byproduct material that is subject to NRC or State-issued decontamination regulations unless the action is pursuant to NRC or State request.(Sec. 17) Authorizes appropriations for FY2001, including those for the Office of Inspector General of the NRC."
