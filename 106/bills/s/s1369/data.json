    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1999-07-14", 
    "text": "Clean Energy Act of 1999 - Sets deadlines by which the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (the Administrator) is directed to: (1) promulgate a final regulation to establish a schedule of limits on the quantity of certain pollutants that all covered generation facilities in the aggregate nationwide shall be permitted to emit in each calendar year; and (2) determine the generation performance standard for such pollutants per megawatt- hour of electric production by covered generation facilities for the next calendar year. Prescribes guidelines for an annual individual emissions allocation formula. Instructs the Administrator to: (1) establish a system for the accurate monitoring of the quantity of each pollutant annually emitted by a covered generation facility; (2) compare the quantity of a pollutant emitted annually by a generation facility with the individual emissions allocation applicable to the facility for the year; and (3) issue emissions credits to a covered generation facility for reduced pollutant emissions. Sets forth a penalty schedule for noncompliance by an owner or operator of a covered generation facility required to submit an emissions credit. Prohibits a generating plant from emitting specified pollutants if the Administrator determines, upon review, that an emissions rate of specified pollutants in excess of the generation performance standard can be reasonably anticipated to cause or contribute to significant adverse local impacts. Establishes a civil penalty for noncompliance. (Sec.5) Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a National Electric System Public Benefits Board (the Board). Requires the Board to establish at a financial institution the \"National Electric System Public Benefits Fund\" to provide matching funds to support specified State public service energy programs. Prescribes funding guidelines and implementation. (Sec.7) Sets forth renewable energy portfolio standards for a nonhydroelectric facility that generates electric energy for sale (covered generation facility). Directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to: (1) establish standards and procedures for certification by a covered generation facility to a purchaser of electricity regarding the amount of electricity generated by renewable and non-renewable energy sources; (2) issue renewable energy credits to covered generation facilities; and (3) maintain records of all renewable energy credit issued and all those sold or exchanged by a covered generation facility. Imposes a civil penalty upon a covered generation facility for noncompliance. Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to repeal its provisions governing cogeneration and small power production facilities. Retains: (1) the validity of contracts entered under such provisions; and (2) FERC jurisdiction to ensure continued status of such facilities and specified exemptions under those provisions. (Sec.8) Requires an electric company to allow a retail electric customer to interconnect and employ a net metering system using specified equipment. Prescribes guidelines governing: (1) net metering accounting and measurements; (2)electricity supplied exceeding electricity generated; (3) electricity generated exceeding electricity supplied; (4) unused credit; and (5) safety requirements. (Sec.9) Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a disclosure system enabling retail consumers to knowledgeably compare retail electric services; (2) promulgate regulations in consultation with a specified interagency Federal task force governing disclosures of emissions and electricity generation data. Deems failure of a retail company to accurately disclose such requisite data as a deceptive act in commerce under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Grants the Secretary enforcement powers. Precludes a State or political subdivision from adopting or enforcing any emission standard or limitation that is less stringent that mandated by this Act."
