    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Federal Commission on Statistical Policy Title II: Efficiency and Confidentiality of Federal Statistical Systems Federal Commission on Statistical Policy Act of 1999 - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) a more centralized statistical system is integral to efficiency; (2) the Chief Statistician must have the authority, personnel, and other resources necessary to carry out the duties of that office effectively, including duties relating to statistical forms clearance; and (3) statistical forms clearance at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should be better distinguished from regulatory forms clearance. Title I: Federal Commission on Statistical Policy - Establishes the Federal Commission on Statistical Policy to study and submit to the Congress and the President a specified report and draft legislation on the reorganization of the Federal statistical system, including recommendations: (1) on whether the Federal statistical system could be reorganized by consolidating the statistical functions of agencies that carry out statistical programs; (2) on how such consolidation could be achieved without disruption in the release of statistical products; (3) on possible improvements to procedures for the release of major economic and social indicators; and (4) to ensure that State data and information be maintained in a confidential, consistent, and comparable manner. Sets forth provisions for presidential review of the report. Provides that if the report recommends consolidating statistical functions into a Federal Statistical Service, the report shall contain draft legislation incorporating such recommendations. Requires the Commission to also conduct comprehensive studies and submit reports to the Congress on all matters relating to the Federal statistical infrastructure. (Sec. 107) Terminates the Commission three years after the enactment of this Act. (Sec. 108) Sets forth expedited procedures for the consideration of a statistical reorganization bill of either House of the Congress. (Sec. 109) Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Efficiency and Confidentiality of Federal Statistical Systems - Statistical Confidentiality Act - Designates Federal Statistical Data Centers within various Federal departments and agencies. (Sec. 204) Allows the OMB Director, in the case of a reorganization that eliminates or substantially alters the mission of an agency or agency component listed, to designate an agency or component to serve as a successor Statistical Data Center under specified conditions. Requires the head of an agency seeking designation as a successor, after consultation with the Director, to provide public notice and an opportunity to comment on the consequences of such designation and on those determinations upon which the designation is proposed to be based. (Sec. 205) Requires, among other things, that Statistical Data Centers: (1) identify opportunities to eliminate duplication and otherwise reduce the reporting burden and cost imposed on the public by sharing information for exclusively statistical purposes; and (2) safeguard the confidentiality of identifiable information acquired for statistical purposes. (Sec. 206) Requires data or information acquired by a Statistical Data Center for exclusively statistical purposes to be used only for such purposes, and to not be disclosed in identifiable form for any other purpose without the informed consent of the respondent. Limits the disclosure of data or information for statistical purposes. (Sec. 207) Provides for coordination and oversight of confidentiality and disclosure policies by the Director. Requires the head of a Statistical Data Center to report to OMB: (1) each disclosure agreement entered into; (2) the results of any review of information security undertaken at the request of OMB; and (3) the results of any similar review undertaken on the initiative of the Statistical Data Center or an agency supplying data or information. Requires the Director to include a summary of all reports submitted to the Director and any actions taken by the Director to advance the purposes of this title in OMB's annual report to the Congress on statistical programs. (Sec. 208) Permits the Director or the head of a Statistical Data Center or agency providing information to a Center to promulgate implementation rules."
