Requires: (1) the Director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse to conduct a study regarding the effectiveness of non-pharmacological heroin rehabilitation programs and methadone-to-abstinence programs; and (2) the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit annual reports to Congress over a five-year period on heroin rehabilitation program effectiveness."
