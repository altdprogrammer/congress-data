Includes such amounts as deficit decreases in OMB estimates and sequestration reports unless offset by legislation decreasing revenues. Reduces the discretionary caps by amounts equal to such deficit decreases. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to provide that revenue decreases offset as provided by this Act shall not be treated as increasing the deficit."
