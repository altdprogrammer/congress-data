Title II: Expanded Health Services for Disabled Individuals - Amends SSA title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI)) to extend to 24 months the period of Medicare coverage after returning to work for recipients of OASDI disability benefits. Provides for such recipients to \"buy-into\" Medicare at a reduced rate, subject to annual review. (Sec. 202) Amends SSA title XIX (Medicaid) to require a State to permit an individual entitled to Medicaid for nursing facility services or intermediate care facility services for the mentally retarded to choose to receive medical assistance for qualified community-based attendant services (rather than institutional services), in the most integrated setting appropriate to the individual's needs, so long as the aggregate amount of Federal expenditures for such individuals in a fiscal year does not exceed the total that would have been expended for them to receive institutional services, plus a specified decreasing transitional allotment each fiscal year between FY 2000 and 2005. Allows for reimbursement for such services without regard to the recipient's age or the nature of the disability. Requires a State to develop a long-term care services transition plan to increase the proportion of such services provided in home and community-based, rather than institutional, settings. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) report to Congress on how excessive utilization of medical services can be reduced by using qualified community-based attendant services; (2) develop an instrument to assess the functional needs of an individual for qualified community-based attendant services; and (3) establish a task force to examine appropriate methods of financing long-term care services.
