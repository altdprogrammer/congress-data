Permits refunds to be made in accordance with otherwise applicable law on account of an individual becoming ineligible to participate in CSRS or FERS as a result of this Act's enactment (provides that, for purposes of any such refund, a Member who becomes ineligible to participate in either of the retirement systems shall be treated as if separated from service).Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) annuities; and (2) preservation of rights based on prior service.Amends the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1965 to provide for the disclosure of information necessary to enable the public to accurately compute the Federal retirement benefits of each Member based on various assumptions of years of service and age of separation from service by reason of retirement.Eliminates for Members automatic: (1) annuity cost-of-living adjustments; and (2) pay adjustments under the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946.Requires a roll call vote for any matter relating to congressional pay."
