    "text": "21st Century Master Teacher Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to establish a Master Teacher Program and a Competency Examination Program under ESEA title II (Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program). Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to provide for information campaigns regarding professional opportunities in elementary or secondary education, under HEA title II (Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants for States and Partnerships).(Sec. 2) Revises ESEA title II to authorize the Secretary of Education to make competitive five-year grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to establish master teacher programs that provide: (1) funding assistance to teachers to become board certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, including the provision of the board certification fee; and (2) salary incentives to teachers who become board certified. Gives priority to LEAs that already provide such assistance and incentives. Requires the Secretary to establish peer review panels to review LEA applications and make recommendations on which ones should be approved. Requires LEA matching funds. Requires teachers receiving such assistance to: (1) enter and complete the board certification program; and (2) upon becoming board certified, teach in a public school system for at least five years. Authorizes appropriations.Revises ESEA title II to authorize the Secretary to: (1) enter into an agreement with the Center for Science, Mathematics, and Engineering of the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, under which the Center shall develop an advanced competency examination for elementary school and secondary school teachers of mathematics and science; and (2) make grants to LEAs to assist them in supplementing the salaries of teachers that pass such examination. Requires such LEAs to provide an additional $2,500 in salary for each grant year to teachers who have passed the examination and teach in schools served by the LEA. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 3) Revises HEA title II to authorize the Secretary to enter into contracts with appropriate entities to conduct information campaigns to broaden awareness of, and encourage mid-career professionals and other qualified individuals to consider, professional opportunities relating to elementary or secondary education. Requires announcements distributed as part of such information campaigns to publicize the availability of Federal assistance under HEA to obtain the necessary education, and to obtain certification or licensing, for such professional opportunities. Makes certain administrative, accountability, and evaluation provisions inapplicable to such contracts and campaigns. Authorizes appropriations."
