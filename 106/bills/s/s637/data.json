Makes it unlawful for any person who is not a licensed firearm manufacturer, importer, or dealer to transfer a firearm pursuant to a listing of the firearm for sale or exchange on an Internet website to any person other than the website operator. Prescribes criminal penalties for willful violations of such prohibition."
