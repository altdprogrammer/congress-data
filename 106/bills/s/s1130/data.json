Declares that such prohibition does not apply to liability imposed under a State's statutory or common law based on negligence of a motor vehicle owner. Declares that nothing in this Act supersedes any State law: (1) imposing financial responsibility or insurance standards on the owner of a motor vehicle for the privilege of registering and operating a motor vehicle; or (2) imposing liability on such companies for failure to meet financial responsibility or liability insurance requirements under State law."
