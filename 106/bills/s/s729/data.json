Requires the Secretaries, prior to making any recommendations for declaration of a national monument in an area, to: (1) ensure compliance with all applicable Federal land management and environmental laws; (2) cause mineral surveys to be conducted by the Geological Survey to determine the mineral values that may be present in the area; (3) cause an assessment of the land's surface resource values to be completed and made available by the appropriate agencies; (4) identify all existing rights held on Federal land contained within such area; and (5) identify all State and private land contained within such area. Requires: (1) either Secretary, on completion of such reviews and mineral surveys, to submit to the President recommendations as to whether any area on Federal land warrants declaration as a national monument; and (2) no later than two years after the receipt of such a recommendation, the President to advise the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the President's recommendations and provide them with maps and descriptions of the boundaries of those areas evaluated for declaration."
