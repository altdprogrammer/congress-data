    "text": "Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to permit an exchange that lists or trades security future products to register as a national securities exchange solely for the purpose of trading such products if it: (1) is a board of trade designated as a contract market not subject to a suspension order by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC); and (2) does not serve as a market place for securities other than security future products, or futures on exempted securities or groups or indexes of securities authorized by CFTC order or options thereon.Provides that such registration shall be effective immediately upon filing of the written notice with the SEC.Revises guidelines governing proposed rule changes by self-regulatory organizations to require: (1) the National Futures Organization and certain self-regulatory organizations to file proposed rule changes concurrently with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and with the CFTC; and (2) the SEC to consult with the CFTC regarding proposed rule changes.Prescribes guidelines (including expedited registration procedures) controlling the National Futures Association as a registered national securities association for the limited purpose of regulating the activities of members who are brokers and dealers in security future products.Exempts the Association from compliance with specified requirements under the SEC and the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970.Prescribes implementation guidelines with respect to: (1) interagency cooperation; (2) addition of security future products to option-specific enforcement; (3) listing standards controlling trading of security future products; (4) mandatory enforcement consultation between the SEC and the CFTC; (5) incorporation of security future products into the national market system, the national system for clearance and settlement, and into market emergency powers and circuit breakers.Amends the following Acts to reflect the provisions of this Act: (1) the Securities Act of 1933; (2) the Investment Company Act of 1940; and (3) the Investment Advisers Act of 1940."
