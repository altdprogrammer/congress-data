Permits the use of a pesticide only if the pesticide has been disclosed in such notice.Prescribes procedures to be followed if a pest cannot be controlled after having used an integrated pest management system and least toxic pesticides, including prior notification of parents, guardians, and staff members of the use of a pesticide and posting of signs. Prescribes alternative procedures in emergency situations.Provides for public comments, through school board meetings, on integrated pest management systems.
