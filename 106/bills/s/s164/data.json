    "text": "Math and Science Learning Improvement Act of 1999 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to State Governors or State educational agencies upon determining that the average score of eighth grade students in a State on the 1999 retake of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study is or would be lower than the median of the scores of the countries participating in such retake. Sets minimum and maximum amounts for such a grant. Directs the Secretary to use the results of the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress for comparisons between States and countries with respect to such retake. Requires use of such grant funds to improve mathematics and science instruction in the State. Authorizes appropriations."
