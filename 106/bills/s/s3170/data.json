Requires grantees to use such funds to provide: (1) additional grant aid to students in their first two years of postsecondary education who are receiving Federal Pell Grants; or (2) intensive summer programs for incoming first-year students (and, under certain conditions, second- or third-year students). Allows grantees to use such funds to serve students who have completed their first two years of postsecondary education if they are at high risk of dropping out of school and if the grantee will first meet the needs of all its eligible first- and second-year students for services under this Act."
