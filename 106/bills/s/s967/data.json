Sets forth exceptions where a person is authorized to carry a firearm: (1) under Federal law; (2) under a State law that grants an exemption based on an individualized determination based on a review of credible evidence that the person should be allowed to carry a firearm because of compelling circumstances (not including a claim of concern about generalized or unspecified risks); or (3) under a State law that provides an exemption for any person who is a law enforcement or retired law enforcement official, a duly authorized private security officer, a person whose employment involves the transport of substantial amounts of cash or other valuables, or anyone the Attorney General determines should be allowed to carry a firearm because of compelling circumstances under regulations that the Attorney General may promulgate."
