Directs the Secretary of Labor, upon the written request of any person, to make available the complete copies of a labor organization's constitution, bylaws, and annual financial reports. (Currently, such documents may be inspected but there is no specific requirement to make available complete copies.)(Sec. 302) Amends FECA to require corporations, required by any Federal law to submit annual reports to shareholders, to disclose the aggregate amount of donations made and the name of the political committee to which each donation was made.Title IV: Elimination of Election Campaign Excesses - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the solicitation or receipt of donations (as well as contributions) on Federal property. (Currently, the prohibition is limited to solicitation or receipt of contributions.)(Sec. 402) Amends FECA to set forth provisions concerning the return to donors of certain contributions and donations.(Sec. 403) Prohibits an individual's aggregate (soft money) donations to a national committee of a political party (or any subordinate committee of a national party) or a Senatorial or Congressional Campaign Committee of a national political party (or an entity that is either directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained, controlled by, or acting on behalf of, such a committee) from exceeding, in the aggregate, $100,000 during a calendar year.Increases the following limits: (1) from $20,000 to $50,000, the limit on an individual's contributions to political committees of a national political party; and (2) from $25,000 to $50,000, the limit on an individual's aggregate contributions.(Sec. 404) Revises provisions concerning the prohibition on the conversion of contributions to personal use.Title V: Enhanced Disclosure - Amends FECA to revise certain reporting requirements with respect to candidates, including requiring the treasurer of a candidate's principal campaign committee to file weekly reports beginning 30 days before a general election.(Sec. 502) Directs the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to make information contained in FECA reports available on the Internet and at FEC offices.(Sec. 503) Sets forth provisions requiring the reporting of independent expenditures made within 20 days before an election which, in the aggregate, total more than $1,000. Requires, in addition, a report within 48 hours when during such time, in the aggregate, they total more than $10,000.(Sec. 504) Amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, regarding semiannual reports by registered lobbyists, to require: (1) such lobbyists to disclose contributions and donations in such reports; and (2) such reports to include specified information if the registrant, the registrant's employer, or a separate segregated fund of such employer made contributions or donations to covered executive branch officials, covered legislative branch officials, or political committees.Title VI: Federal Election Commission Reform - Amends FECA to: (1) provide for the filing of reports using computers and facsimile (fax) machines; (2) revise the term limit for members of the FEC to establish a single term of eight years for new members; (3) increase the penalty for knowing and willful violations of FECA or of IRC provisions relating to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account; (4) permit an individual who is responding with a brief to an alleged violation of FECA or of the preceding IRC provisions to submit, with the brief, a request to present oral arguments before the FEC; (5) establish civil penalties for minor reporting violations; (6) change certain reporting from a calendar year basis to an election cycle basis; and (7) provide for the appointment of the staff director and general counsel of the FEC by the President, subject to Senate confirmation (currently such appointments are made by the FEC).Title VII: Improvements to the National Voter Registration Act - Amends the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to: (1) repeal the requirement for States to provide for voter registration by mail; (2) require applicants registering to vote to provide certain additional information; (3) permit States to remove certain registrants from the official list of eligible voters; (4) permit States to require voters to produce a valid photographic identification and provide a signature (unless illiterate or disabled) before receiving a ballot for voting; and (5) repeal the requirement that States permit registrants who have changed residence and now have a new polling place, but are still within the same registrar's jurisdiction and the same congressional district, to vote at the polling place for their former address."
