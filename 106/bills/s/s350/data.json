    "text": "Military Health Care Improvement Act of 1999 - Amends the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) to direct the Secretary of Defense to ensure that the medical and dental coverage available through the TRICARE program (a Department of Defense managed health care program) is substantially similar to the medical and dental coverage available under the Federal Employees Health Benefits program that has the most subscribers as of January 1, 2000. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide for the portability of benefits under the TRICARE program; and (2) minimize the certification requirements imposed upon TRICARE beneficiaries. Authorizes the Secretary to increase the level of reimbursement provided to TRICARE health care providers when necessary to ensure an adequate number of qualified providers under such program."
