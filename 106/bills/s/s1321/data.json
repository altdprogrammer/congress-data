Limits grants to three-year terms. Requires the Attorney General and the Secretary of HHS to distribute to each State child welfare service agency and domestic violence coalition and to Congress a summary of information on: (1) the activities funded with grants under this section; and (2) any related initiatives undertaken to promote attention by the staff of child welfare service agencies and community-based domestic violence programs to domestic violence and its impact on child and adult victims. Provides for technical assistance to grant recipients. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 7) Authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to States and Indian tribal governments to enable them to enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with nonprofit entities to assist such entities in establishing supervised visitation centers for visitation and visitation exchange by and between parents.
