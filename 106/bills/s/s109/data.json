Authorizes the Secretary to accept the donation of funds and lands or interests in lands to carry out this Act.Requires the Secretary to submit: (1) the initial general management plan for the Area to the House Committee on Resources (currently, Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs); and (2) within three years after funds are made available, a revision of such plan to specified congressional committees."
