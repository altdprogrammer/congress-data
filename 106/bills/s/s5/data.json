(Sec. 1012) Grants the Attorney General the authority, if a person is being held in pretrial detention or is otherwise in custody in a foreign county based upon a violation of the law in that country and the person is found extraditable to the United States by the competent authorities of that country while still in pretrial detention or custody, to: (1) request the temporary transfer of that person to the United States to face prosecution in a Federal or State criminal proceeding; (2) maintain the custody of that person while he or she is in the United States; and (3) return that person to the foreign country at the conclusion of the criminal prosecution, including any imposition of sentence.

Grants such judge or magistrate the authority to issue orders to execute the request. (Sec. 1028) Grants the Attorney General authority to temporarily transfer a person who is serving a sentence, is in pretrial detention, or is otherwise being held in U.S. custody, whose testimony is needed in a foreign criminal proceeding, subject to specified requirements, if such transfer is consistent with the international obligations of the United States.

(Sec. 1202) Prohibits any funds appropriated for any fiscal year after FY 1999 for U.S. counter-drug or counter-narcotics activities from being obligated or expended for such activities between November 1 of such fiscal year and the later of the notification date required in such fiscal year under provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 regarding authority to transfer excess defense articles or the date of the submittal of the plans required by this subtitle.

Subtitle D: Money Laundering Deterrence - Money Laundering Deterrence Act of 1999 - Revises Federal law to expand the scope of immunity from civil liability for disclosures of suspicious monetary transactions made by: (1) a financial institution and any of its directors, officers, employees, or agents to an appropriate governmental agency; or (2) an independent accountant who audits a financial institution. Extends such immunity to any failure to notify either the subject of such disclosure, or any other person identified in it. Prohibits notification of such disclosures or their contents: (1) to any person involved in the suspect transaction; or (2) by any government staff to other government agencies. Exempts from such prohibition any use of related information by government officers in the conduct of either official duties or law enforcement, regulatory, or investigative proceedings. States that written employment references submitted by a financial institution to another upon request may disclose information concerning possible involvement in suspicious transactions relevant to possible illegalities. Shields from civil liability any financial institution and its directors, officers, employees, and agents for any such disclosures. Authorizes the Secretary to disseminate information contained in such reports to certain self-regulatory organizations subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, if the Securities and Exchange Commission determines it is necessary or appropriate for such organizations' statutory functions.
