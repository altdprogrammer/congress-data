    "date": "2000-05-16", 
    "text": "Campaign Finance Reform and Disclosure Act of 2000 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit contributions to candidates for political office by any individual who is not a U.S. citizen, regardless of whether or not he or she is not lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence. (Currently, such prohibition applies only to non-citizen who is not lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.)Limits to 40 percent of total contributions acceptance of out-of-State contributions by Senate candidates.Limits reimbursement from campaigns for contributions by Senate candidates and their immediate families. Restricts the use of campaign funds by Senate candidates for personal purposes.Limits congressional use of the franking privilege during a year in which there will be an election for the Member's seat unless the Member makes a public announcement that he or she will not be a candidate for election to any Federal office in that year.Decreases from $5,000 to $1,000 the multicandidate political committee (PAC) contribution limit, and requires that such limit be indexed annually (but never lowered).Prohibits a political party committee from accepting contributions conditioned on their use on behalf of a particular candidate.Exempts communications between a political party and members of the political party from specified spending limitations.Excludes from the definition of contribution State or local political party committee payments for certain State and local activities.Amends the National Labor Relations Act to revise the rights of employees relating to the payment and use of labor organization dues to require an employee's written consent to the use or assignment of any portion of such dues for purposes unrelated to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment.Provides for expedited Supreme Court review of constitutional issues of this Act or any amendment made by this Act."
