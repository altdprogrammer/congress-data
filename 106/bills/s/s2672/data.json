Requires the District to be relieved of all payment obligations relating to the Project and requires all debt under the Water Services Contract to be extinguished upon the District's payment of a specified amount to the Secretary of the Interior. Provides that the District shall continue to be obligated to make Project payments under the Central Valley Project Improvement Act through 2029.States that on payment of such amount: (1) the Project shall no longer be a Federal reclamation project or a unit of the Central Valley Project; and (2) the District shall not be entitled to receive any further reclamation benefits.Directs the Chief of the Forest Service, upon such conveyance, to grant the District the right to occupy and flood portions of land in Tahoe National Forest, subject to the terms and conditions stated in an agreement between the District and the Supervisor of such Forest.Allows the Secretary, to the extent that costs associated with the Project are included as a reimbursable cost of the Central Valley Project, to exclude such costs in excess of the amount of costs repaid by the District from such Project's pooled reimbursable costs until the Project is operationally integrated into the water supply yield of such Project."
