    "text": "Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2000 - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to extend to August 1, 2012, the indemnification authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with respect to licensees and nonprofit educational institutions. Makes such indemnification authority permanent for the Department of Energy (DOE) with respect to contractors.(Sec. 3) Increases from $10 million to $20 million the maximum amount of standard deferred premium that may be charged a licensee following a nuclear incident in any one year for each facility for which the licensee is required to maintain the maximum amount of primary financial protection.(Sec. 4) Sets a $10 billion ceiling upon the aggregate DOE liability limit pursuant to DOE indemnification agreements and for each nuclear incident.Provides that all agreements which obligate DOE to indemnify a person are deemed to be amended to reflect the indemnification amount for both public liability and any applicable financial protection required of the contractor as of the date of enactment of this Act.(Sec. 5) Increases from $100 million to $500 million the indemnification amount and the aggregate public liability limitation due from DOE for incidents outside the United States.(Sec. 7) Directs the Secretary of Energy to adjust the indemnification agreement amount in accordance with the aggregate percentage change in the Consumer Price Index at least once during each five-year period.(Sec. 8) Repeals the directive to the Secretary to determine whether a nonprofit educational institution should receive an automatic remission of any penalties for violations of DOE regulations.Shields a nonprofit contractor, subcontractor, or supplier from a civil penalty in excess of any performance fee paid by the Secretary."
