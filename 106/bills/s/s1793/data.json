    "text": "Nuclear Decommissioning Assurance Act of 1999 - Permits a nuclear power facility licensee to petition the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), for a determination of whether: (1) adequate amounts are deposited in its nuclear decommissioning trust fund; and (2) future funding for any nuclear power plant is assured for any nuclear power plant owned in whole or in part by such licensee.Sets a time frame by which the NRC must issue a determination whether the nuclear decommissioning trust fund and the currently approved decommissioning recovery cost rates are adequate to ensure full and safe facility decommissioning. Details mandatory NRC considerations.Amends the Federal Power Act to permit an electric utility that owns a nuclear power facility in whole or in part to petition the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), for an order approving rates and charges in connection with wholesale transmission or sale of electricity to ensure collection of revenues necessary to ensure adequate funding to satisfy its decommissioning obligations.Provides that in such petition proceeding any nuclear decommissioning assurance determination made under this Act shall be conclusive. Permits a utility whose request has been denied to seek judicial review."
