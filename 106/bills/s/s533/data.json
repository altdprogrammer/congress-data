    "text": "Interstate Transportation of Municipal Solid Waste Control Act of 1999 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize a Governor of a State that imported more than 1 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) during 1998 to: (1) restrict the quantity of such waste received for disposal at each landfill during a calendar year to the quantity received at the landfill during 1998; (2) restrict the quantity in calendar years succeeding the year the State first imports more than 1 million tons of such waste to the quantity received for disposal at the landfill to the first calendar year of such importation; and (3) prohibit, beginning in 2001, importation of such waste from a \"super exporting State\" (one that exports to other States at least 6 million tons of such waste in the aggregate). Prohibits discrimination against any particular landfill, against shipments on the basis of State of origin, or contrary to State law. Authorizes a Governor, upon written request of an affected local government and subject to certain documentation requirements, to: (1) increase the annual quantity of out-of-State waste to be disposed at a landfill; and (2) terminate the prohibition on imports from super exporting States. Prohibits a landfill from receiving any such waste unless it is received under: (1) specified exemptions regarding the metropolitan statistical area and a per landfill maximum tonnage; or (2) authorization from the affected local government or pursuant to a host community agreement (a legally binding document executed by local government officials specifically authorizing a landfill or incinerator to receive out-of-State MSW) entered into before enactment of this Act. Sets forth information and notification requirements applicable to the authorization process. Requires reports of out-of-State MSW activity by owners and operators and by States. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to publish a list disclosing, for each State, quantities of out-of-State MSW imports and exports. Allows States that import MSW for disposal in a landfill in the State to impose and collect fees on such importation."
