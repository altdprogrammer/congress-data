    "text": "Professional Development Reform Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to establish a new program for the professional development of elementary and secondary school teachers. Directs the Secretary of Education to make program allotments to applicant State educational agencies (SEAs) according to a specified formula. Requires an SEA to reserve not more than five percent of its allotment to support programs to provide effective leadership and mentoring training to school administrators and teachers. Allows an SEA also to reserve the following portions of its allotment: (1) two percent for technical assistance and information dissemination to schools and local educational agencies (LEAs) for professional development activities aligned with State standards for content, student performance, and teaching excellence; and (2) two percent for evaluation of effectiveness, in certain respects, of professional development provided by schools and LEAs, and for administrative costs. Requires SEAs to allocate to eligible applicant LEAs all allotment funds not so reserved. Bases an LEA's eligibility for such allocations on its eligibility for assistance for basic LEA programs to help disadvantaged children meet high standards. Requires each recipient LEA to use its allocation to carry out specified types of professional development activities in the schools it serves that have the highest percentages of students living in poverty. Provides for continuation of funding under specified conditions. Directs the Secretary to reserve not more than five percent of the amount appropriated under this Act for each fiscal year for: (1) a national evaluation, including State evaluation reports and a report to Congress; and (2) dissemination activities, including a national database or clearinghouse. Authorizes appropriations."
