    "text": "Congressional Regulatory Review Reform Act of 2000 - Amends Federal law to require any Federal agency promulgating a major rule to submit it to each House of Congress for approval by joint resolution enacted according to a specified procedure.Defines major rule as any rule that the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget finds has resulted in or is likely to result in: (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic and export markets. Excludes from the meaning of major rule any rule promulgated under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the amendments made by that Act.Declares that any major rule approved by a joint resolution (other than one deemed passed) shall not be subject to judicial review.Authorizes the President to establish by Executive order a program for the systematic review of rules."
