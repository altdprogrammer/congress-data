Allows funds withheld from a State during FY 2004 to be available for up to three fiscal years after such date (to allow a State to meet such requirement within such period), but allows no grace period with respect to funds withheld during subsequent fiscal years.(Sec. 343) Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to waive, without charge, any terms contained in the deed conveying U.S. lands to a public institution of higher education in Oklahoma that restrict the use of such land that, as of the date of enactment of this Act, is not being used for the operation of an airport or for air traffic."
