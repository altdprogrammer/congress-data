Provides that at least five of such projects shall require participating health care providers to report adverse events and health- or medication-related errors to the patient and patient's family member. Permits the use of reported information only for purposes of evaluating the ability to reduce errors in delivery of care. Subjects such information to confidentiality requirements and makes it inadmissible as evidence in any civil or criminal action. Prohibits disclosure of such information under the Freedom of Information Act as well.Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide for establishment of a national database of medical errors to contain information collected under this Act; (2) provide information to educate patients and family members about their role in reducing medical errors; (3) develop programs that encourage patients to take a more active role in their medical treatment; and (4) make grants to health professional associations and other organizations to provide training in ways to reduce medical errors.Requires the Secretary to report to appropriate congressional committees on: (1) costs associated with implementing a program that identifies factors that contribute to errors and which includes upgrading the heath care computer systems and other technologies in the United States to reduce medical errors; and (2) the success of each demonstration project, data collected by States, best methods for reducing medical errors and costs associated with applying such methods, and sharing information on best practices to reduce such errors in Federal health care programs.Authorizes appropriations."
