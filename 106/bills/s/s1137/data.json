    "text": "Integrated Oil Company Antitrust Act - Amends the Clayton Act to prohibit an integrated oil company, including any affiliate thereof, from merging with or acquiring a controlling interest in another integrated oil company, unless: (1) the Attorney General of the United States finds that the proposed merger or acquisition will promote competition in the oil industry; and (2) the acquiring company agrees to make available for sale to refiners that are not part of an integrated oil company and to independent marketers sufficient quantities of crude oil and petroleum product to ensure adequate competition and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approves that agreement. Requires the Attorney General to report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees within ten days after making a finding that the proposed merger or acquisition will promote competition in the oil industry, including an analysis of the effect of the merger or acquisition on such competition. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the application process and shared Attorney General-FTC decision-making regarding the application; and (2) U.S. district court jurisdiction."
