Requires individuals whose period of obligated service is: (1) two years to serve at least 20 months before such eligibility; and (2) three years to serve at least 30 months before such eligibility. Revises the amount of such assistance based on the initial period of obligated duty. Limits the eligibility period for such benefits to ten years after either the enactment of this Act or the date of the individual's last discharge or release from active duty, whichever is later.(Sec. 104) Authorizes participants in the Veterans Educational Assistance Program who have continuously served on active duty since October 9, 1996, through at least April 1, 2000, to enroll in the GI Bill Program. Provides a one-year enrollment period. Requires monthly pay reductions to cover program costs.(Sec. 105) Allows individuals eligible for GI Bill benefits for active-duty or reserve service, during the period beginning on May 1, 2001, and ending on July 31, 2001, to contribute an additional monthly amount in order to receive an increased amount of basic educational assistance. Requires such contributions to be in multiples of $4 and not exceed $600. Makes eligible for such additional assistance those members on active duty on the date of enactment of this Act but subsequently discharged or released before May 1, 2001.Subtitle B: Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance - Increases the rates of survivors' and dependents' educational assistance, including assistance used for correspondence courses, special restorative training, and apprenticeship training. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) to annually increase such amounts by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index.(Sec. 112) Revises generally the period of eligibility for the receipt of survivors' and dependents' educational assistance for individuals whose eligibility is based on the permanent total disability or death of a parent. Revises the effective date for the award of such assistance.(Sec. 114) Includes within the term \"program of education\" for purposes of GI Bill educational benefits a preparatory course for a test that is required or utilized for admission to a college or graduate school. Allows a person to participate in such a course before his or her 18th birthday.Subtitle C: General Educational Assistance - Authorizes the payment of basic educational assistance during periods between school terms where the period between such terms does not exceed eight weeks and both the terms preceding and following such period are not shorter than such period.(Sec. 122) Authorizes as of March 1, 2001, the use of basic educational assistance for payment of vocation or profession licensing or certification tests, limiting such amount to the lesser of $2,000 or the fee charged for the test. Prohibits: (1) such amount from exceeding the amount of the individual's available entitlement; and (2) any such payment until the Secretary determines that the testing meets certain approval requirements for such tests as well as organizations and entities offering such tests. Establishes within the Department of Veterans Affairs (Department) the Professional Certification and Licensure Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary with respect to the requirements of organizations and entities offering such tests. Provides funding.(Sec. 123) Increases the amounts authorized for FY 2001 and 2002 for payment to State approving agencies for administrative expenses incurred while approving courses of education to be paid from veterans' basic educational assistance.Title II: Health Provisions - Subtitle A: Personnel Matters - Revises pay adjustment authority for nurses employed by the Department to require the director of a Department health care facility to use third-party industry wage surveys in making such adjustments. Prohibits any adjustment from reducing the rate of basic pay applicable to any nurse grade. Prohibits the director, in determining whether to carry out an adjustment, from considering the absence of a current recruitment or retention problem for personnel in that position. Requires a director to make such determination based on whether there is a significant pay-related staffing problem for such position at that facility. Authorizes the Department's Under Secretary for Health to modify any adjustment determination made by a facility director. Requires each director to report annually to the Secretary on staffing for covered positions at that facility. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the congressional veterans' committees on such staffing. Makes annual (currently terminated in 1993) a reporting requirement from the Secretary to such committees regarding pay adjustments.Requires the Under Secretary to ensure that: (1) the director of a geographic service area, in formulating policy for the provision of patient care, consult regularly with a senior nurse executive; and (2) the director of a health-care facility include a registered nurse on any committee providing recommendations or decisions on medical center operations or policy affecting clinical services, clinical outcomes, budget, or resources.(Sec. 202) Increases the special pay for dentists for: (1) full-time status; (2) length-of-service pay; (3) scarce specialty pay; (4) service in certain executive positions; (5) service in a geographic location in which there exists extraordinary difficulties in the recruitment and retention of qualified dentists; and (6) completing a post-graduate year of accredited hospital-based training. Credits toward civil service retirement calculations 25 percent of the special pay for length-of-service pay for each two years that the dentist completes as a dentist in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).(Sec. 203) Exempts VHA pharmacists from a required ceiling on special salary rates for certain VHA health professionals.(Sec. 204) Revises generally provisions regarding the temporary appointment of graduates of physician assistant training programs.
