    "text": "Florida Coast Protection Act of 1999 - Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to prohibit any Federal official or agency from granting any license or permit for exploration or development of, or production from, any area leased under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act before the State receives a copy of an environmental impact statement under specified provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).(Sec. 3) Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to remove provisions: (1) exempting any area of the outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico from a requirement to submit a development and production plan before development and production under an oil and gas lease; and (2) allowing the Secretary of the Interior to apply provisions relating to oil and gas development and production to a lease located in the Gulf adjacent to the State of Florida.(Sec. 4) Declares that, in the Gulf, the approval of such a plan is a major Federal action for purposes of NEPA. Directs the Secretary to ensure that each affected State receive the final environmental impact statement at least 180 days before the Secretary makes a determination on whether each plan activity complies with the those States' enforceable policies of approved management programs.(Sec. 5) Prohibits the Secretary from conducting any preleasing activity or holding a lease sale under this Act in an area within 100 miles off the coast of Florida in: (1) the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area adjacent to Florida; (2) the Straits of Florida Planning Area; or (3) the South Atlantic Planning Area."
