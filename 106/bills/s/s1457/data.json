Sets forth program details.Permits the States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana to apply for funding from the Bonneville Power Administration for purposes of funding loans that meet both the objectives of this Act and the fish and wildlife objectives of the Bonneville Power Administration under specified law. Authorizes appropriations to implement the revolving loan program."
