Makes such point of order inapplicable to any such legislation or motion if it reduces revenues or implements structural social security or Medicare reform.Waives or suspends the point of order under this Act in the Senate only by an affirmative three-fifths majority vote. Requires the same majority to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on such point of order.Terminates this Act on October 1, 2000."
