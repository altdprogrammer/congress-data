    "text": "Directs: (1) the Comptroller General of the United States to select ten jurisdictions with laws classifying certain types of crimes as hate crimes and ten jurisdictions without such laws from which to collect data over a 12-month period; and (2) the Comptroller General and the General Accounting Office (GAO) to complete a study that analyzes the data collected under this Act and under the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 to determine the extent of hate crime activity throughout the country and the success of State and local officials in combating that activity.Specifies data to be collected (i.e., the number of hate crimes reported and investigated, percentage of hate crimes prosecuted and resulting in a conviction, the length of sentences imposed in comparison with that imposed for similar crimes committed in jurisdictions without hate crime laws, and references to and descriptions of laws under which the offenders were punished).Requires the Comptroller General and GAO to identify any trends in the commission of hate crimes by geographic region, type of crime committed, and the number of hate crimes prosecuted and the number for which convictions are obtained.Directs the Attorney General: (1) to develop a model statute to criminalize acts classified as hate crimes; and (2) in developing such statute, to include crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice and to prepare an analysis of all reasons why any crime motivated by prejudice based on any traits of a victim should or should not be included.Directs the Attorney General: (1) at the request of a law enforcement official of a State or political subdivision thereof, to provide assistance in the criminal investigation or prosecution of any crime that constitutes a crime of violence or a felony under State law and that is motivated by prejudice based on the victim's race, ethnicity, or religion or that is a violation of the State's hate crime law; and (2) in providing such assistance, to give priority to crimes committed by offenders who have committed crimes in more than one State.Establishes a grant program within the Department of Justice to assist State and local officials in the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes. Sets forth eligibility, reporting, and other requirements. Authorizes appropriations.Prohibits and sets penalties (including the death penalty under specified circumstances) for: (1) traveling across a State line, or entering or leaving Indian country, in order to willfully injure, intimidate, or interfere with any person because of that person's race, color, religion, or national origin; and (2) by force or threat of force, willfully injuring, intimidating, or interfering with any person because of that person's race, color, religion, or national origin."
