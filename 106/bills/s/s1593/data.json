Increases the aggregate individual contribution limit to $30,000.Requires national and State committees to report all receipts and disbursements. Repeals the building fund exception to the definition of contribution.Amends the National Labor Relations Act to declare it to be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to receive payments from an employee pursuant to an agreement requiring such non-member employee to make payments in lieu of organization dues or fees without establishing a specified objection procedure under which the non-member's fees are reduced by the percentage that would be used to support political activities (thus codifying the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Communications Workers of America et al. v. Beck et al)."
