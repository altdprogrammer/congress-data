Waives such requirement with respect to anyone suspected of carrying a weapon.Instructs the Commissioner of Customs to require Customs Service personnel to undergo periodic training on identification, detention, and search procedures, with particular emphasis on profiling proscriptions.Directs the Commissioner to study and report annually to Congress on detentions and searches of persons by Customs Service personnel during the preceding calendar year.Authorizes appropriations."
