Requires the program director to: (1) function as a facilitator between small communities and air carriers; (2) carry out a specified airline service restoration program; (3) ensure that the Bureau of Transportation Statistics collects data on passenger information to assess the service needs of small communities; (4) coordinate efforts with other Federal, State, and local agencies to increase the viability of service to small communities and the creation of aviation development zones; and (5) recommend policies to the Secretary and Congress that will ensure that small communities have access to quality, affordable air transportation services. Requires the program director to report annually to the Secretary and Congress with respect to the availability of quality air transportation services to small communities.(Sec. 5) Authorizes no more than 40 small communities or consortia of small communities or a State to develop an assessment of air service requirements and submit it with an air service program proposal to the program director.
