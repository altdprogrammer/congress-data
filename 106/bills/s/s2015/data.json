    "text": "Stem Cell Research Act of 2000 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct, support, or fund research on or utilizing human embryos for purposes of generating embryonic stem cells only in accordance with this Act.Requires, for purposes of carrying out research, that human embryonic stem cells be derived only from embryos that otherwise would be discarded that have been donated from in- vitro fertilization clinics with the written informed consent of the progenitors. Prohibits human embryonic stem cell research from resulting in the creation of human embryos or in the reproductive cloning of a human being.Makes it unlawful for any person receiving Federal funds to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human gametes or embryos for valuable consideration if such action affects interstate commerce.Directs the Secretary, in conjunction with the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to issue guidelines governing human embryonic stem cell research. Requires such guidelines to ensure that: (1) all Federal research protocols and consent forms involving human embryonic stem cell research must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board; and (2) such board is empowered to make determinations as to whether proposed research is in accordance with NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.Requires the Secretary to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on activities carried out under this Act."
