    "text": "Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make certain permanent resident aliens eligible for cancellation of removal (from the United States) who have not been convicted of an aggravated felony punishable by at least five years' imprisonment. (Current law provides for ineligibility for conviction of any aggravated felony.) Terminates such aliens' seven-year continuous U.S. residency requirement upon the filing of charges rather than when the crime was committed. Revises criminal alien release from custody provisions. Amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to repeal the Attorney General's authority to revoke an alien's bond or parole. Authorizes judicial review of deportation cases. Provides for a court-appointed counsel in alien removal and related appeals proceedings."
