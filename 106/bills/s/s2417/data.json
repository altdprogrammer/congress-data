Makes $50 million of such funds available to States for the: (1) collection of reliable monitoring data; (2) improvement of specified lists regarding waters with insufficient controls and maximum daily loads; (3) preparation of total maximum daily load allocations for such waters; and (4) development of watershed management strategies.Reauthorizes appropriations for FY 2001 through 2007 for grants to States for implementation of nonpoint source pollution control management programs. Limits the amount made available from such funds for groundwater quality protection activities to advance States toward implementation of comprehensive nonpoint source pollution control programs. Makes $200 million available from such funds for States to provide grants to landowners to develop and implement nonpoint source pollution control projects to restore or improve water quality of impaired waters that have been identified as a priority for restoration. Limits the Federal share of project costs to 90 percent.Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on the: (1) scientific basis underlying the development and implementation of total maximum daily loads under the Act; and (2) availability and effectiveness of alternative programs or mechanisms in producing quantifiable reductions of pollution from point and nonpoint sources to achieve water quality standards. Directs the Administrator to contract with the National Academy of Public Administrators to study: (1) the effectiveness of existing voluntary and other programs in producing quantifiable reductions in pollution from such sources and attaining water quality standards; and (2) the costs and benefits associated with such programs that are incurred by State and local governments and the private sector. Requires the Administrator to submit such studies to specified congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations."
