    "text": "Telecommunications Competition Enforcement Act of 1999 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to mandate that if the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) finds that a Bell operating company (BOC) has not fully implemented the requirements under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 for full and open competition with regard to network access for all telecommunications (voice, video, and data) for at least one-half of the States in its region by February 8, 2001, the FCC shall assess a forfeiture penalty of $100,000 per day for each day of continuing violation of such requirements. Provides that if such requirements are not met by a BOC by February 8, 2003, the FCC shall order the BOC to divest itself of its telecommunications network facilities within 180 days. Requires the FCC to ensure, for an incumbent local exchange carrier, other than a BOC, with more than five percent of the national access lines, that such company's markets are open to competition by completing an investigation within 120 days to determine whether such carrier has fully complied with such competition requirements for all telecommunications. Allows a noncomplying carrier 60 days to achieve such compliance, with penalties for violations after such period. Allows the FCC to assess forfeiture penalties on a BOC if, at any time after its approval, the FCC determines that such BOC has ceased to meet the open competition requirements."
