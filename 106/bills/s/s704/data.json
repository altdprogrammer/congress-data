    "text": "Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act of 1999 - Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to assess and collect a fee for health care services provided in connection with each health care visit requested by a prisoner, except for preventative health care services, emergency services, prenatal care, diagnosis or treatment of contagious diseases, mental health care, or substance abuse treatment. Defines \"health care visit\" to exclude a visit initiated by a prisoner: (1) pursuant to a staff referral; or (2) to obtain staff-approved followup treatment for a chronic condition. Requires that each fee assessed be collected by the Director: (1) from the account of the prisoner receiving health care services; or (2) where such services are provided because of an injury inflicted by another prisoner, from the account of the prisoner who inflicted the injury. Sets a minimum fee of two dollars. Specifies that the prisoner's consent shall not be required for the collection of the fee. Specifies that nothing herein may be construed to permit refusal of treatment to a prisoner on the basis that: (1) the prisoner's account is insolvent; or (2) the prisoner is otherwise unable to pay. Requires that sums collected under this Act: (1) be used for restitution of the victims where the prisoner is subject to a restitution order; and (2) be deposited in the Crime Victims Fund (75 percent) and be available to the Attorney General for administrative expenses incurred in carrying out this Act (25 percent) where the prisoner is not subject to such an order. Sets forth requirements for reporting by the Director. (Sec. 3) Amends the code to authorize a State or local government to assess and collect a reasonable fee from a Federal prisoner's trust fund account (or institution equivalent) for health care services if the prisoner is confined in a non-Federal institution, under specified circumstances. Specifies that nothing herein may be construed to permit any refusal of treatment to a prisoner on the basis that the account of the prisoner is insolvent, or that the prisoner is otherwise unable to pay a fee assessed under this section."
