Requires such officials to enter into an interdepartmental memorandum of agreement providing for the implementation of authorized plans. Establishes the Indian Health Service as the lead agency with specified responsibilities, including the development of a single reporting format for plans and projects and development of a single system of Federal oversight for the plan.Prohibits any reduction of Federal funds available to a participating tribe as a result of this Act. Provides for interagency fund transfers to carry out this Act.Makes any State with an alcohol and substance abuse or mental health program targeted to Indian tribes eligible to receive, at no cost, such Federal personnel assignments as the Secretary may deem appropriate to help ensure the success of such program."
