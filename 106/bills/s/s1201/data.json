Defines \"missing youth\" as anyone between 18 and 21 years of age whose whereabouts are unknown and who is physically or mentally disabled, who may be in the company of another person under circumstances indicating that such individual's physical safety is in danger, or whose disappearance is surrounded by circumstances that indicate that the disappearance may have been involuntary."
