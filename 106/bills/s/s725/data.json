    "text": "Coral Reef Conservation Act of 1999 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to provide grants for the conservation of coral reefs. Limits the Federal share to 50 percent of the total cost of any coral conservation project. Authorizes waivers. Allows any relevant natural resource management authority of a State or U.S. territory or other government authority with jurisdiction over coral reefs or whose activities affect coral reefs, or educational or non-governmental institutions with demonstrated expertise in the conservation of coral reefs, to submit to the Administrator a coral conservation proposal. Requires the Administrator to ensure that funding for grants awarded is distributed in following manner: (1) no less than 40 percent of available funds shall be awarded for coral conservation projects in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and the Carribean Sea; and (2) remaining funds shall be awarded for projects that address emerging priorities or threats identified in consultation with the Coral Reef Task Force. Sets forth proposal review guidelines, project approval criteria, and grantee reporting requirements. Authorizes the Administrator to consult with the Task Force to obtain guidance in establishing coral conservation project priorities. Authorizes the Administrator to enter into an agreement authorizing an organization to receive, hold, and administer funds received pursuant to this Act to support partnerships between the public and private sectors that further the purposes of this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to any State, local, or territorial government agency with jurisdiction over coral reefs for emergencies to address unforseen or disaster related circumstance pertaining to coral reefs or coral reef ecosystems. Authorizes appropriations."
