Requires the grantee to use of three-quarters of the grant amount (after such reservation) to award grants to State economic education councils, or in the case of a State that does not have a State economic education council, a center for economic education (a recipient). Requires that such a grant pay for the Federal share of the cost of enabling the recipient to work in partnership with one or more specified educational entities for one or more of the following purposes: (1) collaboratively establishing and conducting teacher training programs that use effective and innovative approaches to the teaching of economics; (2) providing resources to school districts that want to incorporate economics into the curricula of their schools; (3) evaluating the impact of economic education on students; (4) conducting economic education research; (5) creating and conducting school-based student activities to promote consumer, economic, and personal finance education, such as saving, investing, and entrepreneurial education, and to encourage awareness and student achievement in economics; (6) establishing interstate and international student and teacher exchanges to promote economic literacy; and (7) encouraging replication of best practices to encourage economic literacy. Sets forth requirements for recipients in carrying out teacher training programs under this Act. Encourages the grantee and recipients, in carrying out assisted activities under this Act, to: (1) include interactions with the local business community to the fullest extent possible, to reinforce the connection between economic education and economic development; and (2) work with private businesses to obtain matching contributions for Federal funds and assist recipients in working toward self-sufficiency. Sets forth requirements for Federal and non-Federal shares, grantee and recipient applications, reserved funds for States without recipients, and reports. Authorizes appropriations."
