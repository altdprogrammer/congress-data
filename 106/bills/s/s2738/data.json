Permits reports of medical errors and close calls in the database to be used only for research to improve the quality and safety of patient care.Requires the Director to: (1) identify public and private sector patient safety reporting systems and build scientific knowledge regarding those systems and related topics; (2) support training initiatives to build the capacity of the U.S. health care community to analyze patient safety data and to act on such data to improve patient safety; and (3) recommend strategies for measuring and evaluating the national progress made in implementing safe practices identified by the Center and through a voluntary reporting system.Provides for certification of entities that collect and analyze information on medical errors and to collaborate with health care providers in collecting information about, or evaluating, certain medical events (certain adverse events or close calls, including those that involve death or injury, associated with the provision of health care). Requires such entities to report periodically to the Director. Provides for termination of certifications after three years, with renewals at the Director's discretion.Sets forth system requirements for providers of health services that elect to participate in a medical error reporting system.Prescribes confidentiality requirements for information regarding medical events collected pursuant to this Act.Authorizes appropriations."
