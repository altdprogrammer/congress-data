Directs the head of each Federal agency that occupies a Federal building to submit an assessment of the agency's ability to meet such goals.Requires the Secretary to determine criteria for: (1) the selection of the Federal public buildings in which defibrillators should be placed; (2) defibrillator maintenance; and (3) the coordination of the use of the defibrillators in public buildings, facilities, or other venues with emergency medical services providers for the geographic areas in which the buildings are located.Provides that any person who provides emergency medical care through the use of a defibrillator, and the person who acquired the device (if specified conditions have been met) are immune from civil liability for any personal injury or wrongful death resulting from the provision of such care, unless the person engaged in gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct under the applicable circumstances, or the person was a licensed or certified medical professional who was using the defibrillator while acting within the scope of employment as a medical professional."
