Prohibits the application of the authorized waivers with respect to a product of a foreign country that is a signatory country to the Agreement on Government Procurement but that has violated such Agreement by discriminating against a covered U.S. product.Prohibits the Director from imposing any assistance limitation that restricts more stringent State Buy American requirements.Makes a person ineligible to enter into a contract or subcontract for a project carried out with financial assistance made available by the Agency if a U.S. court or agency has determined that such person has affixed a \"Made in America\" label to any product used in such a project, or otherwise has represented that a product was produced in the United States, when it was not."
