    "text": "Electric Reliability 2000 Act - Amends the Federal Power Act to provide for the establishment and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards to ensure the reliable operation of the bulk-power system. Grants the Federal Energy Regulatory Corporation (FERC) jurisdiction, for purposes of approving and enforcing compliance with standards in the United States, over: (1) the electric reliability organization; (2) all Affiliated Regional Reliability Entities (entities to which authority has been delegated to enforce compliance with reliability standards); (3) all system operators; and (4) all users of the bulk-power system. Provides that, prior to the establishment of the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO), any person (including the North American Electric Reliability Council and its member Regional Reliability Councils) may file a proposed reliability standard, guidance, or practice which, subject to FERC approval, shall be mandatory and enforceable.Prescribes procedural guidelines for FERC approval of: (1) applications competing for status as the Electric Reliability Council; and (2) ERO standards. Requires all users of the bulk-power system to comply with such standards.Mandates that: (1) the ERO take all appropriate steps to gain recognition in Canada and Mexico; and (2) the United States use its best efforts to enter into international agreements with the governments of Canada and Mexico to effectuate compliance with ERO standards, and to provide for the effectiveness of the Organization's mission.Requires every system operator to be a member of the ERO and of any Affiliated Regional Reliability Entity operating under an agreement applicable to the region in which the system operator operates or is responsible for the operation of a bulk-power system facility.Grants the ERO disciplinary and enforcement powers. Directs the ERO to assess periodically the reliability and adequacy of the inter-connected bulk-power system in North America and to report its findings and recommendations annually to FERC and to the Secretary of Energy. Provides for the assessment and recovery of implementation and enforcement costs incurred by the ERO and each Affiliated Regional Reliability Entity, respectively.Sets forth antitrust defenses for activities undertaken by the ERO, its members, or members of an affiliated regional reliability entity.Instructs FERC to establish a regional advisory body on the petition of the Governors of at least two-thirds of the States within a region that have more than one-half of their electrical loads served within the region. Restricts such body to the 48 contiguous States.Restricts ERO authority to develop, implement, and enforce compliance exclusively to reliability standards governing the bulk-power system. Denies both the ERO and FERC any authority under this Act to set and enforce compliance with adequacy or safety standards governing either electric facilities or services.Declares that nothing in this Act preempts State authority to take action to ensure safety, adequacy, and reliability of electric service within a State, as long as such action is not inconsistent with any organization standard. Empowers FERC to: (1) issue a final order determining whether a State action is inconsistent with an ERO standard; and (2) stay the effectiveness of any State action, after consultation with ERO, and pending issuance of a final FERC order."
