(Sec. 102) Authorizes appropriations. Reserves a specified portion for grants to BIA schools. (Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary of Education to award grants to State educational agencies (SEAs) in each State, from specified allotments, to implement statewide initiatives and programs to: (1) recruit, train, and retain beginning teachers; and (2) provide ongoing professional development to veteran teachers and principals. Allows each SEA to reserve up to ten percent of such grant funds for statewide activities to improve the quality of the teaching force, including: (1) assisting local educational agencies (LEAs) to reduce out-of-field placements; (2) reducing the use of emergency credentials; (3) improving alternative certification programs; (4) administrative costs and evaluation of assisted activities; (5) linking assisted programs with State standards; (6) supporting National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification of teachers who are or will teach in high-need schools; and (7) assisting LEA teacher recruitment, induction, and professional development programs. Sets forth State allotment formula and State application requirements. (Sec. 104) Requires each SEA to use 20 percent of such grant funds to: (1) award scholarships to qualified individuals who enter the elementary or secondary school teaching field; and (2) establish partnerships with LEAs that serve school districts with the greatest teacher shortages and colleges of education to assist in carrying out such scholarship program, including recruitment of prospective teachers and support services for the teachers. Allows SEAs to also include community-based and other organizations in such partnerships. Sets forth individual eligibility requirements for such scholarships. Allows SEAs to determine the amount of the scholarship, but requires that individual need be considered in determining such amount. Requires scholarship recipients to agree to teach for at least three years, after degree completion, in high-need school districts or high-need content areas. Requires that incentives under such scholarship program be coordinated with those under the Federal student loan forgiveness program under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA). (Sec. 105) Requires each SEA to use at least 70 percent of such grant funds to award competitive grants to eligible LEAs for specified authorized activities. Sets forth requirements for LEA eligibility, applications, and evaluations of assisted programs. Title II: Improving Teacher Preparation - Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the Congress should fully fund Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants for States and Partnerships, under HEA title II, at $300 million; and (2) the 106th Congress should make a strong investment in accomplishing the goal of holding institutions of higher education accountable for improving the initial preparation of teachers, a goal to which the 105th Congress made a strong commitment. Title III: Improving Teacher Technology Training - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide for teacher technology training. Requires schools to give attention to professional development that incorporates technology used to improve teaching and learning. Requires professional development activities to include instruction in the use of technology. Adds technology to the list of core subject areas for the National Teacher Training Project grants program (Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program). Requires local plans for improving teaching and learning to include descriptions of how their core subject area programs will incorporate technologies which meet the educational needs of individuals who are from historically underrepresented groups, or are economically disadvantaged, or have limited English language abilities, or have disabilities. Requires authorized professional development activities to incorporate effective technology for meeting the educational needs of diverse groups of students. Includes technological innovation as a higher education activity to improve teacher education programs."
