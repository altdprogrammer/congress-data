Permits grants to be used only to carry out projects designed to meet critical water supply needs. Prohibits grants for projects located in States or areas that are referred to in specified Federal reclamation law and are within the geographic scope of the reclamation and reuse program established under the Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act. Makes projects funded under this Act ineligible for funds under any other Federal program. Limits the Federal cost share of projects funded under this Act to 50 percent. Requires the Administrator to report to Congress on progress made toward meeting the critical water supply needs of grant recipients. Authorizes appropriations."
