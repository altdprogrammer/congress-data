    "text": "Department of Defense Civilian Workforce Realignment Act of 2000 - Extends through FY 2005 the authority for voluntary separations of Department of Defense (DOD) employees during a reduction in force.(Sec. 3) Amends Federal provisions concerning the use of voluntary separation incentive pay and voluntary early retirement authority to: (1) extend the voluntary separation pay authority through FY 2005; (2) add as a purpose of the voluntary separation incentive program the restructuring of the defense workforce for various purposes; (3) allow separation pay to be paid in either a lump-sum (current law) or installments; and (4) require termination of incentive pay installments when a person accepts other employment with the Federal Government.(Sec. 4) Amends the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees' Retirement System to entitle to an immediate annuity a DOD employee who, before October 1, 2005, is separated from service after completing 25 years of service or after becoming 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service, as long as such employee: (1) is separated involuntarily other than for cause; and (2) has not declined a reasonable offer of another DOD position which is not lower than two grades below their former grade, and is within the employee's commuting area. Provides related eligibility conditions, including that the employee is separated from service during a major DOD organizational adjustment.(Sec. 5) States that a Federal program for providing employee training shall not include any course of postsecondary education that is administered or conducted by an institution not accredited by a national or regional accrediting body. Allows coverage for training toward an academic degree if the training provides an opportunity to obtain an academic degree pursuant to a planned, systematic, and coordinated program of professional development approved by the head of that agency.(Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary of Defense to submit to the congressional defense, governmental affairs, and government reform committees a strategic plan for exercising the authorities provided or extended by this Act."
