Defines \"employer\" to mean any other individual employed by the defendant's business that supervises the defendant's activity (but if that defendant has no supervisor, prior written certification is acceptable from any other employee of the business).Sets penalties for violations of this prohibition.(Sec. 6) Authorizes the head of a Federal agency to donate body armor that is surplus property and in serviceable condition directly to any State or local law enforcement agency. Allows specified officials in the Treasury and Justice Departments to act as the head of a Federal agency.Specifies that the United States shall not be liable for any harm occurring in connection with the use or misuse of any body armor donated under this section."
