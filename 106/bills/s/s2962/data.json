    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "2000-09-28", 
    "text": "Federal Reformulated Fuels Act of 2000 - Amends the Clean Air Act (CAA) to authorize a State Governor, upon notification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the 90-day period beginning on this Act's enactment date, or during the 90-day period beginning on the date an area in the State becomes a covered area as a result of reclassification as a Severe ozone nonattainment area, to waive oxygen content requirements for reformulated gasoline sold or dispensed in the State. Considers gasoline that complies with all other requirements for reformulated gasoline other than those regarding oxygen content to be reformulated gasoline.Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations to ensure that reductions of toxic air pollutant emissions and aromatic hydrocarbon content achieved under the reformulated gasoline program before this Act's enactment are maintained in States for which the oxygenate requirement is waived or to apply a specified alternative performance standard to reformulated gasoline sold in such States.(Sec. 3) Authorizes the Administrator to control the sale or introduction into commerce of any fuel or fuel additive that causes or contributes to air or water pollution that may be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Permits States not subject to a prohibition on enforcement of certain State emission control standards to prescribe such control on fuel or fuel additives for water quality protection purposes.Requires the Administrator to ban the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. Authorizes the Administrator to establish a schedule to phase out the use of MTBE preceding such ban.(Sec. 4) Authorizes the Administrator to approve a revision of a State implementation plan that excludes an area from a waiver from Reid vapor pressure requirements provided for ethanol if: (1) the State demonstrates that increases in volatile organic compound emissions resulting from the waiver significantly interfere with attainment or maintenance of the national ambient air quality standard for ozone; and (2) the Administrator determines the exclusion to be reasonable and practicable.(Sec. 5) Directs (currently, authorizes) the Administrator, for purposes of registration of fuels or fuel additives and on a regular basis, to require manufacturers of such fuels or additives to conduct tests to determine potential public health and environmental effects (currently, public health effects) of the fuel or additive and to meet other existing requirements.(Sec. 6) Requires motor vehicle fuel sold in the United States in 2008 and thereafter to be comprised (on a six-month average basis) of a specified percentage of clean alternative fuel. Phases in such percentage requirement, to require motor vehicle fuel to contain 1.5 percent clean alternative fuel in 2011 and thereafter.Requires all motor vehicle fuel sold in the United States during 2002 through 2007 to contain, on a six-month average basis, a specified percentage of renewable fuel. Phases in the percentage requirement, to require fuel to contain 1.1 percent renewable fuel by 2007.Authorizes credit trading programs to permit persons who refine, blend, or import motor vehicle fuel with more than the required clean alternative or renewable fuel content or who manufacture certain energy-efficient vehicles to use or transfer such credits to others for compliance purposes. Permits the use of the vehicle manufacturer credits to provide any portion of the non-Federal share required for an alternative fuel project under Federal-aid highway provisions regarding the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program or a voluntary supply commitment under the Energy Policy Act of 1992.Provides for a temporary waiver of this section's requirements upon State petition if: (1) implementation would severely harm the economy or environment of a State, region, or the United States; or (2) there is an inadequate domestic supply or distribution capacity to meet such requirements. Authorizes exemptions from such requirements for small refiners.Makes violators of this section subject to civil penalties under the CAA.(Sec. 7) Authorizes the Administrator to approve State implementation plan revisions that apply a prohibition on the sale of conventional gasoline in covered areas (areas requiring the use of reformulated gasoline) to a nonclassified area.(Sec. 8) Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize the EPA Administrator and States to use funds from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund to: (1) carry out corrective actions with respect to a release of MTBE that presents a risk to human health or welfare or the environment; and (2) conduct inspections, issue orders, or bring actions under the underground storage tank regulation program. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 9) Directs the Administrator to publish analyses of: (1) the changes in emissions of air pollutants and air quality due to the use of motor vehicle fuel and fuel additives resulting from the implementation of this Act; and (2) the effects of motor vehicle fuel and fuel additives on public health and the environment.Requires the Administrator to publish regulations establishing performance requirements to ensure that, as compared with emissions due to the use of motor vehicle fuel and fuel additives during the period of 1998 through 2000, emissions due to the use of such fuel and additives will not be significantly greater on a per-gallon average basis in any region or cause air quality to be significantly worse in any region.Directs the Administrator to publish regulations establishing performance requirements for such fuel and additives, the use of such fuel and additives, and motor vehicles that are necessary to ensure adequate public health and environmental protection and to achieve specific reductions in the use of compounds or associated emission products that pose the greatest human health risk.Requires the Administrator to finalize an emissions model that reflects the effects of fuel characteristics or components on emissions from vehicles in the motor vehicle fleet during 2005."
