Requires an additional Committee study on the method for determining an accurate consumer price index for individuals receiving disability benefits under SSA title II. Authorizes appropriations.Outlines a BLS pilot program to test CPIE accuracy.Provides for interim application of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for cost-of-living computation quarters from January 1, 2000, to implementation of the Official Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (Official CPIE) to calculate cost-of-living adjustments for old-age and survivors insurance benefits.Directs the BLS Commissioner to prepare and publish monthly the Official CPIE for implementation, based on the implementation plan and recommendations, and subject to congressional approval of the study report, in calculating such adjustments for any retiree or individual who has attained age 62.Authorizes appropriations."
