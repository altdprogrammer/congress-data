    "text": "Safer Communities Partnership Act of 1999 - Directs the Attorney General to establish a pilot program to encourage and support communities that adopt a comprehensive approach to suppressing and preventing violent juvenile crime and reducing drug and alcohol abuse among juveniles, patterned after successful State juvenile crime reduction strategies.Requires the Attorney General, in carrying out the program, to: (1) make and track grants; and (2) provide for technical assistance and training, in addition to data collection and dissemination of relevant information, and general program administration. Directs the Attorney General to appoint or designate an Administrator to carry out the program.Sets forth initial grant and renewal requirements. Directs that a grant recipient (coalition) submit to the Attorney General a comprehensive plan for reducing violent juvenile crime that meets specified requirements, such as ensuring that: (1) heavy emphasis is placed on coordinated enforcement initiatives; (2) there is close collaboration between police and probation officers in the supervision of juvenile offenders; (3) a program is in place to trace all firearms seized from crime scenes or offenders in an effort to identify illegal gun traffickers; and (4) a program is in place to divert nonviolent juvenile offenders into substance or alcohol abuse treatment.Requires coalitions to establish a system to measure and report outcomes, devise a detailed model for measuring and evaluating success, and provide assurances that the plan will be evaluated regularly to assess progress in reducing violent juvenile crime. Directs the Attorney General to give priority to coalitions representing communities with demonstrated juvenile crime and drug abuse problems.Sets forth provisions regarding grant amounts, permitted use of funds, a Comptroller General report to Congress reviewing program effectiveness, and information collection and dissemination with respect to coalitions. Authorizes appropriations."
