Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to invest Fund amounts in interest-bearing U.S. obligations. Directs: (1) the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer to the Secretary of Agriculture Fund amounts resulting from items on a retaliation list because of injury to producers of agricultural commodities; and (2) the Secretary of Agriculture to distribute a portion of such amounts to each injured producer of an agricultural commodity for promotion and development of their products. Provides for the distribution of Fund amounts to nonagricultural producers who have been similarly injured. Prohibits a payment made to an injured producer or an injured agricultural commodity producer from resulting in the reduction or denial of any service or assistance with respect to which such producers would otherwise be entitled."
