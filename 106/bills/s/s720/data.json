Authorizes appropriations. Urges the President to take all necessary steps to ensure that such assistance shall not be provided to the Government of Yugoslavia or the Government of Serbia.(Sec. 102) Authorizes the President to provide assistance to the Government of Montenegro, unless the President determines, and reports to the appropriate congressional committees, that the leadership of such government is not committed to, or is not taking steps to promote, democratic principles, the rule of law, or respect for internationally recognized human rights.(Sec. 103) Directs the Broadcasting Board of Governors to further the open communication of information and ideas through the increased use of radio and television broadcasting (Voice of America and Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty, Incorporated) to Yugoslavia in both the Serbo-Croatian and Albanian languages.Title II: Assistance to the Victims of Serbian Oppression - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) humanitarian assistance to the victims of the conflict in Kosovo (including refugees and internally displaced persons), and all assistance to rebuild damaged property there, should be the responsibility of the Government of Yugoslavia and the Government of Serbia; (2) under President Milosevic's direction neither government has provided the resources to assist innocent, civilian victims of oppression in Kosovo; and (3) because neither government has fulfilled the responsibilities of a sovereign government toward the Kosovar people, the international community offers the only course for humanitarian assistance to victims of oppression in Kosovo.(Sec. 203) Authorizes the President to furnish assistance (including economic support funds) under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962 for: (1) relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction in Kosovo; and (2) refugees and persons displaced by the conflict there. Prohibits assistance to any group that has been designated as a terrorist organization.Title III: \"Outer Wall\" Sanctions - Imposes certain economic and non-economic (\"Outer Wall\") sanctions against Yugoslavia until the President determines, and certifies to the appropriate congressional committees, that the Government of Yugoslavia has made significant progress in meeting certain conditions, including: (1) agreement on a lasting settlement in Kosovo; (2) compliance with the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina; (3) implementation of internal democratic reform; (4) settlement of all succession issues with the other republics that emerged from the break-up of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; and (5) cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, including the transfer of all indicted war criminals in Yugoslavia to the Hague.(Sec. 301) Sets forth such sanctions, including instructing: (1) the U.S. executive directors of the international financial institutions to oppose, and vote against, any extension of any financial assistance of any kind to the Government of Yugoslavia; (2) the U.S. Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to oppose and block any consensus to allow the participation of Yugoslavia in the OSCE; (3) the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN) to oppose any resolution in the UN Security Council to admit Yugoslavia to the UN, including to oppose any proposal to allow it to assume the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the UN General Assembly; (4) the U.S. Permanent Representative to the North Atlantic Council to oppose the extension to Yugoslavia of membership in the Partnership for Peace program or any other affiliated NATO organization; and (5) the U.S. Representatives to the Southeast European Cooperation Initiative (SECI) to actively oppose the extension of SECI membership to Yugoslavia.Expresses the sense of Congress that the President: (1) should not restore full diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia until the President has determined, and reported to the appropriate congressional committees, that Yugoslavia has met the aforementioned conditions; and (2) should encourage all other European countries to diminish their level of diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia.(Sec. 302) Expresses the sense of Congress that if any international financial institution approves a loan or other financial assistance to the Government of Yugoslavia over the opposition of the United States, then the Secretary of the Treasury should withhold from payment the U.S. share of any increase in the paid-in capital of such institution in an amount equal to the amount of such loan or other assistance.Title IV: Other Measures Against Yugoslavia - Blocks all property of the Government of Serbia or the Government of Yugoslavia (including commercial, industrial, or public utility or entities) that is in the United States.(Sec. 402) Directs the President to use the authorities under the Immigration and Nationality Act to suspend the entry into the United States of any alien who: (1) holds a position in the senior leadership of the Government of Yugoslavia or the Government of Serbia; or (2) is a spouse, minor child, or agent of such person.(Sec. 403) Prohibits the export of computers, computer software, or goods or technology intended to manufacture or service computers to or for use by the Government of Yugoslavia or by the Government of Serbia (including the military, the police, the prison system, and the national security agencies of such republics). Declares that nothing in this section shall prevent the issuance of licenses to ensure the safety of civil aviation and safe operation of U.S.-origin commercial passenger aircraft and to ensure the safety of ocean-going maritime traffic in international waters.(Sec. 404) Prohibits: (1) any Government agency (including the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation) from extending any loan, credit guarantee, insurance, financing, or other similar financial assistance to the Government of Yugoslavia or the Government of Serbia; and (2) any funds being made available for activities of the Trade and Development Agency in or for Serbia.Urges all other countries, particularly European countries, to suspend any of their programs that provide similar financial assistance to the Government of Yugoslavia or the Government of Serbia, including rescheduling either government's debt under more favorable conditions.Prohibits any U.S. national from making or approving any loan or other extension of credit (unless it is for housing, education, or humanitarian benefit to assist the victims of repression in Kosovo), directly or indirectly, to the Government of Yugoslavia or to the Government of Serbia.(Sec. 405) Prohibits the U.S. Government (including any Federal agency or entity) from providing assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or the Arms Export Control Act (including the provision of Foreign Military Financing or international military education and training (IMET)) or providing any defense articles or defense services under such Acts, to the armed forces of the Government of Yugoslavia or of the Government of Serbia.(Sec. 406) Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should continue to seek to coordinate with other countries, particularly European countries, a comprehensive, multilateral strategy to further the purposes of this Act, including, as appropriate, encouraging other countries to take similar measures contained in this title.(Sec. 407) Exempts from the sanctions imposed in this Act both Kosovo and Montenegro (unless the President determines and certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the leadership of the Government of Montenegro is not committed to, or is not taking steps to promote, democratic principles, the rule of law, or respect for internationally recognized human rights). Provides for a waiver and termination of sanctions imposed against Yugoslavia.Title V: Miscellaneous Provisions - Declares it is U.S. policy to support the investigation of President Slobodan Milosevic by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and grave breaches of the Geneva Convention.(Sec. 502) Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should call on NATO allies in negotiating the future of Kosovo to establish guarantees for the rights of the ethnic Hungarian community of Vojvodina.(Sec. 503) Declares it is U.S. policy to insist that the Government of Yugoslavia has the responsibility to engage in good faith negotiations with the Governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Slovenia for resolution of outstanding property issues and disposition of specified properties located in the United States. Expresses the sense of Congress that if the Government of Yugoslavia refuses to negotiate in good faith, the President should take steps to return such properties to such governments.(Sec. 504) Authorizes the President to furnish assistance to Yugoslavia if he determines, and certifies to the appropriate congressional committees, that the Government of Yugoslavia is committed to democratic principles and the rule of law and respects internationally recognized human rights."
