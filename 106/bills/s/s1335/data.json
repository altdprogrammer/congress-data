    "text": "Amends the Social Security Act to authorize the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Defense (administering Secretaries) to expand and extend the Medicare subvention demonstration project for military retirees (a project providing reimbursement to the Secretary of Defense for Medicare health care services furnished to Medicare-eligible military retirees through the Department of Defense) if the administering Secretaries determine that: (1) such expansion and extension would be beneficial to such retirees and their dependents; and (2) project requirements are being met and will continue to be met if the project is expanded and extended. Requires the determination of such expansion and extension to be made between July 1, 1999, and January 1, 2000. Provides expansion rules and allows the administering Secretaries to extend the project by one or two years. Requires: (1) revision of the original operating agreement to reflect such expansion and extension, including an increase in the maximum reimbursement amount under the project; and (2) continued project evaluations and reports by the Comptroller General. Directs the administering Secretaries to provide retirees and dependents participating in the project with information regarding the applicable statutory protections for individuals who no longer participate in the project. Extends until January 1, 2001, the required date for the submission of a report from the administering Secretaries to Congress regarding the extension and expansion of the project."
