    "text": "Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to provide for local family information centers.Revises ESEA title I (Helping Disadvantaged Students Meet High Standards) part E (Federal Evaluations, Demonstrations, and Transition Projects) to authorize the Secretary of Education to make grants to, and enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with, local nonprofit parent organizations to support local family information centers that help ensure that parents of students in schools assisted under title I part A (Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local Educational Agencies) have the training, information, and support they need to be able to participate effectively in helping their children to meet challenging State standards.Sets forth requirements for center activities, applications, and eligibility. Directs the Secretary to: (1) make at least two awards of assistance under this Act to a local nonprofit parent organization in each State, if the applications are of sufficient quality; (2) select such organizations so as to ensure provision of the most effective assistance to low-income parents of students in schools assisted under part A that are located in high poverty rural and urban areas in the State, with particular emphasis on rural and urban geographic areas with high school dropout rates, high percentages of limited English proficient students, or geographic areas with schools identified for school improvement or corrective action; and (3) evaluate and report on assisted centers.Authorizes appropriations."
