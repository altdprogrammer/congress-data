    "text": "Defective Product Penalty Act of 2000 - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criminal penalties for the distribution of defective products (products with some flaw that renders them dangerous to human life beyond their reasonable and accepted risk).Sunshine in Litigation Act of 2000 - Amends the Federal judicial code to require a court to enter an order restricting the disclosure of information obtained through discovery, approving a settlement agreement that would restrict the disclosure of such information, or restricting access to civil court records only after finding that: (1) such order would not restrict the disclosure of information relevant to public health or safety; (2) the public interest in the disclosure of potential health or safety hazards is clearly outweighed by the interest of maintaining the confidentiality of such information; and (3) the requested protective order is no broader than necessary to protect the interest in maintaining confidentiality.Amends Federal transportation law to: (1) require motor vehicle or vehicle equipment manufacturers to review and consider vehicle or equipment incident information and notify the Secretary of Transportation upon having reason to believe that a defect or noncompliance may exist; (2) extend the period during which remedies for defects and noncompliance shall be provided by a manufacturer without charge; and (3) increase the civil penalty for violations of certain vehicle and equipment safety violations."
