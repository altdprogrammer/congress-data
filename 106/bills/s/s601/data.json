    "text": "Foreign Language Education Improvement Amendments Act of 1999 - Amends the Foreign Language Assistance Act of 1994 to require that foreign language assistance program grants be awarded for at least three years and not more than five years (currently grant duration is three years). Directs the Secretary of Education to use 50 percent of such program funds to award grants for foreign language programs serving students in certain heavily-impacted elementary or secondary schools. Sets the Federal share of such grants to such schools at 100 percent (currently 50 percent at schools that do not receive waivers). Includes among grant applications to be given special consideration those for programs that: (1) make effective use of technology such as computer assisted instruction, language laboratories, or distance learning; (2) promote innovative activities such as immersion, partial immersion, or content-based instruction; or (3) involve consortia with elementary schools or secondary schools. Revises elementary school incentive payment provisions to base such payments on the school's initiating a program designed to lead to communicative competency in a foreign language. Extends through FY 2004 the authorization of appropriations for the foreign language assistance program. Increases the amount of such program funds which may be used for elementary school incentive payments."
