States that nothing in this Act applies to, or grants authority to the Federal Communications Commission with respect to: (1) the imposition of wholesale discount obligations on bulk offerings of advanced services to providers of Internet services or telecommunications carriers or imposition of the duty to provide as network elements the facilities and equipment used exclusively to provide Internet services; (2) technical standards or specifications for the provision of Internet services; or (3) the provision of Internet services. States that a provider of Internet services may not be considered a carrier providing intrastate communication service because it provides Internet services."
