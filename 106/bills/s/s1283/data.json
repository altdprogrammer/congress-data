(Sec. 150) Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to: (1) implement the notice of decision approved by the National Capital Regional Director, dated April 7, 1999, including its provisions concerning the issuance of right-of-way permits at market rates; and (2) expend necessary sums to carry out this mandate. Declares that a Federal agency receiving an application to locate a wireless communications antenna on Federal property in the District of Columbia or surrounding area over which the Federal agency exercises control shall take final action on the application, including action on the issuance of right-of-way permits at market rates.

(Sec. 151) Declares the sense of the Senate that, in considering the District of Columbia's FY 2001 budget, the Senate will take into consideration progress or lack of progress in addressing specified issues, including crime, access to drug abuse treatment, management of parolees and pretrial violent offenders, education, improvement in basic city services, application for and management of Federal grants, and indicators of child well-being. (Sec. 152) Urges the Mayor, before using Federal Medicaid payments to Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH) to serve a small number of childless adults, to consider the recommendations of the Health Care Development Commission. (Sec. 153) Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the law enforcement, court, prison, probation, parole, and other components of the criminal justice system of the District of Columbia, in order to identify the components most in need of additional resources, including financial, personal, and management resources.
