Provides for an alternative calculation of lost earnings due to erroneous coverage.(Sec. 207) Bars an agency from placing an individual under CSRS coverage unless: (1) the individual has been employed with such coverage within the preceding 365 days; or (2) OPM has agreed that the agency's coverage determination is correct.(Sec. 208) Authorizes the OPM Director to: (1) extend deadlines for making elections under certain circumstances; (2) reimburse expenses incurred by an individual with respect to settlement of a claim for losses resulting from a coverage error; (3) compensate an individual for monetary losses that are a direct and proximate result of such an error, excluding claimed losses relating to foregone contributions and earnings under the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) and other investment opportunities; and (4) waive payments otherwise required by this Act.Title III: General Provisions - Provides for conformity with this Act of the Foreign Service and Central Intelligence Agency retirement systems.Title IV: Tax Provisions - Provides that no Federal retirement plan shall fail to be treated as a qualified plan under the Internal Revenue Code by reason of: (1) any failure to follow plan terms as addressed by this Act; or (2) any action taken under this Act.Excludes from individual gross income any amount attributable to a direct transfer under this Act between funds or any Government contribution to any fund or account.Title V: Miscellaneous Retirement Provisions - Includes as creditable service of a Federal employee or Member of Congress for purposes of FERS provisions a period of service (other than any service already creditable under FERS, any military service, and any service performed in the employ of a Federal Reserve Bank) that was creditable under the Bank Plan (the benefit structure in which employees of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System appointed on or after January 1, 1984, participate), if the employee waives credit for such service under the Bank Plan and makes a payment to the TSF equal to the amount that would have been deducted from pay had the employee been subject to FERS during such period of service (together with interest on such amount computed).Excludes from participation in FERS any employee or Member who has separated from civilian service after having been subject to the benefit structure for employees of the Board appointed before January 1, 1984, and having at least five years of civilian service (other than any service performed in the employ of a Federal Reserve Bank) creditable under such benefit structure, except for such persons who subsequently enter a position subject to FERS provisions.Makes provisions regarding creditability and certain former Board employees applicable only to individuals who separate from service subject to FERS on or after the date of enactment of this Act.(Sec. 502) Treats as a separation from Government employment, for purposes of the TSP, any transfer from a position that is subject to FERS, CSRS, or any other retirement system under which individuals may contribute to the TSF through withholdings from pay, to a position that is not subject to any of them.Applies the amendments made by this section to transfers occurring before, on, or after this Act's enactment date. Considers, for transfers occurring before this Act's enactment, the date of transfer to be this Act's enactment date.Title VI: Effective Date - Sets forth the effective date of this Act."
