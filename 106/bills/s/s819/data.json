Allocates 30 percent of funds to NPS units threatened or impaired by activities occurring inside the unit, and 70 percent to units threatened or impaired by activities occurring outside the unit. Specifies an annual amount for FY 2000 through 2015 for the Federal share (50 percent) of the Everglades and South Florida ecosystem restoration project under the Water Resources Development Act of 1996.Prohibits from deposit in the separate account any revenues from any new oil and gas leases, or from development of any existing leases in a moratorium area."
