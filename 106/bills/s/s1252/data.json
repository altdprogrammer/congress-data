    "text": "Standardized School Report Card Act - Requires annual State and school report cards with respect to elementary and secondary education, in easily understandable language. Requires each State educational agency (SEA) receiving assistance under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to produce and widely disseminate a State report card for parents, the general public, teachers and the Secretary of Education. Requires each school receiving assistance under ESEA, or the local educational agency (LEA) serving that school, to produce and widely disseminate a school report card for parents, the general public, teachers and the SEA, in easily understandable language, with respect to elementary or secondary education in the school. Requires such State and school report cards to contain, as appropriate, specified information regarding indicators of school performance and quality, including: (1) student performance in language arts and mathematics, and other assessed subject areas, including comparisons with students elsewhere; (2) attendance and graduation rates; (3) professional qualifications of teachers, and numbers teaching out-of-field or with emergency certification; (4) average class size; (5) school safety; (6) parental involvement; (7) annual school dropout rate; and (8) student access to technology, including computers and the Internet. Directs the Secretary to use Office of Educational Research and Improvement funds to develop a model school report card for dissemination, upon request, to a school, LEA, or SEA. Requires a certain disaggregation of student performance data in State and school report cards."
