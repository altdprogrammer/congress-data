Authorizes such demonstration programs to employ synchronic and asynchronic telecommunications and other appropriate means to maintain coordination and cooperation with one another and with participating Schools and Nests. Requires such programs to provide direction to the Secretary in developing site visit evaluation of Schools and Nests.
