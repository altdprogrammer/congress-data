Limits the Federal share to 76 percent. Requires cooperative agreement concurrence by the Water System Board. Directs the Secretary to: (1) interconnect the Dry Prairie System with the Water System; and (2) provide for the delivery of water to the Dry Prairie System from the Missouri River through the Water System.

Makes the water supply project constructed with assistance under this Act eligible to receive firm power from such program as long as the Fort Peck system operates on a not-for- profit basis. Sets forth provisions regarding recovery of expenses associated with power purchases and purchases of additional power.Requires the Fort Peck tribes and Dry Prairie Rural Water Association Incorporated to develop a water conservation plan containing a description of water conservation objectives and measures and a schedule for implementing such measures and this Act to meet such objectives.Requires any funds received by the Fort Peck tribes pursuant to this Act to be used to offset any claims for money damages against the United States for water rights based on a treaty, compact, executive order, agreement, aboriginal title, or law.Authorizes appropriations."
