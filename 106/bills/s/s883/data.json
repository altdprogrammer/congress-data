Authorizes the Attorney General, upon determining that the scheduling or rescheduling of a substance on a temporary basis is necessary to avoid such imminent hazard, to schedule the substance (by order and without regard to specified requirements relating to the Secretary of Health and Human Services) in schedule I if no exemption or approval is in effect for the substance, or in schedule II if the substance is not listed in schedule I. Authorizes the Attorney General to extend the temporary scheduling or rescheduling of a substance until a final order becomes effective. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) transfer flunitrazepam from schedule IV to schedule I; and (2) add ketamine hydrochloride to schedule III."
