Allows such an action to be commenced by an Indian arts and crafts organization on behalf of itself, or by an Indian on behalf of himself or herself. Authorizes the Attorney General, in the case of such a civil action commenced by the Attorney General upon the request of the Secretary of the Interior on behalf of an Indian who is a member of an Indian tribe or on behalf of an Indian tribe or Indian arts and crafts organization, to deduct from the amount recovered the amount for the costs of investigation awarded and to reimburse the Indian Arts and Crafts Board the amount of such costs incurred as a direct result of Board activities in the suit. Requires the Board to promulgate regulations to include specific examples in the definition of the term \"Indian product.\""
