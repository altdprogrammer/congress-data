    "text": "Sudan Peace Act - Declares that Congress: (1) condemns violations of human rights on all sides of the conflict in Sudan (including the Government of Sudan), the ongoing slave trade there, and the Government's increasing use and organization of \"murahalliin\"or \"mujahadeen\", Popular Defense Forces (PDF), and regular Sudanese Army units into raiding and slaving parties in Bahr al Ghazal, the Nuba Mountains, Upper Nile, and Blue Nile regions; and (2) recognizes that the use of raiding and slaving parties is a tool for creating food shortages as a systematic means to destroy the societies, culture, and economies of the Dinka, Nuer, and Nuba peoples in a policy of low-intensity ethnic cleansing.(Sec. 5) Expresses the sense of Congress that it: (1) declares its support for the efforts by U.S. executive branch officials and the President's Special Envoy for Sudan to lead in a reinvigoration of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD)-sponsored peace process; (2) calls on IGAD member states, the European Union, the Organization of African Unity, Egypt, and other key states to support such process; and (3) urges Kenya's leadership in the implementation of the process.Authorizes the Secretary of State to utilize Department of State personnel for the support of: (1) the secretariat of IGAD; (2) the ongoing negotiations between the Government of Sudan and opposition forces; (3) any peace settlement planning to be carried out by the National Democratic Alliance and IGAD Partners' Forum (IPF); and (4) other U.S. diplomatic efforts with respect to Sudan.(Sec. 6) Expresses the sense of Congress that the President, acting through the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, should take specified actions to increase pressure on the combatants involved in the war in Sudan.(Sec. 7) Imposes certain export and economic sanctions against Sudan until the President determines, and certifies to Congress, that the Government of Sudan has: (1) committed to and made progress toward a peaceful solution to the war in Sudan; (2) made substantial progress in controlling the raiding and slaving activities of all regular and irregular forces, including Popular Defense Forces and other militias and murahalliin; (3) instituted reforms with regard to providing basic human and civil rights to all Sudanese; and (4) ceased aerial bombardment of civilian targets.Directs the President to report to Congress on: (1) the specific sources (including any U.S. sources) and current status of Sudan's financing and construction of oil exploitation infrastructure and pipelines; (2) such financing's relation to sanctions contained in the Executive Order of November 4, 1997; (3) the extent of aerial bombardment by the Government of Sudan forces in areas outside its control; (4) the number, duration, and locations of air strips or other humanitarian relief facilities to which access is denied by any party to the conflict; and (5) the status of the IGAD-sponsored peace process or any other ongoing effort to end the conflict, including the specific and verifiable steps taken by parties to the conflict, the members of the IGAD Partners Forum, and the members of IGAD toward a comprehensive solution to the war.(Sec. 8) Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should organize and maintain a formal consultative process with the European Union, the United Nations Security Council, and other relevant parties on coordinating an effort within the UN to revise the terms of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) to end the Government of Sudan's veto power over OLS plans for air transport relief flights.(Sec. 9) Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should continue to increase the use of non-OLS agencies in the distribution of relief supplies in southern Sudan.(Sec. 10) Directs the President to develop and report to Congress on a contingency plan to provide, outside UN auspices, the greatest amount of U.S. Government and privately donated relief to all affected areas in Sudan, including the Nuba Mountains, Upper Nile, and Blue Nile, in the event the Government of Sudan imposes a ban on OLS air transport relief flights.(Sec. 11) Supports the President's ongoing efforts to diversify and increase the effectiveness of U.S. assistance to populations in areas of Sudan outside of the control of the Government of Sudan, especially the long-term focus shown in the Sudan Transition Assistance for Rehabilitation (STAR) program with its emphasis on promoting democracy, self-reliance, and actively supporting people-to-people reconciliation efforts. Authorizes appropriations.Grants the President authority to undertake any appropriate programs using Federal agencies, contractual arrangements, or direct support of indigenous groups, agencies, or organizations in areas outside the control of the Government of Sudan (including northern, southern, and eastern regions) in an effort to provide emergency relief, economic self-sufficiency, build civil authority, provide education, enhance rule of law and the development of the judiciary, support people-to-people reconciliation efforts, or implementation of any programs in support of any viable peace agreement.Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the President should immediately and to the fullest extent possible utilize the Office of Transition Initiatives at the Agency for International Development to pursue such programs in the Sudan; and (2) priority should be given in current and future development or transition programs undertaken by the U.S. Government to rebuilding and supporting the Rumbek Secondary School in the Sudan.(Sec. 12) Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should assess the humanitarian needs in the Nuba Mountains, Red Sea Hills, and Blue Nile regions of Sudan, and respond appropriately to those needs.(Sec. 13) Directs the President to report to the appropriate congressional committees detailing possible options or plans of the U.S. Government for the provision of nonlethal assistance to participants of the National Democratic Alliance."
