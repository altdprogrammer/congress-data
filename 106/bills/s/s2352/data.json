    "text": "Wekiva Wild and Scenic River Designation Act - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate specified segments of the Wekiva River, Rock Springs Run, and Black Water Creek in Florida as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System (NWSRS).Directs the Secretary of the Interior to offer to enter into cooperative agreements with Florida and Lake, Orange, and Seminole counties, and appropriate local planning and environmental organizations to provide for the long-term protection, preservation, and enhancement of the Wekiva River system (segments of the Wekiva River, Wekiwa Springs Run, Rock Springs Run, and Black Water Creek designated as NWSRS components under this Act). Declares that the Secretary's administration of the system by the use of such agreements shall not constitute National Park Service administration of the Wekiva river system and shall not cause such system to be considered as a National Park System unit. Requires publicly owned lands within the system's boundaries to continue to be managed by the agency having jurisdiction over the lands, in accordance with the statutory authority and mission of the agency.Provides that: (1) if the Secretary determines that a specified segment of Seminole Creek in Florida is eligible for designation as a NWSRS component and the owner of the property through which Seminole Creek runs notifies the Secretary of his or her support for such designation, the Secretary may designate that tributary as an additional NWSRS component; and (2) nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize funding for land acquisition, facility development, or operation.Requires the Secretary to establish the Wekiva River System Advisory Management Committee to: (1) assist in the development of the comprehensive management plan to be developed as required by the Act for the Wekiva River system; and (2) provide advice to the Secretary in carrying out management responsibilities under this Act.Authorizes appropriations."
