    "text": "Religious Liberty Protection Act of 2000 - Prohibits a government (defined as a State, an entity created under State authority, the United States, an instrumentality or official of the United States, or any person acting under color of State or Federal law) from substantially burdening a person's religious exercise: (1) in a government-operated program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance; or (2) in any case in which the burden affects, or in which removal of the burden would affect, international or interstate commerce or commerce with Indian tribes. Allows a substantial burden if the government demonstrates that it is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.Amends the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 to end its applicability to the States and to make it applicable only to the Federal Government, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories and possessions. Redefines (as used in such Act and defines for the purposes of this Act) exercise of religion to mean any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by or central to a system of religious belief, including: (1) the use, building, or converting of real property for religious exercise; and (2) any conduct protected as a religious exercise under the first amendment to the Constitution."
