    "text": "Shields a business entity from civil liability relating to any injury or death resulting from the use of equipment donated by a business entity to a nonprofit organization. Makes this Act inapplicable to an injury or death that results from an act or omission of a business entity that constitutes gross negligence or intentional misconduct, including misconduct that: (1) constitutes a hate crime or a crime of violence or act of international terrorism for which the defendant has been convicted in any court; or (2) involves a sexual offense for which the defendant has been convicted in any court, or misconduct for which the defendant has been found to have violated a Federal or State civil rights law. Preempts State laws to the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this Act, except State law that provides additional protection from liability. Specifies that this Act shall not be construed to supersede any Federal or State health or safety law. Makes this Act inapplicable to any civil action in a State court against a business entity, in which all parties are citizens of the State if such State, citing this Act's authority and containing no other provision, enacts a statute declaring the State's election that this Act not apply to such action in the State."
