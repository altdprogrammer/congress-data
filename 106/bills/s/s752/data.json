    "text": "Decennial Census Improvement Act of 1999 - Prohibits compensation for service performed by an individual in a temporary census position (a temporary position within the Bureau of the Census established for purposes relating to the 2000 decennial census of population) from causing: (1) that individual or any other individual to become ineligible for any benefits provided under any Federal program or any State or local program financed with Federal funds; or (2) a reduction in the amount of any such benefits for which that individual or any other individual would otherwise be eligible. Makes such requirement applicable only with respect to compensation for service performed during calendar year 2000. Prohibits the application of such requirement if the individual performing the service involved is appointed (or first appointed to any other temporary census position) before January 1, 2000. Modifies Federal law regarding exemptions from certain provisions relating to offsets from pay and other benefits for reemployed annuitants and former uniformed service members to make such law: (1) applicable to service in any temporary position within the Bureau established for purposes relating to the 2000 decennial census; and (2) inapplicable to any service performed after December 31, 2000."
