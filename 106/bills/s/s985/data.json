    "text": "Intergovernmental Gaming Agreement Act of 1999 - Amends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to revise provisions concerning tribal-State compacts governing the conduct of Class III gaming activities on Indian lands. Authorizes such activities on Indian lands only if they are authorized by such a compact approved by the governing body of the Indian tribe with jurisdiction. Permits (current law requires) a tribe to request a State to negotiate such a compact. Sets deadlines for the State to respond and for the commencement and conclusion of negotiations. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, at the request of a tribe, if agreement has not been reached on the compact within a prescribed period, to initiate a mediation process to: (1) conclude a compact; or (2) provide for the issuance of gaming procedures by the Secretary. Permits a State to: (1) elect to participate in the mediation; or (2) decline to participate, in which case the Secretary shall issue such procedures. Sets forth provisions concerning: (1) selection of a mediator; (2) the process by which such mediator will submit to the Secretary recommendations for the operation and regulation of gaming; (3) the deadlines by which the Secretary shall make a final determination and issue gaming procedures; and (4) jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia over challenges of the Secretary's gaming procedures or decisions to complete a compact or initiate mediation and over actions to enforce compact provisions or to enjoin gaming activities conducted in violation of a compact. Prohibits: (1) any compact or procedures from requiring that a State undertake any regulation of gaming on Indian lands unless the State consents and the State's laws permit such regulation; and (2) the Secretary from approving a compact that requires State regulation of gaming without the State's or tribe's consent. Directs the National Indian Gaming Commission to monitor, regulate, and license gaming consistent with an approved compact."
