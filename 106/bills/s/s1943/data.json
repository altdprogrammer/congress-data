    "text": "Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to reauthorize and revise provisions for an Inexpensive Book Distribution Program (IBDP) for reading motivation, which is part E of title X (Programs of National Significance) of ESEA.Authorizes the Secretary of Education to enter into a contract with the First Book organization to: (1) pay the Federal share (100 percent) of the cost to First Book of distributing new books to disadvantaged children and families, primarily through tutoring, mentoring, and family literacy programs; and (2) promote the growth and strengthening of First Book Local Advisory Boards to leverage the Federal book distribution efforts and build upon the work of community programs to enhance reading motivation for at-risk children. (Current law authorizes a contract with the Reading Is Fundamental (RIF) organization to support and promote programs, which include the distribution of inexpensive books to students, that motivate children to read. Current law sets the Federal share at 75 percent of the cost of subcontractor costs of purchasing books, but 100 percent in the case of programs serving children of migrant or seasonal farmworkers.) Sets forth requirements for such contract with First Book.Extends through FY 2005 the authorization of appropriations for the IBDP program."
