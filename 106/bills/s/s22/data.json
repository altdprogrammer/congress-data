    "text": "Government Secrecy Reform Act of 1999 - Authorizes the President, in accordance with this Act, to protect from unauthorized disclosure, information owned by, produced by or for, or under the control of the executive branch, when there is a demonstrable need to do so in order to protect the national security of the United States. Sets forth requirements for the establishment of standards and procedures for classifying and declassifying information. Authorizes information to be classified, and classified information under review for declassification to remain classified, only if the harm to national security expected from disclosure of such information outweighs the public interest in disclosure. Requires the President to: (1) prescribe the factors to be utilized in deciding whether the disclosure of information might reasonably be expected to harm national security or might serve the public interest; and (2) in prescribing factors, to also prescribe guidance to be utilized in applying such factors. Bars information from remaining classified under this Act after ten years after the date of original classification. Authorizes an agency official to provide for declassification earlier than such date. Permits an agency official with original classification authority to provide for declassification up to 25 years after the date of original classification under certain conditions. Sets forth additional requirements for other postponements of declassification. Prohibits the declassification or release of information classified under this Act without the approval of the agency that originally classified the information, except as provided in this Act. Directs the President to establish procedures for declassifying information that was classified before this Act's effective date. Requires such procedures to include procedures for the automatic declassification of such information that has remained classified for more than 25 years as of such date. (Sec. 3) Establishes within the National Archives and Records Administration the Office of National Classification and Declassification Oversight (Office) to carry out specified duties with respect to the coordination and oversight of classification and declassification policies and practices of Federal agencies. Requires the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs to provide policy guidance to the Office on behalf of the President. Establishes within the Executive Office of the President the Classification and Declassification Review Board to decide on appeals by agencies which challenge Office declassification orders or Office determinations not to concur in postponement of declassification and on appeals by persons who have filed requests for mandatory declassification review. (Sec. 5) Authorizes agencies to appeal Board decisions or actions to the President. Makes the President's decision on such appeals final. (Sec. 6) Prohibits judicial review of any provision of, or action taken under, this Act, except as otherwise provided by the Freedom of Information Act."
