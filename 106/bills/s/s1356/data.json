Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) promulgate regulations defining \"proximate geographical area\"; and (2) designate, under existing provisions relating to a dumping permit program, at least one site for the dumping of dredged material generated in the vicinity of Long Island Sound. Prohibits, except at the site or sites so designated, the dumping of dredged material in the Sound after the date at least one site is designated."
