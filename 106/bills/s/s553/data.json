Defines \"ILO eligible beneficiary country\" as a least-developed beneficiary developing country or a beneficiary developing country that: (1) the President determines is implementing and enforcing the provisions of Convention No. 138 of the General Conference of the ILO; and (2) has requested the additional benefits.Declares that certain competitive need requirements calling for the withdrawal of duty-free treatment of articles exported to the United States from a beneficiary developing country in a quantity having an appraised value in excess of the applicable amount for the calendar year shall not apply (waiver) to an ILO eligible beneficiary country.Authorizes the President to withdraw, suspend, or limit the designation of a country as an ILO eligible beneficiary country for purposes of the additional benefits if it is determined that: (1) the country no longer meets certain criteria qualifying it as an ILO eligible beneficiary country; or (2) imports of the article to which such benefits have been granted have increased in such amounts as to cause, or threaten to cause, injury to a domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the article."
