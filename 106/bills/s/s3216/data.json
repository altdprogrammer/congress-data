Sets forth provisions permitting a party to file an appeal of such determinations with the Court in cases where the panel does not act or is not convened.Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to grant the U.S. Court of International Trade jurisdiction over the review of a final determination of such a binational panel.Declares that the amendments made by this Act shall apply with respect to goods from Canada and Mexico."
