Grants the Attorney General sole authority to make such determination, which shall last 90 days unless extended after consultation with the appropriate congressional committees.Revises provisions respecting inspection of aliens seeking U.S. admission, including requiring: (1) an alien to be informed of certain rights prior to removal or withdrawal of his or her admission application, and (2) review of a removal order by an immigration judge, with the right of the alien to personally appear and be represented (at his or her expense).Exempts from expedited removal procedures aliens fleeing countries with poor human rights record, as determined by the Attorney General.Revises the procedure used to determine whether an applicant for asylum has a credible fear of persecution.Authorizes (currently requires) the Attorney General to detain asylum applicants pending claims resolution.Repeals a specified limitation on judicial review of alien admissions.Provides, with respect to asylum applicants, for an exception to the filing deadline or a permitted second filing after a rejection upon a showing of good cause."
