    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2000-05-11", 
    "text": "Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000 - Amends the Clean Air Act (the Act) to prohibit the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) or any other ether compound as a fuel additive. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to waive such prohibition with respect to an ether compound other than MTBE if the use of such compound as a fuel additive will not pose a significant human health or environmental risk. Makes such prohibition effective three years after this Act's enactment date.Requires the Administrator to require, during the period beginning on this Act's enactment and ending three years after such date, persons selling gasoline that contains MTBE at retail to label the fuel dispensing system with a notice that the gasoline contains MTBE.(Sec. 4) Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to require the Administrator to develop technical guidelines to assist States in the investigation and cleanup of MTBE in groundwater.(Sec. 5) Revises the oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline under the Act to require the oxygen content to equal or exceed two percent oxygen by weight averaged on an annual basis. (Current law requires such percentage without averaging.) Prohibits the regulations for the use of reformulated gasoline from specifying a minimum oxygen content.(Sec. 6) Requires the Administrator to revise performance standards regarding reformulated gasoline to ensure that the ozone-forming potential, taking into account all ozone precursors, of the aggregate emissions during the high ozone season from baseline vehicles when using reformulated gasoline does not exceed such potential of the emissions from such vehicles when using reformulated gasoline that complies with regulations that were in effect on September 1, 1999, and applicable to such gasoline sold in 2000 and subsequent calendar years.Provides for adjustments to the performance standard for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to account for emissions of carbon monoxide that are greater or less than a specified baseline for emissions achieved by reformulated gasoline containing two percent oxygen by weight and meeting other performance standards.Requires the Administrator to revise performance standards by redefining \"baseline vehicles\" to mean vehicles representative of vehicles (including off-road vehicles) in use as of January 1, 2000.Directs the Administrator to revise performance standards to ensure that the aggregate emissions of precursors of toxic air pollutants, particulate matter (PM)-10, and fine particulate matter from baseline vehicles when using reformulated gasoline do not exceed such emissions from such vehicles when using reformulated gasoline that complies with regulations that were in effect on January 1, 2000, and applicable to such gasoline sold in 2000 and subsequent calendar years.Prohibits the average aromatic hydrocarbon content of such gasoline from exceeding the average aromatic hydrocarbon content of such gasoline sold in covered areas (specified ozone nonattainment areas where the use of such gasoline is required) for use in baseline vehicles when using such gasoline sold during 2000. Sets the maximum aromatic hydrocarbon content of such gasoline at 30 percent.Bars the average olefin content of reformulated gasoline from exceeding the average olefin content of such gasoline sold in covered areas for use in baseline vehicles when using such gasoline during 2000. Limits the olefin content of such gasoline to ten percent.(Sec. 7) Removes a provision which allows the Administrator to waive the oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline for any ozone nonattainment area if the requirement would interfere with the attainment of any national primary ambient air quality standard. Permits the Administrator, if the Secretary of Energy finds that there is an insufficient domestic supply of oxygenates to meet the oxygen content requirement, to promulgate regulations temporarily reducing such requirement to ensure an adequate supply of oxygenates. Requires such regulations to ensure that the environmental benefits of reformulated gasoline are maintained during the period of the temporary reduction in the oxygen content requirement.(Sec. 8) Requires the Administrator, upon the application of a State Governor, to apply prohibitions on the sale of conventional gasoline in covered areas (areas requiring the use of reformulated gasoline), to any nonclassified areas (opt-in areas).(Sec. 9) Directs the Administrator to revise anti-dumping regulations with respect to the sale of gasoline to ensure that this Act and its amendments do not result in any increased emissions in areas that are not covered areas.(Sec. 10) Amends provisions regarding State reasonable progress demonstrations with respect to VOC emissions to authorize States, in making such demonstrations, to claim as a credit toward the requirement for VOC emission reductions an amount equivalent to the ozone-forming potential of carbon monoxide emission reductions attributable to any amount by which the average oxygen content of reformulated gasoline sold in the State exceeds two percent.(Sec. 11) Amends Federal highway provisions to provide that for purposes of determining the estimated tax payments attributable to highway users paid into the Highway Trust Fund, the amount paid into the Fund with respect to the sale or gasohol or other fuels containing alcohol by reason of taxes imposed on special fuels or gasoline shall be treated as equal to the amount that would have been imposed without regard to the reduction in revenues resulting from regulations prohibiting the use of MTBE or other ether compounds as fuel additives under the Clean Air Act and specified Internal Revenue Code provisions concerning alcohol fuels."
