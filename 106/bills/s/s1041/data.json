    "text": "GI Education Opportunity Act of 1999 - Entitles to basic educational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill educational assistance program individuals who are either current participants in the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance program (PVEAP) or have elected not to receive basic educational assistance and who: (1) have completed the requirements of a secondary school diploma, or have completed at least 12 semester hours in a program leading to a standard college degree, before applying for such benefits; (2) if discharged or released, were discharged or released under honorable conditions; and (3) during the one-year period following the enactment of this Act, make an irrevocable decision to receive such benefits in lieu of any other veterans' educational benefits. Requires: (1) the reduction by $1,200 of the basic pay of individuals making such elections; and (2) disenrollment under the PVEAP for those electing to transfer from that program to the Montgomery GI Bill program. Expresses the sense of Congress that any subsequent law which includes provisions terminating or reducing the required contribution of military personnel for PVEAP benefits should terminate or reduce by an identical amount the contributions for Montgomery GI Bill benefits."
