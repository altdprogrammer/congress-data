    "text": "Stalking Prevention and Victim Protection Act of 2000 - Rewrites stalking provisions of the Federal criminal code. Prohibits: (1) for the purpose of stalking an individual, another to travel in interstate or foreign commerce, using or causing another to use the mail or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce, or entering or leaving, or causing another to enter or leave, Indian country; or (2) stalking an individual within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States or within Indian country. Specifies that a person stalks an individual if that person engages in conduct: (1) with the intent to injure or harass the individual; and (2) that places the individual in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to, that individual or a member of that individual's immediate family, or that individual's intimate partner.Directs the court at the time of sentencing for an offense under this Act to issue an appropriate protection order designed to protect the victim from further stalking by the convicted person. Specifies that such order shall remain in effect for such time as the court deems necessary, and may be modified, extended, or terminated at any time after notice to the victim and opportunity for a hearing. Redefines \"crime of violence\" to permit a court to order the detention of an alleged stalking defendant pending trial in order to assure the safety of the community or the defendant's appearance at trial pursuant to the pretrial detention statute."
