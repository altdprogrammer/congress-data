    "text": "Air Travelers Fair Treatment Act of 2000 - Amends Federal transportation law to make it an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition for an air carrier or foreign air carrier to fail to provide a passenger with an accurate explanation of the reasons for a flight delay, cancellation, or diversion from a ticketed itinerary.(Sec. 2) Makes it an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition for an air carrier or foreign air carrier to: (1) prohibit a person (including a governmental entity) that purchases air transportation from only using a portion of the air transportation purchased (including only for one-way travel instead of round-trip travel); or (2) assess an additional fee on or charge to such a person or any ticket agent that sold the air transportation to such person.Makes it an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition for an air carrier or foreign air carrier, in the case of a termination, cancellation, nonrenewal, or substantial change in the competitive circumstances of the appointment of a ticket agent by an air carrier or foreign air carrier, to fail: (1) to provide the ticket agent with written notice, and a full statement of reasons for the action, on or before the 90th day preceding the action; and (2) to provide the ticket agent with at least 60 days to correct any deficiency claimed. Exempts from this rule cases of insolvency, an assignment for the benefit of creditors, bankruptcy, or nonpayment of sums due under the appointment.(Sec. 3) Modifies Federal preemption of State authority over air transportation prices, routes, and service to preempt only direct State prescription of such prices, routes, or levels of service.(Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe regulations to establish minimum standards for resuscitation, emergency medical, and first-aid equipment and supplies to be carried on board an aircraft capable of carrying at least 30 passengers.Prohibits air carriers or foreign air carriers from preventing, hindering, or failing to assist any passenger from exiting an aircraft (under the same circumstances as any flight crew member may exit) if: (1) the aircraft is parked over an hour past its scheduled departure time at an airport terminal gate with access to ramp or other boarding and deplaning facilities; and (2) the aircraft captain has not been informed by air traffic control authorities that the aircraft can be cleared for departure within 15 minutes.(Sec. 5) Establishes the National Commission to Ensure Consumer Information and Choice in the Airline Industry to study and report policy recommendations to the President and the Congress on: (1) consumer access to information about airline industry products and services; and (2) the impediments imposed by the airline industry on distributors of the industry's products and services, including travel agents and Internet-based distributors."
