Permits grants to be made, and contracts and cooperative agreements to be entered into, to assist the city and KTC in the preparation and implementation of such a plan for the land within the city's municipal watershed.Makes this Act effective upon the execution of one or more conservation easements that, subject to valid existing rights of third parties: (1) encumber all lands as specified; (2) provide for the relinquishment by KTC of its development rights on such lands; and (3) provide for perpetual protection and management of specified lands described as a watershed, a municipal drinking water source, a source of fresh water for the Gunnuk Creek Hatchery, and habitat for black bear, deer, birds, and other wildlife. Prohibits: (1) timber harvested from lands conveyed to KTC from being available for export as unprocessed logs from Alaska; and (2) KTC from selling, trading, substituting, or otherwise conveying such timber to any person for export from Alaska. Authorizes appropriations, including to compensate KTC for relinquishing its development rights and to provide assistance to KTC to meet such timber manufacturing and export restrictions. Prohibits such funds from being paid to KTC unless it is a party to such conservation easements."
