    "text": "Veterans' Long-Term Care Enhancement Act of 1999 - Includes noninstitutional extended care services within the definition of medical services authorized to be provided to eligible veterans. Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide assisted living services to a veteran who is eligible to receive hospital, nursing home, and domiciliary care, and to the spouse of such veteran. Requires such veteran and spouse to agree to reimburse the United States for the cost of such care. Repeals provisions authorizing respite care for such veterans. Directs the Secretary to carry out three pilot programs to determine the feasibility and practicability of various methods of meeting the long-term care needs of eligible veterans. Requires each program to be carried out at two Veterans Integrated Service Networks. Requires services provided to include a comprehensive array of health care services and other services that meet such needs, including case management services. Directs the Secretary to emphasize the provision of preventive care services, including screening and education. Requires one pilot program to be carried out: (1) directly through facilities and personnel of the Department of Veterans Affairs; (2) through a combination of Department facilities and personnel and services provided under cooperative arrangements with public and private nongovernmental entities; and (3) through cooperative arrangements with non-Department entities. Outlines provisions concerning: (1) payment for services under the pilot programs; (2) required data collection; and (3) annual reports from the Secretary to Congress for the duration of the programs. Terminates such programs three years after their commencement."
