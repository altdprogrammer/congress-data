    "text": "Dental Health Access Expansion Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), to establish a program for awarding grants to eligible entities and individuals to expand the availability of primary dental care services in federally-designated health professional shortage areas.Makes eligible for such grants: (1) certain health centers located in such designated areas which provide matching non-Federal funds of at least 45 percent of grant amounts; and (2) licensed dentists who practice in such a designated area and 25 percent of whose patients are receiving assistance under a State plan under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2000 through 2004.Requires the HRSA Administrator to design and implement procedures to simplify the process by which dental health professional shortage areas are designated.Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 to repeal (as a funding offset) certain requirements for mortgage insurance premiums on mortgages executed during FY 1991 through 1994 that are obligations of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund."
