    "text": "Services for Children of Substance Abusers Reauthorization Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require that the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (currently, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services administration) make grants for: (1) services for children and families of substance abusers; (2) identification of such children and families; and (3) education and training of providers of such services. Requires grantees to identify children who may be eligible for medical assistance under titles XIX (Medicare) or XXI (Children's Health Insurance) of the Social Security Act. Adds developmentally and age-appropriate alcohol and drug evaluation, early intervention, treatment, and prevention to the services to be provided to children (replacing provisions mandating preventive counseling services). Requires that certain services be provided by a public health nurse, social worker, or similar professional, or by a trained worker from the community supervised by a professional. Allows services to be delivered to families through an entity that meets State licensure or certification requirements for that service. Mandates aggressive outreach to family members with substance abuse problems. Modifies requirements regarding: (1) mandated services for substance abusers and other people involved in abusers' lives; (2) grant eligibility; and (3) information submitted by grant applicants.Modifies reporting and evaluation requirements.Authorizes appropriations.Removes provisions mandating: (1) coordination with the State lead agency and the State Interagency Coordinating Council under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; and (2) peer review as part of the grant awarding process.Authorizes grants for the training of personnel who provide services to children and families to assist the professionals in recognizing drug and alcohol problems and to enhance their skills in identifying substance abuse and obtaining early intervention, prevention, and treatment resources."
