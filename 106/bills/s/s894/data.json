Authorizes the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), without regard to statutes requiring competitive bidding, to contract with up to three qualified carriers to provide group long-term care insurance under this Act. Sets forth contract terms, including a requirement that coverage may not be canceled, except for nonpayment of charges. Provides for five-year, automatically renewable insurance contracts. Describes conditions under which coverage may be terminated. Sets forth required elements of contracts, including portability of benefits. Requires OPM to ensure that at least one of the benefits plans is a Government-wide plan. Makes insured individuals responsible for 100 percent of the charges of coverage and allows sponsoring individuals to have amounts withheld from pay for coverage for qualified relatives. Provides for an open enrollment period at least annually."
