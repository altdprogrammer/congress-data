    "text": "Children's Protection From Violent Programming Act - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to: (1) assess the effectiveness of measures to require television broadcasters and multichannel video programming distributors to rate and encode programming that could be blocked by parents by use of a V-chip; and (2) report its findings annually to specified congressional committees. Authorizes the FCC, if it finds such measures ineffective, to complete a rulemaking prohibiting the distribution of violent video programming during hours when children are reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion of the audience.Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to make it unlawful for any person to distribute to the public any violent video programming not blockable by electronic means specifically on the basis of its violent content. Authorizes the FCC, as part of its rulemaking proceedings, to exempt programming (including news programs and sporting events) whose distribution does not conflict with the objective of protecting children from the negative influences of violent video programming. Exempts premium and pay-per-view direct-to-home satellite programming.Directs the FCC to: (1) impose a forfeiture penalty of up to $25,000 on any person who violates such requirements; and (2) revoke any broadcasting or distribution license issued, in the case of repeat violators.Requires the FCC to study and report to specified committees on the marketing to children of violent content by the motion picture, music recording, and computer and video game industries, including whether such practices have improved under a specified model of self-regulation recommended by the FCC."
