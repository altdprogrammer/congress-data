Provides for the determination of an eligible small business or smaller enterprise that is not required to pay Federal income tax at the corporate level but that is required to pass income through to its shareholders or partners by using a specified formula to compute its after-tax income. Requires the Small Business Administration to issue SBIC guarantees and trust certificates at periodic intervals of not less than every 12 (currently, six) months."
