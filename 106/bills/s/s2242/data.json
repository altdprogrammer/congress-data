    "text": "Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act Amendments of 2000 - Amends the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998 to require the inclusion within annual lists submitted by the heads of executive agencies to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) those activities performed by Federal Government sources for such agency that are inherently governmental functions. (Currently, such lists are required only with respect to activities determined not to be inherently governmental functions.) Requires a description of each such activity and list publication within 30 days after receipt.Requires notification to agency employees who are engaged in an activity listed as not being inherently governmental that such activity may be converted to performance by a private source.Requires competitive procedures to be used when considering contracting with a private source for the performance of an activity that is not inherently governmental.Requires OMB Circular A-76 and applicable Federal laws to be followed in cost comparisons of performing a function within the executive agency versus through a private source. Allows an activity not inherently governmental to be performed by a private source without a cost comparison if the activity is currently performed by fewer than ten full-time Federal employees.Prohibits an agency activity not inherently governmental from being performed by another Federal source unless, within three years prior, performance of such activity has been justified pursuant to Federal competitive procedures. Prohibits the performance within State or local agencies of an activity not inherently governmental unless the head of such agency has first: (1) solicited offers for performance of such activity under Federal procurement requirements; and (2) determined that no responsible private source is available to meet the agency's needs with respect to that activity.Allows an interested party to submit to an executive agency a challenge of the classification of any activity on a list for which a notice of public availability has been published. Revises publication deadlines.Prohibits the conversion of agency performance of an activity not inherently governmental to performance by a Federal Prison Industries government corporation.Excludes research and development from consideration as an inherently governmental function.Requires the OMB Director to report to Congress on the portability of Federal pension benefits."
