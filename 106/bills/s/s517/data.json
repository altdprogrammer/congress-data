    "text": "Access to Emergency Medical Services Act of 1999 - Provides that if a group health plan or health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer provides any benefits with respect to emergency services, the plan or issuer shall cover such services: (1) without the need for any prior authorization determination; (2) whether or not the health care provider furnishing such services is a participating provider with respect to such services; (3) in a manner so that if such services are provided by a nonparticipating provider, the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee is not liable for amounts that exceed the liability that would be incurred if the services were provided by a participating provider; and (4) without regard to any other term or condition of such plan or coverage (other than exclusion or coordination of benefits, a specified affiliation or waiting period, and applicable cost sharing). Requires such plans or issuers, in the case of maintenance or post-stabilization care services other than emergency services, to provide for reimbursement for services provided by nonparticipating providers in a manner consistent with specified guidelines relating to promoting efficient and timely coordination of maintenance and post- stabilization care of an enrollee under the Social Security Act or such guidelines as the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish. Requires information regarding coverage of emergency services to be made available annually by plans and issuers. Amends the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code to deem requirements of the Access to Emergency Medical Services Act of 1999 to be incorporated into such Acts and the Internal Revenue Code."
