Sets forth provisions relating to the treatment of land or natural resources transferred by the Pueblo prior to this Act's enactment date and ratifies such transfers.

Authorizes appropriations. Prohibits disbursal of amounts in the Fund until: (1) the case of Pueblo of Santo Domingo v. Rael has been dismissed with prejudice; and (2) the compromise final judgment described above has been entered in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.Declares the boundaries of the Santo Domingo Pueblo Grant, as determined by the 1907 Hall-Joy Survey, to be the current boundaries of the Grant and that any lands currently owned or hereafter acquired by the Pueblo within such boundaries or the Grant shall be considered to be Indian country."
