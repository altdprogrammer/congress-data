    "text": "Youth Violence Prevention Act of 1999 - Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (the Act) to prohibit: (1) the sale or other disposition of a firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person has committed an act of violent juvenile delinquency; and (2) the shipment transport, or possession in interstate or foreign commerce of a firearm or ammunition, or the receipt of any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, by a person who has committed an act of violent juvenile delinquency. Specifies that: (1) what constitutes an adjudication of an act of violent juvenile delinquency shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held; and (2) any State conviction or adjudication of such an act that has been expunged or set aside, or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored, shall not be considered a conviction or adjudication of an act of violent juvenile delinquency for purposes of the Act. Amends the Act to set penalties for: (1) straw purchases of firearms (transferring a firearm knowing or having reasonable cause to know that another will carry or otherwise possess, discharge, or use the firearm in the commission of a violent felony); (2) possession by a juvenile of a handgun or ammunition in violation of Act provisions regarding transfer to a person, whom the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a juvenile, of a handgun or ammunition suitable for use only in a handgun, and, during the same course of conduct, violating provisions regarding possession of a firearm in a school zone, with intent to carry or otherwise possess, discharge, or otherwise use the handgun or ammunition in the commission of a violent felony; and (3) persons other than juveniles who knowingly violate provisions of the Act regarding the transfer to a person, whom the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a juvenile, of a handgun or ammunition suitable for use only in a handgun, knowing or having reasonable cause to know that another will carry or otherwise possess, discharge, or use the firearm in the commission of a violent felony. Tightens restrictions under the Act on temporary transfers of a handgun or ammunition to, and possession or use by, a juvenile. Makes current exemptions regarding such transfers applicable only if the juvenile's possession and use of a handgun or ammunition are in accordance with State and local law and if specified other conditions apply."
