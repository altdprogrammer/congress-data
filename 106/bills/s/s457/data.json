Requires, when a person applies to buy a handgun, that: (1) the licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer contact the chief law enforcement officer of the prospective purchaser's place of residence; and (2) five (currently, three) business days have elapsed since the licensee contacted the national instant criminal background check system."
