    "text": "Arctic Coastal Plain Domestic Energy Security Act of 2000 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Land Management, to: (1) establish and implement a competitive oil and gas leasing program for the exploration, development, and production of oil and gas resources in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (Alaska); (2) ensure that such program does not result in significant adverse effects upon either fish, wildlife, or the environment; and (3) ensure receipt of fair market value by the public for the mineral resources to be leased.(Sec. 3) Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 to repeal the proscription against the leasing or development for oil or gas production on the Coastal Plain.Declares that: (1) Congress has determined that such oil and gas leasing activities are compatible with the purposes for which the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was established; and (2) no further findings or decisions are required.Authorizes the Secretary to designate up to a total of 45,000 acres of the Coastal Plain as Special Areas closed to leasing, but within which the Secretary may permit: (1) restrictive lease terms with respect to surface use and occupancy; and (2) the use of horizontal drilling technology from sites located outside the designated Special Areas.States that this Act constitutes the Secretary's sole authority to close lands to oil and gas exploration and production within the Coastal Plain. Directs the Secretary to convey: (1) the surface estate of specified Coastal Plain lands to the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation; and (2) the subsurface estate beneath such surface estate to the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation.(Sec. 6) Prescribes procedural guidelines for lease sales on the Coastal Plain, including lease terms, conditions, and bonding requirements. Provides for expedited judicial review in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia with respect to actions of the Secretary.(Sec. 12) Directs the Secretary to grant rights of way and easements across the Coastal Plain for oil and gas transportation. Mandates that all revenues received by the Federal Government from competitive transactions and charges derived from Coastal Plain oil and gas leasing be deposited into the Treasury. Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to pay semiannually to the State of Alaska the same percentage of such revenues as is set forth in specified law."
