    "text": "Social Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to make it out of order in the Senate to consider a concurrent budget resolution (or amendment thereto or conference report thereon) that violates a provision of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 that provides that the receipts and disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors and Disability Insurance Trust Funds (social security trust funds) shall not be counted for purposes of the presidential or congressional budget or the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act).Makes it out of order in the Senate to consider a concurrent budget resolution (or amendment thereto or conference report thereon) that sets forth a deficit for any fiscal year. Makes such point of order inapplicable if the deficit for a fiscal year results solely from the enactment of social security reform legislation or provisions designated as emergency requirements.Expresses the sense of the Senate that the congressional budget resolution for FY 2000 provides a sound framework for allocating resources to Medicare to modernize Medicare benefits, improve the solvency of the program, and improve coverage of prescription drugs."
