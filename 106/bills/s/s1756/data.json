Permits such transactions when use of a conventional agreement would not be appropriate.(Sec. 8) Mandates that, with respect to National Laboratories and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) facilities, all actions taken by the Secretary in implementing this Act shall be through the Administrator for Nuclear Security in conformance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000.(Sec. 9) Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to reflect the provisions of this Act with respect to strategic plans, experimental Federal waivers, and time required for approval.(Sec. 10) Declares that it shall be an objective of the NNSA Administrator to obligate funds for either cooperative research and development agreements, or cost-shared research partnerships with non-Federal organizations, in an amount at least equal to prescribed percentages appropriated for specified fiscal years. Requires the Administrator to report to congressional defense committees regarding attainment of such objective."
