Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for violations of such requirements.(Sec. 10) Sets forth certain reporting and recordkeeping requirements for manufacturers of motor vehicles or motor vehicle equipment with respect to: (1) accidents that result in fatalities, injuries, or fires involving such vehicles or equipment; and (2) certain warranty information, consumer complaints, personal injury claims, and other safety-related information as they relate to actual or potential defects.(Sec. 11) Increases civil penalties for tampering with motor vehicle odometers.(Sec. 12) Directs the Secretary to initiate rulemaking proceedings to: (1) review and revise motor vehicle safety standards for pneumatic tires; and (2) improve the labeling of tires in order to improve public understanding of load limits and appropriate tire inflation levels.(Sec. 14) Authorizes appropriations for FY 2001 for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration."
