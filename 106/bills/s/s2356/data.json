    "text": "Child and Adult Care Food Program Management Improvement Act of 2000 - Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to revise provisions for management of the child and adult care food program (CACFP).(Sec. 2) Excludes from CACFP eligibility institutions that State agencies responsible for CACFP administration determine to have been seriously deficient in the administration or operation of any Federal, State, or local program during the previous five-year period, or another period determined appropriate by the Secretary of Agriculture.(Sec. 3) Revises provisions for CACFP institutional approval and applications. Requires the State agency to: (1) determine that the institution is administratively capable of operating the program described in its application, and that its participation is necessary to ensure adequate availability of benefits to eligible participants; (2) establish criteria for selecting among institutions if the number of eligible institutions exceeds that necessary to ensure the adequate availability of program benefits to eligible participants; and (3) in the case of private institutions, with the exception of family or group day care homes, conduct a satisfactory prior inspection of institutions which must have tax-exempt status, operate a federal program requiring nonprofit status, or receive compensation under the Social Security Act for providing nonresidential child care or day care outside school hours for at least 25 percent of its enrolled children or licensed capacity.(Sec. 4) Prohibits the Secretary from requiring public organizations acting as sponsoring organizations for one or more family or group day care homes to compare costs to receive administrative reimbursement under CACFP. Directs the Secretary to permit such public organizations to submit biennial budgets for administrative costs.(Sec. 5) Allows State agencies to withhold reimbursements temporarily without a hearing for up to 90 days under specified conditions.(Sec. 6) Requires State agencies to limit the ability of family or group day care homes to transfer from a sponsoring organization to another sponsoring organization more frequently than once a year or to a sponsoring organization that ceases to participate in CACFP. Authorizes State agencies to permit or require such homes to transfer from a sponsoring organization to another sponsoring organization more frequently than once a year in the case of extenuating circumstances.(Sec. 7) Limits payments for administrative expenses for sponsoring organizations to costs incurred in administrating CACFP. Requires State agencies to limit such administrative expense payments to no more than 15 percent of the CACFP payment to the sponsoring organization. Directs the Secretary to evaluate and adjust such maximum limitation on the basis of the results of a study of administrative costs required under this Act.(Sec. 8) Requires a State to return, and the Secretary to reallocate to other States on the basis of need, any audit funds allocated under CACFP that are not obligated by the State for that fiscal year.(Sec. 9) Directs the Secretary to reserve a specified portion of funds to provide training and technical assistance to State agencies to improve their CACFP management and oversight.(Sec. 10) Establishes a program of grants to not more than five State agencies to improve CACFP programs. Directs the Secretary to reserve a specified amount of funds for such grants. Requires State agencies to meet specified eligibility requirements and use such grants to collaborate with State and local licensing agencies and lead agencies that administer grants under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to establish State or local licensing requirements for all categories of family or group day care homes and child care centers located within the State.(Sec. 11) Allows State agencies to: (1) retain up to 50 percent of any funds collected as a result of their audits or reviews of institutions participating in CACFP; and (2) use such funds for program costs they incur to improve management and operation of CACFP.(Sec. 12) Directs the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, to study and report to specified congressional committees on the administrative rate structure and administrative costs of institutions acting as sponsoring organizations of family or group day care homes and sponsoring organizations of other specified organizations. Reserves specified funds for such study."
