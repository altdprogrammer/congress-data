Defines as a qualified small business for such assistance one which: (1) has acquired a brownfield site; or (2) uses any hazardous substance during its course of business and has limited or no access to cleanup capital from conventional sources. Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to direct the SBA to promote the establishment of one or more small business investment companies the primary purpose of which is to finance: (1)such cleanup activities; or (2) projects that assist small businesses in cleaning up their facilities and adopting new, clean technologies. Provides a set-aside for such financing of the lesser of $2 million or ten percent of the amount authorized for purchases of participating securities and guarantees of debentures under such Act. Defines a \"brownfield site\" as an abandoned, idled, or underused commercial or industrial facility, the expansion or redevelopment of which is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination."
