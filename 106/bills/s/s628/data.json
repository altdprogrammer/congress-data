Requires the Secretary to study and report to Congress on: (1) the implementation of this Act; and (2) all matters relating to the creation of a national uniform policy on advance directives. Amends titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, with regard to advance directives in order to: (1) require service providers and eligible organizations to provide an appropriately trained professional for discussing advance directive issues with all adult individuals receiving medical care by or through such entities; and (2) ensure that an advance directive valid in one State will be honored in another State. Requires the Secretary, through the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), to: (1) establish and operate a clearinghouse and 24-hour toll-free telephone hotline to provide consumer information about advance directives and end-of-life decision making; (2) conduct ongoing evaluations of innovative health care programs that provide end-of-life care to Medicare beneficiaries who are seriously ill or who suffer from a medical condition that is likely to be fatal; and (3) conduct demonstration projects to develop new and innovative approaches to providing such end-of-life care. Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress on the quality of end-of-life care under Medicare, together with any suggestions for legislation to improve the quality of such care. Provides for necessary funding of such evaluations, demonstration projects, and annual reports. Amends SSA title XVIII, as amended by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, to provide for Medicare coverage of self-administered prescription drugs which are prescribed for the relief of chronic pain in patients with a life-threatening disease or condition."
