    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "2000-01-07", 
    "text": "Surface Transportation Act of 1999 - Amends Federal transportation provisions to repeal a provision requiring that funds allocated to a State in accordance with High Priority Projects Program requirements of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) be treated as amounts in addition to sums that a State is apportioned for programmatic purposes.Authorizes a State to use for a project under the High Priority Projects Program any funds apportioned under such provisions for which the project is eligible. Allows a State, if a project is not eligible for such funds, to use for the project certain funds apportioned to the State under the Surface Transportation Program (STP). Directs that such apportioned funds be reimbursed from amounts allocated for the project in an amount equal to that used under this section, but not to exceed the total of the amounts allocated for the project.(Sec. 3) Authorizes the obligation of National Highway System funds for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and rehabilitation of, and preventative maintenance for, intercity rail passenger facilities and rolling stock, including passenger facilities and rolling stock for transportation systems using magnetic levitation.Authorizes the use of STP funds for capital costs for vehicles and facilities, whether publicly or privately owned, that are used to provide intercity passenger service by rail (including vehicles and facilities that are used to provide transportation systems using magnetic levitation).Makes eligible under the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program certain projects or programs that will have air quality benefits through acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and rehabilitation of, and preventative maintenance for, intercity rail passenger facilities and rolling stock, including passenger facilities and rolling stock for transportation systems using magnetic levitation.Transfers to Amtrak and publicly-owned intercity passenger rail lines specified highway funds.(Sec. 4) Revises provisions regarding the Historic Bridges Program to replace a restriction that caps the amount of Federal-aid highway funds that can be spent on a historic bridge to a sum equal to the cost of demolition with one that equals 200 percent of such cost. Provides that if a State determines that the relocation of a historic bridge is a reasonable alternative, the eligible reimbursement project costs shall be equal to the greater of the Federal share that would be available for the construction of a new bicycle or pedestrian bridge or 200 percent of the cost of demolition of the historic bridge.(Sec. 5) Amends TEA-21 to make all obligation authority for the minimum guarantee program available as multi-year funding.(Sec. 6) Amends TEA-21 to direct the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to establish a system consisting of: (1) a commercial motor vehicle registration information clearinghouse to facilitate the electronic exchange and reconciliation of interstate commercial motor vehicle registration information; and (2) an electronic remittance netting function with electronic funds transfer capability through a central U.S. bank to facilitate payment of commercial motor vehicle registration fees. Requires that such system include intrastate commercial motor vehicle registration information to the extent that each State elects to submit such information to the Secretary for purposes of the system.Authorizes the Secretary to delegate, by means of a contract, the duties of the Secretary for purposes of this section to an entity outside the Department of Transportation if the Secretary provides continuing oversight. Directs the Secretary to work with representatives of the Governments of Canada and Mexico and other appropriate officials to encourage their participation in the clearinghouse established under this section.Makes specified funding available for FY 2000-2002. Prohibits the Secretary and an entity to which a delegation is made from making any expenditure of such funds to facilitate the participation by a State in the system until the State enters into an agreement with the Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury to submit interstate and intrastate commercial motor vehicle registration information to the Secretary of the Treasury.(Sec. 7) Authorizes the Secretary, at the request of a State, to transfer apportioned funds and obligation authority from funds made available to the State to another State or to the Federal Highway Administration for the purpose of funding one or more specific projects. Directs that the transferred funds be used for the same purpose and in the same manner as that for which they were authorized. Specifies that such transfer shall have no effect on any apportionment formula used to distribute funds to the States.
