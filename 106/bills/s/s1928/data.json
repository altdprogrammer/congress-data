Requires the demonstration project to be conducted at up to eight sites jointly designated by the Secretaries. Directs the VA Secretary to establish and operate coordinated care health plans to provide benefits to the targeted veterans enrolled in the project.Modifies the current Medicare subvention demonstration project for military retirees, permitting a one year extension of the project and, under certain conditions, permitting payment on a fee-for-service basis.Increases from 45 percent to 51 percent the amount that may be reduced, for cost reporting periods after FY 1999, from the amount of Medicare enrollee bad debt that is otherwise treated as allowable costs for purposes of determining the reasonable costs of Medicare-reimbursable outpatient hospital services furnished to Medicare enrollees."
