Excludes spina bifida from such defects, along with familial or birth-related defects or injuries. Directs the Secretary to provide to such children necessary health care to address the defect and any associated disability. Authorizes the Secretary to provide vocational training to such a child if the achievement of a vocational goal is reasonably feasible.Directs the Secretary to pay a monthly allowance to such a child, the amount to be determined through a schedule rating the various covered defects and disabilities and their degree. Prohibits individuals receiving benefits or assistance under these provisions from receiving benefits or assistance under provisions authorizing benefits for children of Vietnam veterans who are born with spina bifida. Prohibits the provision of any assistance or benefits where affirmative evidence shows the birth defect to be the result of something other than service in Vietnam."
