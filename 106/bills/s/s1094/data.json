    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1999-05-20", 
    "text": "Amends the General Education Provisions Act to require public or private elementary school or secondary schools that receive Federal funds to inform the school to which one of their students is transferring whether the student is in good standing. Requires such a statement to be provided within ten days after the school receives notice of a student's intent to transfer to the other school. Defines good standing as being eligible to attend class at the school from which the student is transferring and not being subject to a period of suspension or expulsion from that school. Requires such statement to include the date and duration of a suspension or expulsion in cases where the student has been suspended or expelled for knowingly possessing a weapon in a school building or on school grounds, for knowingly possessing, selling, or delivering an illegal drug in a school building or on school grounds, or for battering a staff member of the school, and the period of the suspension or expulsion has not expired. Prohibits such a student from being allowed to attend class in any elementary school or secondary school that receives Federal funds until the student serves the entire period of the suspension or expulsion. Directs the Secretary of Education to develop a one page standard form for schools to use in providing such statement."
