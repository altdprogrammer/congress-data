Considers a candidate's contribution of personal funds to be an out-of-State contribution.(Sec. 102) Prohibits a candidate and the candidate's authorized committees from accepting contributions used to pay campaign debt 90 days after a general or special election.(Sec. 103) Raises, as specified, contribution limits in a general election for a candidate when an opponent of the candidate and the opponent's authorized committee make certain aggregate expenditures from the opponent's personal funds. Requires a candidate's principal campaign committee to notify the Federal Election Commission of certain excess aggregate expenditures made using the candidate's personal funds.(Sec. 104) Increases and indexes individual and multicandidate political committee contribution limits.Title II: Disclosure Requirements - Requires the disclosure of disbursements made by national political parties aggregating more than $1,000 made during a calendar year for certain political activities.(Sec. 202) Makes it unlawful, except with the separate, written, voluntary authorization of each individual, for: (1) national banks or corporations to collect or assess its stockholders or employees any dues, initiation fee, or other payment as a condition of employment or membership if any part of such dues, fee, or payment will be used for political activities in which the national bank or corporation is engaged; and (2) labor organizations to collect from or assess its members or nonmembers any dues, initiation fee, or other payment if any part of such dues, fee, or payment will be used for political activities.States that an authorization shall remain in effect until revoked and may be revoked at any time.Requires disclosure by: (1) corporations or national banks to shareholders of the amount of each disbursement made for political activities or that otherwise influences Federal elections; and (2) labor organizations to dues paying members and nonmembers the amount of each disbursement made for political activities or that otherwise influences Federal elections, including contributions and expenditures. Requires corporations, national banks, and labor organizations to disclose to the Commission annual disbursements aggregating $1,000 or more for certain permissible activities.Title III: Reporting Requirements - Revises requirements regarding FECA reports to require a candidate's principal campaign committee to file reports: (1) during the months of July, August, September, and October preceding an election; and (2) for each 24 hour period beginning 15 days before an election.(Sec. 302) Revises provisions regarding contributor information accounts of political committees to require specified contributor information for contributions in any amount.(Sec. 303) Prohibits a candidate's authorized committee from depositing or otherwise negotiating a contribution without the complete required contributor information.(Sec. 304) Repeals current reporting provisions regarding electronic filing. Replaces them with new provisions: (1) permitting the filing of FECA reports using computers and facsimile machines; and (2) requiring campaign finance information to be accessible to the public on the Internet and to be publicly available at Commission offices within 24 hours after such information is received by the Commission.Title IV: Use of Government Property and Services - Amends Federal postal law to repeal the current requirement regarding the mailing of any mass mailing as franked mail by Members of, or Members-elect to, the Congress. Replaces them with a requirement banning Members of, or Members-elect to, the Congress from mailing any mass mailing as franked mail.(Sec. 402) Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit and set penalties for the use of White House meals and accommodations for political fund raising.(Sec. 403) Expresses the sense of the Congress that Federal law clearly demonstrates that \"controlling legal authority\" under the Federal criminal code prohibits the use of Federal property to raise campaign funds.(Sec. 404) Amends the Federal criminal code to impose criminal penalties upon anyone who solicits or receives anything of value in consideration of providing a person with access to Air Force One, Marine One, Air Force Two, Marine Two, the White House, or Vice President's residence.(Sec. 405) Amends FECA to require any political committee of a national political party for whom the President, Vice President, or any executive department head uses Air Force One for transportation for any travel which includes a fund raising event for committee benefit to reimburse the Federal Government for the fair market value of the transportation of the individual involved, based on the cost of an equivalent commercial chartered flight.(Sec. 406) Requires a candidate for election for Federal office (other than a candidate who holds Federal office) to reimburse the Federal Government via the candidate's principal campaign committee for the costs of using Government property for campaign-related travel for election for such office.Title V: Effective Date - Sets forth the effective date of this Act."
