Increases the limits on statutory damages per work: (1) from a minimum of $500 to $750; and (2) from a maximum of $20,000 to $30,000.Increases from $100,000 to $150,000 the maximum amount to which a court may increase the award of statutory damages per work where the copyright owner sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that infringement was committed willfully.Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission by a specified deadline to promulgate emergency guideline amendments to implement the requirements of the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act for sentences sufficiently stringent to deter criminal infringement of a copyright or trademark, in accordance with certain procedures set forth in the Sentencing Act of 1987, as though the authority under that Act had not expired."
