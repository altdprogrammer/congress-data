    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that whoever, acting with the state of mind otherwise required for the commission of a Federal offense, intentionally engages in conduct that, in fact, constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of the offense, is guilty of an attempt and is subject to the same penalties as prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the attempt (but bars imposition of the death penalty).Specifies that inability to commit the offense, and completion of the offense, are not defenses to a prosecution under this Act, with exceptions.Makes it an affirmative defense, on which the defendant bears the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence, that under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of criminal intent, the defendant prevented the commission of the offense."
