    "text": "Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to establish a new subpart 3, Child Centered Program, under part A (Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local Educational Agencies) of title I (Helping Disadvantaged Children Meet High Standards).Allows States and participating local educational agencies (LEAs) to use funds under subpart 1 (Basic Program Requirements) and subpart 2 (Allocations) to carry out such child centered program. Requires States and such LEAs to use certain incentive grant funds to carry out such program.Allows an LEA, if its State does not carry out such a child centered program or have an approved application for a fiscal year, to elect to carry out such a program. Requires the Secretary of Education to provide directly to such LEA the funds it is eligible for under subparts 1 and 2 to carry out such program. Requires participating LEAs to obtain State approval of the submission, but not of the contents, of their applications for such program assistance.Requires the Secretary to award incentive grants to States (or directly to LEAs under the described conditions) that elect to carry out such a child centered program and have an approved application. Bases such incentive grant amounts on relative share of funds received under subparts 1 and 2. Authorizes appropriations for such incentive grants.Sets forth requirements for State and LEA use of child centered program funds from subparts 1 and 2 and incentive grants, including: (1) establishing per-pupil amounts which may be varied because of certain factors; and (2) providing supplemental education services directly or through a contractor, or, if requested and selected by the child's parent or legal guardian, a tutorial assistance provider, another public school, or a private school.Allows use of child centered program funds for schoolwide programs under specified conditions.Requires that private school children receive comparable services.Requires participating States and LEAs to operate statewide or school-district-wide open enrollment programs. Requires public schools receiving such child centered program funds to carry out parent involvement activities, including annual meetings and information on parents' right to choose to use the per pupil amount to purchase supplemental education services from the specified types of providers.Sets forth requirements for program applications, administration, State and LEA reports, termination authority, and evaluations and reports by the Comptroller General.Prohibits Federal control of specified types of State and local education decisions as a condition for eligibility to receive funds under this Act. Prohibits preemption of a State constitution or statute that pertains to expenditure of State funds in or by religious institutions."
