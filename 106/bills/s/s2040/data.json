(Thus excludes the Fund's receipts and disbursements from the U.S. Budget.)Amends the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to provide that all amounts in such Fund at the end of any fiscal year shall be immediately available for expenditure or obligation, without further appropriation, at the commencement of the next fiscal year. (Currently, amounts from the Fund are available only when appropriated.)"
