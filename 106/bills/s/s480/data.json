    "text": "Credit Card Consumer Protection Act of 1999 - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to: (1) prohibit fee assessment against a credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan solely on the basis of on-time payments; (2) require advance notice of any interest rate increase for a credit card account, and of the consumer's right to cancel such account before the effective date of that increase; and (3) prohibit post-cancellation increases in interest rates and fees on the outstanding balance of any canceled cards. Mandates disclosure to a credit card account holder of the fees and interest rates imposed upon credit advances through the use of third party checks. Proscribes over-the-limit fees in creditor-approved transactions and two-cycle billing. Prescribes additional notice requirements governing introductory rates to identify the fixed and variable interest rate which will apply following the introductory period."
