Allows the appointment of a Real Property Officer for any major component of an agency, who shall report to the Senior Real Property Officer.Makes the Senior Real Property Officer for each agency responsible for continuously monitoring agency real property assets to: (1) ensure that the management of each asset is fully consistent with and supportive of the goals and objectives of the agency's Strategic Plan and reflected in an agency asset management plan; (2) identify assets that can benefit from the application of enhanced asset management tools (see Title IV); (3) ensure, in cases where an asset can benefit from application of an enhanced asset management tool, that any resulting transaction will result in a fair return on the Federal Government investment and protect the Government from unreasonable financial or other risks; and (4) ensure that a listing and description of the agency's assets is provided to the Administrator.Title IV: Enhanced Authorities for Real Property Asset Management - Authorizes the head of a landholding agency to apply an enhanced asset management tool to a real property interest when such interest: (1) when used to acquire replacement real property, is not excess property; (2) is used to fulfill or support a continuing mission requirement; and (3) can, by applying an enhanced asset management tool, improve the support of such mission.Requires the agency head, before applying an enhanced asset management tool to such an interest, to determine that such application: (1) supports the agency's Strategic Plan and real property asset management plan; (2) is the most economical and cost effective option available for the use of the real property; and (3) is documented in a business plan which, commensurate with the nature of the selected tool, analyzes all reasonable options for using the property; takes into account applicable provisions of law, including the National Environmental Policy Act; and evidences compliance with the requirements of the Stewart B McKinney Homeless Assistance Act.Authorizes any landholding agency to acquire replacement real property by: (1) transfer or exchange of real property subject to this Act with other Federal agencies under terms mutually agreeable to the agencies involved; and (2) selling or exchanging a real property asset or interests therein with any non-Federal source, provided that the transaction does not conflict with other applicable laws governing the acquisition of real property interests by Federal agencies, the agency first made the property available for transfer or exchange to other Federal agencies, and the transaction results in the agency receiving fair market value consideration for the asset sold or exchanged.Allows the head of any landholding agency to make available to other Federal agencies and to non-Federal entities the unexpired portion of any government lease for real property, provided that the sublease results in the agency receiving fair market rental value for the asset. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) priorities for subleasing; (2) out-leasing agreements; (3) forms of consideration; (4) transactional reports; and (5) annual reports.Title V: Incentives for Real and Personal Property Management Improvement - Authorizes Federal agencies to retain from proceeds from the sales of personal property amounts necessary to recover the full costs of disposing of such property, including the costs for warehousing, storage, environmental services, advertising, appraisal, and transportation. Directs that: (1) such amounts be deposited into an account available for such expenses without regard to fiscal year limitations; and (2) amounts that are not needed to pay such costs be transferred at least annually to the general fund or to a specific account in the Treasury as required by statute.Rewrites provisions regarding the transfer or sale of property to provide for agency retention of the proceeds from real property, and the crediting of monetary proceeds to the agency's capital asset account. Allows agencies to be reimbursed from the monetary proceeds of real property dispositions or from other available resources, including the agency's capital asset account, for the full costs of disposing of such property.Sets forth a schedule for implementing this title.Title VI: Streamlined and Enhanced Disposal Authorities - Authorizes the Administrator to convey the U.S. interest in surplus real and related personal property which the Secretary of the Interior has determined is suitable and desirable for use as a historic monument, for the benefit of the public, to a qualified nonprofit organization established for the primary purpose of preserving historic monuments, provided that the State, political subdivision, instrumentalities thereof, and municipality in which the property is located do not request conveyance to them.Makes the authority of any department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive branch or wholly owned Government corporation to convey or give surplus real and related personal property for public airport purposes subject to the requirements of the Act. Directs that any such surplus real property available for conveyance first be made available to the Administrator for disposal, including conveyance for any public benefit purposes, including public airport use.Amends the Stewart B McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to: (1) direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), on a quarterly basis, to request information from each landholding agency regarding surplus, unutilized, or underutilized public buildings and real property (current law) that have not been previously reported on by the agency; (2) extend to 90 days (currently 60 days) the period during which written notice may be filed of intent to apply for property for use to assist the homeless; (3) direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to give a preference to applications that contain a certification that their proposal is consistent with the local Continuum of Care strategy for homeless assistance; and (4) make such Act inapplicable to buildings and property that are in a secured area for national defense purposes or that are inaccessible by road and can be reached only by crossing private property.Directs the Secretary of HUD: (1) to survey landholding agencies to determine whether the properties included in the last comprehensive list of properties published under such Act remain available for use to assist the homeless; and (2) to publish in the Federal Register a list of all such properties.Title VII: Miscellaneous - Provides that the authorities granted by this Act to Federal agency heads for real and personal property transactions and management shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any existing authorities.Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) severability; and (2) judicial review."
