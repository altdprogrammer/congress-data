Extends from within six months to within 12 months of the pertinent election the period during which a campaign audit of a candidate's authorized committee may be begun.Grants authority to the Commission to seek, at any time during an administrative enforcement proceeding, a temporary restraining order or a temporary injunction if the Commission believes there is a substantial likelihood that a violation is occurring or is about to occur.Revises the requirement regarding the payment of a civil penalty for knowing and willful violations of any contribution or expenditure prohibition or limit. Increases the maximum civil penalty that a conciliation agreement may require from the greater of $10,000 or an amount equal to 200 percent of the contribution or expenditure involved to the greater of $15,000 or an amount equal to 300 percent of the contribution or expenditure involved.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2001."
