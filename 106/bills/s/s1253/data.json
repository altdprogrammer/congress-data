Declares that, for purposes of that Act, the site shall not be considered to have resulted from an act of God.(Sec. 10) Authorizes the Secretary to enter into an agreement with a foundation under which the foundation may receive, hold, and administer amounts to support public-private partnerships that further this Act's purposes. Authorizes such a foundation to solicit and accept any gift or donation to further this Act's purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer certain funds appropriated under this Act to such a foundation.(Sec. 11) Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
