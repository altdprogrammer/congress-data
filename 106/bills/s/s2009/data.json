Requires that at least 99 percent of such funds be awarded to eligible LEAs in the first year, and 99.5 in the second and in each succeeding year that an SEA receives such a grant. Allows the remainder to be used for State activities and administrative costs related to the grant program.Requires reports by SEAs, LEAs, and the Secretary.Directs the Secretary, at the end of the third year an SEA participates in the program, to permit continued participation only if the SEA has met its performance goals and objectives for two consecutive years.Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on this Act's impact on student achievement.Authorizes appropriations."
