    "text": "Eisenhower National Clearinghouse Improvement Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to revise provisions for the renamed Eisenhower National Clearinghouse for Education (currently only \"for Mathematics and Science Education\"). Includes language arts and social studies (as well as mathematics and science) among the education subjects for which the Clearinghouse carries on certain activities, including: (1) maintaining a repository of instructional materials and programs for elementary and secondary schools; (2) compiling information on Federal programs; and (3) disseminating information, programs, and instructional materials. Requires the Clearinghouse to: (1) gather qualitative and evaluative materials and programs; (2) review and rank materials and programs on the basis of such evaluations; and (3) distribute review results to teachers in an easily accessible form. Prohibits the Clearinghouse, however, from directly conducting an evaluation of the materials or programs. Directs the Clearinghouse, in reviewing evaluations of materials and programs, to give particular attention to the effective use of education technology in mathematics, science, language arts, and social studies."
