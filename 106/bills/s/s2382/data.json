and (2) U.S. development assistance for any testing or breeding feasibility study, variety improvement or introduction, consultancy, publication, conference, or training in connection with the growth or production in a foreign country of an agricultural commodity grown or produced in the United States, with specified exceptions.(Sec. 112) Amends the International Financial Institutions Act to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Directors of specified international financial institutions to use the U.S. vote to oppose any assistance by them for the production or extraction of any commodity or mineral for export, if it is in surplus on world markets and such assistance will cause substantial injury to U.S. producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity.(Sec. 113) Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit U.S. assistance (other than direct and guaranteed loans and credit and insurance programs by OPIC) to provide: (1) financial incentive to a business enterprise located in the United States to relocate outside the United States if such incentive is likely to reduce the number of employees of such enterprise because U.S. production is being replaced by it outside the United States; (2) assistance to establish or develop in a foreign country any export processing zone in which the tax, tariff, labor, environment, and safety laws of such country do not apply to activities within the zone, unless the President determines and certifies that such assistance is not likely to cause a loss of jobs within the United States; or (3) assistance for any project that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights within a recipient country or zone, except that such assistance shall not be precluded for the informal sector of such country, micro and small-scale enterprise, and smallholder agriculture.(Sec. 114) Declares that assistance under this Act should make full use of American resources, including commodities, products, and services, to the maximum extent possible.Expresses the sense of Congress that, to the greatest extent practicable, all agricultural commodities, equipment, and products purchased with funds made available in this Act should be American-made.

Authorizes appropriations.Grants the President authority to undertake any appropriate programs using Federal agencies, contractual arrangements, or direct support of indigenous groups, agencies, or organizations in areas outside the control of the Government of Sudan (including northern, southern, and eastern regions) in an effort to provide emergency relief, economic self-sufficiency, build civil authority, provide education, enhance rule of law and the development of the judiciary, support people-to-people reconciliation efforts, or implementation of any programs in support of any viable peace agreement.Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the President should immediately and to the fullest extent possible utilize the Office of Transition Initiatives at the Agency for International Development to pursue such programs in the Sudan; and (2) priority should be given in current and future development or transition programs undertaken by the U.S. Government to rebuilding and supporting the Rumbek Secondary School in the Sudan.(Sec. 232) Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should assess the humanitarian needs in the Nuba Mountains, Red Sea Hills, and Blue Nile regions of Sudan, and respond appropriately to those needs.(Sec. 233) Directs the President to report to the appropriate congressional committees detailing possible options or plans of the U.S. Government for the provision of nonlethal assistance to participants of the National Democratic Alliance.Subtitle D: Assistance to Countries With Large Populations Having HIV/AIDS - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to revise requirements for assistance for health programs in developing countries to declare that Congress recognizes: (1) the growing international dilemma of children with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); and (2) that mother-to-child transmission prevention strategies can serve as a major force for change in developing regions, and that it is therefore a major objective of the foreign assistance program to control the acquired immune deficiency syndrom (AIDS) epidemic. Provides that Congress expects the agency primarily responsible for administering this Act to make the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS a priority in the foreign assistance program for developing countries. Authorizes appropriations (earmarking amounts for training and training facilities in sub-Saharan Africa and U.S. contributions to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative).(Sec. 245) Directs the President to enter into negotiations with foreign government officials and other interested parties to establish an international vaccine purchase fund that would: (1) accept contributions from governments to purchase and distribute in developing countries vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, and any infectious disease which causes the deaths of over one million people worldwide each year; and (2) be a significant market incentive for private sector vaccine research.(Sec. 246) Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into negotiations with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) or the International Development Association (IDA), and with their member nations and other interested parties, for the creation of two trust funds which would accept contributions from governments, the private sector, and nongovernmental entities to: (1) address the AIDS epidemic in countries eligible to borrow from the IDA; and (2) provide support for or the establishment of programs which provide primary and secondary education for orphans in sub-Saharan Africa. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 248) Directs the President to coordinate the development of multidonor strategy to provide for the support and education of AIDS orphans and the families, communities, and institutions most affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa.
