    "text": "Amends the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 to prohibit the providing of U.S. intelligence information to the United Nations or any of its affiliated organizations, or to any United Nations officials or employees, unless the President certifies to specified congressional committees that the Director of Central Intelligence has required, and such organization has implemented, procedures for protecting intelligence no less stringent than procedures maintained by nations with which the United States regularly shares such intelligence information. Authorizes waiver of such requirement upon the President's certification to such committees that providing such information is in the direct national interest of the United States and that all possible measures protecting it have been taken. Requires the President to report at least quarterly to specified congressional committees on the types and volume of intelligence provided to the United Nations, including the purposes for which it was provided, an assessment of all the security risks, and any unauthorized intelligence disclosures that become known."
