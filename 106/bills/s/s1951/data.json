Provides for the deeming of such an interruption when oil and gas prices in the United States increase to a level likely to cause a significant adverse impact on the national economy as a result of the anticompetitive conduct of one or more foreign countries or international entities.Directs the President to present a status report to certain congressional committees if the price of a barrel of crude oil exceeds a specified price for a period greater than 14 days, including: (1) the impact upon the price of home heating oil; and (2) whether the President supports a drawdown and distribution from the SPR."
