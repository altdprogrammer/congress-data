Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to submit to Congress a report on the effectiveness of the TRIAD program.Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Aging, to provide to the Attorney General of each State and to publicly disseminate in each State, including to area agencies on aging, information designed to educate senior citizens and raise awareness about the dangers of fraud, including telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud. Directs the Secretary to give priority, in disseminating information, to areas with high incidents of fraud against senior citizens.Directs the Attorney General to: (1) conduct a study to assist in developing new strategies to prevent and otherwise reduce the incidence of crimes against seniors; and (2) include as part of each National Crime Victimization Survey statistics related to crimes targeting or disproportionately affecting seniors, crime risk factors for seniors, and specific characteristics of the victims of crimes who are seniors.Expresses the sense of Congress that State and local governments should fully incorporate fraud avoidance information and programs into programs that provide assistance to the aging."
