    "text": "Title I: The Disabled Veterans Memorial - Authorizes the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation to establish a memorial on Federal land in the District of Columbia or its environs to honor disabled veterans who have served in the U.S. armed forces.(Sec. 101) Prohibits Federal funds from being used to pay any expense of the establishment of the memorial.Title II: Commemorative Works Act Amendments - Commemorative Works Clarification and Revision Act of 2000 - Amends the Commemorative Works Act of 1986 to: (1) state as one of the Act's purposes encouraging the location of commemorative works within the urban fabric of the District; (2) exclude from the meaning of \"commemorative work\" any structure that is not a commemorative work as defined by the Act; (3) define sponsor; (4) update the map covered by the Act to include the \"Reserve,\" defined as the great cross-axis of the Mall, extending from the U.S. Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, and from the White House to the Jefferson Memorial.(Sec. 202) Excludes a work solely commemorating a limited military engagement from the Act (currently, a work commemorating a lesser conflict). Extends from ten to 25 years the period of time that must elapse between the end of a war or military conflict and the establishment of a memorial.Changes from the House Committee on House Oversight to the House Committee on Resources committee jurisdiction over legislation authorizing commemorative works in the District and its environs.Allows members of the National Capital Memorial Commission to appoint designees to serve in their place.Prohibits the authorization of sites for commemorative works within the Reserve after January 1, 2000.Requires that a commemorative work be located to protect cultural and natural resources (as well as open space and existing public use).Prohibits commemorative work designed primarily as a museum from being located on lands under the Secretary of the Interior's jurisdiction in Area I or in East Potomac Park. Authorizes the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts to develop criteria or guidelines specified to each site that are mutually agreed upon to ensure that the design of the commemorative work carries out the Act's purposes.Prohibits the acknowledgment of donor contributions to such works in any manner as part of the work or its site.Mandates that monies provided by a commemorative work's sponsor for its maintenance shall be available, without further appropriation, for the non-recurring repair of such work.Requires a commemorative work's sponsor (currently, person) to donate at least 10 percent of the total estimated construction costs to offset the costs of perpetual maintenance and preservation costs of the work, and requires such proceeds to be available for the nonrecurring repairs of such work. Authorizes the Secretary or the National Park Foundation to make donated moneys available for the maintenance of a commemorative work.Repeals the authority of the Secretary or the Administrator of the General Services Administration (as appropriate) to suspend a sponsor's activities if it is determined that fund raising efforts have misrepresented an affiliation with a commemorative work or the United States. Requires the work sponsor to submit annual operations reports, including audited financial statements, to the Secretary or the Administrator (as appropriate).Repeals authority to make temporary site designations.Revises provisions for expiration of legislative authority for a commemorative work seven years after its enactment. Provides in the alternative for expiration of such authority seven years from the date of enactment of authority to locate the work within Area I where such addition authority has been granted, unless (as under current law) the Secretary or the Administrator (as appropriate) has issued a construction permit, or: (1) final design approvals have been obtained from specified commissions; and (2) 75 percent of the amount estimated to be required for memorial completion has been raised. Provides that, if these conditions are met, the Secretary or the Administrator may extend the seven-year legislative authority for up to three years. Terminates any previous site and design approvals upon expiration of the legislative authority.Directs the National Capital Planning Commission, in coordination with the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Memorial Commission, to complete its master plan to guide the location and development of future memorials outside the Reserve for the next 50 years, including evaluation of and guidelines for potential sites.Mandates that nothing in this Title shall apply to memorials whose sites were approved before the enactment of this Title."
