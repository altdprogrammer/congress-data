    "text": "Violent Offender DNA Identification Act of 1999 - Requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to develop a voluntary plan to assist State and local forensic laboratories in performing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analyses of DNA samples collected from convicted offenders, aimed at eliminating the backlog of convicted offender DNA samples awaiting analysis in State or local forensic laboratory storage in an efficient, expeditious manner that will provide for their entry into the Combined DNA Indexing System (CODIS). Sets forth provisions regarding plan conditions and plan implementation. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 3) Revises the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 to authorize the Director of the FBI to expand CODIS to include information on DNA identification records and analyses related to criminal offenses and acts of juvenile delinquency under Federal law, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and the District of Columbia (DC) Code.Modifies the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (VCCLEA) to authorize the Director to establish an index of individuals adjudicated delinquent for acts of juvenile delinquency, including specified qualifying offenses. Directs that the index include only information on DNA identification records and DNA analyses that undergo semiannual external proficiency testing and that meet other specified requirements.Requires the Director to establish a list of qualifying offenses, such as an act of juvenile delinquency under Federal law that constitutes a crime of violence, and certain standards and procedures.Requires: (1) the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to collect a DNA sample from each individual in the custody of the Bureau who has been convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for a qualifying offense; and (2) the agency responsible for the supervision under Federal law of an individual on supervised release, parole, or probation to collect a DNA sample from each individual who has been convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for a qualifying offense.Authorizes the Government of DC to: (1) identify one or more categories of individuals who are in custody of, or under supervision by, DC, from whom DNA samples should be collected; and (2) collect a DNA sample from each such individual.Directs the Director of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for DC, or the Trustee appointed under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 as appropriate, to collect a DNA sample from each individual under Agency or Trustee supervision who is on supervised release, parole, or probation and who has been convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for a qualifying offense.Directs the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations that specify categories of conduct punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (qualifying military offenses) that are comparable to qualifying offenses, and set forth standards and procedures for the analysis of DNA samples collected from individuals convicted of a qualifying military offense, their inclusion in an index, and the expungement of DNA identification records and analyses under specified circumstances.Sets criminal penalties for individuals from whom the collection of a DNA sample is required or authorized who fails to cooperate in the collection of that sample.Authorizes appropriations. Requires such cooperation as a condition of probation, supervised release, or release generally.Sets forth report and evaluation requirements."
