Prescribes consultation and coordination guidelines. Permits the Board and the Secretary to authorize financial subsidiaries of banks to engage in merchant banking.Permits such financial activities upon the condition that all insured bank holding company (BHC) subsidiary depository institutions are well capitalized and well-managed, and upon BHC certification that they meet certain Board standards.Authorizes the appropriate Federal banking agency to prohibit an FHC or insured depository institution from commencing any new activity, or acquiring control of a company engaged in such activity, if any of its insured depository institution subsidiaries or affiliates failed to receive a satisfactory rating at its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA).Instructs the Board to apply capital and management standards that are comparable to a U.S. counterpart of a foreign bank that operates a branch or agency, or owns or controls a commercial lending company in the United States, giving due regard to the principle of national treatment and equality of competitive opportunity.Cites circumstances under which certain companies that become BHCs after enactment of this Act are authorized to continue their commodities transactions and affiliations. Sets forth cross-marketing restrictions for FHC-controlled depository institutions. Nullifies a BHC election to become an FHC if its subsidiary insured depository institutions failed to achieve a rating of \"satisfactory record of meeting community credit needs\" at its most recent examination.(Sec. 104) Retains the McCarran-Ferguson Act as the law of the United States.Proscribes any State laws which impede or restrict insurance sales activities by an insured depository institution. Enumerates permissible State restrictions upon certain insurance sales practices conducted by insured depository institutions. Preserves certain State regulatory oversight over insurance. Preempts certain State affiliation laws governing insurance companies and affiliates.Prohibits State regulation of the insurance activities of an insured depository institution or its affiliate that in any way discriminates adversely between insured depository institutions and other entities engaged in insurance activities.(Sec. 105) Mandates that mutual BHCs be regulated on the same terms as BHCs.(Sec. 106) Amends the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 to apply to any branch of a bank owned by an out-of-State BHC its prohibition against interstate branching by an out-of-state bank primarily to establish deposit production offices.(Sec. 107) Amends the BHCA with regard to: (1) overdraft errors; (2) divestiture requirements; and (3) foreign bank subsidiaries of limited purpose credit card banks.(Sec. 108) Directs the Board and the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the feasibility of requiring large insured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies whose failure could have serious adverse effects upon financial stability to maintain some portion of their capital in the form of subordinated debt in order to reduce the risk to any deposit insurance fund, and to minimize financial instability (\"too big to fail syndrome\").(Sec. 109) Instructs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the extent to which credit is being provided to small businesses and farms as a result of this Act.Subtitle B: Streamlining Supervision of Financial Holding Companies - Prohibits the Board from imposing any capital or capital adequacy criteria upon a BHC subsidiary that is not an insured depository institution, and is: (1) in compliance with State or Federal capitalization rules; (2) registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; or (3) licensed as an insurance agent in the State. Prohibits the Board, when developing capital adequacy requirements, from taking into consideration any affiliated investment company which is neither a BHC, nor controlled by one holding 25 percent or more shares of the investment company worth more than $1 million.(Sec. 111) Subjects securities and insurance activities conducted by a functionally regulated subsidiary of a bank to the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and State regulatory authority, respectively.(Sec. 112) Declares ineffective and non-enforceable any Board actions requiring an insurance company BHC or a registered securities broker-dealer BHC to provide assets to a subsidiary insured depository institution if either the State insurance authority or the SEC determines in writing that such actions would have a material adverse effect on the BHC's financial condition. Permits the Board to order divestiture of the subsidiary in lieu of other action. States that BHCA restraints placed upon Board authority over BHCs and their functionally regulated subsidiaries also limit the authority of the Federal banking agencies with respect to those companies and their subsidiaries. Allows the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to examine the affiliate of any depository institution to disclose fully its relationship with the institution, and the effect of that relationship on the institution.(Sec. 113) Prohibits the Board from taking certain statutory action against a functionally regulated BHC subsidiary unless it is necessary to prevent or redress an unsafe or unsound practice or breach of fiduciary duty that poses a material risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of either an affiliated depository institution or to the domestic or international payment systems.(Sec. 114) Sets forth criteria under which the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board, and the FDIC, are authorized to restrict with prudential safeguards the relationships or transactions between entities and subsidiaries under their respective jurisdictions.(Sec. 115) Denies a Federal banking agency examination authority over a registered investment company that is neither a BHC nor a savings and loan holding company. Grants the FDIC examination authority over an insured depository institution affiliate if necessary to determine the condition of the insured depository institution for insurance purposes.(Sec. 116) Provides that a declaration filed by a company seeking to be an FHC shall satisfy BHC registration requirements but not any requirement to file an application to acquire a bank.Revises BHCA divestiture procedures to permit a BHC to elect divestiture of either a nonbanking subsidiary or an insured depository institution.(Sec. 117) Amends the FDIA to prohibit the use of the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) to benefit any shareholder or affiliate (other than an insured depository institution receiving FDIA assistance) (currently only any shareholder) of any insured depository institution: (1) in Federal conservatorship or receivership; (2) in default or in danger of default, or (3) in connection with the provision of certain insurance or other specified assistance.(Sec. 118) Amends the BHCA of 1956 to repeal strictures governing activities of BHC subsidiaries in connection with insurance and savings bank life insurance.Subtitle C: Subsidiaries of National Banks - Amends Federal banking law to set forth a statutory framework within which a national bank may control or hold an interest in a financial subsidiary. Restricts such subsidiary to activities that are: (1) financial in nature; or (2) permissible for a national bank to engage in directly. Bars such subsidiary from engaging in certain insurance, or real estate development and investment activities.(Sec. 121) Prescribes guidelines for mandatory coordination between the Secretary and the Board with respect to any determination of whether an activity is financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity.Requires a national bank that establishes or maintains a financial subsidiary to have in place: (1) procedures for identifying financial and operational risks within the bank and its subsidiary that adequately protect the bank from such risks; and (2) procedures to preserve the separate corporate identity and limited liability of the bank and its subsidiary.Amends the Federal Reserve Act (FRA) to set forth: (1) statutory parameters for transactions between national banks and their financial subsidiaries; (2) a rebuttable presumption of control of portfolio companies; and (3) a deadline by which the Board must adopt final rules regarding derivative transactions and intraday credit.Amends the FDIA to set forth requirements for safety and soundness firewalls applicable to financial subsidiaries of insured State banks that are in compliance with this Act.
