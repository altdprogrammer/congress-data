Prohibits any action from being taken to diminish access to such land by FHWA employees except when taken for security reasons.Requires the Director to ensure compliance by the CIA with the deed restrictions that apply to such land.Requires compliance by the Secretary and the Director with the terms and conditions of the Interagency Agreement between the NPS and the CIA regarding the exchange and management of the land subject to such Agreement.Requires the Secretary and the Director to complete the exchange not later than 120 days after this Act 's enactment.Requires: (1) any land conveyed to the Secretary to be included within the boundary of the Parkway and to be administered by the NPS as part of the Parkway and (2) any land conveyed to the Director to be administered as part of the CIA's Headquarters Building Compound."
