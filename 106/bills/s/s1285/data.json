    "text": "Law Enforcement Public Aviation Reform Act of 1999 - Amends Federal aviation safety law to expand the definition of \"public aircraft\" with respect to aircraft operated by one unit of government on behalf of another, pursuant to a cost reimbursement agreement, when necessary to respond to a significant and imminent threat to life or property, and no air service by a private operator is available. Repeals the restriction of this definition to the unavailability of private air service. Deems any such aircraft to be public aircraft if operated for law enforcement or search and rescue purposes, or in response to imminent threats to life, property, or natural resources, without regard to whether it is operated under an intergovernmental cost reimbursement agreement."
