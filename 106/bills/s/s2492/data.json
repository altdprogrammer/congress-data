    "text": "Nuclear Weapons Complex Conversion Act of 2000 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to expand and enhance the activities under the Nuclear Cities Initiative (Initiative) so as to: (1) assist the Russian Federation in the downsizing of its nuclear complex; and (2) coordinate such downsizing with other U.S. nuclear nonproliferation programs. Requires the Secretary, in carrying out such actions, to: (1) facilitate the enhanced use of the technology, research and development services of the Russia Ministry of Atomic Energy; and (2) accelerate the Initiative by implementing programs at specified Russian cities in which nuclear weapons facilities exist in order to convert significant portions of activities from military to civilian activities.Urges the President to enter into negotiations with the Russian Federation for the Federation's development of a plan to restructure its nuclear complex in order to meet changes in Russian nuclear security requirements by 2010. Directs the Secretary to carry out a program to encourage students in the United States and the Russian Federation to pursue careers in nonproliferation.Authorizes appropriations. Expresses the sense of Congress that availability of Initiative funds after FY 2001 should be contingent upon: (1) demonstrable progress in enhancing and accelerating Initiative activities; and (2) the development and implementation of Russia's nuclear restructuring plan.Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) there should be a National Coordinator for Nonproliferation Matters to coordinate various Federal nonproliferation programs, including the Initiative; and (2) such Coordinator position should be similar to the Coordinator position filled by the President under the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996."
