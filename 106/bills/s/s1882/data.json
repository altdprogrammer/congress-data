    "text": "Child Support Enforcement Options Act of 1999 - Amends title III (Unemployment Insurance) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to permit the State agency charged with administration of State unemployment compensation law to disclose wage information, upon request, to any individual or person enforcing child support obligations (as well as to officers or employees of any State or local child support enforcement agency, as under current law). Authorizes the State agency charged with administration of State unemployment compensation law to impose fees to cover its administrative costs for such disclosure.Amends SSA title IV part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) promote the enforcement of child support obligations through activities conducted by either a private attorney or a public entity in order to ensure the fullest use of available enforcement resources not requiring Federal financial support; and (2) provide private attorneys or public enforcement agencies registered with the Secretary access to enforcement remedies and resources. Includes among such remedies and resources: (1) the collection of overdue child support from Federal and State income tax refunds; (2) passport restrictions; (3) consumer credit bureau reporting; and (4) financial institution data matches. Sets forth implementation procedures.Requires a State to prescribe by statute a procedure for the expeditious payment of child support received on behalf of the entitled individual by a State instrumentality or local government (or its authorized entity) at the address (including a financial institution for electronic transfer or direct deposit of funds) and in care of the individual or entity last legally specified for receipt of such payment, without regard to whether the child support obligation is being enforced under an approved State plan, and without the necessity of obtaining a judicial or administrative order."
