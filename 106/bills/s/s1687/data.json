Requires such officials to hear any petition filed with the FTC, by the acquiring person or by the person whose voting securities or assets are to be acquired, to determine: (1) whether a request for additional information or documentary material is unreasonably cumulative, unduly burdensome or duplicative; or (2) whether the request for such information or material has been substantially complied with by the petitioning person. Provides for an expedited merger review process of petitions filed with the FTC. Directs the Attorney General and the FTC to report annually to Congress with respect to merger notifications and the submission of additional information or documentary material relevant to such mergers."
