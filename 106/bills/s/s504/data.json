(Sec. 107) Establishes the Advisory Committee on Federal Campaign Reform to study the laws (including regulations) that affect how election campaigns are conducted and the implementation of such laws and make recomendations for change. Requires the Committee to submit a biennial report to the Congress which shall include: (1) any recommendations for changes in the laws governing the conduct of Federal campaigns, including any changes in the rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives to which a majority of Committee members agree; and (2) a draft of any proposed legislation, including both the majority and the minority views with regard to any recommendation. Sets forth fast-track procedures for congressional consideration of a Federal election Act to carry out the Committee's recommendations. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 108) Authorizes appropriations for funding FEC. Directs FEC to establish a schedule of user fees for persons required to file reports. States that any fees collected are hereby appropriated for FEC and Committee use in carrying out their duties, and shall remain available without fiscal year limitation. Limits the estimated operating costs of such entities. (Sec. 109) Authorizes FEC to conduct random audits and investigations to ensure voluntary compliance with FECA and to seek an injunction if it believes there is a substantial likelihood that a FECA violation is occurring or is about to occur. (Sec. 111) Increases the penalty for knowing and willful violations. (Sec. 112) Permits FEC to expedite certain proceedings. Title II: Enhanced Campaign Finance Disclosure - Amends FECA to require authorized committees to deposit certain contributions in an escrow account unless the information required is complete. (Sec. 202) Modifies the term \"identification\" to include an affirmation that any individual (or any other person) is not prohibited from making a contribution. (Sec. 203) Revises certain reporting requirements."
