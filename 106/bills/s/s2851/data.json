    "text": "Prohibits the President from obligating or expending any appropriated funds for a covered deployment of the armed forces until the President submits to the appropriate officials and committees of Congress a report on the deployment which shall: (1) specify the vital national interests which require the deployment, the likely consequences of the deployment on such interests and any other national interests, and the adverse consequences to such interests of the absence of such deployment; (2) specify why diplomatic and other means, other than the deployment, are unable to secure the interests specified; (3) identify concrete policy objectives which are to be achieved by the deployment, the specific military missions which are designed to achieve each such policy objective, and the anticipated date, or the set of conditions, that defines the endpoint of the deployment; and (4) specify the authority for the deployment under the Constitution and under international law.Provides that such prohibition shall not apply in the case of a deployment in response to a war or national emergency declared by the President or Congress that is caused by an attack on the United States, or its territories or possessions, or on the armed forces abroad. Requires the President, if the prohibition does not apply with respect to a deployment, to submit to the appropriate congressional officials and committees a report on the deployment that meets the requirements specified above as soon as practicable after the date of the deployment."
