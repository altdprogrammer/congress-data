    "text": "East Timor Self-Determination Act of 1999 - Declares that: (1) Congress recognizes that the Government of Indonesia took a positive step by agreeing on September 12, 1999, to the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to East Timor; and (2) the purpose of this Act is to encourage such Government to take such additional steps as are necessary to create a peaceful environment in which the United Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) can fulfill its mandate and implement the results of the August 30, 1999, vote on East Timor's political status.Prohibits the provision of economic assistance (except humanitarian assistance), or military assistance, or the licensing or delivery of exports of defense articles or defense services (except in connection with the international peacekeeping force) to the Government of Indonesia or East Timor.Applies such prohibitions with respect to the Government of Indonesia until the President determines and certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that certain conditions prevail, including: (1) a generally safe environment exists for the return of Timorese who were forced to flee the militia-led violence; (2) the UN Assistance Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) can resume its mandate without threat or intimidation; (3) significant steps have been taken to implement the results of the August 30, 1999, vote on East Timor's political status; and (4) the Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia have ceased engaging in violence in East Timor, have ceased support and training of armed militias opposed to East Timor's independence, and are withdrawing their forces from East Timor in cooperation with a UN-supervised process of transferring sovereignty to an independent East Timor.Urges the President to continue to coordinate with other countries, particularly member states of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, to develop a comprehensive, multilateral strategy to further the purposes of this Act."
