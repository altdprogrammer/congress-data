    "text": "Federal Employees Child Care Act - Directs the Administrator of General Services to: (1) establish health, safety, and facility standards and compliance requirements for child care in executive branch facilities; (2) issue regulations requiring any entity sponsoring a child care facility to comply with standards of a child care accreditation entity; and (3) establish an interagency council to facilitate cooperation and sharing of best practices. Directs the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, the Librarian of Congress, and the head of a designated entity in the Senate to ensure that the corresponding child care facility obtains accreditation by a child care accreditation entity in accordance with such entity's accreditation standards, and if it does not maintain accreditation status with a child care accreditation entity, to issue regulations governing its operation to ensure the safety and quality of care of children placed in it. Requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to issue regulations for child care facilities, and entities sponsoring child care facilities, in judicial facilities. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 4) Directs the Administrator and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to jointly submit to Congress a report that evaluates child care provided by entities sponsoring child care facilities in executive, legislative, or judicial facilities. (Sec. 5) Permits an executive agency to use agency funds to provide child care services, in a facility owned or leased by an executive agency, or through a contractor, for its civilian employees. Requires funds so used to be applied to improve the affordability of child care for lower income employees. (Sec. 6) Amends Federal law to revise conditions for the allotment of space for child care services for Federal employees in Federal buildings. Makes available child care and related services to children of Federal employees or on-site Federal contractors, or dependent children who live with such employees or contractors. (Currently space may be allotted for the provision of child care services to children of whom at least 50 percent have one parent or guardian who is a Federal employee.) Requires the Administrator to confirm that at least 50 percent of aggregate enrollment in Federal child care centers Government-wide are children of Federal employees or on-site Federal contractors, or dependent children who live with such employees or contractors. States that, if enrollment at a center does not meet the percentage goal, the provider shall develop and implement a business plan with the sponsoring Federal agency to achieve the goal within a reasonable time frame. Authorizes a Federal agency without a child care program, or the Administrator upon identifying a need for child care at a Federal agency, to enter into an agreement with a non-Federal, licensed, and accredited child care facility, or a planned facility that will become licensed and accredited. Permits a Federal agency, upon the approval of the agency head, to conduct a pilot project for no more than two years to test innovative approaches to providing more cost-effective alternative forms of child care assistance for Federal employees. Requires the Administrator to serve as an information clearinghouse for such pilot projects initiated by other Federal agencies. Requires each Federal child care center located in a Federal space to ensure that each employee undergoes a criminal history background check consistent with the Crime Control Act of 1990."
