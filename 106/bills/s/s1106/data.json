Requires the Secretary to establish standards for benefit eligibility frequency. Prohibits related denial of coverage, incentives to individuals, restrictions on provider-patient communications, and provider penalties. Allows State laws providing greater detection or prevention benefits.Amends PHSA to apply such requirements to coverage offered in the individual market."
