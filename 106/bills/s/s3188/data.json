    "text": "Cyber Security Enhancement Act - Prohibits critical infrastructure information, records relating to such information, and information on critical infrastructure protection derived from such information or records that are submitted voluntarily by a non-Federal source to a critical infrastructure protection office or program from being made available under the Freedom of Information Act, if the person submitting such information or records expressly so requests. Allows the withdrawal of such a request at any time. Protects such information or records for five years after their submission and allows an extension for an additional five years.Makes the antitrust laws inapplicable to conduct: (1) facilitating responses intended to correct or avoid a cyber security related problem; or (2) communicating or disclosing information to help correct or avoid the effects of such a problem.Amends the Federal criminal code to: (1) increase the maximum terms of imprisonment for fraud and related activities in connection with the use of computers; and (2) authorize the use of subpoenas in cases involving cyber crime.Requires a plan to encourage: (1) the standardization of Federal, State, and local law enforcement requests to Internet service providers and other entities for electronic information and records used to investigate computer crimes; and (2) such providers to prevent or impede the use of false Internet protocol addresses as a means of access to Internet servers."
