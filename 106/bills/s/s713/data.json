Limits such deduction to an individual recognized by the Commission as a whaling captain charged with the responsibility of maintaining and carrying out such sanctioned whaling activities. Lists as whaling expenses those for: (1) the acquisition and maintenance of whaling boats, weapons, and gear; (2) food and other provisions for the crew; and (3) storage and distribution of the catch."
