Allows such expense for itemizers and non-itemizers. Exempts reserve member expenses from entertainment expense disallowance and partial meal and entertainment limitation.Title II: Additional Benefits for Reserves of the Armed Forces - Reserve Components Equity Act of 2000 - Amends Federal law to authorize armed forces reserve and National Guard personnel traveling to perform annual training duty outside the continental United States to travel on a space-required basis between the member's home and place of duty if there is no available road or rail transportation.Directs the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations to provide the following persons with transportation on Department of Defense (DOD) aircraft on a space-available basis under the same terms and conditions that apply to members of the armed forces entitled to retired pay: (1) members of the Selected Reserve in good standing; (2) a former reserve member under 60 years of age who would be eligible for retired pay except for being under such age; and (3) dependents of the above. Limits the required identification for such travel.Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations authorizing a reserve member traveling to inactive duty training at least 50 miles from home to be eligible for billeting (housing) in DOD facilities on the same basis as active-duty personnel traveling under orders away from such member's duty station. Requires proof of the reason for such travel.Increases the maximum number of reserve retirement points that may be credited in a year for reserve service.Authorizes the Secretary of the military department concerned to provide civil legal services to reserve personnel (and their dependents) not otherwise entitled to such services following a release from active duty under a call or order to such duty for more than 30 days under a mobilization authority, but only for a period that is not in excess of twice the length of the duty period served."
