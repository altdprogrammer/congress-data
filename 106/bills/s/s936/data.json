    "text": "Children's Firearm Access Prevention Act - Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to: (1) define \"secure gun storage or safety device\" to include a device that, when installed on a firearm, is designed to prevent the firearm from being operated without first removing the device; and (2) prohibit any person from keeping a loaded firearm, or an unloaded firearm and ammunition, which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce or which otherwise substantially affects interstate or foreign commerce, within any premise that is under such person's custody or control if that person knows, or reasonably should know, that a juvenile is capable of gaining access to the firearm without the permission of the parent or legal guardian of the juvenile. Makes exceptions in cases where: (1) the person keeping the firearm uses a secure gun storage or safety device for the firearm; (2) the person is a peace officer or a member of the armed forces or National Guard and the juvenile obtains the firearm during, or incidental to, the performance of such person's official duties; (3) the juvenile obtains or discharges the firearm in a lawful act of self-defense or defense of others;(4) the person has no reasonable expectation that a juvenile is likely to be present on the premises where the firearm is kept; or (5) the juvenile obtains the firearm as a result of an unlawful entry. Sets penalties for violations. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to ensure that a copy of the prohibition under this Act appears on the form required to be obtained by a licensed dealer from a prospective transferee of a firearm."
