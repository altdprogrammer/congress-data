Directs the Secretary to reduce the amount otherwise payable to the State for the fiscal year by an alternative penalty amount determined according to a specified scale, which increases for each fiscal year of noncompliance.Requires waiver of all penalties for any State subject to a penalty which achieves compliance by April 1, 2000. Reduces the penalty amount for any State achieving compliance after April 1 but before September 30, 2000. Prohibits a penalty against a State for a fiscal year for which the State has already been penalized for noncompliance with respect to the automated data processing system requirement.Exempts failure to comply substantially with SDU or automated systems requirements from the current penalty of loss of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) block grant funds under part A of SSA title IV."
