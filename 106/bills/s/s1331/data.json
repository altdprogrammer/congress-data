    "text": "Lincoln County Land Act of 2000 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), in cooperation with Lincoln County, Nevada, and the city of Mesquite, Nevada, in accordance with this Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, and other applicable law, and subject to valid existing rights, to dispose of specified County lands identified for disposal in a competitive bidding process, at a minimum, for fair market value. Requires the disposal of such lands not later than one year and not later than five years, respectively, after the enactment of this Act. Segregates such land from all forms of entry and appropriation (except for competitive sale) under the public land laws, including the mining laws, and from operation of the mineral and geothermal leasing laws. Requires the Secretary to ensure that qualified bidders intend to comply with County and city zoning ordinances and any master plan for the area developed and approved by the County and the city.Provides for the following disposition of the gross proceeds of land sales under this Act in a fiscal year: (1) five percent shall be paid directly to Nevada for use in the State's general education program; (2) ten percent shall be returned to the County for use as determined through normal county budget procedures, with emphasis given to school support; and (3) the remainder shall be deposited in a special account in the Treasury. Makes such account available to the Secretary for: (1) inventory, evaluation, protection, and management of unique archeological resources in the County; (2) development of a multispecies habitat conservation plan in the County; (3) reimbursement of costs incurred by the Nevada State Office and the Ely Field Office of the Bureau of Land Management in preparing the sales, or other authorized land sales within the County; (4) processing public land use authorizations and rights-of way stemming from development of the conveyed land; and (5) the cost of acquisition of environmentally sensitive land or interests in such land in Nevada, with priority given to land outside Clark County. Provides for all funds deposited as principal in the special account to earn interest in the amount determined by the Secretary of the Treasury on the basis of the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities.Authorizes the Secretary: (1) before initiating efforts to acquire land under this Act, to consult with Nevada and with local government within whose jurisdiction the land is located, including planning and regulatory agencies, and with other interested persons, concerning the necessity of making the acquisition, the potential impacts on State and local government, and other aspects of the acquisition; and (2) after such process has been completed, to acquire with the proceeds of the special account environmentally sensitive land and interests in such land. Prohibits land from being acquired without the landowner's consent. Permits funds made available from such account to be used with any other funds made available under any other provision of law.Declares that, on acceptance of title by the United States, land and interests in lands acquired under this Act that is within the boundaries of a unit of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, National Trails System, National Wilderness Preservation System, any other system established by Act of Congress, or any national conservation or national recreation area established by such an Act shall become part of the unit or area without further action by the Secretary and shall be managed in accordance with all laws and regulations and land use plans applicable to the unit or area."
