Requires certification or recertification to be made through a process that either granted certification or recertification with such certification or recertification in effect as of January 1, 2000, and remaining in effect through the earlier of January 1, 2002, or the completion of recertification under regulations promulgated by the Secretary, or that is defined through regulations promulgated by January 1, 2002, that: (1) require recertifications of such organizations no more frequently than once every four years; (2) rely on outcome and process performance measures that are based on empirical evidence of organ donor potential and other related factors in each service area of such organizations; (3) use multiple outcome measures as part of the certification process; (4) provide for filing and approval of a corrective action plan by an organization that fails to meet performance standards and a grace period of up to three years to implement the plan without risk of decertification; and (5) provide for a qualified organization to appeal a decertification to the Secretary on substantive and procedural grounds."
