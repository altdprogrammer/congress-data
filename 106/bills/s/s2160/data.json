    "text": "Fair Access to Infertility Treatment and Hope Act of 2000 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA)to require group health plans and health insurance issuers providing health insurance coverage in connection with such plans to ensure that coverage is provided for infertility benefits. Authorizes coverage of in vitro fertilization, intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection, gamete or embryo donation, assisted hatching, embryo transfer, and gamete or zygote intra-fallopian tube transfer to be limited to four completed embryo transfers. Permits the provision of at least two additional embryo transfers if a live birth follows a completed transfer under one of such procedures. Requires coverage of such procedures if: (1) an individual has been unable to attain or sustain a successful pregnancy through reasonable, less costly medically appropriate covered infertility treatments; and (2) the procedures are performed at medical facilities that conform with minimal guidelines and standards for assisted reproductive technology of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology or the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.Prohibits group health plans and health insurance issuers from: (1) denying an individual eligibility or continuing eligibility to enroll or renew coverage because of the individual's or enrollee's use or potential use of items or services covered by this Act; (2) providing monetary payments or rebates to a covered individual to encourage the acceptance of less than minimum protections available under this Act; or (3) providing incentives to a health care professional to induce such professional to withhold infertility services from a covered individual.Amends the PHSA to apply infertility benefits provisions to health insurance coverage offered by an issuer in the individual market in the same manner as they are applied to coverage in the group market.Provides the infertility benefit coverage described by this Act for Federal employee health benefit plans as well."
