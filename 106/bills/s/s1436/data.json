    "text": "Farm Income and Trade Equity Act of 1999 - Amends the Agricultural Market Transition Act to authorize agricultural owners or producers subject to production flexibility contracts to permanently elect to receive payments and marketing assistance loans which factor in European Union (EU) support levels in lieu of contract payments and marketing assistance loans under such Act. Sets forth payment rate and related provisions for: (1) wheat, feed grains, and oilseeds; and (2) cotton and rice. Sets forth alternative loan rate provisions for electing owners or producers. Amends the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to provide for increased funding (including situations affected by Uruguay Round Trade Agreement caps) for the export enhancement program and the dairy export incentive program (under the Food Security Act of 1985) equal to direct EU subsidies."
