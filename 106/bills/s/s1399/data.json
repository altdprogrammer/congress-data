Provides that whenever after October 1, 2002, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines that such rates of pay are inadequate to recruit or retain high-quality health personnel at such a facility, the Secretary shall adjust such pay to achieve consistency with the rates of compensation for corresponding non-Department health-care positions in the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor market area of that facility. Provides for the automatic statutory adjustment to such rates of pay whenever an annual Federal pay adjustment becomes effective."
