    "text": "Seniors' Access to Continuing Care Act of 1999 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to prohibit health insurance provided through a managed care organization under a group health plan (and, for the PHSA, health insurance in the individual market) from denying coverage with regard to a continuing care retirement community or other qualified facility concerning: (1) post-hospitalization services in the same community or facility as in pre-hospitalization; (2) skilled nursing services without a preceding hospitalization; and (3) the same facility the participant's or beneficiary's spouse already resides in. Makes the prohibition: (1) depend on whether such services are otherwise covered; and (2) regardless of whether the organization is under contract with the community or facility. Prohibits related denial of enrollment or renewal, incentives to enrollees, and penalties or incentives to physicians. Declares that this Act does not preempt State laws meeting certain requirements, including requirements more protective of participants or beneficiaries than requirements under this Act. Provides for enforcement."
