    "text": "Methyl Bromide Fairness Act of 2000 - Amends provisions of the Clean Air Act that prohibit the production of certain substances to provide an exemption for the production, importation, and consumption of methyl bromide to fumigate commodities or articles or facilities where such commodities or articles may be processed or stored for purposes of compliance with Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service requirements or with any international, Federal, State, or local sanitation or food protection standard. (Current law provides for the use of methyl bromide to fumigate commodities entering or leaving the United States to the extent consistent with the Montreal Protocol.)Prohibits the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from terminating production of methyl bromide prior to January 1, 2015 (currently, January 1, 2005). Requires the Administrator to promulgate rules for reductions in, and terminate the production, importation, and consumption of, methyl bromide under a schedule that is in accordance with, but not more stringent than, the Montreal Protocol phaseout schedule for developing countries (currently, the Montreal Protocol phaseout schedule in effect on October 21, 1998)."
