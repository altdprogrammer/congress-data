Prohibits obtaining a social security number for purposes of locating or identifying an individual with the intent to physically injure, harm, or use the identity of the individual for illegal purposes. Provides prerequisites for consent, including that the individual be informed of the general purposes for which the number will be utilized and the types of persons to whom the number may be available.Provides that nothing in this law shall be construed to prohibit the use of social security numbers: (1) required or permitted under certain Federal laws; (2) for retrieving information about an individual without displaying the number publicly;(3) for law enforcement; or (4) obtained from a public record lawfully acquired from a governmental agency.Authorizes persons aggrieved by violations of this law to bring civil actions in district courts to recover damages. Prohibits actions from being commenced more than three years after the date the violation was or should have been reasonably discovered. Subjects violators to civil money penalties as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security in addition to any other penalties that may be prescribed."
