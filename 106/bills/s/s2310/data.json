Authorizes the Secretary at any time to compromise, mitigate, or remit the liability with respect to any willful violation. Limits review of the Secretary's action.Requires the Secretary, upon denying a license application, revoking or suspending a license, or assessing such a civil penalty, to provide written notice of such action to the affected party, which notice shall: (1) state specifically the grounds upon which such action was taken; and (2) with respect to a notice of license revocation or suspension, be given to the holder before the effective date of the revocation or suspension. Sets forth provisions regarding the appeal process, including a hearing, notice of decision and timetable for appeal, and a stay pending appeal.(Sec. 3) Terminates a firearms dealer's license upon the date of conviction (currently, upon the date such conviction becomes final) pursuant to indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year."
