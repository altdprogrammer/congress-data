    "text": "Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize the President to make grants to assist small businesses and agricultural enterprises adversely affected by a major disaster in meeting disaster-related expenses, including the costs of nonstructural repairs and replacement of noninsured contents and inventory.Provides that a small business or agricultural enterprise receiving a grant shall not use the proceeds of the grant for relocation, but may use such proceeds in a new location, at the President's discretion, for a safety, health, or mitigation purpose.Makes a small business or agricultural enterprise receiving such grant assistance liable to the United States to the extent that assistance duplicates benefits provided to such business or enterprise for the same purpose by another Federal agency. Requires any Federal agency that provides any duplicative assistance to collect an amount equal to the value of that assistance from the recipient in any case in which the head of the agency considers such collection to be in the Government's best interest.Makes a small business or agricultural enterprise eligible for a grant in relation to not more than one major disaster. Limits the maximum grant amount that a small business or agricultural enterprise may receive under this Act to $20,000.Makes such program applicable to any major disaster declared after September 1, 1999, and before the date of the enactment of this Act."
