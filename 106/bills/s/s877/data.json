    "text": "Broadband Internet Regulatory Relief Act of 1999 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to mandate that an incumbent local exchange carrier shall not be subject to Federal requirements concerning: (1) facilities and equipment used exclusively to provide advanced communications service; and (2) the provision of such service in any State in which 70 percent of such carrier's loops in its service territory are DSL-capable (capable of transporting an advanced service). Provides that the prices, terms, and conditions of any advanced service by such a carrier shall not be subject to Federal regulation if the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) determines that advanced service is being offered by an unaffiliated provider in competition with such carrier within a geographic area served by a central office. States that prices, terms, and conditions offered by a carrier or an affiliate shall not be subject to FCC regulation in an area in which such carrier was not the carrier on February 8, 1996. Requires carriers not subject to regulation to file with the FCC a schedule of charges and practices. Provides that the duty not to prohibit or impose unreasonable or discriminatory conditions on the resale of telecommunications services shall not apply to such a carrier with respect to its provision of advanced service."
