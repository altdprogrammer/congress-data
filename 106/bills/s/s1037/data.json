    "text": "Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to prohibit, effective January 1, 2000, the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in areas of the United States that are not specified nonattainment areas required to meet an oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline under the Clean Air Act. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to prohibit immediately the use of MTBE in an area if it is leaking into ground or surface water. Directs the Administrator to require by January 1, 2001, and 2002, reductions in the quantity of MTBE that may be used in gasoline of one-third and two-thirds, respectively. Requires persons selling gasoline that contains MTBE at retail to label the fuel dispensing system with a notice that the gasoline contains MTBE. Prohibits, effective January 1, 2003, the use of MTBE in gasoline. Directs the Administrator to study and report to Congress on the behavior, toxicity, carcinogenicity, health effects, and biodegradability in air and water of ethanol, olefins, aromatics, benzene, and alkylate."
