Prohibits Cuban Government officials, or members of their immediate families, from being eligible for such scholarships. Provides that such scholarship-making authority supercedes any existing law. Makes specified amounts under such Act in FY 2000 through 2004 available for such scholarships, for up to 20 scholarships in FY 2000, 25 in FY 2001, and 35 in each of FY 2002 through 2004."
