Grants such judge or magistrate the authority to issue orders to execute the request.(Sec. 202) Revises Federal criminal code provisions regarding custody and return of foreign witnesses to grant the Attorney General the authority, if testimony of a person serving a sentence, in pretrial detention, or otherwise being held in custody in the United States is needed in a foreign criminal proceeding, to: (1) temporarily transfer that person to the foreign country for the purpose of giving testimony; (2) transport that person from the United States in custody; (3) make appropriate arrangements for custody for that person while outside the United States; and (4) return that person in custody to the United States from the foreign country. Allows the Attorney General to exercise such authority over persons held in custody for a State law violation if the appropriate State authorities consent.Title III: Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide for the inadmissibility and removability of aliens who have committed acts of torture abroad.(Sec. 302) Directs the Attorney General to establish within the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice an Office of Special Investigations to investigate and remove, denaturalize, or prosecute alien participants of Nazi persecutions, genocide, or torture abroad. Authorizes appropriations."
