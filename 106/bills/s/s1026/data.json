    "text": "Medicare HMO Protection Act of 1999 - Amends part C (Medicare+Choice) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act with regard to contracts with Medicare+Choice organizations to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to delay the effectiveness of a Medicare+Choice organization's termination of its plan with respect to all individuals in an area, if: (1) the termination would cause an imminent and serious health risk to enrollees; (2) the termination would result in a significant reduction in the Medicare+Choice plans available in the area affected; or (3) the organization terminating coverage is offering Medicare+Choice plans in contract areas in close proximity to the area affected by the termination without suffering considerable financial losses. Permits the Secretary, in making the last determination, to audit and inspect the organization's books or records.Authorizes the Secretary to end such a delay early upon determining that an adequate provider network has been established that will provide at least an equal level of insurance coverage as existed in the area affected by the termination on the date the Medicare+Choice organization informed the Secretary of its intention to terminate the contract.Authorizes the Secretary and the Medicare+Choice organization terminating coverage to negotiate during the period of delay for a new contract that will enable the organization to continue coverage.Extends the initial Medicare+Choice contract period from one year to three years.Requires any Medicare+Choice organization contract to provide and pay for a written notice to enrollees at least 120 days before termination of the contract, together with a description of alternatives for obtaining benefits."
