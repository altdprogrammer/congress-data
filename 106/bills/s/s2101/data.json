Directs the Secretary, upon certification of a country, to pay to such country, every three months, an amount equal to a specified formula. Provides for a lump sum payment to foreign countries that have been certified for a four month period. Prohibits the previously dollarized Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, Panama, East Timor, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Republic of Ecuador, and the British Virgin Islands from being issued payments under this Act until specified conditions are met.Authorizes appropriations."
