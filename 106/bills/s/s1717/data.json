Removes Medicaid- eligibility determinations with regard to TANF recipients from such provisions. Repeals the termination of authorization for the increased Federal matching rate. Includes as administrative expenditures those attributable to the administrative costs of CHIP-eligibility determinations with regard to children and pregnant women and outreach to such populations likely to be eligible for such benefits. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a procedure under which, if a State does not obligate available amounts, local and community-based organizations in CHIP and Medicaid, with State approval, may seek to have administrative costs relating to outreach and enrollment of children and pregnant women treated as State administrative costs."
