Increases the prison term for a succeeding conviction of the same offense.(Sec. 4) Requires the criminal and civil forfeiture of any property used in committing such offenses, as well as any property constituting or derived from proceeds from such offense.(Sec. 6) Includes such offenses when committed by juveniles as offenses under which the Attorney General may certify to the appropriate district court a substantial Federal interest in exercising Federal prosecution.(Sec. 7) Includes as a defense against prosecution for a computer offense by a telecommunications provider, subscriber, or other aggrieved person that the person providing the information was responding to the request of a governmental entity.(Sec. 8) Authorizes the Federal interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications for a suspected felony violation relating to computer fraud and abuse.(Sec. 9) Provides for the criminal forfeiture of any replicator or other device used to copy a computer program or computer program documentation or packaging.(Sec. 10) Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend Federal sentencing guidelines to provide guidelines relating to computer fraud and abuse and the use of encryption in connection with the commission or concealment of criminal acts.(Sec. 11) Requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to construct and equip a National Cyber Crime Technical Support Center to serve as the centralized technical resource for Federal, State, and local law enforcement and to provide technical assistance in the investigation of computer-related criminal activities.
