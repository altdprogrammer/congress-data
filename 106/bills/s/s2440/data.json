    "text": "Airport Security Improvement Act of 2000 - Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to develop an electronic fingerprint transmission pilot project for individual criminal history record checks into an aviation industry-wide program. Exempts any airport, air carrier, or screening company from participating in such program if they determine it would not be cost effective and notify the Administrator of such determination.(Sec. 2) Amends Federal aviation law to require that a criminal history record check (fingerprint check) be done for any individual applying for a position as a security screener, a screener supervisor, or that will allow unescorted access to an aircraft or a secured area of an airport. Allows such persons during the first three years to work temporarily without a fingerprint check (provided such fingerprints have been submitted and an employment investigation has found no cause for suspicion) for 45 days during the first two years of such three year period, and for 30 days during the third year of such period. Requires all new employees, after the temporary periods, to have a fingerprint check before beginning work. Declares that an employment investigation shall not be required for an individual if a criminal history record check is completed before the individual begins working. Sets forth specified exceptions to the requirements of this Act.Lists additional crimes in the past ten years preceding an employment investigation for which an individual will be barred from employment in a position as a security screener or a position that will allow unescorted access.(Sec. 3) Directs the Administrator to issue a final rule on the certification of screening companies.Establishes new minimum standards for the training of security screeners.Directs the Administrator to work with air carriers and airports to ensure that computer-based training facilities intended for use by security screeners at an airport are conveniently located and easily accessible.(Sec. 4) Requires each airport operator, air carrier, and security screening company to include a list of sanctions published by the Administrator in its security program for use as guidelines in the discipline of its employees for infractions of airport access control requirements. Requires the Administrator to work with airport operators and air carriers to improve airport access controls by January 31, 2001.(Sec. 5) Directs the Administrator to take certain actions to ensure physical security at FAA staffed facilities that house air traffic control systems. Requires the Administrator to report to specified congressional committees on progress made in improving the physical security of air traffic control facilities, including the percentage of such facilities that have been granted physical security accreditation.(Sec. 6) Directs the Administrator to issue an amendment to air carrier security programs to require a manual process which will increase the number of checked bags that are selected for screening by explosive detection systems.(Sec. 7) Amends the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century to require the Secretary of Transportation to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences (currently, the General Accounting Office) to conduct a certain airport noise study. Requires the National Academy of Sciences to report the results of such study to the Secretary.Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 8) Revises the total number of members of the Federal Aviation Management Advisory Council."
