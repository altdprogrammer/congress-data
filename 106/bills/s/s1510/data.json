    "text": "United States Cruise Vessel Act - Title I: Operations Under Certificate of Documentation - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue a certificate of documentation with a temporary coastwise endorsement for an eligible cruise vessel not built in the United States to operate in domestic itineraries in the transportation of passengers in the coastwise trade between ports in the United States, if the vessel meets requirements of this title. Terminates the certification authority 24 months after the date of enactment of this Act (with an exception).(Sec. 102) Prohibits the Secretary from issuing such a certificate unless the vessel operator establishes that: (1) any repair, maintenance, alteration, or other preparation of the vessel for operation under a certificate has been or will be performed in a U.S. shipyard; and (2) any vessel repair, maintenance, or alteration after the issuance of the certificate will be performed in a U.S. shipyard (with an authorized waiver due to emergency circumstances).(Sec. 103) Prohibits any certified vessel from commencing operations in the U.S. coastwise trade until its operator executes a contract with one or more U.S. shipyards for the construction of a total of two or more cruise vessels with a combined berth or stateroom capacity at least equal to the certified vessel. Disregards such a contract for construction of a vessel of less than 20,000 gross tons or equipped with fewer than 800 passenger berths. Requires the first constructed vessel to be delivered no later than 60 months after the original vessel was certified, allowing an extension for impossibility of performance.(Sec. 104) Prohibits certified or constructed vessels from: (1) operating as ferries; (2) regularly carrying for hire both passengers and cargo; or (3) operating between or among the islands of Hawaii.(Sec. 105) Requires any person eligible to document a vessel under this Act that enters into a contract for construction of a qualified cruise vessel to notify the Secretary of its construction no less than two full years before the vessel is intended to commence operations. Applies such requirement also to reconstructed vessels.Requires each vessel certified to submit annually a proposed vessel itinerary, allowing for a period of publication and public comment.(Sec. 106) Requires the Secretary to issue an annual report on the number of vessels operating under certification and on the progress of construction of vessels to replace those vessels.(Sec. 107) Provides for enforcement of a breach of construction contract by an operator.Title II: Other Provisions - Provides that nothing in this Act affects or modifies the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, the Jones Act, or other Acts as specified.(Sec. 202) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to issue new or otherwise available permits to U.S.-flag vessels carrying passengers for hire to enter Glacier Bay or other National Park Service areas."
