Applies current special corporation) rules for health insurance costs of self-employed individuals to two-percent shareholders in S corporations, except that a two-percent shareholder's wages shall be treated as self-employed earned income. (Thus provides that non-health care related fringe benefits such as group-term life insurance will be excludible from such wages, and not taxed.)(Sec. 9) Makes family limited partnerships eligible to be S corporation shareholders.(Sec. 10) Permits the issuance of qualified preferred stock, which shall not be treated as second class stock. Makes any distribution (not in payment in exchange for stock) made by an S corporation with respect to qualified preferred stock includible as ordinary income of the holder and deductible to the corporation as an expense.(Sec. 11) Reduces from 100 percent to 90 percent the percentage of shares held by shareholders necessary for consent to election by a small business organization to be an S corporation. Prescribes rules for such consent.(Sec. 12) Revises exceptions to the criteria for the treatment of certain wholly owned subchapter S subsidiaries with reference to required information returns."
