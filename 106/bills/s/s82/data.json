Directs the Administrator of the FAA to establish life-cycle cost estimates for any air traffic control modernization project in which such costs equal or exceed $50 million. (Sec. 103) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999 and 2000 for airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning programs. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary of Transportation, in order to improve security at U.S. public airports, to carry out at least one project to test and evaluate innovative airport security systems and related technology. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 106) Prohibits the Administrator of the FAA from terminating human weather observers for Automated Surface Observation System stations until certain conditions are met. Title II: Airport Improvement Program Amendments - Removes the maximum cap on airport improvement funds credited to the discretionary fund. (Sec. 202) Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a demonstration program of up to 20 projects for grants to implement innovative financing techniques for airport development projects. (Sec. 203) Limits to no more than 90 percent the Federal share of costs for certain airport projects. (Sec. 204) Increases the apportionment for airport improvement grant funds for airport noise compatibility programs. (Sec. 205) Authorizes the use of airport improvement funds apportioned to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico for any of their public airports. Authorizes the use of the supplemental apportionment of airport improvement funds for Alaska for any of its public airports. Repeals a certain limitation on the apportionment of airport improvement funds for commercial airports in Alaska. Revises the amount of certain funds apportioned to the discretionary and small airport funds. Authorizes the Secretary to distribute a certain percentage of funds from the small airport fund for grants for projects at small hub airports. Declares that an airport development project shall remain eligible for funding from the discretionary fund (subject to the availability of funds) even though the status of the airport project changes from a primary airport to a non-primary airport. Revises, for purposes of grant eligibility for airport development funds, the definition of \"public-use airport\" to include a privately- owned airport that, as a reliever airport, received federal aid for airport development before October 9, 1996, but only if the Administrator of the FAA issues revised administrative guidance after July 1, 1998, for the designation of reliever airports. Repeals the eligibility of reliever airports for the issuance of a letter of intent to obligate airport development funds. Prohibits the collection of a passenger facility fee from a passenger: (1) in Alaska aboard an aircraft having a seating capacity of less than 20 passengers; and (2) on flights, including flight segments, between two or more points in Hawaii. Permits certain regulations promulgated by the Secretary to authorize a public agency to request waiver of a passenger facility fee for: (1) any class of domestic or foreign air carriers that enplane not more than a specified of the total number of passengers enplaned annually at a airport; or (2) passengers enplaned on a flight to an airport with scheduled passenger service but fewer than 2,500 passenger boardings each year, or in a community with a population of less than 10,000 and not connected by land to the National Highway SYSTEM. Grants priority (except for requests from another Federal agency or instrumentality) to a request by a public agency for surplus property for use at a public airport. Requires the apportionment of not less than $650,000 (currently, $500,000) nor more than $22 million of airport improvement funds to an airport sponsor for a primary airport for each fiscal year. Increases the apportionment of airport improvement funds to sponsors of cargo-only airports. Authorizes the Secretary to apportion to an airport sponsor in a fiscal year airport improvement funds equal to that amount apportioned to such sponsor in the previous fiscal year if the Secretary makes specified determinations related to temporary air service interruptions. Declares that the Secretary may permit the use of State highway specifications for airfield pavement construction using airport development funds at non-primary airports with runways of 5,000 feet or shorter serving aircraft that do not exceed 60,000 pounds, if the Secretary determines that: (1) safety will not be negatively affected; and (2) the life of the pavement will not be shorter than it would be if constructed using FAA standards. Prohibits an airport from seeking airport development funds for runway rehabilitation or reconstruction of any such airfield pavement constructed using State highway specifications for a period of ten years after construction is completed. Declares that the airport improvement program should encourage, among other things, activities related to the use of integrated in- pavement lighting systems for airport runways and taxiways and other runway and taxiway incursion prevention devices. Makes such activities eligible for funding under the airport improvement program. (Sec. 206) Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on FAA efforts to implement capacity enhancements and improvements (both technical and procedural), such as precision runway monitoring systems, and the time frame for implementation of such improvements. (Sec. 207) Directs the Administrator of the FAA to discourage airport sponsors and airports from using entitlement funds for lower priority projects by giving lower priority to discretionary projects submitted by airport sponsors and airports that have used entitlement funds for projects that have a lower priority than the projects for which discretionary funds are being requested. (Sec. 208) Prohibits the Secretary from waiving certain required assurances that property be used for aeronautical purposes with respect to the grant of airport development funds, unless the Secretary provides public notice at least 30 days before issuing such WAIVER. (Sec. 209) Amends Federal aviation safety law to revise the term \"public aircraft\" to include non-government-owned aircraft transporting passengers if the aircraft is operated for prisoner transport. (Sec. 210) Authorizes the Secretary, in order to enable additional air service by an air carrier with less than 50 percent of the scheduled passenger traffic at an airport, to consider the shell of a terminal building (including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) to be an eligible airport-related project. (Sec. 211) Directs the Administrator of the FAA to evaluate, and report to specified congressional committees on, options for improving the quality of information available to the FAA on airfield pavement conditions for airports that are part of the national air transportation system. (Sec. 212) Authorizes the Secretary to use unobligated airport development and noise compatibility program funds to make discretionary grants for noise abatement activities. Title III: Amendments To Aviation Law - Amends Federal aviation law to authorize the Administrator of the FAA to contract for procurement of severable services for a period that begins in one fiscal year and ends in the next fiscal year if (without regard to any option to extend it) the contract period does not exceed one year. Declares that funds available for a fiscal year may be obligated for the total amount of the contract. (Sec. 302) Amends the Airport Noise and Capacity Act to authorize an air carrier operating Stage 2 aircraft between places only in Hawaii to transport Stage 2 aircraft to or from the 48 contiguous States on a non-revenue basis in order to: (1) perform maintenance (including alterations) or preventive maintenance on such aircraft with a maximum weight of more than 75,000 pounds; or (2) conduct operations with aircraft within such weight limitations. (Sec. 303) Authorizes the Administrator of the FAA to establish consortia of government and aviation industry representatives at airports to provide advice on matters related to aviation security and SAFETY. (Sec. 304) Authorizes the Administrator of the FAA to enter into bilateral agreements with the aeronautical authorities of another country to exchange with that country all or part of their respective functions and duties with respect to certain domestic and foreign aircraft. (Sec. 305) Amends Federal aviation law to provide for the collection of new fees for FAA services provided to a foreign government or to any entity obtaining such services outside the United States other than: (1) air traffic control services; and (2) fees for production-certification-related service performed outside the United States. (Sec. 306) Amends the Pilot Records Improvement Act to require an employment investigation (including a criminal history check) in the case of passenger, baggage, or property screening at airports if the Administrator of the FAA decides it is necessary to ensure air transportation security. Permits an air carrier that has not obtained information about a pilot from a foreign government or entity that has employed the pilot to allow such pilot to begin service as a pilot of certain small aircraft if the carrier has made a documented good faith attempt to obtain it. (Sec. 307) Amends Federal aviation law to extend Federal aviation insurance and reinsurance programs through December 31, 2003. (Sec. 309) Establishes criminal penalties for any individual who: (1) knowingly and willfully serves or attempts to serve as an airman without an airman's certificate; (2) knowingly and willfully employs for service or uses as an airman an individual who does not have such certificate; or (3) without an airman's certificate provides for the air transportation of a controlled substance. (Sec. 310) Requires major air carriers providing air service to essential airport facilities that have interline agreements involving ticketing, baggage and ground handling, and terminal and gate access with other carriers, to provide on a nondiscriminatory basis the same services to any requesting air carrier that offers air service to a small community airport. Title IV: Miscellaneous - Directs the Administrator of the FAA to report to specified congressional committees every three months on electronic data processing problems associated with the year 2000 (Y2K problem) within the FAA. (Sec. 402) Directs the Administrator of the FAA to require by regulation that collision avoidance equipment (TCAS II) be installed on each cargo aircraft with a payload capacity of 15,000 kilograms or more. (Sec. 403) Directs the Administrator of the FAA to solicit comments on the need for: (1) improvement of runway safety areas; and (2) the installation of precision approach path indicators. (Sec. 404) Makes applicable to other specified types of aircraft (currently exempted from them), including turbojet-powered aircraft and aircraft equipped to carry only one individual, certain requirements that commercial aircraft be outfitted with an emergency locator transmitter. (Continues to exempt from such requirements aircraft used in scheduled flights by scheduled air carriers holding certificates issued by the Secretary, training operations conducted entirely within a 50-mile radius of the airport from which the training operations begin, flight operations related to design and testing, the manufacture, preparation, and delivery of aircraft, showing compliance with regulations, exhibition, or air racing, or the aerial application of a substance on agricultural crops.) (Sec. 405) Prohibits the Administrator of the FAA, except for the facilitation of law enforcement, from issuing a certificate to any person: (1) convicted of a violation of any Federal or State law relating to the installation, production, repair, or sale of a counterfeit or falsely represented aviation part or material; or (2) subject to a controlling or ownership interest of an individual convicted of such violation. Directs the Administrator to revoke any such certificates issued to convicted persons or persons who knowingly facilitate such a violation. Prohibits the employment of an individual convicted of counterfeit parts dealing to perform a function related to the procurement, sale, production, or repair of a part or material, or the installation of a part into a civil aircraft. (Sec. 406) Subjects to a civil penalty of up to $10,000 any individual who interferes with the duties or responsibilities of the flight crew or cabin crew of a civil aircraft, or who poses an imminent threat to the safety of the aircraft or other individuals on the aircraft. (Sec. 407) Directs the Secretary to work with appropriate international organizations and aviation authorities of other nations to bring about their establishment of higher standards for accommodating handicapped passengers in air transportation, particularly with respect to foreign air carriers that code-share with domestic air carriers. Prohibits foreign air carriers doing business in the United States from discriminating against handicapped persons while providing air transportation. Directs the Secretary or a person designated by the Secretary within the Office of Civil Rights to investigate each complaint of discrimination against a handicapped person. Directs the Secretary to implement a plan to provide technical assistance to air carriers and individuals with disabilities in understanding the rights and responsibilities with respect to discrimination against handicapped persons, including ensuring the availability of appropriate technical assistance manuals to such individuals and entities. Establishes a civil penalty for any air carrier that discriminates against handicapped persons while providing air transportation, unless an individual accepts a credit or voucher in a certain amount for the purchase of a ticket on that carrier or any affiliated carrier.
