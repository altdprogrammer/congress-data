Title I: Department of the Treasury - Treasury Department Appropriations Act, 2000 - Makes appropriations for the Department of the Treasury for: (1) departmental offices; (2) department-wide systems and capital investments programs for development and acquisition of automatic data processing equipment, software, and services; (3) the Office of Inspector General; (4) the Inspector General for Tax Administration; (5) repair and restoration of the Treasury building and annex; (6) the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network; (7) violent crime reduction programs; (8) the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, including amounts for maintenance and facility improvements; (9) the Financial Management Service; (10) the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; (11) the U.S. Customs Service, including amounts for operations and maintenance of marine vessels and aircraft and collection of the Harbor Maintenance Fee; (12) the Bureau of the Public Debt; (13) the Internal Revenue Service, including amounts for tax law enforcement, earned income tax credit compliance and error reduction initiatives, and information systems and telecommunications support; and (14) the Secret Service, including an amount for construction and improvement of facilities. Sets forth authorized uses of, and limitations on, such funds. (Sec. 116) Authorizes the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, from October 1, 1999, through January 1, 2003, to offer voluntary separation incentives to specified employees to carry out the plan to reorganize the Office of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. (Sec. 117) Permits the Commissioner of the Financial Management Service, from October 1, 1999, through January 31, 2000, to offer such incentives to specified employees to carry out the closure of the Chicago Financial Center in a manner deemed efficient, equitable to employees, and cost-effective. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury, prior to obligating resources for voluntary separation incentive payments, to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a strategic plan outlining the intended use of such payments and a proposed organizational chart for the agency once such payments have been completed. Provides for approval of such plan by the OMB Director. Permits such payments only in accordance with the strategic plan. Reduces the total number of funded employee positions in the agency by one position for each vacancy created by the separation of any employee who has received such a payment unless OMB believes that the agency plan demonstrates that the positions would better be used to reallocate occupations or reshape the workforce and produce a more cost-effective result. (Sec. 118) Amends the Federal judicial code to provide that moneys due from or payable by the United States to any state against which a judgment is pending with respect to damages sought for certain terrorist acts shall be subject to attachment and execution to the same extent as if the United States were a private person. Authorizes the President, upon determining that a waiver is necessary in the national security interest, to waive certain requirements for execution or attachment of property with respect to which certain financial transactions are regulated under the Trading with the Enemy Act, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act in connection with a judicial order directing attachment or execution against the principal office of a foreign mission to the United States used for diplomatic purposes or any funds held by such mission necessary to satisfy actual office operating expenses. Makes such a waiver inapplicable to: (1) the principal office of a foreign mission used for any nondiplomatic purpose by either the foreign state or the United States or to the proceeds of such a purpose; or (2) the proceeds of a sale or transfer if any asset of the office is sold or transferred for value to a third party. Applies the amendments made by this section to any claim for which a foreign state is not immune from the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts in cases where damages are sought for certain terrorist activity, including claims arising before this Act's enactment date.

Guy Federal Building, Post Office and United States Courthouse. (Sec. 411) Directs the GSA Administrator to convey specified lands in Washington, D.C. to the Columbia Hospital for Women to enable the expansion by the Hospital of its Ambulatory Care Center, Betty Ford Breast Center, Center for Teen Health, and Reproductive Toxicology Center. Sets forth conditions on such conveyance. Makes appropriations for: (1) the Merit Systems Protection Board; (2) the National Archives and Records Administration, including amounts for repairs and restoration of archives; (3) the National Historical Publications and Records Commission; (4) the Office of Government Ethics; (5) the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), including an amount for the Office of Inspector General; (6) Government contributions for health and life insurance benefits for annuitants; (7) the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund; (8) the Office of Special Counsel; and (9) the U.S. Tax Court.
