    "text": "Women's Access to Care Act - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code to require a group health plan or a health insurance issuer to permit a woman participant to designate a physician who specializes in obstetrics and gynecology as her primary care provider (with authority to order further gynecological care) in addition to, or in lieu of, a non-obstetrics and gynecology primary care provider. Prohibits a plan or issuer from requiring, in the case of a woman not making such designation, primary care provider referral for routine gynecological care and pregnancy-related services. Amends the Public Health Service Act and the Internal Revenue Code to apply those requirements to health insurance in the individual market."
