    "text": "Honesty in Sweepstakes Act of 1999 - Amends Federal postal law to prohibit, unless specified notices in a specified font are printed on the envelope, enclosed material, or face of the order entry device, delivery of any mail constituting a solicitation, offer, or sweepstakes in connection with a sales promotion for a product or service: (1) that includes the chance or opportunity to win anything of value if such mail contains words or symbols that suggest that the recipient has received or will receive anything of value if the recipient has in fact not won that thing of value; (2) that states that the recipient is likely to receive anything of value if statistically the recipient is not likely to receive anything of value; or (3) resembling a negotiable instrument. Prescribes civil penalties for any person who, through the use of the mail, sends any matter which is nonmailable under Federal postal law. Deposits such penalties into the Postal Service Fund (currently, the Treasury). Expresses the sense of the Congress that civil penalties collected through the enforcement of this Act should be allocated by the Postal Service to increase consumer awareness of misleading solicitations received through the mail, including releasing an annual listing of the top ten offenders of this Act. States that nothing in this Act shall preempt any State law that regulates advertising or sales of goods and services associated with any game of chance."
