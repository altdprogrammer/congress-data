    "text": "Energy and Climate Policy Act of 1999 - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to replace provisions establishing a Director of Climate Protection with those establishing an Office of Global Climate Change in the Department of Energy. Requires the Office to serve as a focal point for coordinating for the Secretary of Energy and Congress all departmental issues and policies regarding climate change and related matters and to be headed by a Director, appointed by the Secretary. (Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary to establish a program of giving annual public recognition to all persons and entities voluntarily reporting information on sources of greenhouse gases who demonstrate voluntarily achieved greenhouse gas reductions, including information reported prior to this Act's enactment. Requires the Secretary, through the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, to conduct and submit to specified congressional committees a review of what changes should be made to guidelines for accuracy and reliability of voluntarily reported information on greenhouse gas reductions. Provides for incorporation into such guidelines of changes found to be beneficial and cost effective in improving the accuracy and reliability of reported information. (Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary to establish a long-term Climate Technology Research, Development, and Demonstration Program to foster development of: (1) new technologies and the enhancement of existing technologies that reduce or avoid anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and improve energy efficiency; (2) new technologies that are able to remove and sequester greenhouse gases from emissions streams; and (3) new technologies and practices to remove and sequester such gases from the atmosphere. Requires submission of a ten-year plan to guide such activities to Congress. Directs the Secretary to solicit proposals for conducting such activities. Describes applicant qualifications, proposal requirements, and criteria for proposal selection. Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology to report annually to Congress: (1) a certification that the program objectives are adequately focused, peer- and merit-reviewed, and not unnecessarily duplicative with other Federal science and technology research; and (2) whether the program addresses an adequate breadth and range of technologies and solutions to address anthropogenic climate change. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 6) Amends the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 to require a specified energy research, development, and demonstration plan to include solutions to the effective management of greenhouse gas emissions in the long term by the development of technologies and practices designed to reduce or avoid anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and remove and sequester greenhouse gases from emissions streams and the atmosphere. Includes within program elements and activities research, development, and demonstration designed to pursue a long-term climate technology strategy to demonstrate a variety of technologies by which stabilization of greenhouse gases might be best achieved."
