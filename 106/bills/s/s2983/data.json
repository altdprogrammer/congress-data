Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer to the Administrator any military property that is the subject of such a notice, provided there is an agreement on its future ownership and use, except when an Act of Congress otherwise specifically identifies the property.Guam Foreign Direct Investment Equity Act - Amends the Organic Act of Guam to declare that the Government of Guam's tax treatment of income made in Guam shall be at the same rate that would apply if Guam were a part of the United States for purposes of treaty obligations of the United States.Deems Guam within the U.S. customs territory in the case of importation from Guam into the United States of betel nuts (also known as \"areca nuts\") by an individual for his or her personal consumption.Amends the Compact of Free Association Act of 1985 to revise certain reporting requirements with respect to the impact of the Compact on U.S. areas to authorize the Governor of any of the U.S. territories or commonwealths or the State of Hawaii to report annually to the Secretary of the Interior (currently, the President must report to Congress) with respect to the financial and social impacts of the compacts of free association on the Governor's respective jurisdiction.Establishes the Guam War Claims Review Commission to: (1) review the facts and circumstances surrounding the implementation, administration, and effectiveness of a specified Federal law in addressing the war claims of American nationals residing on Guam between December 8, 1941, and July 21, 1944; (2) review all relevant Federal and Guam territorial laws, records of oral testimony previously taken, and documents; (3) receive oral testimony of persons who personally experienced the taking and occupation of Guam by Japanese military forces; (4) determine whether there was parity of war claims paid to the residents of Guam with war claims paid to U.S. citizens or nationals who lived in or had holdings in foreign countries and other U.S. possessions occupied by the Japanese during World War II; (5) estimate the amount necessary to compensate the people of Guam for death, personal injury, forced labor, forced march, and internment; and (6) by a certain deadline report to the Secretary of the Interior and specified congressional committees any comments or recommendations for action.
