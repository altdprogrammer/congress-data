    "text": "Gun Dealer Responsibility Act of 1999 - Authorizes any person suffering bodily injury as a result of the discharge of a firearm (or the estate of a person who is incapacitated or deceased) to bring an action for damages and other appropriate relief in U.S. district court against any dealer who transferred the firearm in violation of Federal firearms law. Directs the court to allow a prevailing plaintiff a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs. Directs that the defendant in such an action be held liable in tort, without regard to fault or proof of defect, for all direct and consequential damages that arise from bodily injury or death proximately resulting from the illegal sale of a firearm if it is established by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant transferred the firearm to any person in violation of Federal law, with exceptions if it is established that: (1) the plaintiff suffered the injury while committing a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; and (2) the injury was suffered as a result of the discharge, by a law enforcement officer in the performance of official duties, of a firearm issued by the United States or any State."
