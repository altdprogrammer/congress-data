Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 1002) Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary to award grants on a competitive basis to local educational agencies to enable such agencies to acquire security technology, or carry out activities related to improving security at the middle and high schools served by the agencies, including obtaining school security assessments, and technical assistance for the development of a comprehensive school security plan from the School Security Technology Center. Directs the Secretary to give priority to agencies showing the highest security needs. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 1003) Directs the Attorney General to develop and submit to the Congress a proposal to further improve school security.Subtitle B: Federal Prosecution of Serious and Violent Juvenile Offenders - Part 1: Reform of Federal Juvenile System - Revises Federal criminal code (code) provisions regarding delinquency proceedings and criminal prosecutions in district courts to authorize a juvenile alleged to have committed an act on or after the day the juvenile attains age 16 to be prosecuted as an adult if specified conditions are met, such as if: (1) the juvenile has requested in writing upon advice of counsel to be prosecuted as an adult; and (2) the act, if committed by an adult, would be a felony crime of violence or a specified serious drug or other offense. Requires the approval of the Attorney General or the Attorney General's designee to prosecute a juvenile between the ages of 13 and 16. (Under current law, the decision to charge a juvenile as an adult for specified crimes is a result of a motion by the United States to transfer the juvenile for criminal prosecution, and the offenses subject to this transfer authority are limited.)Makes a determination regarding approval or institution of prosecution under this title non-reviewable in court, with exceptions.Allows a juvenile to be prosecuted and convicted as an adult for any other offense which is properly joined under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and convicted of a lesser included offense.(Sec.1212) Limits the applicability of statutory minimum sentences in certain prosecutions of persons under age 16.(Sec. 1214) Requires: (1) an arresting officer to promptly take reasonable steps to notify the parents, guardian, or custodian of a juvenile taken into custody (current law requires immediate notification of such parties and the Attorney General); and (2) the juvenile to be taken before a judicial officer without unreasonable delay (current law prohibits a juvenile from being detained for longer than a reasonable period before being brought before a magistrate).(Sec. 1216) Requires juvenile delinquency proceedings for a juvenile in detention to begin within 45 (currently, 30) days after the beginning of such detention.Directs the court, in determining whether an information should be dismissed with or without prejudice, to consider the seriousness of the offense, the facts and circumstances of the case that led to the dismissal, and the impact of a re-prosecution on the administration of justice.(Sec. 1217) Modifies sentencing options under the code to make available increased detention, fines, and supervised release for adjudicated delinquents. Makes mandatory restitution applicable to adjudicated delinquents. Increases, for an adjudicated delinquent, the maximum period of: (1) probation to the same period applicable to an adult; and (2) official detention to the lesser of the maximum term of imprisonment authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult, ten years, or the date on which the juvenile attains age 26.Authorizes the court, pursuant to guidelines promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission, to treat the conviction as adult of juveniles aged 13, 14, and 15 as an adjudication of delinquency. Directs the Commission to promulgate such guidelines within one year of this Act's enactment.(Sec. 1218) Modifies code provisions regarding the use of juvenile records to direct that the court records of the original proceeding be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure.
