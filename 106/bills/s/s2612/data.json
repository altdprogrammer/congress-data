    "text": "Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000 - Amends the Federal judicial code to direct the United States Sentencing Commission to amend the sentencing guidelines regarding any offense relating to the manufacture, importation, or exportation of, or trafficking in, 3-4 methylenedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA, or Ecstasy), 3-4 methylenedioxy amphetamine, 3-4 methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine, or any other controlled substance that is marketed as Ecstasy and that has either a chemical structure substantially similar to, or an effect on the central nervous system substantially similar to or greater than that of, MDMA (including an attempt or conspiracy to commit such an offense in violation of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act).Directs the Commission: (1) with respect to each such offense, to review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to provide for increased penalties comparable to the base offense levels for offenses involving any methamphetamine mixture; and (2) to ensure that the Federal sentencing guidelines for offenders convicted of such offenses reflect the need for aggressive law enforcement action regarding offenses involving such controlled substances and the dangers associated with unlawful activity involving such substances.(Sec. 4) Sets forth similar provisions with respect to offenses relating to the manufacture, importation, or exportation of, or trafficking in, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid and its salts (GHB), or the List I chemical gamma- butyrolactone.(Sec. 5) Directs the Commission to promulgate amendments under this Act as soon as practicable after this Act's enactment date in accordance with a procedure set forth in the Sentencing Act of 1987 (emergency guidelines promulgation authority), as though the authority under that Act had not expired.(Sec. 6) Amends the CSA to prohibit any person from teaching, demonstrating, or distributing information pertaining to the manufacture of: (1) a controlled substance with the intent that the teaching, demonstration, or information be used for, or in furtherance of, an activity that constitutes a crime; or (2) a controlled substance to any person knowing that such person intends to use the teaching, demonstration, or information for, or in furtherance of, an activity that constitutes an offense. Sets penalties for violations.(Sec. 7) Requires the head of each Federal department, agency, and establishment (department) to place anti-drug messages on appropriate Internet websites controlled by such department which shall contain an electronic hyperlink to the Internet website of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.(Sec. 8) Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to make grants to, and enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with, public and nonprofit private entities to carry out: (1) school-based programs concerning the dangers of abuse of and addiction to MDMA or related drugs, using methods that are effective and science-based, including initiatives that give students the responsibility to create their own anti-drug abuse education programs for their schools; and (2) community-based abuse and addiction prevention programs relating to MDMA or related drugs that are effective and science-based.Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) permissible uses of grant funds; (2) priorities for grants; (3) a specified annual allocation to support and conduct periodic analyses and evaluations of effective prevention programs for abuse of and addiction to MDMA or related drugs and the development of strategies for disseminating information about and implementing such programs; and (4) reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations.Requires the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, in conducting the national media campaign under the Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998, to ensure that such campaign addresses the reduction and prevention of abuse of MDMA or related drugs among young people in the United States."
