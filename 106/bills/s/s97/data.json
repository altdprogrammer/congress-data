    "text": "Childrens' (sic) Internet Protection Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to make an elementary or secondary school having computers with Internet access, or a library with one or more computers with Internet access, ineligible to receive universal services at discount rates unless the authority responsible for the administration of such school or library certifies to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that it: (1) has selected a technology for such computers which filters or blocks access to material that is obscene and to child pornography; and (2) is enforcing a policy to ensure the operation of such technology during any use of such computers by minors. Allows such authority to use a technology which filters other material deemed inappropriate for minors. Requires such certification within 30 days, with certain exceptions (requiring exception notification to the FCC). Requires schools or libraries obtaining such computers after the effective date of this Act to make such certification within ten days after the date on which the school first becomes covered.Requires each covered school or library not in compliance with such requirements to reimburse each telecommunications carrier in an amount equal to the universal services discount received. Requires the FCC to determine the date such discount shall cease to apply to a noncomplying school or library, and to resume the discount upon certification of compliance. Prohibits Federal agencies from: (1) making determinations of other material inappropriate for minors; (2) reviewing a determination made by a school or library authority with respect to verification; or (3) considering the criteria employed by such authority to determine eligibility for universal services discount rates.Allows discounted universal services rates: (1) to be available only for services covered by FCC regulations on priorities for funding telecommunications services (including the Internet) that assign priority for available funds for the poorest schools; and (2) to be used for the purchase or acquisition of appropriate filtering or blocking products, but not for the purchase of unrelated software or other technology."
