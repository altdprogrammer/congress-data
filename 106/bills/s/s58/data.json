    "text": "Telephone Services Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Act of 1999 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act) to require a telecommunications carrier or reseller, in order to verify a subscriber's selection of a telephone exchange (local) or toll (long-distance) service provider, to require such subscriber to: (1) affirm that the subscriber is authorized to effect such selection; (2) acknowledge the type of service to be changed; (3) affirm the subscriber's intent to select such provider; (4) acknowledge that such selection will result in a change of service provider; and (5) provide other information as considered appropriate by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the subscriber's protection. Requires the appropriate carrier or reseller to notify the subscriber, in writing, not more than 15 days after such a change has been processed. Provides carrier or reseller penalties for unauthorized subscriber changes, including disqualification from the provision of such services (with reinstatement under certain conditions). Requires local exchange carriers to submit to the FCC quarterly reports on the number of complaints of unauthorized changes submitted by its subscribers. Directs the FCC to use such information to identify carriers or resellers that engage in a pattern and practice of unauthorized changes. Provides criminal penalties against such carriers or resellers. (Sec. 3) Prohibits any person from causing a charge to be included on a subscriber's bill for exchange or toll service unless such charge has been specifically and knowingly authorized by the subscriber or is otherwise authorized or required by law. Requires billing agents to include on such bills certain information identifying and explaining such charges. Prohibits the disruption of telephone service based on a charge dispute. Requires a toll-free number for the resolution of disputed charges. Provides civil penalties for violations of such requirements. Requires local exchange carriers to submit to the FCC quarterly reports on the number of complaints of unauthorized bill charges. Directs the FCC to use such information to identify providers that engage in a pattern and practice of unauthorized charges. (Sec. 4) Authorizes the FCC to assess and recover any required penalty, fine, or forfeiture and to impose any other sanction required against an entity that is not a telecommunications carrier for a violation of any provisions of the Act to the extent that such entity provides billing services or other services for charges which appear on subscriber bills. (Sec. 5) Empowers the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to prevent telecommunications carriers from using unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. (Sec. 6) Directs the FCC to provide monthly to the FTC information collected by the FCC as a result of complaints regarding telephone services fraud, to be incorporated into such Commission's Consumer Sentinel online database. (Sec. 7) Directs the FCC to study and report to Congress on the feasibility and advisability of requiring telephone service billing agents to establish and provide consumer billing controls which permit subscribers to prevent the inclusion of unauthorized charges on telephone bills."
