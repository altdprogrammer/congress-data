Includes among such criteria determinations as to whether a proposed expenditure or tax change is: (1) necessary; (2) sudden; (3) a compelling need requiring immediate action; (4) unforeseen; and (5) temporary. Requires the President or committee report to provide a written justification of why a requirement should be accorded emergency status if it does not meet such criteria. Provides that if a point of order is sustained against a provision designated as an emergency requirement, that provision and the language making the designation shall be stricken from the measure and may not be offered as a floor amendment."
