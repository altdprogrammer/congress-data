Allows a project proposal to be submitted by: (1) any wildlife management authority of a country that has within its boundaries any part of the range of a great ape if such authority's activities affect a great ape population; (2) the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Secretariat; or (3) any person or group with the demonstrated expertise required for the conservation of great apes. Sets forth provisions governing: (1) the required elements of project proposals; (2) project review and approval; and (3) assistance recipient reporting requirements. Prohibits the use of grant amounts for captive breeding of great apes other than for captive breeding for release into the wild. Authorizes appropriations."
