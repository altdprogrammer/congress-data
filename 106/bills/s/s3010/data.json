Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to use a prior year to determine attributable income when circumstances warrant. Authorizes the Secretary, in lieu of obtaining income information directly from the veteran, to utilize information obtained from the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Secretary of the Treasury in determining attributable income. Makes permanent (currently expires at the end of FY 2003) the authority of the Secretary to obtain such information."
