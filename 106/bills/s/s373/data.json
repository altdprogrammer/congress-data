    "text": "Forced and Indentured Child Labor Prevention Act - Prohibits Federal agencies from acquiring items that appear on a published list of prohibited items unless the item source certifies that forced or indentured child labor was not used to mine, produce, or manufacture the item. Directs the Secretary of Labor to publish biennially such a list of items the Secretaries of Labor, State, and Treasury have identified that might have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor. Sets forth related requirements with respect to contract clauses, investigations, and remedies, including contract termination or contractor debarment or suspension. Directs the General Services Administrator to review actions taken under this Act and report to the Congress. Makes this Act inapplicable to procurement contracts for any product, or any article, material, or supply contained in a product, that is mined, produced, or manufactured in any foreign country or instrumentality that is a party to the Agreement on Government Procurement annexed to the World Trade Organization Agreement, or a party to the North American Free Trade Agreement, if the contract is of a value that is equal to or greater than the U.S. threshold specified in the applicable Agreement."
