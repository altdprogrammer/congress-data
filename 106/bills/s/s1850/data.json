    "text": "Telephone Call Privacy Act of 1999 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to allow a telecommunications carrier to use, disclose, or permit access to customer proprietary (identifying) telephone network information for the provision, by the carrier or another party, of its product or services only if the carrier: (1) provides the customer a notice of the information being disclosed and the specific product or service for which the information is being disclosed; (2) permits the customer to review and correct such proprietary information; and (3) does not receive from such customer within 15 days after notification a notice disapproving the use of such information for such purposes. Allows a customer to provide written disapproval of such use notwithstanding a previous approval.Outlines provisions authorizing a person that receives or obtains customer proprietary information to disclose such information to criminal law enforcement and judicial personnel for criminal law enforcement and related judicial proceedings. Provides requirements for court orders for investigative or law enforcement officers to obtain such information, including that: (1) the information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation; and (2) the law enforcement need for such information outweighs the privacy interest of the individual involved."
