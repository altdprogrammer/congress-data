    "text": "Terminates, for a five-year period, certain nuclear proliferation sanctions against India and Pakistan with respect to any grounds for their imposition arising: (1) under the Arms Export Control Act and the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 before enactment of this Act; and (2) prior to enactment of this Act if imposition of such sanctions would deny any license for the export of any defense article, or related defense service or technology, needed by such country as a replacement or spare part for an item in the country's inventory, as a substitute for such an item in any case where that item is no longer being manufactured and readily available, or as a safety enhancement that would not significantly improve the country's combat capabilities. Applies specified requirements of the Arms Export Control Act to such defense articles, defense services, or technologies. Prohibits use of the authority of this Act to provide economic support fund assistance except for assistance that supports nongovernmental organization activities, democracy, or humanitarian activities. Repeals: (1) a specified section of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 relating to certain nuclear non-proliferation conditions on assistance to Pakistan; and (2) the India-Pakistan Relief Act (title IX of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999, as contained in Public Law 105-277)."
