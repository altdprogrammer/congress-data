Includes as \"land or an interest in land or water\" stock in any corporation, if the fair market value of the corporation's land or interests in land or water equals or exceeds 90 percent of the fair market value of all of its assets at all times during the three-year period ending on the date of the sale. Deems a purchaser an eligible entity if it is: (1) any Federal, State, or local governmental agency; or (2) any tax-exempt charitable organization that is organized and at all times operated principally for one or more specified conservation purposes, and meets certain other requirements."
