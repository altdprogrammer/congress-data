    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to allow a State or local government to enact a statute or ordinance that prohibits a violation of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations which prohibit: (1) a use of citizens band radio equipment not authorized by the FCC; or (2) the unauthorized operation of such equipment on a frequency between 24 and 35 megahertz.Provides that a station licensed by the FCC in any radio service for the operation at issue shall not be subject to such a statute or ordinance.Requires the FCC to provide technical guidance regarding the detection and determination of violations of FCC regulations.Permits a person affected to submit to the FCC an appeal of the decision of a State or local government enforcing such a statute or ordinance.Provides that: (1) the enforcement of such a statute or ordinance shall not preclude the FCC from enforcing the regulation in that case concurrently; and (2) nothing in this Act shall be construed to diminish or otherwise affect FCC jurisdiction over devices capable of interfering with radio communications.Mandates that enforcement of a statute or ordinance with respect to citizens band radio equipment aboard a commercial motor vehicle shall require probable cause that such vehicle or individual is in violation of such FCC regulations."
