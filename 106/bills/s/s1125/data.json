    "text": "Telecommunications Merger Review Act of 1999 - Amends the Clayton Act to repeal the authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to approve telecommunications industry mergers. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act) to mandate that the FCC has no authority to review a merger or other transaction (merger), or to impose any term or condition on the assignment or transfer of any license or other authorization (license) issued under the Act that is proposed to be assigned or transferred in the course of a merger, while that merger is subject to review by either the Department of Justice (DOJ) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Empowers DOJ and FTC with primary authority to review mergers involving the proposed assignment or transfer of any license issued under the Act. Authorizes the FCC to file comments in any such proceeding. States that, if DOJ or FTC reviews a merger and issues either a written decision of approval or a written statement of nonintervention in such merger, then the FCC shall authorize the assignment or transfer of any license involved therein. Prohibits the FCC from imposing any other term or condition on the assignment or transfer of such license, or imposing any other obligation on any party to such merger. Prohibits the FCC from reviewing any application for assignment or transfer of a license issued under the Act in connection with a merger unless neither DOJ or the FTC issues a decision or statement in connection with such merger. Requires the FCC to conclude any review so conducted within 60 days after DOJ or FTC issues such a decision or statement."
