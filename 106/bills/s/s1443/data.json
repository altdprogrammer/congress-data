Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award program grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to establish or expand elementary and secondary school counseling programs. Requires each assisted program to ensure: (1) a team approach to school counseling by maintaining a ratio in the LEA's elementary and secondary schools that does not exceed one school counselor to 250 students, one school social worker to 800 students, and one school psychologist to 1,000 students; and (2) that school counselors, psychologists, and social workers paid from funds under this Act spend at least 85 percent of work time in providing direct services to students and not more than 15 percent on associated administrative tasks. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2000 through 2004 for such program grants. Requires that 60 percent of such specified amount of funds be reserved for grants for elementary schools."
