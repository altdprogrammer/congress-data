    "text": "Family Planning State Flexibility Act of 1999 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to authorize States to provide family planning services and supplies to Medicaid-eligible individuals of child-bearing age (including minors who can be considered to be sexually active) who: (1) desire such services and supplies; and (2) have incomes not exceeding specified levels, including the eligibility income level specified under a certain waiver authorized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for a woman to be Medicaid-eligible. Permits a State plan to allow any woman who receives family planning services and supplies under such an arrangement, and who then becomes ineligible for them because of hours of, or income from, employment, to remain eligible for such assistance through the end of the six month period beginning on the first day of ineligibility, with an additional six month extension of such assistance authorized. Provides that a woman who, while pregnant, is eligible for, has applied for, and has received State Medicaid plan assistance shall continue to be eligible under the plan for such family planning services and supplies until the woman's income exceeds the maximum income level established by the State for the woman to be Medicaid- eligible (as a result of pregnancy or otherwise)."
