Repeals the mandate of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 for reports on the average wholesale price of drugs and biologicals.(Sec. 9) Provides that Medicare- and Medicaid-related actions shall not be stayed by bankruptcy proceedings, nor Medicare- and Medicaid-related debt discharged in bankruptcy.(Sec. 11) Authorizes the Secretary to establish a procedure for enrolling and re- enrolling, for an appropriate fee, non-service providers that furnish covered health care items or services.(Sec. 12) Directs the HHS Secretary to: (1) develop and implement a comprehensive plan of activities to increase Medicare compliance, education, and assistance for health care providers; and (2) contract with the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences to establish a committee to study Medicare administrative requirements applicable to Medicare health care providers, and make recommendations on how Medicare paperwork and administrative requirements can be minimized. Authorizes appropriations for such study.(Sec. 14) Specifies application of certain sanctions to Federal health care programs.(Sec. 15) Revises alternative criteria for payments for durable medical equipment (DME) to include the least expensive amount that the item supplier is paid by a Medicare+Choice organization or by any Federal health care program. Requires the Secretary to adjust the payment rate for any DME administrative costs exceeding those associated with providing a particular item to a Medicare+Choice organization or another Federal health care program.(Sec. 16) Outlines provisions for implementation of a commercial claims auditing system for Medicare carriers in processing claims under Medicare part B.(Sec. 18) Authorizes appropriations for carrying out and expanding nationwide the Health Care Anti-Fraud, Waste and Abuse Community Volunteer Demonstration Projects (Medicare Senior Waste Patrol) conducted by the Administration on Aging.(Sec. 21) Repeals certain conditions for the termination of agreements with agencies or organizations for the processing of Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance) claims. Revises requirements for performance standards and criteria for fiscal intermediaries. Changes certain cost reimbursement provisions from mandatory to discretionary.

(Sec. 22) Exempts from requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 any Office of Inspector General established within an agency under the Inspector General Act of 1978."
