    "text": "Saving Humanities, Arts, and Resources for Education Networking Act of 2000 (SHARE Net Act) - Expresses the sense of Congress that, following the principle of the Morrill Acts that public assets be used for broadening public education, the resources available through the auction of the analog spectrum should be tapped to fund the development of a new educational and cultural infrastructure that utilizes today's technologies to expand the reach and impact of existing high-quality community educational resources.Authorizes the Secretary of Education to carry out a SHARE Net Grant program to develop a comprehensive, accessible, high-tech infrastructure of educational and cultural resources for nonprofit institutions, individuals, and others for educational purposes through a systematic effort to coordinate, link, and enhance existing specialized resources and expertise in public and private cultural and educational institutions.Allows such grants to be made to partnerships with at least three organizations from at least three of these categories: (1) institutions of a higher education; (2) libraries; (3) public radio and television stations; (4) museums; (5) arts and cultural institutions; (6) State educational agencies; (7) local educational agencies; and (8) public interest, not-for-profit organizations.Sets forth mandatory and permissible uses of grant funds, and application and matching funds requirements. Requires grant award priority to be given to partnerships that: (1) serve a low-income community; or (2) have a membership that is broadly representative of the region or State to be served.Authorizes appropriations."
