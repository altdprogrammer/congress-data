Title X: Suspension of Certain Sanctions Against India and Pakistan - Suspends the application of certain nuclear proliferation sanctions that would otherwise arise under the Arms Export Control Act (contained in provisions concerning nuclear enrichment transfers, nuclear reprocessing transfers, illegal exports for nuclear explosive devices, transfers of nuclear explosive devices, and nuclear detonations) or the Export Import Bank Act of 1945 against India and Pakistan for a five-year period. Waives with respect to such countries the imposition of a specified sanction arising prior to enactment of this Act that would deny any license for the export of any dual-use article or technology that would not contribute directly to missile development or to a nuclear weapons program. Authorizes the waiver of restrictions on assistance to such countries mandated under the Arms Export Control Act if the President determines that such restrictions would not be in the national security interest. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) no waiver should be granted with respect to any party that initiates or supports activities that jeopardize peace and security in Jammu and Kashmir; (2) the broad application of export controls to nearly 300 Indian and Pakistani entities (entities) as part of the export control list is inconsistent with national security interests and needs refinement; and (3) export controls should be applied only to those entities that make direct and material contribution to weapons of mass destruction and missile programs and only to those items that can contribute to such programs. Requires a report from the President to the congressional foreign relations committees listing those entities whose activities contribute to such programs. Authorizes the President to renew the suspension of such sanctions after the five-year period, after certifying to such committees that it is in the national security interest to do so."
