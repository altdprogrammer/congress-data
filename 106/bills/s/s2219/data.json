Requires such grants to be for programs in kindergarten through grade eight.Directs the Secretary of Education, in awarding such grants, to give special consideration to applications that demonstrate the greatest need for new or improved counseling services to meet the needs of students who are at risk of being involved in delinquent behavior, becoming victims of crime, failing to meet the academic standards required to be promoted, or dropping out of school before the students graduate (at-risk students), as well as to meeting specified other current priority considerations. Eliminates a maximum grant limitation.Requires applicant LEAs to describe the particular emotional, social, and educational needs of the students who will be targeted by such programs. Requires recipient LEAs to use such grants to establish or improve counseling services through qualified school counselors, school psychologists, and school social workers.Authorizes appropriations for such program of school counseling demonstration grants, and for the following grant programs which this Act adds under the Fund for the Improvement of Education: (1) summer school; (2) enrichment; and (3) youth development.Authorizes the Secretary to make allotments to State educational agencies (SEAs) for grants to LEAs to support summer school programs for students who have not met academic standards required for promotion to the next grade. Bases such State allotments on relative amounts received under ESEA title I (Helping Disadvantaged Children Meet High Standards) part A (Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local Educational Agencies). Requires a reservation of funds for innovative programs.Authorizes the Secretary to make allotments to eligible State agencies for grants to consortia (consisting of public elementary or secondary schools, institutions of higher education, not-for-profit scientific and cultural agencies, libraries, or community organizations) to provide after-school and summer enrichment activities for youth. Bases such State allotments on relative amounts received under ESEA title I part A.Authorizes the Director of the National Park Service to make allotments to eligible State agencies for matching grants to local public park or recreation agencies for the support of after-school and summer youth development programs. Bases such State allotments on relative numbers of youth age five through 18. Requires a reservation of funds for innovative programs.(Sec. 6) Amends ESEA title II (Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program) to establish a new part E, Teacher Scholarships. (Transfers the current part E to part F.)Authorizes the Secretary to make allotments to eligible State agencies to award scholarships to individuals who attend approved teacher education programs and agree to become teachers in public elementary and secondary schools in underserved school districts for at least one year for each year of the scholarship.Authorizes appropriations for such Teacher Scholarships program.(Sec. 7) Authorizes appropriations to carry out ESEA title II.Directs the Secretary to reserve five percent of funds, under part B (State and Local Activities) of ESEA title II, to award grants for innovative teacher preparation and certification or licensure programs and to develop model teacher evaluation programs.Requires a State, in order for its SEA to be eligible for part B funds, to: (1) assess the professional development needs for teachers and principals; (2) adopt a plan to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that all teachers employed by LEAs meet the State's certification or licensure requirements for the subjects in which the teachers teach; (3) adopt a plan to improve teaching in reading, mathematics, and science; and (4) establish guidelines, in cooperation with specified groups, to evaluate the performance of teachers and principals.Requires LEAs that receive part B grant funds to: (1) use at least 80 percent of such funds for professional development activities for schools in which student performance in core academic subjects is below the average performance for all students in the schools they serve; and (2) give priority to using such funds for professional development activities that ensure that all teachers are certified in the subject areas in which they teach, improve teaching in reading, mathematics, and science, and improve education and support services provided to students at risk of not meeting the academic performance standards required to be promoted to the next grade.Requires an LEA, in order to be eligible for part B funds, to establish a comprehensive system to evaluate the performance of teachers and principals in accordance with the guidelines established by the SEA. Requires such system to be developed in cooperation with specified groups and to include certain components."
