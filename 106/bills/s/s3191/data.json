Subjects each such agreement to Office approval. Provides that, except as specified, rules governing drug courts will be promulgated separately by each participating Federal district court, with the advice of the Office, subject to DOJ approval.Excludes as an \"eligible offender\" a person who: (1) is accused of violent criminal offenses; (2) is not accused of drug, drug-related, or drug-motivated offenses; (3) has previously been convicted of a Federal or State violent felony offense; or (4) for any other reason within the court's discretion does not meet all requirements of the applicable drug court.Sets forth provisions regarding offender eligibility requirements, the handling of ineligible offenders, requirements for drug program participants, identification of drug program participants, participant fitness examination, eligibility hearings, judicial discretion regarding eligibility, drug court responsibilities, disciplinary sanctions, drug court records, and administrative fees.Requires that each program provide all participating offenders with a personalized program, including required elements of treatment, supervision, rehabilitation, education, and job skills training."
