    "text": "Indian Child Welfare Act Amendments of 1999 - Amends the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 to provide for retention by an Indian tribe of exclusive jurisdiction over child custody proceedings involving Indian children that are or become wards of a tribal court of that Indian tribe. Revises requirements, with respect to Indian children, regarding: (1) the voluntary termination of parental rights; and (2) the withdrawal of a consent to such voluntary termination or to adoption. Requires a party seeking the voluntary placement of an Indian child or the voluntary termination of parental rights to provide written notice to the Indian child's tribe. Sets forth the requirements for such a written notice. Permits an Indian tribe to intervene only if a child's tribe has sent a written objection to the adoptive placement to the court or to the party seeking the voluntary placement of the Indian child, but permits the child's Indian tribe to intervene in any case in which the Indian tribe did not receive a written notice. Modifies requirements regarding consideration of the personal preference of an Indian child or parent with respect to adoptive placements, foster care, and preadoptive placements. Prescribes, in any case in which a court determines that it is appropriate to consider the preference of a parent or Indian child, that preference may be considered to constitute good cause. Provides criminal sanctions for fraudulent representation with respect to any proceeding involving an Indian child."
