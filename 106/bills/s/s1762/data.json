Limits the amount of Federal funds that may be made available for construction of a particular rehabilitation project to 65 percent of the total rehabilitation costs, but not to exceed 100 percent of actual construction costs incurred, and makes the local organization responsible for resource rights costs and all Federal, State, and local permits.Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Natural Resources Conservation Service, to provide technical assistance to planning, designing, and implementing rehabilitation projects should such an organization request such assistance.Prohibits any assistance authorized from being used to perform operation and maintenance activities.Outlines assistance application requirements. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a system of approving rehabilitation assistance requests from eligible organizations equitably; and (2) give requests made for decommissioning the same priority as requests made for other forms of rehabilitation.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2001 through 2005 to provide financial and technical assistance. Earmarks funds authorized for the first two fiscal years for an assessment by the Secretary of the rehabilitation needs of covered projects. Requires: (1) the Secretary to maintain a database to track the benefits derived from rehabilitation projects and expenditures and report annually to Congress on the status of activities conducted; and (2) eligible local organizations that received assistance to report to the Secretary on the status of rehabilitation efforts after the completion of the specific projects for which assistance was provided."
