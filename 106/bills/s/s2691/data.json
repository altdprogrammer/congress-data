Requires the Secretary of the Interior to identify public domain lands (as defined under this Act) within the Medford, Roseburg, Eugene, Salem and Coos Bay Districts and the Klamath Resource Area of the Lakeview District of the Bureau of Land Management equal in size and condition as such O&C lands, but not subject to the Act relating to the Oregon and California Railroad and Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands. Requires such Secretary to: (1) submit to Congress and publish in the Federal Register a map or maps identifying those public domain lands mentioned in the two preceding clauses; and (2) after an opportunity for public comment, complete an administrative land reclassification such that the O&C lands within the Unit become public domain lands not subject to the distribution provision and the public domain lands within such Districts become O&C lands subject to such Act.Authorizes appropriations under the provisions of the FY 1999 Interior Appropriations Act for Clackamas County, Oregon, for watershed restoration (except timber extraction) that protects or enhances water quality or relates to the recovery of endangered and threatened species near the Unit in order to further this Act's purposes."
