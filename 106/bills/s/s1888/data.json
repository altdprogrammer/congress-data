Waives the matching requirement if the cost of the project is $25,000 or less or the project is necessary to undertake planning and monitoring requirements for coral reef areas under specified Federal laws. Allocates 40 percent of grant awards for projects in the Pacific Ocean, 40 percent for projects in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea, and the remainder for projects that address emergency priorities or threats.Sets forth procedures for project review and approval.Authorizes appropriations."
