    "text": "Gun Industry Accountability Act - Provides that in any civil action by a State or local government against a manufacturer of firearms to recover damages relating to the sale, distribution, use, or misuse of a firearm (including gun violence) within the State or local governmental area, the State or local government may recover Federal damages associated with the claim. Bars the State or local government from recovering Federal damages with respect to which the Attorney General files an action against a firearms manufacturer. Sets forth procedures regarding actions brought by a State or local government, including notice of civil action, entry of appearance, effect of failure to enter an appearance or proceed with the action, prevention of dual recovery of Federal damages (if there is a conflict between a State and one or more local governments within the State), and dismissal or compromise. Establishes a formula for the distribution and use of Federal damages recovered by a State or local government."
