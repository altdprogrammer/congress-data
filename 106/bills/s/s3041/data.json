Requires full replenishment of the fund each fiscal year. Limits the use of the fund to non-recurring or unforeseen needs arising during the fiscal year, including expenses associated with unforeseen weather or other natural disasters, unexpected liability created by Federal law or new public safety or health needs or requirements identified after the budget process has occurred, or opportunities to achieve cost savings.
