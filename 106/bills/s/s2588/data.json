    "text": "Ute-Moab Land Restoration Act - Amends the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 to direct the United States to convey to the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation all Federal land within the exterior boundaries of NOSR-2 (Oil Shale Reserve Numbered 2), including surface and mineral rights. Prohibits such conveyance from including the following reservations of the United States: (1) a nine percent royalty interest in the value of any oil, gas, other hydrocarbons, and all other minerals from the conveyed land which are produced, saved, and sold; (2) the portion of the bed of Green River contained entirely within NOSR-2; (3) the land, including surface and mineral rights, to the west of the river within NOSR-2; and (4) a 1/4 mile scenic easement on the east side of the river within NOSR-2 (which shall not affect the Tribe's right to use and access the river).Declares that the United States relinquishes all management authority over such conveyed land, including tribal activities conducted on such land, on completion of such conveyance.Provides that such lands conveyed to the Tribe shall not revert to the United States for management in trust status.Revokes all withdrawals in effect on NOSR-2.Directs the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to administer the land and interests in land reserved from such conveyance and to submit to Congress a land use plan.Prohibits the royalty interest reserved from conveyance that is required to be paid by the Tribe from including any development, production, marketing, and operating expenses. Requires the United States to bear responsibility for and pay gross production taxes, pipeline taxes, and allocation taxes assessed against the gross production.Requires the Tribe to: (1) submit to the Secretary of Energy and Congress an annual report on resource development and other activities of the Tribe concerning such conveyance; and (2) obtain an audit of all such resource development activities every five years and include the results in the next annual report.Requires the Tribe: (1) to manage land adjacent to and within a 1/4 mile of the Green River in a in a manner that maintains the land's protected status and is consistent with a government-to-government agreement and a specified memorandum of understanding between the Tribe and the Secretary; and (2) in accordance with such agreement, to protect any endangered or threatened plant species located or found on the NOSR-2 land conveyed to the Tribe and to manage, protect, and assert control over any horse not owned by the Tribe or tribal members that is located or found on such land in a manner that is consistent with Federal law.Requires the Secretary of Energy: (1) to prepare a plan for the commencement of remedial action, including groundwater restoration, at the Atlas uranium milling site, Moab, Utah; (2) to retain the amounts received as royalties under this Act to carry out such remedial action; and (3) until funds authorized by this Act are made available, to use available funds to carry out such remedial action and any remediation activity being carried out at the site by the trustee appointed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Provides that if the site is sold after remedial action is completed, the seller shall pay to the Secretary of Energy the portion of the sale price attributable to such action.Amends the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 to designate such site as a processing site, with specified exceptions."
