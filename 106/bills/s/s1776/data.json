Authorizes appropriations.Title VIII: Voluntary Initiatives - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to direct the Secretary to: (1) revise guidelines governing the voluntary collection and reporting of information on sources of greenhouse gases to reflect the amendments made by this Act; and (2) create and implement a public awareness program regarding the benefits of certification of voluntary emission reductions.Affirms continuance of State action designed to mitigate the financial risks to persons who engage in voluntary steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
