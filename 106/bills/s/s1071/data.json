Cites Center duties, including development, testing, and demonstration of methods and technologies necessary for DOE's long-term stewardship of defense nuclear facility lands affected by legacy waste. Requires the Center to enter into memoranda of understanding with Federal agencies to establish administrative procedures to: (1) participate in work for other programs on lands of the Departments of the Interior and of Agriculture; and (2) solve pressing long-term stewardship problems. Establishes a Natural Resources Institute as a pilot demonstration project within the Center to: (1) serve as partner and facilitator in performing enumerated Center duties; (2) perform multidisciplinary research regarding long-term stewardship; (3) support formulation and implementation of long-term stewardship public policy; and (4) act as an information resource center. Mandates Institute cooperation with governmental agencies, colleges and universities, national laboratories, and with the public."
