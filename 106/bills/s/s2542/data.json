    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2000-05-11", 
    "text": "Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2000 - Prohibits any person from sending an unsolicited commercial electronic mail (e-mail) message unless the message contains a valid and legitimately obtained e-mail address, conspicuously displayed, to which a recipient may send notice of a desire not to receive further messages. Prohibits a person from sending other unsolicited commercial e-mail messages more than ten days after receiving a notice to discontinue. Prohibits any person from sending such messages with a false or misleading transmission address or false or misleading routing information. Prohibits a person from selling, distributing, or possessing software primarily designed to falsify message transmission or routing information and having limited commercially significant purposes other than such falsification.(Sec. 5) Authorizes an Internet service provider (ISP) to decline to transmit such messages to its subscribers without compensation from the sender. Holds harmless an ISP for any action taken to block the transmission or receipt of such messages, or for the retransmission of such messages as an intermediary without knowledge that the transmission violates this Act.(Sec. 6) Prohibits a person from using or disclosing domain name registration data if: (1) such use violates policies of that registrar that are clearly posted on its website; and (2) the data is used for transmitting or enabling the transmission of unsolicited bulk commercial e-mail. Holds harmless (with limitations) a registrar that fails or refuses to disclose such information on good faith that the information would be used to perform a prohibited act.(Sec. 7) Outlines procedures for Federal Trade Commission (FTC) notification of alleged violators concerning the transmission of unsolicited commercial e-mail. Requires such notification to: (1) direct the person to discontinue further transmissions of such e-mail; (2) direct the person to immediately delete the e-mail addresses of such recipients from its directories or mailing lists; and (3) prohibit the person from transferring a mailing list that contains such addresses. Provides for enforcement of such requirements.(Sec. 8) Directs the FTC to enforce this Act in the same manner as an FTC trade regulation.(Sec. 9) Authorizes any ISP adversely affected by a violation under this Act, or a State on behalf of its residents, to bring an enforcement action in the appropriate district court.(Sec. 12) Directs the FTC to report to Congress on: (1) the effectiveness of this Act in preventing or reducing the volume of unsolicited bulk commercial e-mail; (2) enforcement actions taken; and (3) the need, if any, for Congress to modify this Act."
