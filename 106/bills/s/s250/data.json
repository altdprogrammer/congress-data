    "text": "Federal Prosecutor Ethics Act - Amends the Federal judicial code to replace provisions regarding ethical standards for attorneys for the Government with ethical standards for Federal prosecutors. Subjects a Federal prosecutor (defined as an attorney employed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) who is directly engaged in the prosecution of violations of Federal civil or criminal law) to all laws and rules governing ethical conduct of attorneys of the State in which such prosecutor is licensed as an attorney, except to the extent such law or rule is inconsistent with Federal law or interferes with the effectuation of Federal law or policy, including the investigation of violations of Federal law. Directs the Attorney General to establish by rule that it shall be punishable conduct for any DOJ officer or employee, in the discharge of his or her official duties, to intentionally: (1) seek the indictment of any person in the absence of a reasonable belief of probable cause; (2) fail to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense; (3) mislead a court as to the guilt of any person by knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law; (4) offer evidence known to be false; (5) alter evidence; (6) attempt to corruptly influence or color a witness's testimony with intent to encourage untruthful testimony; (7) violate a criminal defendant's right to discovery; (8) offer or provide sexual activities to any Government witness or potential witness in exchange for his or her testimony; or (9) improperly disseminate confidential, non-public information to any person during an investigation or trial. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) establish a range of penalties for engaging in such prohibited conduct, including reprimand, demotion, dismissal, suspension from employment, referral of ethical charges to the bar, and referral of evidence related to the conduct to a grand jury; and (2) report annually to specified congressional committees on the activities and operations of DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility. Establishes a Commission on Federal Prosecutorial Conduct. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations."
