Amends provisions relating to the Puerto Rico and possession tax credit to modify, with respect to possessions other than Puerto Rico, corporate eligibility requirements.

Modifies additional restricted credit requirements. Sets forth credit rules applicable to Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands."
