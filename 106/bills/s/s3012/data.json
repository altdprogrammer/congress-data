    "text": "Transportation Information Recall Enhancement Act - Declares it is the purpose of this Act to ensure that defects in motor vehicles or replacement equipment in foreign countries are quickly, accurately, and truthfully reported to the Secretary of Transportation in cases in which: (1) motor vehicles or replacement equipment are manufactured for export to the United States; or (2) such vehicles or equipment are manufactured in the United States using a manufacturing process that is the same as, or similar to, the manufacturing process used in the foreign country, with the result that U.S. manufactured motor vehicles or replacement equipment may also be defective.Amends Federal transportation law to require a manufacturer, not later than 48 hours after determining, or learning that a government of a foreign country has determined, that a foreign motor vehicle product contains a defect that could be related to motor vehicle safety, to report such determination to the Secretary of Transportation. Sets forth similar requirements with respect to the reporting of possible defects in such vehicle or equipment that have resulted in a significant number of serious injuries or fatalities in a foreign country. Sets forth both criminal and civil penalties for manufacturers of foreign motor vehicle products who falsify information with respect to, or otherwise violate, the reporting requirements contained in this Act."
