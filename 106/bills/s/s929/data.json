    "text": "National Military Museum Act - Establishes as a nonprofit corporation the National Military Museum Foundation to provide for the location, design, construction, and operation and maintenance of a national museum (the National Military Museum) in the National Capital area for honoring the services of members of the armed forces. Requires the Foundation to report annually to Congress on Foundation activities. Requires the Museum to be located in one or more parcels of property in Arlington, Virginia, near Arlington National Cemetery. Provides for the acquisition and transfer of property for Museum purposes. Requires the Foundation to submit to Congress a preliminary Museum design as well as certain preliminary assessments in connection with the Museum. Directs the Comptroller General to submit to Congress an assessment of the Foundation report. Directs the Secretary of Defense to carry out Museum construction, including necessary environmental restoration or remediation. Requires the Foundation to ensure that Museum construction commences no later than March 1, 2018, and is completed no later than March 1, 2022. Makes the Foundation responsible for appropriate fund raising activities. Authorizes the head of any Federal department or agency to transfer, loan, or otherwise provide the Museum with any military artifact, memorabilia, or other material appropriate for Museum display. Provides that if the Foundation recommends that the Museum be within the Smithsonian Institution, then it is the sense of Congress that: (1) the Museum be placed within such Institution; and (2) the Foundation board of directors become an advisory board for the Museum. Authorizes appropriations for the Department of Defense for FY 2000 for the Museum."
