Increases such pay by 4.8 percent, effective on January 1, 2000. Provides: (1) an increase in such pay as of July 1, 2000, for officers and enlisted personnel within specified pay grades; and (2) a pay increase for each of fiscal years 2001 through 2006 of one percent over the percentage increase as calculated under the Employment Cost Index. (Sec. 103) Extends through December 31, 2002, specified authorities currently scheduled to expire on December 31, 1999, with respect to certain special pay and bonus programs within the regular and reserve armed forces, as well as for military nurse officer candidates, registered nurses, and nurse anesthetists. Title II: Retired Pay - Repeals a Federal provision which provides a formula reduction in the retired pay of military personnel who first became members after July 31, 1986, and had creditable military service of less than 30 years. Directs the Secretary of Defense to increase the annual retired pay of such members under a revised formula which takes into account annual cost-of-living increases. Title III: Thrift Savings Plan - Authorizes a member serving on active duty to participate in the Federal Thrift Savings Plan, with a maximum annual contribution of five percent of basic pay and any enlistment or reenlistment bonus. Prohibits matching Federal agency contributions. Title IV: Montgomery GI Bill Benefits - Increases for FY 2000 the monthly rate of educational assistance paid to veterans pursuing a program of education on a full-time basis under the veterans' educational assistance program (VEAP). (Sec. 402) Terminates a one-year reduction in the basic pay of military personnel who choose not to participate in the VEAP. (Sec. 403) Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, when appropriate, to make accelerated payments under the VEAP pursuant to an individual's request. (Sec. 404) Authorizes such Secretary to permit individuals entitled to assistance under the VEAP to transfer such assistance to the individual's spouse, one or more children, or a combination thereof. Requires the individual to designate the transferees chosen, the percentage of assistance for each, and the period in which such transfer shall be effective. Requires any child receiving such assistance to complete his or her entitlement before attaining 26 years of age. Title V: Report - Directs the Secretary of Defense to submit annually to the Congress an assessment of the effects of this Act on military personnel recruitment and retention."
