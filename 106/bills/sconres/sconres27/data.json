    "text": "Declares that Congress: (1) regards the political independence and territorial integrity of the emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe as vital to European peace and security and, thus, to U.S. interests; (2) endorses the commitment of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will remain open to the accession of further members; and (3) believes that all NATO members should commit to improving their respective defense capabilities and that NATO should prepare more vigorously to defend itself against future threats and to expand its primary defensive focus beyond its previous concentration on threats to the east. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the NAC should pace, not pause, the process of NATO enlargement and should initiate a formal review of all pending applications for NATO membership in the course of the 1999 Washington Summit (with the results presented to the NAC membership in May 2000 with recommendations); (2) NATO should continue to assess potential applicants for NATO membership on a continuous basis; and (3) the President, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Defense should fully use their offices to encourage the NATO allies of the United States to commit the resources necessary to upgrade their capabilities to rapidly deploy forces over long distances, sustain operations for extended periods of time, and operate jointly with the United States in high intensity conflicts."
