Calls on the President to: (1) seek from Chinese leaders a public renunciation of any use of (or threat to use) force against Taiwan; and (2) provide an annual report detailing the military balance on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Calls for the Secretary of Defense to make available to the appropriate congressional committees the annual military requirements list submitted by Taiwan. Declares that it should be U.S. policy to: (1) encourage the participation of Taiwan in a high-level regional dialogue on the best means of ensuring stability, peace, and freedom of the seas in East Asia; and (2) publicly support Taiwan's admission to the World Trade Organization."
