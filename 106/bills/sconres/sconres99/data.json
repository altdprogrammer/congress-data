Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the People's Republic of China should abandon its provocative threats against Taiwan and undertake steps that would lead to a substantive dialogue, including a renunciation of the use of force against Taiwan and progress toward democracy, the rule of law, and protection of human and religious rights in the People's Republic of China. Affirms the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act as the legal standard by which U.S. policy toward Taiwan shall be determined."
