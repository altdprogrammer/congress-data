    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Levels and Amounts Title II: Budgetary Restraints and Rulemaking Title III: Sense of the Congress and the Senate Sets forth the congressional budget for the Government for FY 2000, including the appropriate budgetary levels for FY 2001 through 2009. Provides that S. Res. 312, approved on October 21, 1998, shall be considered to be the concurrent budget resolution for FY 1999. Title I: Levels and Amounts - Lists recommended budgetary levels and amounts, for FY 2000 through 2009, with respect to: (1) Federal revenues; (2) new budget authority; (3) budget outlays; (4) deficits or surpluses; (5) public debt; and (6) debt held by the public. (Sec. 102) Sets forth for such fiscal years specified amounts of revenues and outlays of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. (Sec. 103) Lists the appropriate levels of new budget authority and budget outlays for specified major functional categories for FY 2000 through 2009. (Sec. 104) Directs the Finance Committee to report to the Senate, and the Ways and Means Committee to report to the House of Representatives, a reconciliation bill proposing necessary changes to: (1) reduce revenues by specified amounts for FY 2000 through 2009; and (2) decrease the statutory limit on the public debt to a specified amount for FY 2000. Title II: Budgetary Restraints and Rulemaking - Requires the: (1) Congressional Budget Office to update its FY 2000 economic and budget forecast by July 15, 1999; and (2) Budget Committee Chairman (Chairman) to make certain FY 2000 budget adjustments if such update estimates a budget surplus for that fiscal year. (Sec. 202) Provides that if legislation is reported by the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee that provides risk management and income assistance for agricultural producers, then the Chairman may increase the allocation of budget authority and outlays to such Committee by specified amounts through FY 2009, with limitations. (Sec. 203) Authorizes the Chairman to reduce spending and revenue aggregates and revise committee allocations for legislation that reduces revenues if such legislation will not increase the deficit for periods through FY 2009. (Sec. 205) Provides that: (1) a Senator may make a point of order against an emergency designation in a measure; (2) if such point of order is sustained, the provision making such designation shall be stricken and may not be offered as a floor amendment; and (3) such authority may be waived or suspended in the Senate only by affirmative vote of three-fifths of the members. (Sec. 206) Mandates that if there is no joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report on the FY 2000 concurrent budget resolution, then the Senate and House Budget Chairmen shall submit for publication allocations consistent with such resolution, as passed by both Houses. (Sec. 207) Allows Senate spending aggregates and other appropriate budgetary levels and limits to be adjusted and allocations revised for legislation that would use proceeds from Outer Continental Shelf leasing and production to fund historic preservation, recreation and land, water, fish, and wildlife conservation efforts and to support coastal needs and activities, provided that such legislation will not increase budget deficits for FY 2000 through 2009. Authorizes the Chairman to file revised allocations, functional levels, and aggregates in such event, and for any amendments to such legislation. (Sec. 208) Authorizes such adjustments and revisions for legislation that would: (1) provide additional funds for Medicare managed care plans agreeing to serve elderly patients for at least two years and whose reimbursement was reduced because of risk adjustment regulations; and (2) significantly extend the solvency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund without the use of transfers of new subsidies from the general fund (including an authorized adjustment to address the cost of the prescription drug benefit). Title III: Sense of the Congress and the Senate - Expresses the sense of the Senate with respect to: (1) elimination of the marriage penalty; (2) improving security for U.S. diplomatic missions; (3) access to high quality home health services; (4) tax treatment of health insurance premiums for the self-employed; (5) tax reductions for working families; (6) full funding of the National Guard; (7) the effects of Social Security reform on women; (8) increased funding for the National Institutes of Health; (9) increased Federal research and development investment; (10) full funding of counter-narcotics activities; (11) funding for tribal colleges; (12) disallowing the use of Social Security surpluses to fund other Federal programs; (13) completion of the sale of Governors Island; and (14) increased funding for the Pell Grant program. (Sec. 309) Expresses the sense of Congress that funds should not be provided to put into effect the Kyoto Protocol prior to Senate ratification."
