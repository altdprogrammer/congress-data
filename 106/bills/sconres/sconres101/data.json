Requires the same majority to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on such point of order.(Sec. 202) Authorizes the adjustment of spending aggregates and other budgetary levels and limits and revision of allocations in the Senate for legislation reported by the Finance Committee to provide a prescription drug benefit for FY 2001 through 2003, provided the legislation will not reduce the on-budget surplus by a total of $20 billion during these years and will not cause an on-budget deficit. Requires such adjustments to be made for legislation or an amendment that provides prescription drug coverage if the Finance Committee has not reported such legislation before September 1, 2000.Authorizes the Chairman of the Budget Committee (Chairman), if legislation is reported by the Finance Committee that extends the solvency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund without the use of transfers of new subsidies from the general fund, decreasing beneficiaries' access to health care, and excluding the cost of extending and modifying the prescription drug benefit described above, to change committee allocations and spending aggregates by up to $20 billion total for FY 2004 and 2005 to fund such benefit if such legislation will not cause an on-budget deficit.(Sec. 203) Permits the Chairman, whenever the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee reports a bill (or an amendment or conference report is submitted) that provides additional resources for counties and complies with this section, to increase the allocation of budget authority (and resulting outlays to that committee by the amount) provided by such legislation, with limitations. Provides that legislation complies if it provides for the stabilization of receipt-based payments to counties that support school and road systems and provides that a portion of those payments would be dedicated toward local investments in Federal lands within the counties.(Sec. 204) Authorizes the appropriate Budget Committee Chairman, if the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry reports a bill before June 29, 2000 (or an amendment or conference report is submitted), that provides assistance for producers of program and specialty crops and enhancements for agriculture conservation that does not cause a specified net increase in budget authority and outlays, to increase the allocation of budget authority (and resulting outlays to that committee by the amount) provided by such legislation, with limitations.(Sec. 205) Authorizes the Chairman to reduce spending and revenue aggregates and revise committee allocations for legislation that reduces revenues if such legislation will not increase the deficit or decrease the surplus for FY 2001 or for the period of FY 2001 through 2005.(Sec. 206) Requires the: (1) Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to update its economic and budget outlook for FY 2001 through 2010 by July 1, 2000; and (2) appropriate Budget Committee Chairman to make certain budget adjustments if such update estimates a budget surplus that exceeds the surplus set forth in the CBO's March 2000 outlook.(Sec. 207) Directs the Chairman, if the reconciliation legislation provided for in section 104 or the Medicare legislation provided for in section 202 of this resolution does not become law by October 1, 2000, to make certain adjustments to the pay-as-you-go scorecard and the level of debt held by the public set forth in this resolution.(Sec. 208) Provides that the criteria to be considered in determining whether a proposed expenditure or tax change is an emergency requirement in legislation are whether it is: (1) necessary, essential, or vital; (2) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up over time; (3) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring immediate action; (4) unforeseen, unpredictable, and unanticipated; and (5) not permanent, temporary in nature. Requires a committee report or the statement of managers to justify why a requirement should be accorded emergency status if it does not meet such criteria.Strikes emergency requirements in legislation under consideration in the Senate when a point of order is sustained against such requirements. Waives or suspends such point of order only by an affirmative three-fifths majority vote. Requires the same majority to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair.(Sec. 209) Requires the appropriate Budget Committee chairman, if legislation becomes law that increases the discretionary spending limit for FY 2001 set out in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act), to increase a specified allocation called for in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to the appropriate Appropriations Committee. Prohibits such allocation from exceeding the total budget authority and outlays set forth under such Act.(Sec. 210) Provides a point of order in the Senate against consideration of legislation that exceeds certain discretionary spending limits in the defense and nondefense categories for FY 2001.

Requires the same majority to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair.Terminates this section on October 1, 2002.(Sec. 212) Provides that for purposes of points of order of this resolution and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, provisions contained in legislation, amendments, or motions that affect any surplus funds of the Federal reserve banks shall not be scored with respect to the levels of budget authority, outlays, or revenues contained in such legislation.(Sec. 213) Provides that provisions contained in an appropriations bill (or related amendment or conference report) that result in increased revenues shall continue not to be scored with respect to the level of budget authority or outlays in such legislation for purposes of points of order under this resolution and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.(Sec. 214) Provides for the application and effect of changes in allocations and aggregates made pursuant to this resolution.(Sec. 215) Authorizes the Chairman, whenever the Finance Committee reports a bill (or an amendment or conference report is submitted) that facilitates children with disabilities receiving health care at home and finances health programs designed to allow such children to access the health services they need to remain at home while allowing their families to become or remain employed, to increase the spending aggregate and allocation of budget authority (and resulting outlays) to that committee by the amount provided by such legislation, with limitations.Title III: Sense of the Senate Provisions - Expresses the sense of the Senate with respect to: (1) funding international tuberculosis control efforts; (2) tax relief for parents and funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant; (3) tax relief for college tuition and interest paid on student loans; (4) increased funding for the National Institutes of Health; (5) funding for elementary and secondary education being in proportion to levels authorized in the Educational Opportunities Act; (6) elimination of wasted Federal expenditures and the use of revenue for tax relief or debt reduction; (7) the skilled nursing benefit and Medicare; (8) full funding as discretionary programs of certain conservation, historic preservation, and wildlife programs and funds; (9) increased appropriations for veterans' medical care; (10) educational impact aid; (11) raised acreage limits under the Conservation and Wetlands Reserve Programs; (12) tax simplification; (13) antitrust enforcement regarding agriculture mergers and anticompetitive activity; (14) trade support for American farmers; (15) the effects of social security reform on women; (16) full funding for programs established by the Violence Against Women Act of 1994; (17) the use of the False Claims Act to combat Medicare fraud; (18) funding for the National Guard; (19) protection of the defense readiness accounts; (20) compensation for the Chinese Embassy bombing in Belgrade; (21) access to information technologies and information technology training to address the digital divide; (22) funding for immunization grants; (23) tax credits for small businesses that provide health insurance to low-income employees; (24) funding for certain criminal justice programs; (25) Pell Grant funding; (26) public education reform; (27) funding for U.S. international leadership; (28) the HIV-AIDS epidemic; and (29) funding for tribal colleges."
