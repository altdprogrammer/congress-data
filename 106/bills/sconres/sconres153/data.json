Reaffirms recognition of the 13th Supreme Soviet as the sole and democratically and constitutionally legitimate legislative body of Belarus.Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should call upon Lukashenko and his regime to: (1) provide a full accounting of the disappearances of specified individuals in that country; and (2) release specified individuals imprisoned in Belarus for their political views."
