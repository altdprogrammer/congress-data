    "date": "1983-08-04", 
    "text": "Hazardous Waste Reduction Act of 1983 - Title I - Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (the Superfund Act) to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make grants to States to assist States in: (1) carrying out hazardous waste enforcement programs under the Solid Waste Disposal Act; (2) carrying out remedial actions and other response measures necessary with respect to the release, or substantial threat of release, of any pollutant or contaminant from a facility not on the 400 top priority known response targets list but which the State determines may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare; and (3) providing technical assistance to companies engaged in the recycling of hazardous substances. Requires that at least $200,000,000 of the amounts appropriated to the Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund shall be reserved to make such grants to States. Revises provisions for audits by each Inspector General of each department or agency delegated responsibility to obligate money in the Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund. Directs each such Inspector General to report annually to the President and the Congress on such auditing of the Fund and to specifically identify any improper uses of the Fund. Provides for reimbursement to the Fund for any improper expenditures. Extends through FY 1995 the authorization of appropriations for the Fund. Increases the yearly amount of such authorization of appropriations for FY 1986 through 1995 (above the yearly amount currently authorized through FY 1985). Amends the hazardous waste management provision of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976) to establish a hazardous waste quantity assessment program. Directs the Administrator, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the States, to develop and implement methods of estimate the quantities of hazardous waste which are generated in each calendar year, on the basis of specified data. Directs the Administrator to report at least annually to the Congress, comparing the quantities of hazardous waste estimated to have been generated during the preceding calendar year and the quantities of waste on which the recycling incentive tax on disposal of hazardous wastes was paid. Title II - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to replace (effective October 1, 1985) the environmental taxes on petroleum and chemical feedstocks with a recycling incentive tax on disposal of hazardous wastes (effective for FY 1985 through 1995). Sets forth tables for determining the amount of such tax. Distinguishes between: (1) toxic and nontoxic hazardous waste; (2) waste disposal before and after the end of FY 1990; and (3) disposal of waste and storage of waste for more than one year. Imposes such tax on the person disposing of such waste. Sets forth requirements for records, statements, and returns relating to such tax. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe any such requirements, as necessary, for persons involved in the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous wastes. Extends through FY 1995 the authority to collect taxes conferred by the Superfund Act."
