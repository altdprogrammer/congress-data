Provides for documents to be furnished without charge when the information is not requested for commercial use and when such request is made by an individual engaged in scientific or scholarly research, journalistic activity, or any nonprofit group which intends to make such information available to the public. Revises the procedure of judicial review of an agency's position under the Act. Provides agencies with authority to extend the time limits for compliance with a request up to 30 days, upon a written notice citing one or more unusual circumstances as set forth in the Act. Requires each agency to promulgate regulations allowing for expedited access to records when there is a compelling need. Requires each agency to promulgate regulations specifying procedures that would permit submitters of trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information to present claims of confidentiality to an agency before submitted information is released in response to a request. Allows submitters objecting to disclosure to seek judicial review. Revises the exemptions requirement under the Freedom of Information Act."
