    "text": "National Mathematics and Science Excellence in Education Act of 1983 - Title I: Science and Mathematics Education Merit Scholarships and Teaching Awards - Congressional Science and Mathematics Education Merit Scholarships and Teaching Awards Act - Authorizes the National Science Foundation to award scholarships to individuals who demonstrate outstanding potential for, and who plan to pursue, careers in teaching mathematics or science in elementary or secondary schools. Limits the period of such a scholarship to two academic years at any institution of higher education offering educational activities designed to prepare individuals for such careers. Authorizes the Foundation, after consultation with the Director of the Office of Science and Technology, to establish criteria for the selection of merit scholars. Limits the number of scholars selected to ten individuals from each State and five individuals from each congressional district in each State (and ten individuals in the case of the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico). Requires each merit scholarship recipient to agree to pursue such a teaching career for at least three years upon completion of the training for which the scholarship was awarded. Requires the Director of the Foundation to submit the names of the individuals selected to the appropriate State Commission on Excellence in Mathematics and Science established under title II of this Act for review and approval. Limits merit scholarship stipends to $2,500 for each academic year of study. Conditions scholarship payment upon the student's maintaining satisfactory proficiency and full-time study. Authorizes the Foundation to require reports on student progress. Authorizes the Foundation to make experienced mathematics and science teacher awards for elementary and secondary school teachers. Sets such awards at $5,000 for those who have taught for at least five years and $10,000 for those who have taught at least ten years. Limits such awards to two $5,000 and two $10,000 awards for each State (and for the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico), and one $5,000 and one $10,000 award for each congressional district in each State. Provides for an awards ceremony for merit scholarships and experienced teacher awards at a place in each State convenient to the individuals selected. Requires, to the extent possible, that the award be made by the appropriate Members of Congress. Sets a yearly deadline for selection and awards. Sets forth administrative provisions. Requires the Foundation to report annually to the President and the Congress on its operations under this title. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1987. Title II: State Commissions on Excellence in Mathematics and Science - Requires any State which desires to receive a block grant for the improvement of education in mathematics and science under the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 to establish a State Commission on Excellence in Mathematics and Science. Requires that the State Commission be appointed by the State Board of Education (or the Governor, if there is no Board) and approved by the Foundation. Sets forth the composition of the State Commission's membership. Permits the State Board to designate an existing State agency which is in substantial compliance with such membership requirements to be the State Commission for a specified interim period. Sets forth the functions of each State Commission. Directs the Secretary of Education and the Director of the Foundation to: (1) convene an annual conference to coordinate the activities of each State Commission; and (2) report to the Congress on the activities of each National Conference, with appropriate recommendations. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1987. Requires the Director of the Foundation to allot a specified amount of such funds to each State. Title III: Block Grant for the Improvement of Education in Mathematics and Science - Amends the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 to establish a new block grant program for the improvement of education in mathematics and science. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1987. Sets forth formulas for allotment of such funds to: (1) U.S. territories and possessions; (2) Indian schools; (3) the Secretary's discretionary funds; and (4) States, including the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, based on relative school-age population. Provides for in-State allocations of State allotments, with no more than 25 percent to the State educational agency (SEA) for State level programs and at least 75 percent to local educational agencies (LEAs) according to relative enrollments in public and nonpublic schools within the LEA school districts, adjusted to provide higher per pupil allocations to LEAs with the greatest numbers or percentages of children whose education imposes a higher than average cost per child (such as children from low-income families, in economically depressed areas, and in sparsely populated areas). Directs the Secretary to approve criteria suggested by the SEA for adjusting such allocations if an equitable distribution would be produced. Directs each SEA, to the extent practicable, to use specified criteria. Directs the SEA to distribute such allocations to LEAs which have submitted applications. Sets forth authorized activities, to be consistent with goals and priorities established by State Commissions, for which SEAs and LEAs may use such block grant funds. Sets forth requirements for State and local applications for such funds. Provides for participation of children enrolled in private schools in such block grant program. Sets forth authorized uses of the Secretary's discretionary funds under such block grant program."
