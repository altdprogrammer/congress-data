Repeals the authority of employers to require as a condition of employment membership in certain labor organizations. Repeals the authority of labor organizations to discriminate against an employee for failure to pay membership fees. Repeals the authority of employers in the building and construction industries to enter into collective bargaining agreements which require membership in certain labor organizations as a condition of employment. Empowers individual employees to enter into individual contracts of employment directly with an employer without the intervention of a bargaining representative. Repeals the requirement that the National Labor Relations Board take a secret ballot of employees if such employees have filed a petition requesting the rescission of a bargaining unit's authority. Repeals the authority of employers and collective bargaining units to require employees with specified conscientious objector status to contribute specified funds to certain charitable organizations. Requires the Board to order a labor organization to pay a specified amount of backpay to an individual if the Board finds that such labor organization has committed an unfair labor practice involving violence against such individual."
