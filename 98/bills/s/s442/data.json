Requires that the zoning regulations provide for the continuance of land uses which existed before July 1, 1982, and be consistent with existing State and local zoning laws. Sets forth the procedural requirements for approval of the land use plan and the zoning regulations by the Secretary of the Interior and their adoption by the local zoning authorities."
