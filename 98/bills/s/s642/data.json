    "text": "Medicare Catastrophic Hospital Cost Protection Act - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to eliminate the time limits on the duration of inpatient hospital care, post-hospital extended care, and inpatient psychiatric hospital care. Prohibits more than two inpatient hospital deductibles per year, no matter how many hospitalizations occur. Revises coinsurance provisions. Provides that coinsurance shall be: (1) 8 percent of the inpatient hospital deductible for each of the first 15 days of hospitalization during any spell of illness; and (2) five percent of the inpatient hospital deductible for each subsequent day. Prohibits the total number of days annually for which coinsurance was charged plus the days for which the inpatient hospital deductible was charged from exceeding 60. Reduces the coinsurance imposed on the 21st through 100th day of care for post-hospital extended care services."
