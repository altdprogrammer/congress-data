    "text": "Intellectual Property Rights Protection and Fair Trade Act 1984 - Directs the President to review, on a country by country basis, the adequacy and effectiveness of such country's efforts to protect the intellectual property rights of U.S. nationals in the context of U.S. trade relations, including, but not limited to, negotiations with respect to a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) convention and the implementation of treaties and conventions. Requires the President to consult with private sector representatives as required by the Trade Act of 1974. Directs the President to report the results of such review to Congress within one year after enactment of this Act, including recommendations for bilateral and multilateral initiatives, negotiating plans and priorities, dealing with inadequate protections in high technology areas, and the imposition of trade suspensions or denials of trade concessions. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to prohibit the President from designating as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of such Act a country which fails to provide adequate intellectual property protection to U.S. nationals or does not assume a constructive role with respect to GATT or compliance with existing treaties and conventions. Permits the President to exempt any country where substantial progress is being made upon presenting written assurances to that effect to Congress. Permits an exemption, up to one year, for any country if it would be in the security or economic interest of the United States. Requires written notification to Congress. Permits a one year extension of such exemption. Requires the President to withdraw or suspend the designation of a beneficiary developing country if after two years after the initial report under this Act is submitted, such country fails to comply with the requirements or qualify for an exemption under this Act. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to assist developing nations in establishing and enforcing effective systems for the protection of intellectual property rights. Sets forth the factors the President must consider in determining whether or not to provide such assistance, including the good faith efforts of the country in question, the relative economic importance of such country, the extent of protection deficiency, and the threat to the technological and trade interests of the United States. Authorizes appropriations."
