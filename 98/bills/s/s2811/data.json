Requires that such State skills corporation: (1) have as one of its principal corporate purposes the provision of a skill training and education program consistent with the employment needs of the State; (2) receive matching funds from direct State appropriation; and (3) receive financial support from business and industry in the State, together with information, technical assistance, and financial support from business concerns within the State.
