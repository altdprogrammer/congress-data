Sets forth rules for the tax treatment of commodities received under such a program involving repayment of Commodity Credit Corporation loans. Specifies that farmers participating in a payment- in-kind program do not forfeit eligibility for the special use valuation provisions for farm property. Specifies that tax-exempt farmers' cooperatives shall not forfeit tax-exempt status if such a cooperative markets any commodity received by, or on behalf of, a member participating in a payment-in-kind program."
