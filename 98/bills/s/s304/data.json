Amends the Act of November 24, 1942 to increase from $2,000 to $50,000 the upper threshold value of certain land interests of intestate Indians without heirs which will escheat to the United States as trustee. (Estates valued below the threshold are held for needy Indians designated by the Secretary of the Interior; those above the threshold are held for whichever Indians Congress chooses to designate.)"
