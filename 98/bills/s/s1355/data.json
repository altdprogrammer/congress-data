    "text": "Small Business Procurement Reform Act of 1983 - Amends the Small Business Act to provide that if bidding on defense procurement actions of $10,000 and above, or civilian procurement actions of $5,000 and above is limited to one person, a particular area of the United States, or both, then the Secretary of Commerce is required to provide a written description of the individual circumstances and the law which is the basis for such limitation along with the notice that is ordinarily required for such procurement actions under such Act. Requires the Secretary to publish timely notice of all procurement contract awards set aside for small businesses. Directs the Secretary to investigate and implement alternative means of notifying such small businesses of defense procurement actions of $10,000 and above and civilian procurement actions of $5,000 and above in addition to the daily publication that is required under such Act. Requires Federal agencies to plan contracts for the procurement of services or spare parts for large systems so as not to preclude performance by small and small disadvantaged businesses as prime contractors, where practicable. Requires the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to establish Government procurement contract arbitration panels to facilitate the resolution of contract disputes between small businesses and Federal agencies. Establishes the Small Business Procurement Advisory Committee to advise the Administrator and Congress on Government contracts awarded to or set aside for small businesses."
