Credit Card Protection Act - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to prohibit the disclosure of any payment device number or credit card number. Specifies circumstances in which such numbers may be disclosed. Defines \"payment device number\" as any code, account number, or other means of account access that can be used to obtain money, goods, services, or anything of value or a transfer of funds. Extends the current prohibition against the fraudulent use and transportation of credit cards to cover credit card numbers, debit cards, electronic banking cards, or other access devices to a customer's account. Makes possession with unlawful or fraudulent intent of five or more illegally obtained credit cards, codes, or other means of accessing an account a Federal crime. Confers Federal jurisdiction over any offense where multiple credit cards or other payment devices are used so long as the fraudulent charges amount to $1,000 or more."
