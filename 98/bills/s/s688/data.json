Provides that any unobligated funds allocated pursuant to this Act shall be: (1) used for development assistance projects in El Salvador; (2) used for aid for persons displaced by the strife; or (3) deposited in the U.S. Treasury. Permits the introduction of U.S. forces into EL Salvador to evacuate U.S. citizens or if there is a clear and present danger of attack upon the United States."
