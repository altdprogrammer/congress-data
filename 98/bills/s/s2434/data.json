    "text": "Amends the Small Business Act to require the Small Business Administration to assign to each major procurement center a breakout procurement center representative who shall: (1) review procurement method codes with the goal of encouraging increased competition among small business; (2) review procurement requirements which limit the opportunity for small businesses to compete as prime contractors; (3) review and conduct a value analysis of engineering change proposals to determine if such proposal will result in lower costs to the Government; and (4) review the systems that account for the access to and ownership of manufacturing data. Directs the Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization of each agency to assign technical advisors to assist each breakout procurement center representative. Sets forth the method for determining either an increase in the rate of basic pay or a payment of a cash award to a breakout procurement representative whenever it is determined that such representative has achieved a significant savings for the Government. Requires the Comptroller General to report to the Committees on Small Business of the House of Representatives and of the Senate regarding breakout procurement procedures."
