    "text": "Amends the American-Mexican Boundary Treaty Act of 1972 to prohibit construction of any new works or modification of existing works on the U.S. side of either the main channel or adjacent lands subject to overflow of the limitrophe sections of either the Rio Grande or the Colorado River without: (1) having submitted an application to the U.S. Commissioner of the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico; and (2) having received from the U.S. Commissioner a permit authorizing the work. Requires that the location and plans for the proposed works be included in the application. Requires the U.S. Commissioner to issue such a permit unless the joint commission determines that the proposed works could cause deflection or obstruction of the normal flow or flood flows of the Rio Grande or the Colorado River that could change the international boundary. Sets forth penalties for violations of this Act. Requires Federal agencies proposing to undertake construction projects in such areas to coordinate with the U.S. Commissioner to secure approval of the proposed project."
