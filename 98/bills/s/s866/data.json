    "text": "Milk Program Improvement Act of 1983 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to give milk producers who reduce production to 1980 levels a 95 percent refund (payments to be made in April and October) of two scheduled 50-cent assessments. Establishes in the Treasury a Milk Promotion Fund (to be terminated by September 30, 1986) to support dairy research and promotion activities. Provides money for such Fund from the remaining five percent of the milk producer assessments. Requires producer approval by referendum (by May 31, 1983) before moneys may be deposited in such Fund. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, beginning July 1, 1983, and ending September 30, 1985, to enter into agreements with, or approve agreements among, milk and dairy producer associations to promote milk and dairy sales. States that program costs shall be covered by moneys from the Fund."
