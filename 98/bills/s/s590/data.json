Increases the amount of funds available to States for FY 1983 and 1984 for low-cost residential weatherization and energy-related home repairs. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to collect data on the number and income levels of households assisted by funds for low-cost residential weatherization and energy-related home repairs."
