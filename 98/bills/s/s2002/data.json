    "text": "Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1983 - Title I: Standards of Disability - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to provide that an individual who is receiving disability benefits may be determined not to be entitled to such benefits on the grounds that the disability involved has ceased, does not exist, or is not disabling, only if: (1) there has been medical improvement in the individual's impairment so that the individual can engage in substantial gainful activity; (2) the individual can engage in substantial gainful activity as a result of medical or vocational therapy or technology; or (3) on the basis of new or improved diagnostic techniques, the individual's impairment is not considered as disabling as it was at the time of the most recent prior disability determination and the individual can engage in substantial gainful activity. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) conduct a study, in conjunction with the National Academy of Sciences, on the use of subjective evidence of pain in making disability determinations; and (2) submit the study results to specified congressional committees. Requires the Secretary to consider the combined effect of all of an individual's impairments in determining whether such individual is unable to engage in substantial gainful activity. Title II: Disability Determination Process - Requires the Secretary to revise the criteria under the category \"Mental Disorders\" in the \"Listing of Impairments\" in effect under part 404 of title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations which are used to make individualized determinations of disability for purposes of determining eligibility for disability benefits under title II of the Social Security Act. Prohibits the Social Security Administration from carrying out continuing eligibility reviews with respect to individuals previously determined to be under a disability due to mental impairment until such revisions have been established by final regulation. Makes such prohibition inapplicable in any case involving fraud or where an individual is engaged in substantial gainful activity. Sets forth requirements for the redetermination of disability determinations made after the enactment of this Act and before the date on which the Secretary's revisions are established by final regulation. Provides that an initial disability determination by the Secretary or by a State agency which is unfavorable to a disability benefit applicant shall remain pending until after notice and opportunity for review. Requires that such a determination contain a statement of the case which indicates the basis of the disability determination, the right to a review, and the right to submit additional medical evidence before such review. Entitles the applicant or the applicant's spouse, divorced spouse, surviving divorced spouse, surviving spouse, surviving divorced mother, child, or parent to a review of a pending disability determination upon request and upon a showing that his or her rights may be prejudiced by such determination. Sets forth procedural requirements with respect to such a review. Requires the Secretary or the State agency to affirm or modify a pending disability determination on the basis of such a review. Provides that an initial decision by the Secretary as to an individual's eligibility for disability benefits which is based upon an initial disability determination and which is unfavorable to such individual shall contain a statement of the case which indicates the basis of such decision, the individual's right to a hearing, and the individual's right to submit additional evidence before or at such hearing. Entitles an individual who is dissatisfied with an initial decision by the Secretary to judicial review. Requires the Secretary to conduct demonstration projects in at least five States implementing the amendments made by this Act. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on such projects. Removes certain time restrictions on the continued payment of disability benefits during the appeal process. Requires the Secretary to study and report to specified congressional committees on: (1) the effect of the continued payment of benefits during the appeal process upon the expenditures from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund; and (2) the rate of appeals to administrative law judges of unfavorable disability benefit entitlement determinations. Provides that a disability determination in the case of an individual with a mental impairment shall be made only after a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist employed by the State agency or the Secretary has made the proper medical evaluation. Requires the Secretary to prescribe standards with respect to consultative examinations which must be obtained for disability determinations. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Provides for the application of Federal rulemaking and administrative procedure requirements to disability determinations under title II of the Social Security Act. Specifies certain decisions by a U.S. court of appeals with which the Secretary and the Department of Health and Human Services must comply, unless there is a review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Expands the types of cases with respect to which States may be reimbursed by the Secretary for the costs of furnishing vocational rehabilitation services. Establishes in the Department of Health and Human Services an Advisory Council on the Medical Aspects of Disability, which shall advise and make recommendations to the Secretary on disability standards, policies, and procedures. Terminates the Council on December 31, 1985. Amends title VII (Administration) of the Social Security Act to require that each report by the Secretary to Congress on the administration of the Social Security Act contain a description of the current status of the disability insurance program under title II of such Act. Requires the Secretary to establish enough attorney adviser positions in the Department of Health and Human Services to insure adequate opportunity for career advancement for attorneys in the Social Security Administration. Requires that such attorneys be given qualifying experience for appointment to administrative law judge positions. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees with respect to complying with these requirements."
