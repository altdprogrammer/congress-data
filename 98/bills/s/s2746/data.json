    "text": "Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to permit entering into trade agreements that provide for the elimination or reduction of U.S. duties only with Israel or Canada. Prohibits any trade benefit from being extended to any country by reason of the extension of a trade benefit to Israel or Canada under such a trade agreement. Authorizes entering into a trade agreement that provides for the elimination or reduction of U.S. duties with a country other than Israel or Canada if: (1) such country requested the negotiation of such agreement; and (2) the President, at least 60 days before notification is given to Congress of the trade agreement, provides notice of the negotiations to the Senate Finance and the House Ways and Means Committees and consults with such committees regarding the negotiations. Declares that the provisions dealing with bills implementing trade agreements on nontariff barriers shall not apply to an implementing bill if: (1) the implementing bill contains a provision approving a trade agreement which provides for the elimination or reduction of any U.S. duty and is entered into with a country other than Israel or Canada; and (2) either the appropriate congressional committees were not consulted with respect to the negotiations or the committees disapproved of the negotiation before the close of the 60 days period. Includes within the definition of the term \"barrier\" for purposes of such negotiations any duty or other import restrictions. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to authorize the imposition of countervailing duties on subsidized articles that are sold (or likely to be sold) for importation into the United States if the International Trade Commission determines that a U.S. industry is materially injured or is threatened with material injury or that the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded because of sales (or the likelihood of sales) of such articles for importation into the United States. Includes leasing arrangements that are euivalent to sales within the meaning of \"sales\" for purposes of countervailing and antidumping duties. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize the President to seek establishment of a joint commission to resolve trade and other economic issues between the United States and Canada."
