    "text": "Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act - Prohibits the sale or transport in interstate commerce of undersized Atlantic striped bass. Requires the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (Commission) to: (1) determine in 1984, and report to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) on, whether each Coastal State has enforced implementation of the guidelines for the Interstate Fisheries Management Plan for Striped Bass (Plan); and (2) biannually monitor, beginning in 1985, and report to the Secretary on the enforcement of the Plan by such States. Requires the Secretary upon a negative notification by the Commission to declare a moratorium on fishing for Atlantic striped bass (except where incidental to other fishing) within the coastal waters of the offending State. Lists activities which are prohibited during such moratorium. Sets forth civil penalties for noncompliance with the provisions of this Act. Declares that any vessel or vehicle connected with a violation shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States. Grants jurisdiction to the United States district courts over civil forfeitures. Authorizes appropriations."
