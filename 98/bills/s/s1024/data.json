    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-04-12", 
    "text": "National Science Foundation Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1984 - Authorizes appropriations for the National Science Foundation for FY 1984 for the following categories: (1) mathematical and physical sciences; (2) engineering; (3) biological, behavioral, and social sciences; (4) astronomical, atmospheric, earth and ocean sciences; (5) Antarctic research programs; (6) scientific, technological, and international affairs; (7) program development and management; and (8) science and engineering education. Limits the amounts of appropriations which may be expended for consultation and for expenses of the Foundation incurred outside the United States. Permits transfers of funds among categories, in excess of ten percent of appropriations, if the chairmen of the House Committee on Science and Technology and the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources each write the Director of the Foundation that there is no objection to the transfer or 30 days have passed after such committees were notified of the proposed transfer. Repeals the requirement that the Director establish a Resource Center for Science and Engineering at an educational institution enrolling a substantial number of minority and/or low-income students. Deletes the requirement that contracting officers of the Foundation report any financial or academic affiliation with a grant applicant. Repeals the prohibition against a Foundation employee's registering a patent in his or her own interest which is related to the subject matter of and is made in connection with official duties."
