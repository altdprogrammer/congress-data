Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Commerce to enable the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to provide increases for salary, pay, and other employee benefits. Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to cause the vessel Protector Alpha to be documented as a vessel of the United States with the privilege of engaging in the coastwise trade if: (1) such vessel complies with specified requirements of law; and (2) all repairs and modifications totalling at least $3,000,000 are performed on such vessel in a U.S. shipyard. Makes permanent the current definition of \"independent ocean freight forwarder\" in the Shipping Act, 1916 (repeals the reversion to an earlier definition scheduled to take effect January 1, 1984)."
