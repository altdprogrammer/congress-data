Amends the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 to make an exception in any case in which a Government authority which has a disbursing function needs to know, for the sole purpose of properly administering such disbursing function: (1) the name and address of any individual customer with access to an account which was credited, or which should have been credited, with any deposit disbursed by such authority; or (2) the amount so credited. Permits a transfer between Government authorities of any information thus obtained, as long as such transfer is made for, and such information will be used for, the sole purpose of properly administering the law which authorizes the payment of funds involved."
