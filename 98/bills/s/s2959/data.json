    "text": "Superfund Expansion and Protection Act of 1984 - Title I: Provisions Relating Primarily to Response and Liability - Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (Superfund) (CERCLA) (the Act) to revise the definition of \"hazardous substance\" to include petroleum (including crude oil or any fraction thereof) which: (1) is released from an underground storage tank (as defined in title IV of this Act); or (2) may present a significant risk to human health. Transfers the definition of \"pollutant or contaminant\" from under provisions for response authorities under the Act to among the definitions for purposes of the entire Act. Provides that such term shall include petroleum (including crude oil or any fraction thereof) only in the case of a release from an underground storage tank as defined in title IV of this Act. Adds references to \"pollutants or contaminants\" under specified provisions of the Act. Includes under the definition of \"release\" the abandonment or discarding of barrels, containers, and other closed receptacles containing hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants. Revises conditions under which the terms \"remedy\" or \"remedial action\" may include offsite transfer, storage, treatment, destruction, or secure disposition. Requires that such offsite actions must be determined to be at least as cost-effective as other remedial actions. Requires the President, in making such a determination, to take into account: (1) the long-term uncertainties associated with land disposal; (2) the goals, objectives, and requirements of the Solid Waste Disposal Act; (3) the persistence, toxicity, mobility, and propensity to bioaccumulate of such hazardous substances; and (4) the long-term maintenance costs of alternative remedial actions. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (the Administrator) to promulgate regulations establishing reportable quantities for: (1) all hazardous substances other than carcinogens, within six months after enactment of this Act; and (2) the remaining hazardous substances, by October 1, 1986. Increases the amount of criminal fines and the duration of criminal sentences for specified violations under the Act. Adds civil penalties for specified violations under the Act. Revises response authorities provisions. Requires that any removal action undertaken by the Administrator or any other person with respect to any release or threat of release shall contribute to the efficient performance of any long-term remedial action with respect to such release or threatened release. Authorizes the Administrator to undertake any such response action unless the Administrator determines that such action will be done properly by the owner or operator of the facility from which the release or threatened release emanates, or by any other responsible party. Directs the Administrator, in undertaking any information gathering or planning under such response authority provisions, to assess the potential effects on human health associated with the release or threatened release. Revises response authorities provisions relating to agreements with States. Requires States to make specified agreements with the Administrator, rather than with the President. Eliminates the requirement that a State assure all future maintenance of the removal and remedial actions provided for the expected life of such actions. Requires the State to pay ten percent of the costs of remedial action and ten percent of all future operation and maintenance costs of any onsite remedial action. Requires a 50 percent or greater State share of response costs only in the case of facilities operated, as well as owned, by the State or local government at the time of hazardous waste disposal. Requires the State to also pay all future operation and maintenance costs of any onsite remedial action at such State or locally owned and operated facilities. Provides for credits to any State which has paid more than a ten percent share of remedial costs at a facility owned, but not operated, by such State or local government. Provides that reasonable administrative expenses may be credited against a State's ten percent share. Provides for credits to a State under prescribed circumstances in which State or local funds are expended. Sets forth mandatory cleanup standards. Directs the Administrator, rather than the President, to select appropriate cost-effective remedial actions determined to be necessary. Requires that such actions be in accordance with: (1) the National Contingency Plan to the extent practicable; and (2) a required protection level. Directs the Administrator, in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a remedial action, to select (to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with the public health and welfare and the environment) permanent solutions and alternative treatment technologies or resource recovery technologies that will result in a permanent and significant decrease in the toxicity, mobility, or volume of the hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant, taking specified factors into account. Requires that the remedial action provide for a level or standard of control necessary to protect human health and the environment. Requires that such level or standard be as stringent as the most stringent applicable standard under the Toxic Substances Control Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Air Act, or Clean Water Act (or water quality criteria under the Clean Water Act). Requires that any remedial action which provides for containment at the facility comply with standards applicable to facilities required to obtain hazardous waste management permits under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Authorizes the Administrator to waive the requirement of the most stringent applicable standard, or of the specified containment standard, and to select an alternative remedial action upon a finding that: (1) such alternative remedial action will provide substantially equivalent protection; or (2) compliance with such requirements at that facility will consume such a disproportionate share of the resources of the Hazardous Substances Trust Fund (the Fund) as to have the effect of deferring or preventing remedial action at other facilities which pose a significantly greater threat to human health and the environment. Prohibits permit requirements for any removal or remedial action undertaken pursuant to the Act at the location of the release or threatened release. Authorizes the Administrator to establish the exclusive administrative procedures for making any determination under provisions for required protection level. Revises provisions for information gathering and access authorities to refer to the Administrator, rather than the President. Applies specified information requirements to generators of hazardous wastes, even if such information is available at the facility where such waste is located. Provides for access to such facilities by duly designated Federal and State officers, whenever necessary to carry out any provision of the Act, at reasonable times and for a reasonable duration. Prohibits anyone from impeding or interfering with such entry. Directs the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to prepare toxicological profiles including specified information, sufficient to establish the likely effect on human health of at least 100 hazardous substances which are most frequently found or which pose the most significant threat to human health at facilities listed on the National Priorities List prepared under the National Contingency Plan. Requires that the 100 profiles be completed 48 months after enactment of this Act (at 12-month intervals for four groups of 25 substances). Adds new provisions for public participation in remedial action planning. Sets forth requirements and procedures for public notice and opportunity to comment on such plans. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants available to any group of individuals who may be affected by a release or threatened release at any facility which is listed on the National Priority List under the National Contingency Plan. Provides that such grants shall be for enabling the group to obtain expert advice and technical assistance to review and assess data and information prepared and required to be published by the Administrator with respect to such facility. Limits such grants to not more than four-fifths of the total costs of such advice and assistance. Requires each grant recipient to contribute at least one-fifth of the total of such costs. Prohibits more than one such grant from being made with respect to a single facility. Sets forth mandatory remedial action schedules. Directs the Administrator (of EPA) to commence remedial investigations for all facilities which are listed, as of the enactment date of this Act, on the National Priorities List (NPL) in accordance with the following schedule: (1) one-third of such facilities within eight months after such enactment date; (2) two-thirds within 16 months after such date; and (3) all within 24 months after such date. Directs the Administrator to list not fewer than 1,600 facilities on the NPL by January 1, 1988. Directs the Administrator to insure commencement of remedial actions and feasibility studies for each facility added to the NPL after the enactment date of this Act, beginning 24 momths after such enactment date, according to a schedule which provides for such commencement at: (1) 200 facilities during the first 12 months after such 24-month period; (2) 275 facilities during the next 12 months; and (3) 375 facilities during the third 12 months. Directs the Administrator to ensure that substantial and continuous physical on-site remedial action commences at facilities on the NPL at a rate of not fewer than 150 facilities per year beginning on October 1, 1986. Directs the Administrator to complete by January 1, 1987, preliminary assessments of all sites listed, as of the enactment date of this Act, on the Emergency and Remedial Response Information System. Directs the Administrator to ensure that remedial action is completed, to the maximum extent feasible, for all facilities listed as of the date of enactment of this Act on the NPL within five years after such enactment date. Directs the Administrator to publish an explanation of why any such remedial action could not be completed within such period. Sets forth provisions for citizen petitions for health effects studies and for emergency relief. Allows any individual or group of individuals to submit a petition to the Administrator providing evidence which: (1) demonstrates that such individual or individuals are being exposed to any hazardous substance; and (2) provides an empirical analysis of the level of exposure. Directs the Administrator to initiate a health effects study upon determination that: (1) there is a reasonable likelihood that such substance is from a facility where such substance is or was treated, stored, recycled, or disposed of, on a regular basis, or where removal action is being or was taken under any provision of the Act; and (2) the exposure may present a significant risk to human health. Directs the Administrator (or the ATSDR Administrator if so designated by the Administrator), within 45 days after receipt of such petition, to: (1) initiate a health effects study; or (2) publish a written explanation of the determination which prevented initiation of the study. Requires that each such health effects study be completed within six months after the date the petition is filed and include specified information. Requires that steps be taken to eliminate any significant risk to human health which such study finds the exposure concerned presents. Provides that such steps may include provision of alternative drinking water supplies and relocation of individuals. Requires that the National Contingency Plan (NCP) be revised within 18 months after the enactment of this Act to reflect the amendments made by this Act. Requires that the portion of the NCP known as \"the National Hazardous Substance Response Plan\" be revised to provide procedures and standards for remedial actions consistent with protection level requirements under this Act. Sets forth provisions for citizen petitions for site ranking. Directs the Administrator, within 12 months after receipt of a citizen petition, to complete a preliminary assessment of the hazards to public health and environment associated with any actual or threatened release of a hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant. Directs the Administrator, if such assessment indicates a significant threat, to make a prompt evaluation in accordance with the hazard ranking system referred to under specified provisions of the Act to determine the national priority of such release or threatened release. Requires that plan criteria for determining priorities among releases or threatened releases throughout the United States for purposes of taking remedial action shall also take into account: (1) the release-associated damage to natural resources which may affect the human food chain; and (2) the release-associated contamination or potential contamination of the ambient air. Sets forth provisions for abatement actions. Directs the Administrator, within 18 months after enactment of this Act, and after consultation with the Attorney General, to revise and republish specified guidelines for using imminent hazard, enforcement, and emergency response authorities to effectuate the responsibilities and powers created by this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to establish administrative procedures regarding the opportunity for a person to object to an abatement order under this Act. Provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review any such abatement order in any action other than an action to: (1) enforce such order; (2) recover a penalty for a violation; or (3) recover punitive damages. Revises liability provisions to provide for liability for Federal or State costs of removal or remedial action with respect to a release or threatened release (whether or not such action is consistent with the NCP). Adds liability for Federal or State costs of information gathering with respect to a release or threatened release. Adds liability for the costs of any action taken by the Administrator, under specified citizens petition and emergency relief provisions of this Act, to eliminate a significant risk to human health presented by exposure to a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant and the costs of any health effects study carried out under such provisions with respect to such exposure. Provides that liability under the Act (CERCLA) shall be strict, joint, and several as construed and applied under specified provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and under these CERCLA liability provisions. Provides that amounts recoverable shall include interest at a specified rate. Prohibits the Attorney General from representing any Federal agency (other than the EPA) in any civil action under title I (Hazardous Substances Releases, Liability, Compensation) of the Act (CERCLA). Authorizes the head of any such Federal agency to appoint agency attorneys or contract with non-Federal attorneys to represent the agency in any such action. Provides that, in any action under liability provisions of the Act, the results of laboratory tests conducted by the Administrator (or by a State) to determine what substances are present at the facility where a release or threatened release occurs may be introduced into evidence and shall be presumed to be accurate. Provides that such presumption shall be overcome if the defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that such test results lack a reasonable basis. Provides that nothing under such liability provisions shall be construed to affect the equitable powers of apportionment of any court following adjudication of liability. Provides that a defendant who establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the specified harm is divisible shall be liable only for the appropriate portion. Allows any defendant held liable for response costs or damages in actions under liability provisions of the Act to bring a separate action in the appropriate U.S. district court to require any other person who was, or could have been, a defendant in the prior enforcement or cost recovery action to contribute to payment of such costs or damages. Sets forth similar liability provisions, including such \"right of contribution,\" under provisions for abatement orders. Adds to authorized uses of the Fund the payment of any costs incurred under provisions of this Act: (1) relating to emergency relief and health effects studies; (2) by the ATSDR in preparing specified toxicological profiles; and (3) by the Administrator in evaluating facilities pursuant to petitions for preliminary assessments of hazards to public health. Eliminates a requirement that 85 percent of specified money credited to the Fund be available only for specified purposes. Limits to six percent of such money the amount available for payment of specified claims. Revises audit provisions to direct the Inspector General of the EPA, in each fiscal year, to: (1) conduct an annual audit of the Fund; (2) report on the status of all remedial and enforcement actions taken during the prior fiscal year; and (3) estimate the amount of resources, including the number of work years or personnel, which would be necessary for the Administrator to complete the implementation of all duties vested in the Administrator under this Act. Requires that such audit and such status report: (1) include specified information; and (2) be reported annually by the Inspector General to the Congress. Prohibits any potentially liable person from seeking judicial review of any determination to incur any governmental response costs pursuant to response authorities provisions or to utilize the Fund for payment of such costs except in an action to recover such costs under liability provisions. Revises statute of limitations provisions under the Act. Prohibits, with specified exceptions for minors or incompetent persons, presentation of any claim or commencement of any action for damages, as defined under the Act, beyond three years after the later of: (1) the date of the discovery of the loss; (2) the date on which regulations are promulgated under specified provisions for the assessment of damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources resulting from a release of oil or hazardous substance for purposes of the Act and of specified provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act; or (3) the date on which regulations are promulgated establishing procedures for the filing of such claims. Sets a statute of limitations of six years after the date of the completion of the response action for presentation of claims or commencement of actions for recovery of response costs in cases involving the responsible person's willful misconduct or willful negligence, violation of safety, construction, or operating standards or regulations, or failures or refusals to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance requested by public officials. Extends the deadline for promulgation of regulations for the assessment of damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources resulting from a release of oil or a hazardous substance for purposes of the Act and of specified provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Sets forth provisions concerning the relationship of this Act to other law. Authorizes States to require any person to contribute to any fund to pay compensation for claims for any response costs or damages or claims which may be compensated under the Act. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Authorizes citizen lawsuits under the Act (CERCLA). Sets forth provisions relating to such citizen lawsuits. Directs the Administrator to commence, within six months after the enactment of this Act, the study required under specified provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act concerning drilling fluids and other wastes associated with oil exploration. Title III: Regulation of Underground Storage Tanks - Establishes a program for identification and regulation of underground storage tanks containing hazardous substances (including petroleum products) and for cleanup of leaks from such tanks. Defines \"hazardous substance\" for purposes of this title as: (1) any substance designated pursuant to specified provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act; (2) any element, compound, mixture, solution, or substance designated pursuant to the CERCLA definition of \"pollutant or contaminant,\" as added by this Act; (3) any hazardous waste having the characteristics identified under or listed pursuant to hazardous waste management provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (but not including any waste the regulation of which under such Act has been suspended by Act of Congress); (4) any toxic pollutant listed under specified provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act; (5) any hazardous air pollutant listed under specified provisions of the Clean Air Act; (6) any imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture with respect to which the Administrator has taken action pursuant to specified provisions of the Toxic Substances Control Act; and (7) any petroleum product or fraction thereof. Excludes from such term natural gas, natural gas liquids, propane, liquefied natural gas, or synthetic gas usable for fuel (or mixtures of natural gas and such synthetic gas). Defines \"underground storage tank\" to include underground pipes connected to such a tank, and lists the following exclusions from this term: (1) farm or residential underground storage tanks of 1,100 gallons or less capacity used for storing motor fuel for noncommercial purposes; (2) underground storage tanks used for storing heating oil for consumptive use on the premises where stored; (3) residential septic tanks; (4) pipelines regulated under the Natural Gas Pipeline Act of 1968; or (5) surface impoundments, pits, ponds, lagoons, or basins. Sets forth notification requirements applicable to any person who, during the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which this title was enacted, has supplied any hazardous substance to 100 or more sites where there is an underground storage tank which is or has been used for the storage of any hazardous substance. Requires such persons to notify a designated State or local agency of the existence of any such tank located at such a site. Directs the Administrator, within eight months after the enactment date of this Act, to promulgate regulations (taking into account the effect on small business) regarding the providing of notice to obtain information concerning any such tanks which are not located at such sites. Requires that the notice required of such persons supplying hazardous substances to 100 or more sites where such tanks are located be provided within 12 months after the enactment of this Act. Requires that the notice required with respect to all other sites where such tanks are located be provided within 12 months after the promulgation of such regulations. Requires that specified information be contained in those notices required of the suppliers to 100 or more sites and in those notices required of owners or operators which install or bring into use an underground storage tank after the enactment of this Act. Sets forth other information requirements for notices required of the suppliers to 100 or more sites, and for notices required pursuant to regulations for tanks at other sites, in the case of any such tank used for such storage prior to the enactment of this Act but taken out of operation before such enactment date (but after January 1, 1974). Provides that notice shall not be required under this title in the case of any tank for which notice was given pursuant to specified provisions of CERCLA. Requires any owner or operator which installs or brings into use an underground storage tank after the enactment of this Act to notify the designated State or local agency within a specified period. Directs the Governor of each State, within 90 days of such enactment date, to designate the appropriate State or local agencies to receive such notifications. Directs the Administrator, within 180 days of such enactment date and in consultation with designated State and local officials, to prescribe in greater detail the form and content of such notifications. Provides that, if a Governor chooses not to designate a State or local agency for such purpose, such notifications shall be submitted to the Administrator. Requires the State, if such notifications are submitted to a designated State or local agency, to compile the submitted information into a comprehensive inventory and furnish such inventory to the Administrator within 18 months of such enactment date. Sets forth provisions for release detection, prevention, and correction regulations applicable to all owners and operators of underground storage tanks used for storing hazardous substances. Directs the Administrator, within nine months after the enactment of this Act, to complete a survey of underground storage tanks used for the storage of hazardous substances, including an assessment of specified factors relating to the likelihood of releases from such tanks. Directs the Administrator to promulgate such regulations after opportunity for public comment and within 27 months after enactment of this Act. Requires that such regulations include requirements respecting specified areas, including: (1) leak detection or inventory systems and tank testing; (2) records of such testing, inventory, or detection; (3) reporting releases and corrective actions; (4) standards of performance for new underground tanks, including specified requirements; (5) corrective actions (including appropriate testing of potentially contaminated drinking water); (6) closure to prevent future release; and (7) evidence of financial responsibility for taking corrective action and for bodily injury and property damage to third parties. Directs the Administrator to take specified factors into consideration in issuing such regulations. Prohibits, until the effective date of such regulations and after 180 days from the enactment of this Act, any person from installing or beginning to use an underground storage tank to store hazardous substances unless such tank is cathodically protected against corrosion, constructed of a noncorrosive material, or contained in a manner designed to prevent the release into the environment of any stored hazardous substances. Sets forth provisions for the Administrator's review and approval of State programs for underground storage tank release detection, prevention, and correction. Requires the State to demonstrate that the State program is equivalent to the Federal program under this title and that it provides for adequate enforcement of compliance with program requirements. Requires that a State's new tank standards be no less stringent than the performance standards promulgated by the Administrator pursuant to this title. Provides for notice and opportunity for public comment before determinations concerning approval of State programs are made. Gives States with approved programs primary enforcement responsibility for requirements related to control of underground storage tanks used to store hazardous substances. Provides for withdrawal of approval upon the Administrator's determination, after public hearing, that a State is not administering and enforcing the program in accordance with specified requirements. Sets forth provisions relating to inspections, monitoring, and testing. Sets forth provisions for confidentiality of information, and criminal penalties for violations of such confidentiality. Requires that all information reported to, or otherwise obtained by, the EPA under this Act be made available, upon written request, to any duly authorized committee of the Congress. Sets forth provisions for Federal enforcement of requirements under this Act. Sets forth civil penalties for specified violations. Makes requirements under this Act applicable to Federal facilities. Authorizes the President to grant exemptions from such requirements upon determination that it is in the paramount interest of the United States to do so. Requires the President to report annually to Congress on such exemptions and the reasons for granting them. Provides that nothing in this Act shall preclude or deny any State or local authority to regulate more stringently underground storage tanks used to store hazardous substances. Directs the Administrator, within 36 months after the enactment of this title, to study the following underground storage tanks exempted under the definition of \"underground storage tanks\": (1) farm or residential tanks of 1,100 gallons or less capacity used for storing motor fuel for noncommercial purposes; and (2) tanks used for storing heating oil for consumptive use on the premises where stored. Requires that such study include estimates of the number and location of such tanks and an analysis of the extent to which there may be releases or threatened releases from such tanks into the environment. Directs the Administrator to report to the President and the Congress on the results of the study, with recommendations as to whether or not such tanks should be subject to regulation under this title. Title IV: Amendments of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the environmental tax on petroleum from 0.79 cent to 4.5 cents a barrel, effective October 1, 1985. Extends the period before such tax is terminated until September 30, 1990. Repeals specified CERCLA sunset provisions relating to expiration of the authority conferred by CERCLA to collect environmental taxes. Repeals specified provisions of the Hazardous Substance Response Revenue Act of 1980 relating to the Post-Closure Tax and Trust Fund, and the amendments made by such provisions. Repeals specified CERCLA provisions relating to the Post-Closure Liability Fund. Requires that all sums credited to the Post-Closure Liability Trust Fund established under the Hazardous Substance Response Revenue Act of 1980 which have not been obligated prior to the date of enactment of this title shall be refunded to the persons who paid taxes under specified provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Requires that such funds be made on a ratable basis in proportion to the total amount of such taxes which were paid by each such person. Adds provisions for a waste end tax, effective January 1, 1987, to Internal Revenue Code provisions for environmental taxes. Imposes such waste end tax on the disposal of any hazardous substance, if such disposal is required to be carried out in compliance with hazardous waste management provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Sets the amount of such waste end tax in the case of: (1) any hazardous substance for which there is in effect under specified CERCLA regulations a reportable quantity of one pound or less, at $15 for each metric ton disposed of by underground injection and $30 for each metric ton not disposed of by such method; (2) all hazardous substances for which there is in effect under specified CERCLA regulations a reportable quantity of more than one pound, at $5 for each metric ton disposed of by underground injection and $10 for each metric ton not disposed of by such method. Provides that, in the cases of mixtures of hazardous substances with reportable quantities of one pound or less and those with reportable quantities more than one pound, the entire mixture shall be deemed to have a reportable quantity of one pound or less. Requires the owner or operator of the facility to pay such waste end tax with respect to the disposal of any hazardous substance at a facility for which a permit is in effect under the hazardous waste management provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Requires the person disposing of the hazardous substance to pay such waste end tax with respect to any other disposal of any hazardous substance. Provides that such waste end tax shall not apply after September 30, 1990. Sets forth exemptions from such waste end tax.
