    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to impose additional procedural requirements for the interception of communications where surreptitious entry is required. Requires the application for an order to state why other means of effecting the interception appear unlikely to succeed, or are too dangerous or impracticable. Requires the court to determine whether surreptitious entry reasonably appears to be required and, if so, to specifically authorize such entry. Allows the interception of communications without a court order in emergency situations involving immediate danger of death or serious injury to any person (current law limits it to conspiracies involving national security or organized crime). Directs an authorizing judge to report orders approving surreptitious entries to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts."
