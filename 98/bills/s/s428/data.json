Directs the Academies to: (1) solicit views of private industry and examine evidence of current industrial initiatives; (2) assess the economic benefit to be gained from each technology; (3) assess government efforts in technological development; (4) summarize existing and projected levels of research and development activity by private industry for each technology; (5) determine current levels of research and development by foreign nations and their competitive strategies; and (6) consider the potential and feasibility of U.S. industry developing a competitive posture in each technology. Directs the Academy to develop a technology development program for each technology designated as economically strategic and to establish an advisory committee to make recommendations for each such program. Sets forth the desired recommendations, including: (1) participants for each program; (2) program responsibilities; (3) levels of effort and financial commitment for each program and participant; and (4) a timetable. Requires a committee set up under the agreement to make interim and annual reports to the President and the appropriate congressional committees on each program and to make a final report within three years. Authorizes appropriations."
