Requires that programs under this Act be administered within the Department of Health and Human Services (currently they may be delegated to other Federal departments and agencies). Prohibits any transfer of such administration outside of the Department. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to continue the administration of grants through the Administration for Native Americans (the Administration). Requires the Commissioner of such Administration to delegate all functions within the Administration. Restricts the delegation and redelegation of functions by the Secretary to personnel within the Department. Permits interagency funding agreements between the Administration and other Federal agencies. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1987. Specifies the percentage of appropriated funds which shall be used for financial assistance under this Act."
