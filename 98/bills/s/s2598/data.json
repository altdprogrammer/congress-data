Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire lands within the Indian Mounds and Upland Island Wilderness Areas owned by Temple-Eastex Incorporated by exchange. Requires the Secretary to terminate any existing timber sales contracts within the boundaries of the Indian Mounds, Upland Island, and Little Lake Creek Wilderness Areas without cost to the buyer. Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Texas shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Texas which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending revision of initial forest management plans. Releases lands in Texas reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Texas without express congressional authorization."
