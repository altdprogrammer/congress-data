    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Amends the District of Columbia Retirement Reform Act to revise provisions concerning the reduction in the Federal contribution for excess costs of police officers and fire fighters' disability retirement. Directs an enrolled actuary, with respect to the District of Columbia Police Officers and Fire Fighters' Retirement Fund, to annually: (1) determine the disability retirement rate for the preceding year; and (2) determine if such disability retirement rate for the preceding year is greater than eight-tenths of a percentage point. Provides that in determining such rate, the numerator shall be the number of police and fire fighters retiring on disability in a year who were hired on or before February 14, 1980, and the denominator shall be the total number of police and fire fighters active during such year. Directs the actuary to report the determination to the District of Columbia Retirement Board and the Comptroller General of the United States, and directs the Board and the Comptroller to transmit copies to the House, the Senate, the Mayor of the District, and the Council of the District of Columbia. Directs the Comptroller General to make a determination as to the amount, if any, by which Federal funding of the Fund should be reduced. Requires funding to be reduced for any year in which the Comptroller General finds that the disability retirement rate for the preceding calendar year is greater than eight-tenths of a percentage point. Provides that the reduction shall be one and one-half percent for each whole tenth of a percentage point by which the disability retirement rate is greater than eight- tenths of a percentage point. Provides that there shall be no reduction if there were less than eight disability retirements in a year among police and fire fighters who were employed as such on or before February 14, 1980. Provides that if the Board determines that unordinary events, such as a fire or civil disorder, caused a significant number of disability retirements, it shall report on such events to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Comptroller General. Requires FEMA to review the Board's report and submit copies of its assessment to the Comptroller General, the Board, the House, the Senate, and the Mayor and the Council of the District of Columbia. Directs the Comptroller General to determine the extent to which the unordinary event caused or contributed to a reduction in the amount appropriated to the Fund. Authorizes appropriations of any amounts necessary to cover any reduction to the Fund caused by the increased retirements due to the unordinary events."
