    "text": "Balanced Budget Procedures Act of 1984 - States that if the total outlays set forth for FY 1989 would exceed the total revenues set forth for such fiscal year under conditions of high employment in any budget submitted by the President for FY 1985 through 1988, then the President shall submit along with such budget an alternative budget in which total outlays for FY 1989 would not exceed total revenues for such fiscal year under conditions of high employment. Requires the President, when such an alternative budget is submitted, to submit recommendations and proposals for changes in Federal laws which would be required in order to achieve such a balance. Requires the Budget Committees of each House, not later than April 15 before each fiscal year from FY 1985 through 1989, to report: (1) a first concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal year in which total outlays and total revenues for FY 1989 would be in balance under conditions of high employment; or (2) an alternative concurrent resolution in equal detail. Requires that any presidential budget for a fiscal year that assumes conditions of high employment and recommends that total outlays exceed total revenues be accompanied by an alternative budget in which total outlays do not exceed total revenues. Requires that any presidential budget which assumes that conditions of high employment will not exist during a given fiscal year, and recommends that total outlays exceed total revenues by a certain amount for such fiscal year, be accompanied by an alternative budget in which total outlays would not exceed total revenues under conditions of high employment. Requires the President, not later than March 15 of any year in which an alternative budget is submitted, to submit recommendations and proposals for changes in Federal laws which will, if enacted, reduce the amount by which total outlays exceed total revenues for such fiscal year. Establishes a National Bipartisan Commission on the Balanced Budget to review the budget and alternative budget and make recommendations for levels of spending and changes in the laws of the United States which may be necessary to achieve a balanced budget by FY 1989. Requires the Commission to report to the President and Congress not later than March 15, 1985, its findings, conclusions, and recommendations for such levels of spending, legislation, and administrative actions as it considers appropriate. Terminates the Commission 30 days after it submits its report. Exempts the budget from the requirements of this Act for any fiscal year for which a declaration of war by the Congress is in effect."
