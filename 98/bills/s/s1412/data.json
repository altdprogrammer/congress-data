    "text": "Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (\"Superfund\") to authorize community relocation and business and employee protection in cases of toxic substance contamination. Includes under the term \"remove\" or \"removal\" the permanent relocation of residents, businesses, and community facilities, in those circumstances where temporary relocation or evacuation is the appropriate response and permanent relocation may be an appropriate remedy. Provides that such term may also include, in the case of a business located in an area of evacuation or relocation, the payment of those installments of principal and interest on business debt which accrue between the date of evacuation or temporary relocation and 30 days following the date that permanent relocation is actually accomplished or, if permanent relocation is formally rejected as the appropriate response, the date on which evacuation or temporary relocation ceases. Provides that such term may also include, in the case of an individual unemployed as a result of such evacuation or relocation, specified types of assistance authorized under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974."
