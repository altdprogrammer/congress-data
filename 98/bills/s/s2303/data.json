Revises block grant allocation provisions to provide States with a minimum allotment equal to FY 1984 levels, and to allocate appropriations in excess of such amounts based on population and per capita income. Permits direct grant payments to Indian tribes or tribal organizations. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for an independent review (by a nongovernmental entity) of block grant distributions to determine whether a more equitable formula can be devised. Requires: (1) consultation with State and local officials; and (2) a report to Congress by October 1, 1986. Requires participating States to: (1) use 75 percent of post FY 1984 grants for prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation projects; (2) make funds available for local mental health centers through FY 1987; and (3) use specified funds for alcohol and drug abuse services for women, and for mental health services for severely disturbed children and adolescents, and for mental health services to underserved areas or populations. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees regarding such youth and women's services. Authorizes States to use funds to establish: (1) comprehensive mental health plans; and (2) mental health services planning councils to service as advocates for the mentally ill, and to monitor such mental health plans. Revises existing block grant audit provisions to: (1) make audits biennial (currently annual); (2) permit a single financial and compliance audit of each entity; and (3) require that audit reports be made available to the Secretary, the State legislature, and to the public (currently only to the Secretary). Requires the Secretary to work with appropriate national organizations to develop model data collection criteria. Authorizes community mental health centers to use block grant funds to provide psychosocial rehabilitation services. Directs the Secretary: (1) acting through the Administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration, to provide technical assistance for States and public and nonprofit entities receiving alcohol, drug abuse, and mental health services block grant funds; and (2) to perform related data collection. Title II: Amendments to Title V of the Public Health Service Act - Replaces the existing National Panel on Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health with an Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Advisory Board. Directs such Board to assess the national needs for alcoholism, drug abuse, and mental health services and the extent to which such needs are being met by State, local, and private programs and programs under title V and part B of title XIX of such Act. Requires an annual report to the appropriate congressional committees. Sets forth related membership and operating provisions, including the use of consultants. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration, to make grants to schools of social work and of the health professions for training in the identification and treatment of alcohol and drug abuse. Retitles the Associate Director of Minority Concerns as the Associate Director for Special Populations. Includes women among the priority populations. Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the National Institute of Mental Health, to make grants for mental health services demonstration projects, including research. Limits such grants to three years, unless extended by the Secretary. Authorizes FY 1985 through 1987 appropriations. Authorizes grants for comprehensive mental health plans. Authorizes FY 1985 and 1986 appropriations for the National Institute of Drug Abuse and the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Includes research on the effects of alcohol and drug abuse upon women among such Institutes' priority projects. Requires the Secretary, acting through such Institutes, to prepare alcohol and drug abuse public service television announcements. Authorizes the Secretary, acting through such Institutes, to make alcohol and drug abuse demonstration project grants. Limits such grants to three years. Requires the Secretary to submit a comprehensive alcohol abuse and alcoholism prevention plan to Congress by October 1, 1985. Requires such report to include: (1) a model program; (2) an analysis of the social and economic costs of alcoholism and alcohol abuse; (3) an assessment of existing treatment and rehabilitation needs, and related personnel needs; (4) a statement of specific goals and objectives; and (5) estimates of public and private resources. Title III: Other Amendments - Amends the definition of \"detoxification treatment\" under the Controlled Substances Act to increase the maximum number of treatment days from 21 to 180. Requires the Secretary to promulgate related implementing regulations within 90 days. Repeals title III of the Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act. Amends the Public Health Service Act to require that members be appointed to the National Advisory Council on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism who have an expertise in the fields of alcoholism and alcohol abuse prevention, research, and treatment."
