    "date": "1983-04-07", 
    "text": "International Telecommunications Act of 1983 - Title I: General - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to create a new title dealing with international telecommunications. Declares that it is U.S. policy to rely upon marketplace competition and the private sector to provide international telecommunications services, to reduce unnecessary regulations, and to encourage entry by new carriers into the international communications marketplace. Sets forth the U.S. policy to promote the deregulation of the resale or shared use of any international telecommunications service and to promote the interconnection of international telecommunications facilities based upon the cost of providing such facilities. Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deregulate international telecommunications services or carriers as competition develops, unless the deregulation may result in a significant adverse impact upon the national defense and security or emergency preparedness or upon the competitiveness of U.S. businesses with foreign competitors. Directs the FCC to publish a list of those international telecommunications services which are regulated by the FCC on the date of enactment of this title. Authorizes the FCC to classify or reclassify as a regulated international telecommunications service any service or facilities where the FCC determines that: (1) such service or facilities are not subject to effective competition; (2) Federal regulation of such services is required to accomplish the purposes of the new title; and (3) the benefits of such regulation outweigh the costs. Sets forth the factors the FCC shall consider in making such determination. Requires each international telecommunications service which is being provided under tariff on the date of enactment to continue to be provided under tariff for at least one year. Directs the FCC to determine which of such services must continue to be regulated. Directs the FCC to review biennially any determination that such a service must be regulated. Requires every telecommunications carrier to establish, upon reasonable request, interconnection of its regulated service or facilities with: (1) a telecommunications carrier; (2) a telecommunications facility or private or Government telecommunications system; and (3) any customer premises equipment which is owned or leased by a customer of such carrier. Prohibits the charges for such interconnection from being imposed in a discriminatory manner. Requires such charges to be based on the cost of the services or facilities provided for such interconnection. Requires that telecommunications carriers which provide both international telecommunications and domestic telecommunications treat the two operations as separate entities for purposes of interconnection requirements. Requires such carriers which provide interconnection between their domestic and international operations to provide other carriers with interconnection of equal quality and at the same rates. Sets forth the maximum penalty for violations of the interconnection requirements. Authorizes the FCC to vacate or modify any international telecommunications service contract between or among U.S. carriers which is entered into after enactment of this title and is filed with the FCC if the contract: (1) is not consistent with this Act; or (2) unjustly or unreasonably discriminates against any carrier. Authorizes the FCC to declare unlawful any international telecommunications service contract between U.S. and foreign carriers or any practice required by such a contract if the FCC finds that the contract or practice violates this Act. Authorizes the FCC, in consultation with affected U.S. carriers and appropriate Federal agencies, to assess U.S. carriers' proposals for the construction and utilization of international telecommunications facilities. Authorizes the FCC or any of the FCC Commissioners to meet, under specified conditions, to exchange information with representatives of foreign telecommunications entities. Declares that it is lawful for U.S. carriers to meet with foreign telecommunications carriers to plan international facilities. Does not exempt such carriers from the antitrust laws if an action taken by such carriers would be an antitrust violation when taken by a single carrier. Title II: International Telecommunications - International Telecommunications and Information Coordination Act of 1983 - Establishes, within the Executive Office of the President, the Office of the Special Representative for Telecommunications and Information. Provides for the appointment of the Special Representative and a Deputy Special Representative by the President, with the consent of the Senate. Requires the Special Representative to: (1) be the chief representative of the United States at international telecommunications and information conferences; (2) advise the President and Congress on international telecommunications and information policies and coordinate executive branch development of such policies; (3) report to Congress on such conferences and policies; and (4) chair the International Telecommunciations and Information Task Force. Requires the Deputy Special Representative to coordinate telecommunications and information policymaking in the executive branch as directed. Authorizes appropriations. Establishes for three years an International Telecommunications and Information Task Force (Task Force) to be the principal coordinating body for the development of U.S. telecommunications and information policies. Authorizes the President to extend the existence of the Task Force for another three years. Directs the Task Force to: (1) recommend to the Special Representative procedures for coordinating policies of all Federal agencies involving international telecommunications and information; (2) review all significant policy determinations and statements of Federal agencies relating to international telecommunications and information (except for the rulemaking and adjudicating provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act); and (3) study and report to Congress within 180 days on the feasibility and desirability of alternatives to the International Telecommunications Union. Directs the Task Force to make recommendations to appropriate Federal agencies, congressional committees, and the President in accordance with the findings of the review. Requires the Task Force to make recommendations and reports regularly to the President and Congress. Transfers the functions of the Departments of State and Commerce relating to international telecommunications and information to the Office of the Special Representative. Transfers certain presidential advisory functions of the Director of the International Communications Agency to the Task Force. Authorizes the Task Force to utilize the services, personnel, and facilities of other Federal agencies and to accept voluntary uncompensated services to carry out its functions under this Act. Directs the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of State to designate personnel to serve as staff to the Task Force. Directs the Task Force to establish an Advisory Committee on International Telecommunications and Information to provide overall policy guidance to the Task Force. Requires the Task Force to consult with the Committee before approving any statement of new U.S. policy relating to international telecommunications and information. Requires the Task Force to adopt procedures for consulting with the Committee on a continuing and timely basis. Title III: Miscellaneous - States that the provisions of this Act shall apply only to the provision of international telecommunications services or facilities. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to collect information on the international economic competition facing U.S. carriers and telecommunications equipment suppliers and to report such information to Congress on a periodic basis. Amends the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 to declare that it is not the intent of Congress to preclude the creation of additional domestic and international communications satellite systems if such other systems will serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. Repeals the power of the FCC to authorize stock offerings of the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT). Allows COMSAT to be incorporated in jurisdictions other than the District of Columbia. Abolishes the position of presidentially appointed directors. Authorizes COMSAT to issue stock with or without par value. Authorizes any COMSAT stockholders of record to inspect and copy COMSAT's record of shareholders. Authorizes COMSAT to provide international services directly to the public, provided that the FCC may require that such common carrier services be provided by a fully separate corporate subsidiary of COMSAT upon determining that such action is required by the public interest, convenience, and necessity. Authorizes the FCC to permit the persons who will best serve the public interest to construct and operate satellite terminal stations. Directs the FCC to authorize users and entities other than authorized carriers to acquire channels in the communications satellite system directly from COMSAT whenever it will serve the public interest. Directs the President, through the Special Representative for Telecommunications and Information, to supervise and instruct COMSAT in its activities with foreign governments, international entities, and the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization as necessary to ensure that such activities are consistent with the national interest and U.S. foreign policy. Authorizes the FCC to issue instructions to COMSAT on regulatory matters within the FCC's jurisdiction. Gives precedence to presidential instructions that conflict with FCC instructions. Establishes within the Department of State an Assistant Secretary of State for Telecommunications Affairs to help formulate and implement a policy regarding foreign economic matters in telecommunications. Permits the President to establish a plan to ensure the availability, continuity, and prompt initiation or restoration of telecommunications services to meet national defense and emergency preparedness needs. Authorizes the President to request carriers to meet to assure the establishment and maintenance of networks of telecommunications services and facilities adequate for such needs. Directs the President to appoint an advisory council to study Federal telecommunications management for national security and emergency preparedness to ensure that the United States shall have a technologically advanced and economically viable telecommunications industry for the purposes of national defense and economic development."
