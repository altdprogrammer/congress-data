    "text": "Tonnage Measurement of Vessels Act - Requires applicable vessels to be measured by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating in accordance with the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969 (Convention) and this Act. Directs the Secretary to issue such vessels an International Tonnage Certificate (1969) upon completion of the measurement. Provides that such vessels may also be measured and issued regulatory tonnages under other provisions of law. Allows the Secretary to authorize the American Bureau of Shipping, other private entity, or another party to the Convention to measure vessels and issue certificates as provided under this Act. Requires the Secretary to accept the tonnage and certificate of vessels of any country that complies with or approximates the provisions of the Convention. Authorizes the Secretary to inspect any vessel to verify compliance with such provisions. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act. Amends the Revised Statutes to remove the limitation on measuring to those vessels which engage in international voyages. Removes the prohibition against collecting or charging fees for the measurement of vessels."
