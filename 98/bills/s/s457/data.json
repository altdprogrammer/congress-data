Rept. 98-339) Amends the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 to provide for management of horse and burro lands and their habitat in accordance with resource management objectives for the area developed in land use planning. Requires regulatory establishment of adoption fees that both discourage adoption for commercial gain and allow a viable adoption program. Authorizes the limited Federal sale of a certain number of animals for FY 1984-1987. Provides for the the granting, without cost, of title to unadoptable excess horses and burros to qualified animal protection entities prior to sale. Permits the appointment of Federal or State employees to the joint advisory board. Changes from \"willful\" to \"knowing\" the state of mind standard for criminal offenses with respect to wild free-roaming horses and burros. Increases penalties for second offenses. Authorizes use of helicopters and motor vehicles in the removal of the animals from land under the administration of other Federal Agencies. Requires annual (currently, biennial) joint reports to certain congressional committees by the Secretaries of Agriculture and of the Interior on the administration of this Act."
