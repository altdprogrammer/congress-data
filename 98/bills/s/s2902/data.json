Prohibits the Secretary from operating the Eurika Lock and Dam in a manner which would cause any new flooding of surrounding land. Allows the Secretary, until any land within the project is needed for navigational purposes, to lease such land for recreation, fish or wildlife, or agricultural purposes. Prohibits the obligation of funds appropriated for construction of the project until an environmental impact statement concerning such construction has been completed. Requires the United States to defend any legal proceedings brought against lands or interests held in the right-of-way for the Cross Florida Barge Canal. Authorizes appropriations."
