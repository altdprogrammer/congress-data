Directs the FCC to renew a broadcast station's license if the station has not seriously violated the Communications Act and, with respect to television stations, the licensee has substantially met the needs of residents of its service area. Prohibits the FCC, when acting on a license renewal application, from considering the license application of another person for the same facilities. Directs the FCC, consistent with sound spectrum management, to encourage the introduction of new and additional services. Allows any person to file with the FCC a petition to establish, or an application to offer, such a service. Direct the FCC: (1) within one year, to determine whether such proposed service is in the public interest; and (2) to presume that such proposed service is in the public interest if it is technically feasible without causing significant technical degradation to, or interference with, radio transmissions by other licensees. Sets forth a schedule of fees to be charged by the FCC for specified administrative services. Authorizes the FCC to increase or decrease the charges annually. Authorizes the FCC to impose penalty fees and to waive fee payments. Requires the moneys collected from these fees to be placed in the Treasury for use by the FCC. Limits the amount collected from the fees to 50 percent of the amount authorized to be appropriated to the FCC."
