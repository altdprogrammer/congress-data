Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to review and report to specified congressional committees on the Department of Agriculture policies, practices, and regulations regarding livestock grazing in national forest wilderness areas in Arizona. Requires the Secretary to determine the suitability of the following lands in the Coronado National Forest for preservation as wilderness and to submit recommendations to the President: (1) the Bunk Robinson Peak Wilderness Study Area; (2) the Whitmire Canyon Wilderness Study Area; and (3) the Mount Graham Wilderness Study Area. Provides that the President shall submit recommendations with respect to such areas to Congress by January 1, 1986.

Provides that areas in Arizona reviewed in the final environmental statement (and Arizona national forest system roadless lands of less than 5,000 acres) which were not designated wilderness or wilderness study shall be managed for multiple use. Provides that in the event that revised land management plans in Arizona are implemented, areas not recommeded for wilderness designation need not be managed to protect such designation prior to or during plan revision, and areas recommended for wilderness designation shall be managed to protect such designation. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless areas review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Arizona without express congressional authorization. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate a portion of the Verde River in Arizona as a component of the national wild and scenic rivers system.
