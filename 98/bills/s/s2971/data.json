    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-09-06", 
    "text": "Labor Trusteeships and Fiduciary Amendments Act of 1984 - Title I: Trusteeship Investigations - Amends the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 to direct the Secretary of Labor to bring a civil action in Federal district court if after investigation the Secretary finds probable cause to believe a labor organization has violated such Act. (Removes the requirement that such an investigation be in response to a member's written complaint.) Conditions the validity of a labor organization trusteeship upon the holding of a fair hearing regarding the establishment of such trusteeship. Requires certification by a body duly authorized by the labor organization that such hearing was fair and in conformity with the organization's constitution and by-laws. (Removes the current initial 18-month presumption of validity for such a trusteeship.) Title II: Removal Procedures - Permits the Secretary to find that a labor organization's removal procedures have not been followed, thus allowing an officer's removal for serious misconduct by vote of the organization membership. (Currently, the Secretary is restricted in such a situation to finding no more than whether the organization has adequate removal procedures in its constitution and by-laws.) Title III: Provisions Relating to the Fiduciary Responsibility of Officers of Labor Organizations - Authorizes a labor organization member to sue an organization fiduciary in Federal district court for: (1) the restoration of profits made through the misuse of organization assets; and (2) removal of such fiduciary. Exempts fiduciaries from any liability for breaches committed outside the period of service as a fiduciary. Authorizes the Secretary to bring a civil action to enforce the fiduciary provisions of such Act. (Currently, only a labor organization or its governing board may bring such a suit.)"
