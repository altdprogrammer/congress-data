    "text": "Amends the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a voluntary on-farm salinity control program in cooperation with private landowners to reduce watershed erosion on both non-Federal and Department of Agriculture lands in order to protect the water quality of the Colorado River. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) identify salt sources; (2) reduce salt levels through improved farm irrigation and watershed management practices; (3) provide technical, monitoring, and cost-sharing assistance; and (4) carry out research, demonstration, and education activities. Requires the Secretary to describe proposed measures in reports to the appropriate congressional committees, the Advisory Council, and the Governor of any affected State. Prohibits fund expenditures until 60 days after any such report is filed. Authorizes the Secretary to use Department of Agriculture agencies, including the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), or to authorize participating agencies to make grants or enter into contracts, to carry out such program. Authorizes appropriations. Prohibits the CCC from making any disbursements unless such amounts are covered in advance by appropriations Acts. Requires a program report to Congress by January 1, 1988, and at five-year intervals thereafter."
