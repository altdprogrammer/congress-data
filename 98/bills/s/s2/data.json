    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-01-26", 
    "text": "Employment Opportunities for Older Americans Act of 1983 - Title I: Amendments to Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 - Amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to eliminate the upper age limitation (70 years of age) of the class of persons to whom such Act applies. Repeals specified provisions allowing mandatory retirement at age 65 in certain professions. Prohibits any employee benefit plan from requiring or permitting the suspension of an employee's benefit accrual because of age before accruing the maximum normal retirement benefit. Title II: Pension Accrual for Older Workers - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit specified types of plans under such Acts from suspending or reducing the rate of an employee's benefit accrual or employer contributions to the employee's account solely because of age. Revises ERISA to prohibit an employer from withholding plan benefits because of any increase in the income of the participant due to employment for less than 1,000 hours during a calendar year. Title III: Further Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include low-income older workers (who are members of economically disadvantaged families and who are at least 65 years of age) as members of targeted groups for purposes of the tax credit for employment of certain new employees. Provides for a tax credit for certain older workers. Allows a tax credit for individuals 62 years of age and older by an applicable percentage of the amount by which old-age benefits otherwise payable to such individuals are reduced on account of income from work by such individual. Reduces the rates of the employment (FICA) taxes on employees and on employers by one-half in the case of workers 65 years of age or older. Makes similar reductions in the case of older workers in the rates of Railroad Retirement Act taxes on employees, employee representatives, and employers. Title IV: Amendments to the Social Security Act - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Benefits) of the Social Security Act to revise formulas relating to the reduction of old age insurance benefit amounts for early retirees. Provides for a graduated increase in old age insurance benefits for individuals who delay retirement until after they reach or exceed age 65. Title V: Amendments to the National Apprenticeship Act - Amends the National Apprenticeship Act to direct the Secretary to ensure that no program of apprenticeship discriminates because of age against any individual in admission or employment."
