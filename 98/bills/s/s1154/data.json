Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 through 1986. Bases State allotments on specified categories of unemployed persons. Permits reallotment of unused funds among States. Permits States to charge participants (premiums and deductibles) up to five percent of their unemployment compensation. Requires participating States to submit an annual application, with required public hearings on funds use and distribution after the first year of participation. Permits States to design such health programs but specifies certain program requirements. Requires an annual report to the Secretary. Provides grants to hospitals and health care facilities serving medically underserved populations or areas of high unemployment. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1986. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress regarding participating facilities by December 31, 1984. Requires private and public employer-provided health plans to contain an open enrollment period of at least 30 days for spouses of unemployed workers. Exempts from such requirement plans of employers who employ less than 25 employees. Provides civil penalties for noncompliance and specified PHSA fund-cutoffs for State noncompliance."
