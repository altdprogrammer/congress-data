Defines \"adoption expense plan\" as a written plan of an employer to reimburse employees for adoption expenses. Allows an individual income tax deduction for adoption expenses not to exceed $1,500, or $2,000 in the case of a child with special needs. Treats employer contributions to an adoption expense plan as a deductible business expense."
