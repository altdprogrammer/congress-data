    "text": "Bus Regulatory Reform Act Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Interstate Commerce Act to revise procedures for the discontinuance of bus transportation in a State. Repeals provisions which prohibit a State or political subdivision from enacting or enforcing any law relating to the discontinuance of bus service under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Requires the Commission to consult with a State before issuing a certificate authorizing a person to provide bus transportation in such State. Makes it Federal transportation policy to coordinate State and Federal regulatory actions to ensure the provision of bus service to rural communities which have no other means of public transportation. States that the Commission does not have authority over certain reduced levels of service in intrastate transportation. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Interstate Commerce Commission and the States should work cooperatively to ensure the preservation of bus service in areas threatened with the total loss of public transportation."
