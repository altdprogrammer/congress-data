Requires the Secretary of the Interior to convey all Federal mineral interests in the lands to which the reversionary interest applied if the University applies for acquisition of such interests. Prescribes the procedure under which the mineral interests shall be conveyed to the University. Prohibits surface occupancy for the development of the mineral interests if such occupancy would interfere with intended surface uses of the land."
