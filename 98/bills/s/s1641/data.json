Prohibits any person in the executive branch who has authority affecting such appointment from inquiring about such candidate's political affiliation. Requires an appointing authority to: (1) nullify the appointment of all members of any scientific advisory body to which a candidate is appointed or denied appointment because of his or her political affiliation; and (2) appoint new members without regard to political affiliation. Authorizes any person to commence a civil action in a U.S. district court, regardless of the amount in controversy, against any Federal agency whose employee is alleged to have violated this Act. Permits a court to award litigation costs to any party to such action."
