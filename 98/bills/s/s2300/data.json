Allows such a contract to provide that performance during the second or any subsequent year is contingent on the appropriation of funds for that year and that a cancellation charge shall be paid to the contractor if performance is cancelled. Requires cancellation of contract performance if no appropriations are available for the contract during the second or subsequent year of the contract period."
