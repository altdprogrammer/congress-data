    "text": "Major League Baseball Community Protection Act - Requires the owner of a major league baseball franchise to provide the appropriate local government authorities at least six months notice of the intent to accept a purchase offer that could result in the relocation of the franchise. Requires that an arbitration board be appointed within 30 days after such notice is provided. Allows any person, within four months after such Board is appointed, to submit to the board a purchase offer that would not result in the relocation of the franchise. Directs the board, within six months after its creation, to conduct a formal hearing on all purchase offers submitted. Prohibits the franchise owner from selling the franchise without a written commitment from the purchaser to keep the franchise in the metropolitan area if the board determines that the value of any offer not including relocation equals or exceeds the value of the original offer involving relocation. Exempts any agreement among owners of baseball franchises to abide by the relocation and arbitration procedures under this Act from application of the antitrust laws. Allows the government authority in an area from which a baseball franchise relocates in violation of this Act to bring an action in any U.S. district court for damages and equitable relief."
