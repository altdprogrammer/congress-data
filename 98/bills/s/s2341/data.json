Part C: State Assistance for Vocational Education Support Programs by Community-Based Organizations - Requires each community-based organization which desires to receive assistance under this part to prepare jointly with the appropriate eligible recipient and submit an application to the State board. Sets forth application requirements. Requires each State, from the portion of its allotment available under this part, to provide financial assistance to joint programs of eligible recipients and community-based organizations within the State to conduct special vocational services and activities. Authorizes the use of such funds for: (1) outreach programs; (2) transitional services; (3) prevocational educational preparation and basic skills development, in cooperation with businesses; (4) special prevocational preparation programs targeted for inner-city youth, non-English speaking youth, Appalachian youth, and the youth of other urban and rural areas having a high density of poverty; (5) career intern programs; (6) student needs assessment; and (7) guidance and counseling. Title II: Program for Vocational Education Opportunities - Requires each State, from the portion of its allotment available for this title, to provide vocational education services and activities to meet the special needs, and enhance the participation, of: (1) handicapped individuals; (2) disadvantaged individuals; (3) single working parents or individuals who have been primarily homemakers as adults; and (4) criminal offenders who are serving in a correctional institution. Limits the use of funds under this title for handicapped individuals to supplemental or additional staff, equipment, materials, and services not provided to other individuals in vocational education that are essential for handicapped individuals to participate in vocational education, but allows each State to use such funds for separate vocational programs for handicapped individuals if the handicapping conditions of the students require a separate program. Permits the use of funds under this title for the improvement of vocational education programs designed to provide equal access to quality vocational education to disadvantaged individuals, including the acquisition of modern machinery and tools and the costs of services and activities which apply the latest technological advances to the course of instruction. Permits use of funds under this title to make grants to eligible recipients for expanding vocational education services when this expansion directly increases the eligible recipients' capacity for providing single working parents and homemakers with marketable skills. Permits use of funds under this title to make grants to community-based organizations of demonstrated effectiveness for the provision of vocational education services to single parents and homemakers. Permits use of funds under this title for programs for single parents and homemakers, including basic literacy instruction, educational materials for marketable skills, and assistance with child care, transportation, or scheduling to make such programs more accessible. Permits use of funds under this title for basic skills instruction for specified groups with special needs. Allows States to use funds under this title to arrange with private vocational training institutions for educational training, equipment, or services under specified circumstances. Requires that services and activities for groups with special needs under this title include, to the extent practicable, worksite programs such as cooperative vocational education, work study, and apprenticeship programs. Permits such services and activities to include placement services for students who have successfully completed vocational education programs. Distributes title II assistance as follows: (1) 25 percent for handicapped individuals; (2) 50 percent for disadvantaged individuals; (3) 23 percent for single parents and homemakers; and (4) two percent for criminal offenders in correctional institutions. Allocates the 75 percent of title II funds which shall be available for the handicapped and disadvantaged among eligible recipients on the basis of a formula which takes into account relative numbers of economically disadvantaged individuals enrolled, relative numbers of disadvantaged and handicapped students served, and increases in the numbers or percentages of handicapped and disadvantaged students proposed to be served. Provides for reductions and reallocations of such payments to eligible recipients under specified conditions. Requires each local educational agency (LEA) to use community-based organizations of demonstrated effectiveness, in addition to other eligible recipients, for the use of title II funds in areas of the State in which: (1) vocational education facilities are insufficient; (2) vocational education programs do not adequately address the needs of disadvantaged students; or (3) the LEA determines that the community-based organization can better serve disadvantaged students. Authorizes each LEA to use title II funds for the handicapped and disadvantaged for joint projects with other LEAs. Permits the State board to adopt a de minimis rule under which funds are: (1) not allocated to an eligible recipient which is eligible to receive $1,000 or less in any fiscal year; and (2) reallocated among other eligible recipients within the State. Permits such a rule whenever the State board determines that the required distribution of funds will result, with respect to such an eligible recipient, in ineffective programming and use of funds. Directs the State board to establish criteria for the distribution of the remaining 25 percent of title II funds to eligible recipients and community-based organizations of demonstrated effectiveness for purposes of the programs for single parents and homemakers and for criminal offenders in correctional institutions. Provides that nothing in this title shall be construed to require the State board to identify, separately, expenditures for disadvantaged individuals and for handicapped individuals with respect to eligible recipients within the State.

Directs the State board to establish criteria for the distribution of title III assistance among eligible recipients, giving special emphasis to economically depressed urban and rural areas and to area vocational schools serving such areas. Requires that at least 30 percent of the title III assistance for each State in each fiscal year be available only for vocational education services and activities at the secondary and postsecondary school level to train and retrain adults.
