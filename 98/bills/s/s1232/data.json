Permits, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a sale, exchange, or interchange authorized by an Act of Congress enacted after May 6, 1983. Provides that the only lands and interests in lands in the System that may be exchanged under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 are those lands and interests in lands described in this Act."
