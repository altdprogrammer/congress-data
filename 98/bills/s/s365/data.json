    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to pay an employee training to be an air traffic controller at the employee's basic pay rate for training hours exceeding 40 hours a week. Prohibits the reduction or termination of the annuity or retired or retainer pay of a civil service annuitant or a former member of the uniformed service who is temporarily reemployed by the Department of Defense to serve as an air traffic controller or to recruit or train others to be controllers during a period when there is an unusual shortage of controllers. Permits the Secretary to pay premium pay to: (1) certain employees directly involved in the operation and maintenance of the air traffic control system; (2) specified flight test pilots; (3) certain controllers who are not required to be certified to perform duties, including the control of air traffic, but who are so certified; (4) controllers assigned to provide on-the-job training in the control of live air traffic; and (5) any controller or flight service training specialist required to work the fourth through sixth hours of an eight-hour day without a meal break. Exempts such employees from provisions limiting premium pay for Federal employees."
