Authorizes the Attorney General or the Secretary of State to determine whether an individual is entitled to a reward and the amount to be paid. Provides that a reward of $100,000 or more may not be made without the approval of the President. Allows for the protection of the identity of the recipient of a reward if it is determined that such measures are necessary. Authorizes appropriations. Makes Federal, State and local officers and employees ineligible for such payment. Requires the Attorney General and the Secretary of State to report annually to specified committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives."
