    "text": "Terminated Pensioners' Survival Act - Authorizes payment of a Federal annuity to persons (or spouses of such persons) who: (1) were participants in a private employee pension plan which was terminated before July 1, 1974; (2) had immediately before termination a nonforfeitable benefit under the plan; and (3) have not received payment in full of such benefit because of the plan's termination. Sets forth the method of computing the annuity. Directs the Secretary of Labor to approve a claim for such an annuity if the claim meets the Secretary's regulation and includes evidence establishing that the claimant is a qualified participant or a qualified spouse. Sets forth the procedure for review of denial of such an annuity claim. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make annuity payments to entitled individuals after the receipt of specified information from the Secretary of Labor. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to work with other Federal agencies to avoid unnecessary expense and duplication of functions. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require disclosure of tax return information to Labor Department employees for comparison of specified records in order to establish the validity of an annuity claim. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1982 to the Department of Labor to carry out its functions under this Act. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of the Treasury to make annuity payments under this Act beginning with FY 1982 and continuing until the last such payment is made."
