    "text": "High Technology Research and Educational Development Act of 1983 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow corporations an increased income tax deduction for charitable contributions of: (1) computer equipment, software, and related services and maintenance given to elementary and secondary schools for use in education, and (2) scientific and technical equipment given to institutions of higher education and vocational schools for use in education, research, and research training. Expands the income tax credit for increasing research expenditures to include contract research expenses for payments to universities for faculty salaries, scholarships, grants, or loans for graduate students in mathematics, engineering, or science. Excludes such contract research expenses from the calculation of base period amounts, for purposes of determining whether the taxpayer has increased expenditures for research. Provides for an income tax exclusion for the scholarships, fellowship grants, student loan forgiveness, or stipends of a graduate student in mathematics, engineering, computer science, or the physical or biological sciences. Specifies that such tax exclusion is not forfeited merely because the student is required, as a condition of the scholarship or fellowship, to perform future service in teaching or research."
