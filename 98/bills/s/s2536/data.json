    "text": "Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act) to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to undertake a study on consumptive uses of Great Lakes water. Authorizes the Administrator to conduct such study, in cooperation with other interested Federal agencies and the eight Great Lake States and their local governments, of all possible control measures which can be implemented to reduce the quantity of Great Lakes water consumed without adversely affecting the projected growth of the Great Lakes region. Requires that such study include an analysis of both existing and new technology which appears to be feasible in the foreseeable future. Requires that such study include at a minimum: (1) a review of methodologies used to forecast Great Lakes consumptive uses; (2) a discussion of environmental and economic impacts associated with various types of cooling systems for thermal electric generating plants; (3) an analysis of the effect of laws, regulations, and national policy objectives on consumptive uses of Great Lakes water used in manufacturing; (4) an analysis of the economic effects on a consuming industry and other Great Lakes interests associated with a particular consumptive use control strategy; (5) an analysis of associated environmental impacts, both singularly and in combination with other consumptive use control strategies; and (6) a summary discussion of recommendations of methods of controlling consumptive uses so as to maximize benefits to the Great Lakes ecosystem and also provide for continued full economic growth for consuming industries as well as other industries which depend on the use of Great Lakes water. Authorizes appropriations."
