    "text": "Pension Plan Reversion Moratorium Act of 1984 - Imposes a 270 day (nine month) moratorium period during which: (1) the Secretary of the Treasury shall not issue determinations regarding a pension plan termination if upon such termination the aggregate amount of reversions to the employer would exceed $1,000,000; and (2) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation shall not issue a notice of sufficiency of assets (a prerequisite to pension plan termination) if upon termination the aggregate amount of reversions to the employer would exceed $1,000,000. States that the Secretary's compliance with the moratorium shall not have the effect of triggering a declaratory judgment remedy under the Internal Revenue Code. Provides a 270 day extension of time after expiration of the moratorium for petitioners to exhaust their administrative remedies regarding pension plan qualifications under specified law. Provides a 90 day extension of time after expiration of the moratorium for filing pension plan termination notices. Exempts multiemployer pension plans from the moratorium imposed by this Act."
