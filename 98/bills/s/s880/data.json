Rept. 98-165) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from restricting the hours of operation of any AM broadcast station during the period beginning two hours before sunrise and ending two hours after sunset, unless operation during such period would interfere with the protected ground-wave signal of an existing AM station or would violate any treaty or international agreement. Prohibits the Commission from denying an application for a license to operate a new AM station or an application to expand the hours of operation of an existing station solely on the grounds that: (1) the area has adequate broadcasting service; or (2) an FM channel is available for the area. Prohibits the Commission from placing an applicant for a station license or construction permit at a disadvantage because that applicant is licensed to operate a station with restricted hours in the area, if such applicant certifies that it will relinguish the restricted license if its application is approved. Exempts any application to alter the hours of operation of a standard broadcast station from public notice and comment requirements."
