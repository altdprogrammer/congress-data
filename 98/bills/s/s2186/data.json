Provides that funds appropriated shall be made available for grants to be matched on a basis of no less than one and one-half non-Federal dollars for each Federal dollar during FY 1985 and 1986, and no less than two non-Federal dollars for each Federal dollar during FY 1987 through FY 1989. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for FY 1985 through FY 1989 which shall be made available to institutes to meet the necessary expenses for purposes of: (1) specific mineral research and demonstration projects of broad application which could not otherwise be undertaken; and (2) research into any aspects of mining and mineral resources problems related to the mission of the Department of the Interior which are not otherwise being studied. Sets forth funding criteria. Requires each institute to: (1) set forth its plan to provide for the training of individuals as mineral engineers and scientists; (2) set forth policies and procedures to assure that Federal funds made available under this Act will supplement and, to the extent practicable, increase the level of funds that would, in the absence of such Federal funds, be made available for purposes of this Act, and in no case supplant such funds; and (3) report annually to the Secretary concerning amounts received under this Act and projects undertaken pursuant to this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) prescribe necessary rules and regulations; and (2) report to Congress annually concerning the receipts, expenditures, and work of the institutes in all States under the provisions of this Act. Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed to authorize Federal control of education at any college or university. Directs the Secretary to assure that programs authorized by this Act are not redundant. Authorizes appropriations necessary to print and publish the results of activities carried out by institutes under this Act and for administrative planning and direction. Directs the Secretary to establish a center for cataloging current and projected scientific research in all fields of mining and mineral resources. Directs the President to clarify agency responsibility for Federal mining and mineral resources research and to provide interagency coordination of such research. Directs the Secretary to appoint a Committee on Mining and Mineral Resources Research to consult with and make recommendations to the Secretary on all matters relating to mining and mineral resources research as required by this Act. Requires the Committee to: (1) develop a national plan for research and development in mining and mineral resources and to formulate and recommend a program to implement the plan utilizing resources provided for under this Act; and (2) submit such plan to the Secretary, the President, and Congress by March 1, 1986, and to update the plan annually. Requires the Committee to determine the eligibility of a college or university to participate as a mining and mineral resources research institute under this Act."
