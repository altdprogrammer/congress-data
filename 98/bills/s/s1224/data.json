Directs the Secretary to allocate certain percentages of specified funds to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma and the Eastern Creeks. Directs the Secretary to: (1) distribute the funds allocated to the Muscogee in order to implement any plan or program authorized by ordinance of such Nation; and (2) hold in trust and invest for their benefit the funds allocated to the Eastern Creeks. Directs the Secretary to distribute such funds in the form of per capita payments to specified Eastern Creeks if the Eastern Creeks are not recognized as an Indian Tribe before June 30, 1985. Directs the Secretary to act on the petition for Federal recognition of the Eastern Creeks by no later than December 31, 1983, or report to Congress if no action is taken. Deems certain Eastern Creeks to be successor entities to the original Eastern Creek tribes for purposes of specified fund distributions if such entities receive Federal acknowledgement as Indian tribes before December 30, 1984. Provides for pro rata fund distribution if more than one tribal entity is recognized by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to distribute specified trust funds and judgment awards in the form of per capita payments if none of the petitioners filing for Eastern Creek status receive Federal recognition as an Indian tribe prior to December 30, 1984. Entitles certain Eastern Creek entities to file alternative distribution plans if such entities receive Federal recognition as Indian tribes prior to the distribution of certain judgment funds."
