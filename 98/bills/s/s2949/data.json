    "text": "Utah State and Federal Land Management Improvement Act of 1984 - Conveys specified Federal land to the State of Utah. Specifies conditions of such conveyance. Requires all mineral revenues received on such conveyed lands to be distributed 50 percent to the State of Utah and 50 percent to the United States. Authorizes the State share to be used as the State Legislature directs. Makes the State of Utah and the United States each responsible for the collection and distribution of mineral revenues on lands each has acquired. Requires the United States and State of Utah to submit annual reports to one another detailing the mineral activity and revenues occurring on the exchanged lands. Exempts certain lands from the mineral revenue distribution requirements. Limits the distribution of revenues received from metalliferous leases on exchanged lands to ten years after the date of conveyance. Includes in each conveyance under this Act the entire surface and subsurface estate. Provides holders of rights with the right of conversion to equivalent new rights under the laws of the acquiring entity. Maintains the rights and privileges of permits and leases for domestic livestock grazing on lands affected by the exchanges under this Act. Requires the State and the United States to assume each other's rights and duties under grazing leases and permits as existed prior to the land exchanges under this Act. Prescribes guidelines to protect valid existing claims for metalliferous minerals on exchanged lands. Extinguishes any claim which is converted under State law to a preferential, noncompetitive mineral lease, sale permit or other disposition. Authorizes the State to select Federal lands of approximately equal value elsewhere in the State if the State's title to exchanged lands is encumbered for more than 20 years after enactment of this Act. Directs the State to assume all Federal rights and responsibilities concerning Federal mineral leases on lands conveyed to it. Makes all payments formerly due to the United States payable to the State. Requires the State and Federal Government, respectively, to assume all of each other's rights and responsibilities regarding nonmetalliferous leases and contracts on exchanged lands. Conveys existing water rights, rights of way, and special use agreements with the conveyed lands. Provides for payments by the United States in lieu of taxes on State lands acquired under this Act. Amends the Utah Enabling Act to provide that lands granted for the support of common schools may be used by the State at less than fair market value for public purposes by State and local agencies. Authorizes appropriations."
