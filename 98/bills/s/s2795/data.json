Encourages States to establish such programs in accordance with specified provisions of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. Authorizes States to provide that unemployment compensation under their State unemployment compensation laws shall be paid to an individual who voluntarily leaves employment in a firm (or subdivision) experiencing a major reduction in employment, for weeks in which such individual is satisfactorily participating in approved training. Amends the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 to provide that specified provisions shall not apply to such individuals. Authorizes States to provide under their State unemployment compensation laws that an individual (including an individual who has voluntarily resigned to enter a training program) may elect, at any time during the first eight weeks of eligibility of such regular unemployment compensating payable for regular compensation, to receive an amount equal to 125 percent of the remainder in equal weekly payments over an extended period of time, if during such period the individual is satisfactorily participating in approved training. Sets a limit on the number of weeks over which the individual may choose to receive compensation. Sets forth a formula for determining the amount of remaining regular compensation for which an individual will be eligible if such individual fails to satisfactorily participate in or successfully graduates from the training program at any time after making such an election. Prohibits any individual who makes such an election from being entitled to any more compensation than would have been received if the individual had not made such election, except to the extent that such additional amount is appropriated and allocated to the State under this part. Requires States to provide that the length of an individual's benefit year under the State unemployment compensation law shall be extended by a number of weeks equal to the number of additional weeks for which such individual received unemployment compensation by reason of such an election. Requires that the amount of any extended compensation or Federal supplemental compensation to which an individual may be entitled be determined on the basis of the weekly amount of regular compensation to which an individual was entitled without regard to any such election. Requires that the determination of exhaustion of regular compensation take such election into account. Authorizes States to provide under their unemployment compensation laws that an individual who has four or more weeks of remaining eligibility for regular compensation and who accepts employment at a lower wage than that required under such State law may receive payment over the 12-month period following acceptance of such employment of an amount equal to 80 percent of the remaining regular compensation for which such individual would be eligible in the benefit year if the individual were to exhaust such eligibility. Provides that such payment shall be in periodic installments which shall be made only for so long as such individual continues such lower-paying employment (or other employment which the individual would not have been required to accept) for a continuous period. Provides that payment of such periodic payments shall terminate any eligibility for additional regular compensation and for any extended compensation or Federal supplemental compensation, during that benefit year. Authorizes appropriations for 1986 through 1988 to be alloted to States to assist them in carrying out programs authorized under this part, in addition to any other amounts authorized or allotted under the Wagner-Peyser Act. Provides that such funds may be used only for: (1) payment of additional amounts of regular compensation by reason of any extended eligibility under specified provisions of this part; and (2) reimbursement to the State for the Federal share of administrative costs incurred by the State in carrying out programs authorized under this part. Sets such Federal share at 50 percent, with a ten percent increase for each percentage point or portion thereof by which a State's average rate of total unemployment is greater than the average for all States.
