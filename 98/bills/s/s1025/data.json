    "text": "Global Resources, Environment, and Population Act of 1983 - Declares it to be the public policy to: (1) promote national population stabilization; (2) encourage other nations to achieve population stabilization; and (3) coordinate research and national planning concerning global trends in population characteristics, the availability of natural resources, and environmental change. Directs all Federal agencies to: (1) use reliable demographic research in planning and decisionmaking which affect national and global population characteristics; and (2) develop procedures to insure the consideration of population characteristics, population stabilization, and environmental, economic, and natural resource aspects in agency planning and decisionmaking. Directs each agency head to: (1) review the agency's statutory authority, policies, and regulations to determine whether there are any impediments to complying with this Act; and (2) recommend the necessary administrative or legislative actions to eliminate such impediments. Establishes an interagency Council on Global Resources, the Environment, and Population to: (1) coordinate research, conduct studies, and report to the President and Congress on trends in population characteristics; (2) assess the impact of such trends on population stabilization, the environment, and the availability of natural resources; (3) recommend legislative and administrative actions to modify or eliminate Federal programs, laws, and regulations which limit the achievement of the policies of this Act; and (4) recommend to Congress and the President a national population policy and policies to encourage global population stabilization at a level which maintains the highest possible standard of living and does not deplete the world's natural resources or degrade the global environment. Requires the President to submit to Congress, annually, a national population change and planning report which includes: (1) an evaluation of the impact that national and global trends in population characteristics, the availability of natural resources, and environmental change will have on the nation's economy and national security; and (2) recommendations for necessary legislative actions."
