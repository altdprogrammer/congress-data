    "text": "Nuclear Licensing and Regulatory Reform Act of 1983 - Title I: Licensing and Regulatory Process - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to establish procedures for centralized review by the NRC of all NRC staff proposals for backfitting requirements. Prohibits approval of a proposed backfitting requirement unless the NRC determines that it will substantially enhance the public health and safety or the common defense and security because of improved overall safety of nuclear facility operation and that such improvement in safety is justified when considered over the remaining life of the facility. Requires that an approved backfitting requirement be issued as an amendment to a permit, license, or design approval or as a rule, regulation, order, or an amendment thereof. Authorizes the NRC to issue a construction and operating license to an applicant for a commercial nuclear production or utilization facility if the NRC determines that the facility will be constructed and will operate in conformity with the application, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and NRC regulations. Requires the holder of such a license to certify to the NRC before commencing operation that the facility has been so constructed and will be so operated. Requires the NRC to publish a notice of receipt of such certification which shall provide a 30-day period for public comment. Requires NRC staff to review the certification and comments and to recommend allowing, prohibiting, or limiting facility operation. Permits the licensee to commence operation unless the NRC issues an order prohibiting limiting operation. Permits judicial review of NRC action or inaction with respect to facility operation within a specified time period. Requires the NRC to provide for onsite inspection of construction. Requires certification of the need for the power to be provided by the facility. Sets forth conditions for facility construction activities by the applicant. Sets forth procedural requirements for formal hearings in connection with proceedings under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 with respect to construction licenses and permits, operating licenses, compensation, awards, royalties, and facility designs. Authorizes the NRC to issue a site permit for approval of a site for one or more nuclear production or utilization facilities prior to the filing of an application for a construction permit or a combined construction permit and operating license for such facilities. Allows a renewal of a site permit upon application by the holder. Sets forth the conditions under which construction activities by the applicant at such a site may proceed. Authorizes the NRC to approve a design for a commercial nuclear production or utilization facility or for subsystems thereof prior to the filing of an application for a construction permit or for a construction and operating license for such facility. Allows the renewal of such an approval upon application by the holder. Prohibits NRC approval of an amendment to a license, construction permit, construction and operating license, design approval, or site permit unless the amendment complies with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and with NRC public health and safety or defense and security regulations. Permits the holder of a permit, license, or design approval to deviate from the permit, license, or design approval without prior NRC approval unless the deviation involves a change in the technical specifications incorporated in the permit license, or design approval or an unreviewed safety question. Authorizes the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards to review applications with respect to licenses, permits, and design approvals. Requires the Committee to submit to the NRC a report on each item reviewed. Requires the NRC to adopt and implement a safety goal and to report to Congress within one year after enactment on the progress made toward its adoption and implementation. Title II: Conforming Amendments - Sets forth conforming amendments."
