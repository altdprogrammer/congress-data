Bases the percentage of the allowable deduction on the adjusted gross income of the contributor. Requires that the donee of the artistic property show that the contribution has significant artistic value and that the use of such property will be related to the charitable purpose of the donee's organization. Denies a fair market value deduction for contributions of any letter, memorandum, or similar property produced by a Federal or State employee which arose out of the performance of such employee's official duties."
