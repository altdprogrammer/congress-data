    "text": "Weatherization Amendments of 1984- Amends the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 to authorize appropriations for FY 1985 through 1994 to carry out the low-income weatherization assistance program established under such Act. Requires the Secretary of Energy to develop and publish a plan for the implementation of the weatherization program during FY 1985 through 1994. Requires the Secretary to submit a biennial report to Congress on the number of dwelling units weatherized under the weatherization program, the average energy savings per unit, the weatherization measures which have yielded especially high energy savings, and legislative changes necessary to meet the goals of the program. Provides that a maximum of ten percent of the amount authorized to be appropriated for the weatherization program shall be allotted to a performance fund which shall provide financial assistance to those States which have demonstrated the best performance during the previous fiscal year in providing weatherization assistance under such program. Eliminates the requirement that States applying for financial assistance under the weatherization program establish policies and procedures for securing, to the maximum extent practicable, the services of volunteers, training participants, and public service employment workers. Increases from $800 to $2,000 the maximum amount of financial assistance which may be spent for the labor and materials used in the weatherization of one dwelling unit. Specifies the deadlines for the disbursement of funds by the Secretary to the States under the weatherization program. Requires that States applying for financial assistance under the weatherization program give priority in providing weatherization assistance to low-income individuals receiving assistance under the low-income energy assistance program. Requires that the regulations promulgated by the Secretary to carry out the weatherization program provide that assistance to the States may be used to provide information, education, and technical assistance to the residents of low-income dwellings in which weatherization materials have been installed. Requires the Secretary to establish a program to encourage the development of new methods to weatherize multifamily rental dwellings which will benefit both the owners and the occupiers. Authorizes the Secretary to use in any fiscal year up to two percent of the funds appropriated for the weatherization program to make grants to local weatherization agencies to carry out field testing of energy saving methods and materials. Requires the Secretary to establish a manufactured housing weatherization information program to encourage the weatherization of manufactured homes. Authorizes the Secretary to use funds authorized under the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 to carry out such program through a national contractor working with States, local governments, nonprofit organizations, and businesses. Includes as \"weatherization materials\" for purposes of the weatherization program any furnace efficiency modifications. Permits a State to determine whether an insulating or energy conserving device or technology constitutes \"weatherization materials\" for purposes of such program. Makes such a determination subject to the Secretary's approval. Provides that the term \"low-income\" shall mean income below any income level established as poverty level under any Federal program being carried out in a State applying for assistance under the weatherization program if such State so elects. Requires that States applying for financial assistance under the weatherization program: (1) submit a training plan for weatherization workers, crew supervisors, field staff, and program directors; (2) arrange for inspections by trained persons of eligible dwellings at least once after the installation of weatherization materials to determine if such materials were the most cost effective and appropriate and were installed correctly; and (3) provide for coordination between the weatherization program and the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program. Makes funds available for the training plan. Requires the Secretary to establish a system for monitoring State and local use of funds under the weatherization program and to promulgate regulations governing cost reporting by local agencies. Provides that the standards governing weatherization efforts by the States shall provide that the procedures to be applied to determine the optimum set of cost- effective weatherization measures to be installed in a dwelling unit shall include State procedures set forth in the State's application and approved by the Secretary."
