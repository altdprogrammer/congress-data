Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1986. Directs the Secretary to allot to each State from such appropriations for each fiscal year an amount based on the relative number of children aged five through 17 in such State. Provides that no State shall receive less than one-half of one percent of the funds appropriated for any fiscal year. Provides for reallotments, based on the Secretary's estimates, of sums exceeding a State's needs. Authorizes additional appropriations for allotment to: (1) Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; (2) the Secretary of the Interior for programs in schools operated for Indian children; and (3) the Secretary of Defense for programs in overseas dependent schools. Apportions 65 percent of each State's allotment to elementary, secondary, and vocational education programs and 35 percent to higher education programs. Directs State educational agencies to distribute a specified percentage of the elementary, secondary, and vocational education apportionment to local educational agencies for mathematics and science instruction, foreign language instruction, and computer education programs, together with related instructional materials. Bases such distribution upon the relative numbers of children aged five through 17 in the schools and upon the size of the proposed programs. Bases renewals of such payments upon such criteria and upon a determination that the local program serves substantial numbers of students and involves several grade levels. Requires each State education agency to: (1) distribute a specified percentage of its apportionment for foreign language instruction; and (2) use a specified percentage for exemplary programs instructional materials, technical assistance, and information. Requires the State agency responsible for vocational education to use a specified percentage of the apportionment for vocational education employment-based programs in new and emerging technologies, including computer learning and instruction (with a specified portion to be used for programs in correctional institutions). Requires each local educational agency to to provide for special educational services and arrangements in which children enrolled in private elementary and secondary schools can participate. Requires that expenditures for such services be equal (taking into account the number and needs of children to be served) to expenditures for public school children. Requires that program funds be distributed among vocational education schools and area vocational schools. Directs the State agency for higher education to distribute the higher education programs apportionment among institutions of higher education, with specified percentages to be used for: (1) elementary and secondary school teacher training, retraining, and in service training in mathematics, science, and computer education, as well as cooperative programs with other organizations, such as museums and libraries; (2) employment-based programs equipment in new and emerging technologies, including computer learning and instruction and basic engineering instruction; and (3) foreign language instruction. Sets forth requirements for State applications for grants under this Act. Sets forth provisions for Federal matching payments of 50 percent of the costs of programs under this Act."
