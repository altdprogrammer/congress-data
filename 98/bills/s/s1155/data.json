Sets forth a benefits entitlement schedule. Requires claims under this Act to be filed within three years of a medical determination of brown lung disability. States that an employer shall be liable for the securing of employee benefits equal to or greater than those provided by this Act, including acquiring insurance or qualifying as a self-insurer under specified conditions. Makes an employer liable to the United States for nonpayment of benefits paid on behalf of an individual by the Secretary (as required by this Act). Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Congress. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and enter into contracts for employment-related respiratory and pulmonary research. Authorizes appropriations."
