    "text": "Authorizes appropriations for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for FY 1984 and 1985. Allocates funds for: (1) nuclear reactor regulation; (2) inspection and enforcement; (3) nuclear material safety and safeguards; (4) nuclear regulatory research; (5) program technical support; and (6) program direction and administration. Limits the NRC's authority to enter into grants and cooperative agreements with universities to not more than one percent of the amount authorized to be appropriated for nuclear regulatory research. Prohibits the NRC from reprogramming any funds authorized for any activities under this Act so that any program would be increased or decreased by more than $500,000, unless: (1) a period of 30 calendar days passes after notice of such reprogramming has been sent to specified congressional committees; or (2) such committees transmit within such 30-day period a written notice that they have no objection to such reprogramming. Authorizes the NRC to use the cooperative nuclear research program funds and the material access authorization program funds to pay salaries and expenses under such programs. Authorizes the NRC to transfer sums from the amounts appropriated under this Act to other Government agencies which perform the work for which such appropriations were made."
