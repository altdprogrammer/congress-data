Rept. 98-464) Idaho Forest Management Act of 1984 - Title I: Findings, Purposes, and Wilderness Designation - Sets forth congressional findings and purposes. Designates the following lands in Idaho as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Selkirks-Canyon Wilderness in the Panhandle National Forest; (2) the Salmo Priest Wilderness in the Panhandle National Forest; (3) the Scotchman Peaks Wilderness in the Panhandle National Forest; (4) the Mallard Larkins Wilderness in the Panhandle and Clearwater National Forests; (5) the Kelly Creek-Hoodoo Wilderness in the Clearwater National Forest; (6) the Secesh Wilderness in the Payette National Forest; (7) the White Clouds Wilderness in the Sawtooth National Recreation Area; (8) the Worm Creek Wilderness in the Caribou National Forest; and (9) the Borah Peak Wilderness in the Challis National Forest. Title II: Release of Lands for Multiple Use Management - Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Idaho shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Idaho which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Idaho reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness area. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Idaho without express congressional authorization. Provides that such provisions shall also apply to: (1) national forest system roadless areas in Idaho which were evaluated in any unit plan or which are being managed pursuant to a multiple use plan; and (2) national forest system roadless lands in Idaho which are less than 5,000 acres in size. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Sets forth requirements with respect to livestock grazing policies, State water allocation authority, buffer zones, mineral resources assessment, and aircraft landing. Specifies procedures for the disposition of existing mining claims in the White Clouds Wilderness designated by this Act. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct an inventory of, and report to Congress on, the structures which exist within the wilderness areas designated by this Act."
