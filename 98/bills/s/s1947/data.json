Sets forth requirements with respect to visitor uses and management of the wilderness area. Requires the Secretary of the Interior and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to negotiate the transfer of legal rights and easements retained by the TVA over lands in the park which are inconsistent with the Wilderness Act or unnecessary for the operation of the Fontana Lake Dam. Designates the land formerly owned by the TVA as wilderness. Authorizes the Secretary to place a historical marker at or near the approach to the Cherokee Qualls Reservation at Soco Gap. Provides for the settlement of all claims of Swain County, North Carolina, against the United States under the agreement of July 30, 1943, providing for construction of a road along the north shore of Fontana Reservoir. Authorizes appropriations."
