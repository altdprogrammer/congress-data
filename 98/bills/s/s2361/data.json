Sets forth the requirements which a plan must meet in order for it to be approved by the Commission. Requires that such plans be reviewed and updated at least every five years. Requires an applicant for a license to develop a water power project to submit to the Commission and to the State within which the proposed project is to be located a certification that the project complies with the State's comprehensive plan. Requires the State to notify the public of such a certification and to arrange for public hearing if necessary. Prohibits approval of such a project by the Commission without the State's concurrence."
