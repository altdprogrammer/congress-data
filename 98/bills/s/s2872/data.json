    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-07-26", 
    "text": "Conservation Service Reform Act of 1984 - Title I: Residential Conservation Service - Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to extend until January 1, 1990, the time period within which energy conservation information requirements imposed upon public utilities and home heating suppliers shall apply. (Under current law, such requirements apply through January 1, 1985.) Eliminates requirements that public utilities and home heating suppliers: (1) arrange to have suggested energy conservation measures installed for residential customers; (2) arrange for related loans for such customers; and (3) provide such customers with lists of suppliers and contractors who sell or install energy conservation measures in the area served by the utilities and home heating suppliers and of lending institutions which will offer loans for the installation of such measures. Provides that an application by a utility for an exemption from the requirements under such Act which is pending on the date of the enactment of this Act shall be considered approved unless the Secretary of Energy disapproves it within 30 days after such date. Permits a State or a utility to elect to formulate and certify an alternative residential energy conservation plan in lieu of the residential energy conservation plan required to be approved by the Secretary pursuant to the National Energy Conservation Policy Act. (Permits alternative plans by utilities where an alternative State plan is not in effect or in the case of a nonregulated utility which is not included in a State plan.) Sets forth procedural requirements for the formulation of such an alternative plan. Requires that such an alternative plan: (1) provide general energy conservation suggestions to all residential customers of utilities in the State; (2) provide specific energy conservation information and improvements to customers upon their requests; (3) provide benefits to a specified percentage of residential buildings which did not receive benefits under such Act before such plan became effective; (4) reduce energy consumption by an average of ten percent or more in such residential buildings; (5) benefit low- and moderate-income individuals as well as others; (6) contain adequate procedures for installation of energy conservation measures; (7) prevent unfair, deceptive, and anticompetitive practices affecting commerce; (8) be carried out by the State, utilities within the State, or both (except in the case of a plan being certified by a utility rather than the State); (9) contain rules concerning accounting and payment of costs which are consistent with such Act; (10) provide redress for any injuries resulting from violations of plan provisions; and (11) assure that the utility will not inspect a furnace or install or inspect furnace efficiency modifications without the customer's request in the case of a furnace using a primary source of energy other than that sold by the utility. Requires the State or the utility to certify that its alternative plan has been formulated in accordance with this Act and will be adequately implemented. Sets forth reporting requirements with which the State or utility must comply. Sets forth administrative and judicial proceedings which may be commenced to require the adequate implementation of an alternative plan. Requires the Secretary of Energy to report to specified congressional committees on the residential energy conservation plans required under the National Energy Conservation Policy Act and on the alternative plans described above. Requires the Secretary to disseminate information annually to the States and public utilities providing technical assistance and relating to the most cost-effective energy conservation procedures and devices and the most successful residential energy conservation plans. Provides as an additional requirement relating to the waiver of the prohibition against supply and installation of residential energy conservation measures by public utilities that there be no unfair competitive advantages to the utility seeking such waiver. Prohibits the Governor of a State from supporting the petition of a regulated utility for such a waiver before: (1) the Governor has notified the public of the waiver petition so that interested persons may make comments and the governor has made the same determinations which the Secretary must make in approving such a petition; and (2) the utility makes all relevant information available to the Governor. Revises requirements with respect to the application of the contracting and general exemptions from the prohibition against supply and installation of residential energy conservation measures by public utilities. Sets forth review procedures for such exemptions. Title II: Repeal of Provisions Regarding Commercial Buildings and Multifamily Dwellings - Repeals title VII of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act."
