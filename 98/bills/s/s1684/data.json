    "text": "Federal Election Campaign Expenditure Limits Act - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to repeal a specified allowance for political fund raising expenditures. Requires an additional pre-election report of receipts and disbursements by the treasurer of a congressional candidate's principal campaign committee. Reduces from $1,000 to $500 the contribution threshholds which must be reported by the principal campaign committee of a congressional candidate. Delineates specific categories in which reported campaign operating expenses must be itemized. Reduces from $1000 to $500 any independent expenditure aggregate which must be reported. Requires specified political committees who must file disbursement and receipt reports to make such reports available for public inspection and purchase. Requires political committees which make communications soliciting contributions to identify the officers, organizers and organizations associated with such committees. Prohibits political parties from holding nominating conventions for the office of President or Vice-President before the first Monday in September of an election year. Prohibits any person or entity from incurring costs or expenditures to solicit contributions for a Presidential or Vice-Presidential candidate before June 1 of an election year. Sets limits upon such expenditures. Raises the expenditure ceiling for: (1) nomination for the office of President from $10,000,000 to $15,000,000; and (2) election to the office of President from $20,000,000 to $25,000,000. Repeals the linkage between the Consumer Price Index and limitations placed on campaign expenditures. Sets limitations on expenditures: (1) for primary and general election campaigns for the Senate and the House of Representatives; and (2) from personal funds for the office of President, Senator, and House of Representatives. Sets limitations on independent expenditures in connection with a clearly identified candidate. Repeals the public financing provisions of the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act, the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act, and the Internal Revenue Code."
