Rept. 98-494) School Facilities Child Care Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to public agencies and private nonprofit organizations having the capacity to furnish school-age child care services in order to assist such agencies and organizations to establish and operate such services in public schools or in community centers in communities where public school facilities are not available. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1986. Sets forth information which must be included in applications by such agencies or organizations to the Secretary for such grants. Requires the Secretary, in approving the applications, to: (1) assure that there is an equitable distribution of approved applications; (2) give priority to applications from applicants in communities with the greatest need and a shortage of economic resources for such services; and (3) give consideration to applications who can illustrate an identifiable base of community support. Directs the Secretary to carry out a program of collecting data from recipients of assistance under this Act designed to provide a national-needs assessment for child care services of school-age children in the United States. Requires the Secretary to report annually to specified congressional committees on activities under this Act together with a needs assessment of child care services for school-age children in each State. Requires the Secretary to operate a clearinghouse on school-age child care programs. Sets forth general administrative provisions with respect to carrying out this Act."
