    "text": "Paleontological Resources Conservation Act of 1983 - Permits any educational or scientific institution to apply to the Department of the Interior for a permit to collect, excavate, and remove any fossil vertebrate located on public or Indian lands. States that a permit will be valid for five years for all public lands within a specified geographic or geologic sector. States that further permission directly from the appropriate Indian or Indian tribe may be necessary in the case of permits for Indian lands. Sets forth other requirements concerning such permits, including: (1) contacting the Federal land manager's local representative for the lands in question; (2) requiring the Federal land manager to notify any Indian tribe whose religious or cultural site might be affected by such permit; and (3) identifying the scientists who will be responsible for complying with the terms of the permit. Permits suspension or revocation of a permit for violations of this Act, subsequent regulations, and the terms of the permit. Exempts Indians with tribal law governing the excavation and removal of such resources from the requirements of this Act. Permits a scientific commercial collector to apply to the Department for a permit to collect, excavate, and remove any fossil vertebrate located on public and Indian lands if such collection is coordinated with a professional vertebrate paleontologist and examined by such a person before commercial disposal. Makes a commercial permit valid for a term of three years within a specified geographical sector. States that an additional permit may be required for activities on Indian lands. Sets forth the conditions for such permits, including: (1) that the fossils removed become the property of the permittee; and (2) that the individual responsible for complying with the permit and the paleontologist examining the fossils be identified. Permits suspension or revocation of a permit for violations of this Act or the terms of the permit. Requires Indian approval for commercial excavations on Indian lands. Permits the Federal land manager's local representative to issue special land use permits on an annual basis to hobbyists and collectors for private purposes, subject to the same coordination and examination conditions as apply to commercial excavators. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate regulations providing for title transfer and for scientific and educational exchanges of vertebrate fossils removed from public and Indian lands. States that disposition or exchange of fossils removed from Indian lands shall be subject to Indian consent. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act. Subjects to forfeiture all fossil vertebrates acquired in violation of this Act. Provides for the confidentiality of fossil nature and location when necessary to protect the resources or locality. Directs the Secretaries of the Interior, Defense, and Agriculture to promulgate regulations to effectuate this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to coordinate the exchange of information among the various interest groups, including previous private collectors and Federal authorities. Establishes a National Advisory Committee for Paleontological Research Policy to assist the Secretary of the Interior and the Federal land managers responsible for implementing this Act. Retains all existing laws and authorities relating to multiple uses of the public lands. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to report to Congress every three years on the activities carried out pursuant to this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
