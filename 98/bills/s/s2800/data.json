    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-06-27", 
    "text": "Emergency Immigrant Education Act of 1984 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1989 for special impact aid payments to State and local educational agencies which provide educational services to immigrant children. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to pay to each State educational agency (SEA) for its administrative costs under this Act up to one and one-half percent of the funds to which the SEA is entitled under this Act. Sets forth provisions for withholding of payments under this Act. Directs the Secretary to make, for FY 1985 through 1989, State entitlement payments equal to $500 for each immigrant child in public and nonpublic elementary or secondary schools within eligible local educational agencies (LEAs). Requires that the number of such children in the public and nonpublic schools within an eligible LEA be at least the lesser of: (1) 500; or (2) three percent of the total enrollment in such public or nonpublic schools during the fiscal year. Requires that the amount of any such grant to an SEA for any fiscal year be reduced by the amounts made available for such fiscal year by any other Federal law for expenditure within the State for the same purposes as those for which funds are available under this Act. Provides that such reduction shall be made only to the extent that such amounts are made available: (1) for such purposes specifically because of the refugee, parolee, asylee, or other immigrant status of the individuals served by such funds; and (2) to provide assistance to individuals eligible for services under this Act. Permits payments to States under this Act to be used for supplementary public educational services and costs for immigrant children in public and nonpublic schools within districts served by eligible LEAs. Includes among such services: (1) English language instruction; (2) other bilingual educational services; (3) special materials and supplies; (4) additional basic instructional services; and (5) inservice personnel training. Sets forth requirements for SEA applications for payments under this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) make payments to SEAs having applications approved; and (2) arrange for the provision of public educational services under this Act to children enrolled in nonpublic schools in cases where a State is prohibited by law from providing such services to such children and where the LEA has substantially failed or is unwilling to provide for the participation on an equitable basis of such children in such services."
