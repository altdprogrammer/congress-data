    "text": "Agricultural Export Expansion Act of 1983 - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to develop and carry out a program under which agricultural commodities acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation are made available, for export without charge, to domestic exporters, domestic processors (for export), and foreign purchasers. Requires the Secretary to: (1) ensure that equal treatment is provided to domestic exporters and foreign purchasers and to domestic processors in cases where the importation of a manufactured product made from agricultural commodities, made available for export under this Act, would place domestic processors of such commodity at a competitive disadvantage; (2) give priority among foreign purchasers who have purchased U.S. agricultural commodities in the past and who continue to do so in increased quanities; (3) ensure that agricultural commodities, made available for export under this Act, are used to encourage increased use of such commodities and to avoid unnecessary market displacement of domestic agricultural commodities; and (4) take reasonable precautions to prevent resale, transshipment or any use of such commodities other than domestic use in the importing country. Authorizes the Secretary to make supplemental distributions of commodities to a foreign purchaser who uses funds realized from the sale of commodities made available under this Act to construct or rehabilitate facilities in the importing country for specified purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to determine the intervals and quantities of such supplemental distributions. Requires the Secretary to carry out such program through the Commodity Credit Corporation. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to include specified agricultural commodities (currently only dairy products) acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation as donations for distributions to needy persons outside the United States. Provides for direct distribution, sale or barter of such commodities. Requires the proceeds realized from the sale or barter of such commodities to be used exclusively for assistance to needy persons. Prohibits the use of such proceeds to defray operating costs or overhead expenses. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to authorize the Secretary to adjust the established price for wheat, feed grain, upland cotton, and rice in a specified manner. Directs the Secretary to estimate, for FY 1984-1986, the annual savings realized from such adjustment. Requires the Secretary to use an amount of funds available to the Commodity Credit Corporation equal to the amount of annual savings to: (1) ensure that the cooperator programs of the Foreign Agricultural Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture are funded at a level ten percent higher than FY 1983 funding level; and (2) provide any remaining funds for the Agricultural Export Promotion Revolving Fund established by this Act. Establishes the Agricultural Export Promotion Revolving Fund in the Treasury, to be used by the Commodity Credit Corporation (without fiscal year limitation) to finance: (1) commercial export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities, private or Corporation owned or controlled stock, on credit terms not to exceed three years; (2) export sales of specified U.S. breeding animals, including cost of freight; and (3) the establishment of facilities in importing countries to improve their capabilities to import U.S. agricultural commodities. Requires the Corporation to use the Fund only to extend credit for market development and expansion and only where there is a substantial potential for developing markets for U.S. agricultural goods. Requires the Secretary to use the Fund to finance sales to the greatest feasible number of countries. Authorizes appropriations for the Fund. Requires all money received by the Corporation in payment for the extension of credit for financing export sales using the Fund to be added back into the Fund. Requires the Secretary to submit an annual report to Congress concerning the use of the Fund. Requires the Secretary to carry out such program through the Commodity Credit Corporation. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require the President to use not less than 20 percent of funds appropriated for economic support programs to purchase domestic agricultural commodities, including one-half of such amount to purchase processed or value-added commodity products. Requires the Secretary of State to submit a report to Congress describing all programs administered by the Secretary under which surplus agricultural commodities could be distributed. Requires the President to submit a written report to Congress by March 31, 1983, describing the negotiation of a long-term grain sales agreement with the U.S.S.R., providing a higher minimum purchase requirement than the present agreement. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to submit a report to Congress describing the growth of and prospects for bilateral agricultural trade agreements and the potential impact of such agreements on trade."
