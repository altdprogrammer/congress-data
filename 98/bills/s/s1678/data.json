    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-07-25", 
    "text": "Energy Emergency Preparedness Act Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to authorize the President to establish and employ volunteers (who shall as far as possible be salaried full-time Federal employees) in the Emergency Petroleum and Gas Executive Reserve, the Emergency Solid Fuels Executive Reserve, and the Emergency Electric Power Executive Reserve to assist in implementing the Comprehensive Energy Emergency Response Procedures Plan. Authorizes the President to consult with representatives of the energy industry, energy consumers, and others, with a view to encouraging the making by such persons of voluntary agreements and plans of action which would be in the public interest and contribute to energy emergency preparedness by facilitating preparation for, or a response to, a domestic or international energy emergency. Directs the President to prescribe standards and procedures by which persons may develop and carry out such voluntary agreements and plans. Directs the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to participate in the development, and when practicable, in the carrying out of voluntary agreements and plans. Prohibits carrying out such an agreement or plan unless it is approved by the Secretary of Energy or by the Attorney General, after consultation with the Federal Trade Commission. Requires the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to report, at least once annually, to the President on the impact on competition and on small business of actions authorized by this Act. Extends, until June 30, 1985, the authority for international voluntary agreements under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Revises provisions relating to the storage of petroleum products in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Requires the minimum required fill rate to be 145,000 (currently either 220,000 or 300,000, discretionary with the President) barrels per day. Preempts any State law or regulation to the extent it provides for the pricing or allocation of residual fuel oil or any other petroleum product, except that exemptions may be granted to a State: (1) to preserve a significant State interest; (2) if interstate commerce would not be unduly burdened; (3) if energy emergency preparedness would not be hindered; and (4) for a State set-aside program. Amends the Energy Emergency Preparedness Act of 1982 to direct the Secretary of Energy to: (1) undertake actions which are necessary to strengthen and improve the energy emergency preparedness policies of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act; and (2) report to Congress on any such actions taken."
