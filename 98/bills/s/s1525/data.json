    "text": "Disaster Relief Act Amendments of 1983 - Amends the short title of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 to read the \"Major Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.\" Amends such Act to redefine 'emergency' to include any instance for which, in the President's determination, Federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local efforts to save lives and protect property. Repeals provisions of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 concerning economic recovery for disaster areas. Amends the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the Disaster Relief Act) to revise procedures concerning State requests for emergency assistance. Describes the determination to be made by the President concerning the nature of an emergency prior to authorizing emergency assistance under such Act. Authorizes the President, in any emergency, to: (1) provide emergency assistance to save lives and protect property and public health; (2) direct Federal agencies to utilize their resources in support of State and local emergency assistance; and (3) coordinate all Federal agencies and voluntary relief or disaster assistance organizations providing emergency assistance and coordinate emergency assistance with State and local officials. Sets forth the manner by which Federal agencies are authorized to provide assistance on the direction of the President. Limits funds to a set amount for any single emergency, except when the President determines that continued emergency assistance is immediately required. Amends the Disaster Relief Act to redefine 'major disaster.' Makes other technical and conforming amendments. Amends such Act to require that facilities receiving such emergency assistance must have been covered by adequate and reasonable flood insurance in order to receive full assistance benefits. Amends provisions of such Act concerning duplication of insurance benefits to provide for repayment of duplicated benefits. Adds four new sections to the Disaster Relief Act, providing for: (1) a declaration that action taken or assistance provided pursuant to such Act that restores facilities substantially as they existed before the disaster shall not be deemed a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; (2) an authorization of the Attorney General to institute actions against any party whose acts or omissions may have caused or contributed to the events resulting in a Presidential declaration of emergency or disaster; and (3) audits and investigations by the President, in conjunction with the Comptroller General, to assure compliance with the Disaster Relief Act. Sets forth criminal and civil penalties for violations of such Act. Adds new provisions to the Disaster Relief Act to: (1) provide that all requests for a declaration by the President that a major disaster exists shall be made by the Governor of the State affected, who shall provide the President with certain information; (2) provide that in any case where an eligible applicant (or the State) is unable to assume its cost-sharing responsibility, the President is authorized to lend or advance a 25 percent share, such loan to be repaid with interest; (3) allow the President to provide assistance directly or through Federal agencies to assist State and local governments in performing essential services, distributing food, medicine, and supplies, coordinating disaster assistance organizations, and providing such other assistance under this Act as the President deems appropriate; and (4) authorize Federal agencies to provide assistance by utilizing resources available under any Act, distributing food, medicine, or supplies, donating equipment and supplies to State and local governments, and performing any emergency work or services essential to save lives and protect and preserve property. Amends the Disaster Relief Act to authorize the President to make contributions to State or local governments to help repair or replace public facilities which were damaged or destroyed by a major disaster. Limits such contributions to 75 percent of the net eligible cost. Authorizes the President to make the same such contributions to private nonprofit facilities, with the same contribution limit. Provides that no such contributions will be made unless the entity affected agrees that such facility shall be repaired in compliance with flood plain management and hazard mitigation criteria required by the President, in conformity with the Coastal Barriers Resources Act and other applicable Federal statutes. Limits the Federal share of disaster assistance available for repairs and reconstruction of public facilities and private nonprofit facilities and debris removal to 75 percent of eligible costs. Revises provisions concerning temporary housing assistance for those displaced by a major disaster or emergency. Provides for the installation of necessary utilities for temporary housing. Authorizes the President to contribute up to 50 percent of the cost of implementing hazard mitigation projects. Reduces the duration of unemployment assistance to individuals unemployed as a result of a major disaster. Permits a State to be reimbursed for certain expenses incurred in administering grants to individuals and families. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1986. Makes technical and conforming amendments."
