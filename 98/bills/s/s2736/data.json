    "date": "1984-10-02", 
    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 5688 passed in lieu) Veterans' Administration Benefit Rate Increase and Program Improvement Act of 1984 - Title I: Disability Compensation and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation - Part A: Rate Increases - Increases the rates of: (1) veterans' disability compensation; (2) additional compensation for dependents; (3) the clothing allowance for certain disabled veterans; (4) dependency and indemnity compensation for spouses; (5) dependency and indemnity compensation for children; and (6) supplemental dependency and indemnity compensation for children. Sets forth the effective dates for such increases. Makes the effective dates and amounts of increase contingent upon the percent of increase in benefits under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act scheduled to take effect on December 1, 1984. Part B: Compensation Program Amendments - Amends the veterans' disability compensation provisions to provide periods of trial work for veterans assigned total service-connected disability ratings by reason of unemployability. Defines trial work as work performed for gain by such a veteran to determine whether in fact such veteran is able to pursue substantially gainful employment. Entitles all unemployable veterans to counseling and other services. (Currently, such services are extended only to veterans participating in a vocational rehabilitation program). Requires veterans rated as unemployable and therefore totally disabled to submit to an evaluation and possibly to a vocational rehabilitation program if either or both are considered appropriate. Sets forth notice and outreach requirements. Directs the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to report to the Veterans' Affairs Committees on the conduct of the trial work program. Title II: Veterans' Administration Rehabilitation and Education Programs - Part A: Rate Increases - Increases the rates of educational and subsistence allowances for eligible veterans and their dependents and survivors. Increases the amount of reporting fee per participating veteran or other eligible person payable to an educational institution. Increases the amount a veteran or other eligible person may borrow for education in any one regular academic year. Part B: Rehabilitation and Education Program Improvements - Tolls the eligibility period for GI Bill and other specified educational benefits and vocational rehabilitation programs for certain veterans and eligible persons who have been prevented from participating in such programs because of alcohol or drug dependence or abuse. Limits the extension to a maximum of four years. Requires affected veterans and persons to have participated in a treatment or rehabilitation program. Repeals a reporting requirement pertaining to deceptive advertising practices by educational institutions. Requires the Administrator to consult with the VA educational advisory committee prior to changing any educational institution requirements for reporting enrollments of GI Bill trainees. Title III: Veterans' Employment Programs - Extends veterans' readjustment appointments in the Federal Government for Vietnam era veterans from FY 1984 to FY 1985. Amends the Emergency Veterans' Job Training Act of 1983 to extend from 60 to 80 days the viability of the Administrator of Veterans Affairs certificate that a veteran is eligible to participate in the job training program established by such Act. Authorizes appropriations for an additional year, through FY 1987. Extends such program from the end of FY 1984 to May 31, 1985, for applications and from December 31, 1984, to September 1, 1985, for the actual job training. Title IV: Veterans' Administration Non-Service-Connected Disability Pension - Establishes a three-year trial work period pilot project for non-service-connected disabled veterans rated as permanently and totally disabled. (See title I for a definition of trial work). Permits participants to retain their disability status and VA health care benefits while performing trial work. Extends eligibility for health care benefits one year beyond the termination of a veteran's pension by reason of income from work or training in a vocational rehabilitation program. Directs the Administrator to report to the Veterans' Affairs Committees on the first three years of the trial work period pilot program and on the results of medical examinations of persons awarded a pension for being age 65. Title V: Other Benefit Rate Increases - Increases the rates of specially adapted housing and automobile assistance grants for certain severely disabled veterans. Increases the maximum amount of coverage under the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance program. Title VI: Miscellaneous Provisions - Expands the definition of the Vietnam era to include service by veterans in South Vietnam during the period July 8, 1959, through August 4, 1964. (Current law starts such period on August 5, 1964.) Excludes amounts received in a VA therapeutic or rehabilitative activity from income for VA pension programs purposes through December 31, 1987. Directs the Administrator to report to the Veterans' Affairs Committees on the number of participants in such activities and the costs of such exclusion. Makes the last date of school attendance the termination date for veterans' dependents' allowances for school-aged dependents. Excludes the value of the home of an incompetent veteran without dependents from the determination of the value of the veteran's estate for purposes of the veteran's eligibility for VA benefits while institutionalized at public expense. Permits the Administrator to waive any discontinuation of benefits for such veterans for up to 60 days of care to avoid hardship. Deletes gender references in certain veterans' benefits provisions."
