    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 2780 passed in lieu) Local Government Fiscal Assistance Amendments of 1983 - Extends the revenue-sharing program of general-purpose fiscal assistance to local governments through FY 1986. States that all data computation (currently, only the allocations) of a local government whose boundaries include areas of two or more counties shall be determined on the basis of the proportion of its population in each county. Requires a local government receiving such assistance to assure that it will comply with the public-participation and audit requirements. Repeals provisions requiring a reduction in the allocation to a State government if it reduces its own payments to local governments. Disregards reductions in adjusted taxes due to economic dislocation for purposes of the general revenue sharing program. Reduces from two to one the number of public hearings a recipient government must hold on its proposals for use of revenue sharing funds. Declares that discrimination proceedings must begin when a government receives a notice of discrimination complaints (currently, when the notice is issued). Removes the requirement that each State and unit of general local government receiving assistance make annual reports to the Secretary of the Treasury. Allows units of local government of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to include property taxes levied for FY 1982 in adjusted taxes for revenue-sharing purposes for the entitlement period beginning October 1, 1983. Makes such allowance contingent upon the Governor of Massachusetts certifying to the Secretary that all units of local government will be required to prepare financial statements in accord with generally accepted accounting principles. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Comptroller General, and the Chairman of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations to undertake a series of studies on federalism and the future role of the Revenue Sharing Program in the Federal system. Specifies the requirements of such studies."
