    "text": "Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to limit the amount of title II benefits to be paid in the case of: (1) aliens who are not permanent residents of the United States or who have been outside the United States for more than six consecutive months while entitled to benefits; and (2) their dependents and survivors. Provides that the amount of title II benefits to be paid to such an individual shall be limited to: (1) the total amount of social security taxes paid on the wages and self-employment income on which the benefits are based if the individual is the only person entitled to such benefits; or (2) a pro rata share of the social security taxes paid on the wages and self-employment income on which the benefits are based if the individual is one of several persons entitled to such benefits. Makes the limitation on title II benefits under this Act inapplicable in the case of an alien who is not a permanent resident of the United States if the benefit involved is payable to such alien as the wife, husband, child, or survivor of a U.S. citizen or national or of a permanent resident of the United States. Provides that the limitation on title II benefits under this Act in the case of an alien who has been outside the United States for more than six consecutive months while entitled to benefits shall not preclude such alien from receiving benefits on the basis of wages and self-employment income other than the wages and self-employment income on which his or her entitlement was based while he or she was outside the United States for more than six consecutive months."
