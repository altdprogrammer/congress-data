States that during the period July 1, 1983 through September 30, 1984, findings of the Secretary of Agriculture under such Act that a natural disaster exists in an area shall be deemed as determinations that an emergency exists for purposes of: (1) reserve wheat and feed grain inventories under the Agricultural Act of 1970; (2) the livestock and poultry emergency feed program under the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977; and (3) Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) surplus feed sales. Directs the Secretary to make such disaster assistance available for the preservation of foundation herds of livestock and poultry until September 30, 1984, or earlier as the Secretary may determine."
