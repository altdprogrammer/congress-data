    "text": "National Security and Arms Export Review Act of 1983 - Amends the Arms Export Control Act to express the sense of the Congress that the President should begin discussions to limit the transfer by member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to developing countries of conventional arms. Requires the President to provide as an addendum to the quarterly report to Congress on military exports the text of all defense requirement surveys completed during the preceding quarter. Requires that the Presidential certification that is sent to Congress before the issuance of a letter of offer to sell defense articles must contain an item stating whether the proposed recipient country or organization has agreed not to transfer the defense article or related training without the consent of the President. Requires that Congress be notified and given an opportunity to disapprove letters of offer to sell and applications for export licenses for: (1) defense articles or services if the price of the defense articles or services is between $50,000,000 and $200,000,000; and (2) defense equipment if the price of the equipment is between $14,000,000 and $200,000,000. Prohibits the issuance of a letter of offer to sell or of an export license for defense articles or services, design, and construction services, or defense equipment if their price is $200,000,000 or more unless: (1) the Congress, within 30 days after receiving certification of the letter of offer or export license application approves of the proposed sale or export; or (2) the President states in the certification that an emergency exists which requires such sale or export in the interests of national security. Prohibits splitting up letters of offer for the sale of defense articles, services, equipment or design and construction service in order to circumvent reporting or review requirements. Requires such letters of offer to include as part of their proposed sales price the sales price of related equipment."
