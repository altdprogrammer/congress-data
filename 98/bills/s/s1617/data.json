    "text": "Maritime Agreements Act of 1983 - Amends the Shipping Act, 1916, to prohibit the United States from entering into intergovernmental maritime agreements that provide for or limit access to liner cargo in foreign commerce, unless specified conditions are met to promote the interests of the United States. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a Maritime Industry Advisory Committee to advise on the negotiation and implementation of such agreements. Requires the Committee to submit a report annually to the Secretary containing its recommendations on such agreements. Declares that such agreements are presumed to be in furtherance of national policy whenever foreign nations operate to exclude or otherwise discriminate against United States-flag operators in reciprocal trades with the United States. Requires such agreements to protect and further the opportunity of United States liner operators to participate as cross traders in international liner trades."
