    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-06-27", 
    "text": "Extra Long Staple Cotton Act of 1983 - Repeals specified extra long staple (ELS) cotton marketing quota and acreage allotment provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 and the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1949, effective with the 1984 crop. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to set forth new ELS cotton program provisions. Establishes a ten-month loan period, with an optional eight-month extension, at minimum rates of 50 (presently 75) percent more than the upland cotton rate. Requires loan level announcements by November 1. Authorizes an ELS cotton acreage limitation program based on a uniform percentage reduction. Makes farmers who knowingly overproduce ineligible for program benefits. Bases a farm's acreage for such reduction purposes on the previous three year's average planted acreage. Requires that part of such acreage be devoted to conservation uses. Authorizes ELS cotton land diversion payments (whether or not an acreage limitation is in effect). Requires such acreage to be devoted to approved conservation uses. Permits land diversion contracts to be determined by bid. Directs the Secretary to limit the total diverted acreage in any local area in order not to adversely affect the local economy. Permits reduced or diverted acreage to be used for approved wildlife habitats. States that the ELS cotton program shall be carried out through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). Requires the Secretary to make recourse loans available to ELS cotton farmers for seed cotton. Authorizes the sale of CCC-owned cotton for unrestricted use at such price levels as the Secretary determines appropriate to maintain and expand domestic and export markets. Amends the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 to add ELS cotton to the $50,000 payment limitation on payments that a person may receive for specified Agricultural Act of 1949 commodity programs."
