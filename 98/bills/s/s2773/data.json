Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to file maps of these areas with specified congressional committees as soon as practicable after the enactment of this Act.

Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental impact statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Georgia shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Georgia which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Georgia reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation in Georgia without express congressional authorization. States that the provisions above shall also apply to national forest system roadless lands in Georgia which are less than 5,000 acres in size. Specifies those areas in Georgia to which the provisions above shall not apply."
