    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Select Committee on Indian Affairs with amendment, S. Rept. 98-608) Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan Distribution of Judgment Funds Act - Authorizes the Saginaw Chippewa Tribe of Michigan, through its Tribal Council, to establish a Principal Investment Fund to be held in trust by the Council for the benefit of the Tribe. Requires the Fund to be used exclusively for tribal economic development or development of tribal resources. Prohibits distribution from such Fund for: (1) per capita payments to tribal members; or (2) purposes other than investment or economic development programs. Requires a certain percentage of the Fund's net income to be retained and included in its principal. Requires the Fund to be audited once every fiscal year and treats such report as a tribal public document. Requires the Secretary to transfer to the tribe for deposit in the Principal Investment Fund certain judgment funds awarded the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan in satisfaction of specified claims. Conditions such transfer upon tribal adoption of a constitutional provision enabling certain persons to become enrolled members regardless of residency on the reservation. States that the Secretary's approval is not required for such change in tribal membership requirements. Absolves the Secretary from any further trust responsibility for the funds after such transfer. Exempts payments, distributions or net income from the Fund from State, local, or Federal income tax. Prohibits the consideration of such payments, net income or distributions in determinations to deny or reduce benefits under Federal assistance programs or the Social Security Act. Authorizes the tribe to: (1) encumber certain net income of the Fund; (2) encumber certain assets not held in trust by the Secretary; and (3) execute limited waivers of sovereign immunity regarding the civil jurisdiction of Michigan State courts with respect to the use of such income or assets; (4) encumber certain undistributed judgment funds (docket number 57); and (5) request the Secretary to transfer such undistributed judgment funds to the Tribal Council. Subjects the net income of docket number 57 funds to the same conditions as the Principal Investment Fund."
