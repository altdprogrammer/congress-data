Makes providing accurate information to Cuba a purpose of such Act. Authorizes using a specified radio station and frequency for radio broadcasting to Cuba. Authorizes the Board to carry out said broadcasting by means of grants, leases or contracts. Authorizes any U.S. agency or instrumentality to sell, loan, lease, or grant property and to perform services at the request of the Board. Prohibits making any grant under this Act to any corporation established to provide radio broadcasting to Cuba, unless the board of directors of such corporation consists only of members of the Board for International Broadcasting and the board of such corporation makes all major policy determinations and appoints (and fixes the compensation of) certain managerial officers and employees. Declares that compliance with such requirements shall not be construed to make such a corporation a Federal agency or instrumentality."
