    "text": "Older Americans Vocational Education Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to States to pay the costs of training, retraining, and placement programs for older Americans. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984, 1985, and 1986. Sets forth methods for making allotments to the States and for the various programs under this Act. Requires each State desiring to receive assistance under this Act to establish an older Americans job training committee to be composed of a representative from the private sector and officers from specified State agencies. Directs the Secretary to make grants under this Act to each State's committee. Directs a committee to use its allotment for: (1) employment based programs for older Americans in occupations with existing job opportunities; (2) training programs for older Americans; and (3) placement services. Requires a State in order to receive a grant to file an application which shall: (1) designate the older Americans job training committee; (2) describe the programs for which assistance is sought; (3) assure that specified categories of older Americans are given priority under the State's programs; (4) provide procedures under which providers of training and placement services may submit applications to the job training committees for distribution of payments to such providers; and (5) assure that no more than ten percent of a State's allotment will be used for administrative expenses. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and enter into contracts with qualified national organizations to develop and carry out demonstration projects designed to focus attention on the special vocational education needs of older individuals and to promote employment opportunities for older individuals. Directs the Secretary to establish and operate an information clearinghouse on training and retraining programs for older Americans. Amends the Vocational Education Act of 1963 to extend coverage to individuals of all ages (and specifically those individuals subject to age stereotyping and age discrimination)."
