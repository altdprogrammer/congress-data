    "text": "Pennsylvania Wilderness Act of 1984 - Designates certain lands in Pennsylvania as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, including Allegheny Islands Wilderness-Proposed and Hickory Creek Wilderness-Proposed. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) to administer such lands in accordance with the Wilderness Act. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire lands or interests in lands within the Hickory Creek Wilderness, including oil, gas, mineral interests and scenic easements. Requires the owner's consent for such acquisition. Limits the appropriation for such acquisitions to $2,000,000. Designates certain lands in the Allegheny National Forest, Pennsylvania, as the Allegheny National Recreation Area. Identifies the lands composing such area as the Allegheny Front, Cornplanter, and Tracy Ridge, including the Allegheny Reservoir. Directs the Secretary to administer the national recreation area in accordance with the following objectives: (1) minimizing the environmental impacts of mineral exploration and development, including privately owned oil and gas; (2) maximizing recreational opportunities on the Allegheny Reservoir, including motorized and non-motorized boating; (3) protection of fish and wildlife habitat; and (4) protection of watershed and free flowing streams. Directs the Secretary to publish a management plan accompanied by an environmental impact statement for the national recreation area. Presents guidelines for the plan. Provides for public participation in preparing the comprehensive management plan. Permits hunting and fishing in accordance with Federal and State laws within the boundaries of the national recreation area. Requires the Secretary to consult with the appropriate State fish and game department before implementing any regulations. Withdraws the minerals in all federally-owned lands within the national recreation area from all forms of appropriation and disposition under either mining laws or mineral leasing laws. Requires special use permit applicants to submit a plan of operations consistent with the objectives of the national recreation area, including a reclamation plan. Directs the Secretary to file maps and legal descriptions of the wilderness and national recreation areas with specified congressional committees. States that the RARE II final environmental statement shall not be subject to judicial review concerning the national forest system lands in Pennsylvania. States that the wilderness designation under this Act is not a congressional intent to create buffer zones around such wilderness area."
