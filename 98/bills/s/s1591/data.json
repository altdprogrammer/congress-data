Directs the Commission to study: (1) the impact of the Supreme Court decision in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha, et. al., declaring legislative vetoes to be unconstitutional on existing legislation containing such veto provisions and on the exercise by the executive branch of broad discretionary powers delegated by Congress; and (2) possible alternatives to such vetoes, including Constitutional amendments, necessary for Congress to oversee the exercise of delegated powers by the executive branch. Directs the Commission to submit its final report to Congress within one year after its first meeting. Terminates the Commission 90 days after such report is submitted. Authorizes appropriations."
