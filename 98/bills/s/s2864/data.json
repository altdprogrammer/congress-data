Prohibits the unauthorized use of a computer when such conduct modifies, destroys, discloses information or prevents the authorized use of a computer operated for or on behalf of the U.S. government. Makes it an offense to attempt to commit or to be a party to a conspiracy to commit such an offense. Increases the penalty for subsequent offenses. Grants authority to the U.S. Secret Service to investigate offenses under this Act. Requires the Attorney General to report annually to Congress about prosecutions under this Act during the first three years after its enactment."
