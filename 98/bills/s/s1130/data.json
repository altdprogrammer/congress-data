Eliminates provisions that authorize the Director of ACTION to provide allowances, services, and support to operate special volunteer programs. Excludes stipends received by participants in the National Older Americans Volunteer Programs as income or compensation for purposes of workers' compensation laws. Grants the Director subpoena authority in conducting audits of the records of Federal grant, loan, or contract recipients under the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 and 1985 for: (1) service learning programs and special volunteer programs; (2) the Retired Senior Volunteer Program; (3) the Foster Grandparent Program and Older American Community Services Programs; and (4) administration of such Act."
