Limits the amount of scholarship and fellowship awards which may be excluded from gross income to the amount of tuition and related expenses.

Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a study on how the incorporation into the tax system of certain tax principles relating to the taxation of income from a trade or business, the taxation of corporations, the elimination of preferential tax treatment for specific industries, and the taxation of individuals would affect the national economy, Federal revenues, and the competitive balance between corporations and unincorporated trade and businesses."
