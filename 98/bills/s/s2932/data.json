    "text": "Amends the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 to: (1) authorize appropriations for FY 1985 and 1986, including appropriations for the State grant programs; and (2) direct the Secretary of Transportation to submit directly to Congress on April 15 of each year the annual reports required of the Secretary under each Act. (Current law requires that the reports be submitted to the President for transmittal to Congress on June 15 of each year.) Declares that the following acts unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce and prohibits any State or subdivision of a State from: (1) assessing natural gas transmission property at a value that has a higher ratio to the true market value of the natural gas transmission property than the ratio that the assessed value of commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction has to the true market value of such commercial and industrial property; (2) levying or collecting a tax on an assessment that may not be made under clause (1) of this paragraph; (3) levying or collecting an ad valorem property tax on natural gas transmission property at a tax rate that exceeds the tax rate applicable to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction; and (4) imposing another tax that discriminates against a natural gas company subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Permits relief only if the ratio of assessed value to true market value exceeds, by at least five percent, the ratio of assessed value to true market value of commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction."
