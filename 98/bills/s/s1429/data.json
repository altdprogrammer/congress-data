Rept. 98-955) Small Business Development Center Improvement Act of 1984 - Amends the Small Business Act to require that the term for grants under the Small Business Development Center program be based upon a calendar year or coincide with the Federal fiscal year. Provides that such program, pursuant to a negotiated cooperative agreement between the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the applicant, shall deliver assistance to the small business community under the management and oversight of the SBA. Requires as a condition to the award of any grant to assist in the establishment of small business development centers, that a matching amount equal to the grant amount be provided by non-Federal sources and be comprised of not less than 50 percent cash and not more than 50 percent of indirect costs and in-kind contributions. Provides for the continuation of financial assistance to establish small business development centers under the Small Business Development Center program. Requires the facilities and staff of each small business development center to be located in such places as to provide maximum accessibility and benefits to small businesses. Requires such centers to have a full-time director who shall have the authority to make expenditures under the center's budget. Authorizes and directs the National Science Foundation to cooperate with the SBA and with small business development centers in developing and establishing programs to support such centers. Requires the National Small Business Development Center Advisory Board to meet at least semiannually and at the call of the Chairman of the Board. (Currently, the Board is required to meet quarterly.) Requires each small business development center to establish an advisory board. Requires the SBA, within six months of the date of enactment of this Act, to develop and implement a program for onsite evaluation of each small business development center. Requires such evaluation to be conducted at least once every two years (currently, such evaluations are conducted annually) and to provide for the participation of a representative of at least one other small business development center on a cost-reimbursement basis. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 and 1986 and every year thereafter for: (1) the small business development center program; (2) expenses of the National Small Business Development Center Advisory Board; and (3) reimbursement to small business development centers for participation in the evaluations of such centers. Extends the Small Business Development Center program through October 1, 1990. Prohibits the SBA from funding any small business development center except as authorized by this Act."
