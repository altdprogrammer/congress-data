Requires the President to transmit to the Congress, within a specified time period, the recommendations for rates of pay of Members of Congress, legislative, and judicial employees. Prohibits the House of Representatives and the Senate from considering any bill or joint resolution carrying an appropriation for compensation of Members of Congress for any fiscal year if such bill or joint resolution carries an appropriation, or a limitation on appropriations, for any other purpose."
