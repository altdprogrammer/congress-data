    "text": "Alien Social Security Benefits Equalization and Limitation Act of 1983 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to exclude from the definitions of \"wages\" and \"self-employment income\" for purposes of determining OASDI eligibility those wages paid to and the self-employment earnings of an individual who, during the time period in which he or she receives such wages or earnings, is not a U.S. citizen or national or a permanent resident. Limits the amount of benefits to be paid in the case of: (1) individuals who are not U.S. citizens or nationals and who have been outside the United States for more than six consecutive months while entitled to benefits; and (2) their dependents and survivors. Provides that the amount of benefits to be paid to such an individual shall be limited to: (1) the total amount of social security taxes paid on the wages and self-employment income on which such benefits are based if the individual is the only person entitled to such benefits; or (2) a portion of the social security taxes paid on the wages and self- employment income on which such benefits are based if the individual is one of several persons entitled to such benefits. Provides that the limitation on benefits under this Act shall not preclude an individual from receiving benefits on the basis of wages and self-employment income other than the wages and self-employment income on which his or her entitlement was based while he or she was outside the United States for more than six consecutive months. Makes such limitation on benefits inapplicable in any case where its application would contravene a U.S. treaty obligation or an international social security agreement between the United States and another country. Eliminates the cost of living adjustment in OASDI benefits in the case of individuals who are not U.S. citizens or nationals and who have been outside the United States for more than six consecutive months while entitled to such benefits."
