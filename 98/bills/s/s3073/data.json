Sets forth: (1) the method for determining the size of a State's grant; and (2) the requirements a State must meet in order to receive a grant. Requires the grants to be made from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Limits the annual aggregate amount of such grants to a specified amount. Requires each State receiving a grant to establish an advisory board to develop recommendations for State policy in supporting graduate medical education and other clinical training activities, and to advise the State with respect to grant allocation requirements. Excludes from reasonable cost the direct costs of graduate medical education and other clinical training activities."
