Amends the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 to require the Secretary of Transportation to pay to each State maritime academy, beginning with FY 1984, the amount of fuel costs estimated to be consumed by its training vessels. Limits such payments to amounts provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Sets forth conditions under which vessels constructed under a construction-differential subsidy, which are limited to foreign trade, may enter into the coastwise domestic trade."
