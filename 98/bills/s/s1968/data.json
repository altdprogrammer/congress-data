    "text": "National Institute for the Biological Assessment of Nuclear Explosions - Establishes the National Institute for the Biological Assessment of Nuclear Explosions as an independent Government agency. Authorizes the Institute to: (1) conduct research on the worldwide biological and environmental effects of simulated nuclear war or explosions; (2) provide grants and other support for similar research by scholars and scientists; (3) make the results of such research available to the public and establish means for disseminating related information; (4) secure information from other Federal agencies if the release of such information would not jeopardize national security or interfere with agency functions; and (5) conduct studies for other agencies. Prohibits the agency from attempting to influence the passage or defeat of any legislation by the Congress, the United Nations, or any State or local legislative body. Allows Institute personnel to testify before such bodies upon request. Requires the Director of the Institute to submit annual reports of the Institute's findings to the President and Congress. Authorizes appropriations for the Institute in specified amounts for FY 1984 and 1985, and for subsequent fiscal years in such amounts as are authorized by Congress."
