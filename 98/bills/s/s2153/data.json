    "text": "Federal Employees Health Benefits Information Act of 1983 - Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish a Federal Employees Health Benefits Information Center which shall maintain a national information clearinghouse and disseminate information on the various health benefit plans available to Federal employees, assist employees and annuitants in understanding such information, and identify problems or deficiencies in any of the health benefit plans available. Requires that carriers be allowed to make written comments on any information relating to their plans which is to be so disseminated and prohibits the dissemination of such information until OPM has reviewed such comments and made any necessary changes in the information. Requires OPM to make a continuing study of: (1) the operation and administration of the Federal employees health benefits program; and (2) the costs, benefits, and coverage under plans available to Federal employees and how they compare with the costs, benefits, and coverage under plans available to employees in private industry. Requires OPM to submit annually to specified congressional committees information relating to recent developments in the health care field and recommendation for legislative or administrative action which may be appropriate. Sets aside funding for the procurement of experts and consultants and for experiments and demonstration projects with respect to improving the quality or timeliness of the information to be provided by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Information Center. Provides that before the start of any contract term in which an adjustment is to be made in the rates or benefits under a health benefits plan or if a newly approved health benefits plan is offered or an existing plan is terminated, there shall be provided an open season of at least three weeks during which Federal employees or annuitants enrolled in health benefits plans may transfer to another plan or cancel their enrollment. Requires OPM to make available to employees and annuitants eligible to enroll in a health benefits plan a description of the types of information and services available from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Information Center and the procedures for obtaining such information and services. Requires that employees and annuitants enrolled in a health benefits plan be notified of any changes in rates charged or benefits provided under such plan."
