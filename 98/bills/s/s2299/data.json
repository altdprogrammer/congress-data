Makes it unlawful for any person to solicit or receive money for arranging for an adoption or for a placement for permanent free care. Provides for the following exceptions: (1) licensed agencies; (2) fees received for professional legal or medical services; and (3) if such person is the natural parent of a child or the prospective adoptive parent. Provides for imprisonment for not more than five years and/or a fine of not more than $10,000. Makes it a Federal offense for any person to use force or duress to cause any other individual to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in connection with an adoption. Provides for imprisonment for not more than ten years or a fine of not more than $20,000. Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978 to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) review model adoption legislation and procedures and propose necessary changes to insure against fraudulent practices; (2) coordinate with national, State and volunteer organizations to improve State adoption legislation; and (3) assist States in the development of improved procedures for controlling illegal adoption practices. Grants the Federal district courts jurisdiction to hear any civil action involving fraudulent adoption practices regardless of the amount in controversy."
