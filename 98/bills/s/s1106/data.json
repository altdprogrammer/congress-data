Authorizes appropriations for specified plant and capital equipment necessary for national security programs. Title II: General Provisions - Prohibits the use of funds authorized under this Act where the costs of the program exceed 105 percent of the program authorization or the costs exceed by more than $10,000,000 the amount authorized by this Act, whichever is the lesser. Prohibits the use of funds authorized by this Act for programs which have not been presented to, or requested of Congress, unless 30 calendar days have elapsed since the Secretary of the Energy has presented to all the appropriate congressional committees a full and complete statement of the action proposed. Allows the written waiver of such requirement where such waiver is approved in writing by each appropriate committee of Congress. Authorizes the Secretary to start any general plant project only if the maximum estimated cost of such project does not exceed $1,000,000. Sets forth procedures for approval of projects that exceed the 25 percent estimated cost provision, and exempts from such procedures any project which has an estimated cost of less than $5,000,000. Allows the transfer of funds from specified projects to other Government agencies for the performance of work for which the appropriation is made. Authorizes the Secretary to perform construction design services for construction projects in support of national security programs as appropriated under this Act. Directs the Secretary to notify the appropriate committees of Congress in writing of specific cost overruns. Authorizes funds for emergency construction design and pay increases."
