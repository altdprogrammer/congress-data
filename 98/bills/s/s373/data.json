Requires the Commission to: (1) conduct at least one public meeting in Alaska annually; (2) publish a statement of the goals and objectives of Arctic research to guide the Office of Arctic Research; and (3) submit an annual report on its activities to the President and Congress. Requires all Federal agencies to consult with the Commission before undertaking major Federal actions relating to Arctic research. Designates the National Science Foundation (NSF) as the lead agency responsible for implementing Arctic research policy. Directs the President to establish an Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee which shall be composed of representatives of the following agencies: (1) NSF; (2) the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, State, Transportation, Health and Human Services, and the Interior; (3) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and (4) the Environmental Protection Agency. Permits the same agencies to designate representatives to report to and advise the Commission on agency activities relating to Arctic research. Directs the Committee to: (1) survey Arctic research conducted by public and private bodies to determine priorities for future research; (2) develop an integrated national Arctic research policy that will guide Federal agencies in implementing Arctic research programs; (3) consult with the Commission on the national Arctic research policy, the five-year plan implementing such policy, future Arctic research, and guidelines for agencies for awarding and administering research grants; (4) provide for the preparation of a single, multiagency budget request for Arctic research; (5) promote cooperation between the Federal Government and State, local, and foreign governments and among Federal agencies in Arctic research activities; (6) cooperate with the Governor of Alaska; and (7) provide for public participation in the development and implementation of national Arctic research policy. Directs the Committee to submit a biennial report to the President and Congress on its activities and the Commission's activities. Requires the Committee to prepare, submit to the President for transmittal to Congress, and biennally update a comprehensive five-year plan for the overall Federal effort in Arctic research. Requires the plan to include: (1) an assessment of needs regarding the Arctic and research to address them; (2) a statement of the Committee's goals and objectives for national Arctic research; (3) a listing of all existing Federal programs related to the Arctic, including goals, funds currently being expended, and funding levels for the next five years; (4) recommendations for program changes and other proposals; and (5) a description of actions taken by the Director and the Office to coordinate the budget review process to insure interagency cooperation in carrying out programs and eliminating duplication among programs. Directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to review all agency and department budget requests related to the Arctic. Directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to consider all Federal agency requests related to Arctic research as one integrated multiagency request and to review such request for adherence to the five-year plan prior to submission of the President's annual budget request. Directs the Commission to review the multiagency request after submission and to report to Congress on its adherence to the five-year plan.
