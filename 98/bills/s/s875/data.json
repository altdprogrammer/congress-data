Provides that a defendant who traffics in goods or services that are alleged to be counterfeit shall be immune from civil or criminal liability established by this Act if adequate labeling and adequate notice to the trademark registrant were provided. Permits any injured owner of a mark registered on the principal register of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to sue for either treble claimant's damages or treble defendant's profits, whichever is greater, and costs in Federal district court. Permits the United States Olympic Committee to bring such an action. Authorizes the court to issue appropriate orders including: (1) temporary restraining orders on notice to the defendant; (2) ex parte temporary restraining orders; and (3) ex parte orders for the seizure of counterfeit goods. Establishes procedures for an ex parte seizure order. Provides that if a court finds goods to be counterfeit in either a criminal or civil case, it may, after reasonable notice to the U.S. attorney, order the goods destroyed. Allows punitive damages to a defendant in a civil action when a cause of action is brought in bad faith."
