    "text": "Brokered Deposits Act of 1984 - Amends the National Housing Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to define the terms \"deposit broker\" and \"short-term account\" for the purposes of such Acts. Prohibits the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) from promulgating any rule or regulation or issuing any order or interpretation which would cause the deposit insurance available to a person for deposits or accounts placed by or through a deposit broker to differ from deposit insurance available to such person for deposits or accounts not placed by or through a deposit broker. Prohibits an insured institution from accepting or maintaining short- term insured accounts placed by or through a deposit broker in excess of the lesser of: (1) 200 percent of the institution's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus; or (2) 15 percent of its total deposits. Prohibits an insured institution whose unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus amounts to less than three percent of its liabilities from having any insured accounts placed by or through a deposit broker. Authorizes the FSLIC and the FDIC to permit an insured institution, upon notice and application, to obtain short-term insured accounts placed by or through a deposit broker in excess of such limitations, giving equal weight to both competitive factors and safety and soundness considerations."
