Requires the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary), not later than October 1 of each year, to compute the annual import ceilings for steel pipe and tube articles. Provides for intra-annual adjustments for such ceilings. Requires the Secretary to consult with the European Community if it appears that the annual import ceilings for any year are likely to be exceeded. Requires the Secretary to seek an agreement with the European Community which will result in compliance with the import ceilings for the rest of the year. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to enforce the import ceilings if an agreement cannot be reached with the European Community. Permits adjustment of the import ceiling if domestic manufacturers cannot meet the demand for steel pipe and tube products."
