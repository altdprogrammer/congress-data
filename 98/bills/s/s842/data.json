Defines \"small business participating debenture\" (SBPD) as a written debt instrument issued by a qualified small business which: (1) is a general obligation of such business; (2) bears interest at not less than specified by the Secretary of the Treasury; (3) has a fixed maturity; (4) grants no voting or conversion rights in the business to the purchaser; and (5) provides for the payment of a share of the issuer's total earnings. Defines \"qualified small business\" as one: (1) whose equity capital does not exceed $10,000,000; (2) the face value of whose outstanding SBPD's does not exceed $1,000,000; and (3) which has no outstanding securities subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allows an interest expense deduction for interest and share of earnings payments made on such debentures. Treats losses on small business participating debentures as ordinary losses."
