Provides for adjustments to the excise tax on noncommercial aviation fuel (presently 12 cents per gallon on gasoline and 14 cents per gallon on jet fuel). Sets forth a formula for the calculation of such adjustments based on total amounts appropriated from the Aviation Trust Fund each fiscal year. Exempts from the special fuels excise tax any fuel used in aircraft involved in agricultural activities. Provides for adjustments to: (1) the passenger ticket tax; (2) the cargo waybill tax; and (3) the excise tax on aircraft tires and tubes."
