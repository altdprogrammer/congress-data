    "text": "Department of Defense Procurement Procedures Act of 1983 - Sets forth a formula for determining the applicable percentage of Department of Defense procurement of property and services which must be made through formal advertising for fiscal years after FY 1983. Prohibits the Department of Defense from expending funds for negotiated contracts in any fiscal year following a fiscal year where the purchases and contracts made through formal advertising fell below the applicable percentage. Removes such prohibition if the Department meets or exceeds the applicable percentage during or after that fiscal year. Requires that specified information concerning a negotiated contract be part of the records of the contracting agency, including all cost and pricing data submitted by a contractor and the name of each Government official who participated in the negotiating or awarding of such contract. Requires that agency records on negotiated contracts containing classified information be maintained for at least ten years and be made available to Congress and the Comptroller General upon request. Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish procedures which are similar to formal advertising procedures for the purchase of or contracting for personal or professional services. Sets forth investigatory procedures to determine the need for and price of services by a university or other educational institution."
