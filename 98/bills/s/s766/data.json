    "text": "Acidic Deposition Study and Sulfur Emission Limitation Act of 1983 - Amends title I (Air Pollution Prevention and Control) of the Clean Air Act to establish a program of acid deposition analysis and mitigation. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, within the five-fiscal-year period following the submission of the final comprehensive National Acid Precipitation Plan under the Energy Security Act, to report on acid deposition to specified congressional committees. Sets forth requirements relating to such report. Directs the Administrator to solicit data, views, and comments from State and other Federal agencies which are carrying out studies and research relating to acid deposition. Prohibits the Administrator from approving State implementation plan revisions, during the five-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act until a date six months after submission of the Administrator's report under this Act, which would increase the annual allowable emissions of sulfur dioxide for any existing major stationary source. Sets forth exemptions from such prohibition under specified circumstances. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to any State or interstate agency, to develop, refine, demonstrate, and implement methods of: (1) neutralizing or restoring the buffering capacity of bodies of water that have become so acidic as to endanger game fish species; (2) removing from bodies of water toxic metals or other toxic substances mobilized by increased acidity; and (3) reducing or neutralizing acidity which can be shown to be harmful to valuable forest ecosystems. Prohibits such grants being made for any project in an amount exceeding 75 percent of costs. Encourages State Governors to: (1) establish and designate appropriate regional acid deposition corridors comprising several States; and (2) negotiate appropriate measures to reduce emissions of acid deposition pollutants, taking into consideration actions taken and planned by the various States and Canada to control sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, future economic growth in the corridors, employment impact, public health and welfare, consumer costs, and equity among the States. Directs the Administrator to cooperate with and to provide technical assistance for such State efforts. Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator for the five fiscal years following the date of enactment of this Act, to prepare the report on acid deposition and to make grants to State or interstate agencies."
