    "text": "Gifted and Talented Children's Education Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to add this Act as part A (Gifted and Talented Children) of title IX (Additional Programs) of ESEA. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1988 for programs for gifted and talented children. Directs the Secretary of Education to reserve 25 percent of such appropriations or $5,000,000, whichever is less, for carrying out discretionary programs. Requires that the remainder of such appropriations be available for State programs. Sets forth provisions for State programs. Directs the Secretary to make grants to State educational agencies (SEAs) for the Federal share of the costs of planning, developing, operating, and improving programs to meet the educational needs of gifted and talented children at the preschool, elementary, and secondary levels. Permits such programs to include inservice training of personnel to teach such children. Directs the Secretary, in any fiscal year in which appropriations for such State programs are less than $15,000,000, to distribute such funds so that each SEA with an approved application receives at least $50,000. Provides for ratable reductions when appropriations are not sufficient to pay such required minimum amount to each SEA. Directs the Secretary, in any fiscal year in which such appropriations equal or exceed $15,000,000, to follow specified State allotment provisions. Requires SEA applications for such grants to contain specified assurances, including the assurance that appropriate consideration will be given to the particular educational needs of disadvantaged gifted and talented children. Prohibits a SEA from reserving more than ten percent of grant funds for program administration, technical assistance, coordination, and statewide planning. Requires a SEA to distribute, on a competitive basis, at least 90 percent of grant funds to local educational agencies (LEAs) which apply, with due regard for the quality of the proposed activities. Requires a SEA to use at least 50 percent of grant funds for programs and projects which include a component for the identification and education of disadvantaged gifted and talented children from low-income families. Permits use of grant funds for instructional equipment only if such equipment will enhance the program or project. Prohibits SEA approval of an LEA application unless the needs of children in nonprofit private elementary and secondary schools have been taken into account. Requires the SEA to provide technical assistance for proposals and programs of LEAs which are unable to compete due to smaller size or lack of financial resources. Requires that an opportunity for a hearing be afforded before the Secretary may disapprove an application which does not meet specified requirements. Sets forth provisions for discretionary programs relating to education of gifted and talented children. Authorizes the Secretary, from amounts reserved for discretionary programs, to pay the Federal share of the costs of grants or contracts to SEAs, LEAs, institutions of higher education, and other public or private organizations for: (1) projects designed to meet the educational needs of such children; (2) personnel training and supervision; (3) model projects for identification and education of such children; (4) an information clearinghouse; (5) statewide planning, development, operation, and improvement of projects and programs; and (6) research, evaluation, and related activities. Permits transfer to the National Institute of Education (NIE) of up to 20 percent of funds for such discretionary programs. Limits to 20 percent that portion of such funds which may be used for grants to institutions of higher education for the training of national leadership personnel. Sets forth application requirements for discretionary program grants and contracts. Applies specified ESEA requirements relating to private school pupil and teacher participation in such discretionary programs, unless such requirements cannot be legally met in the State. Permits NIE to carry out a program of research and related activities, including experimental and model schools, pertaining to the education of gifted and talented children from funds transferred for such purpose, notwithstanding specified provisions of the General Education Provisions Act. Sets forth provisions for State allotments in any fiscal year in which appropriations for gifted and talented children programs equal or exceed $15,000,000. Directs the Secretary to allot up to one percent of such appropriations, in accordance with their respective needs, among: (1) specified territories and possessions of the United States; (2) programs in schools operated for Indian children by the Department of the Interior; and (3) programs in overseas dependent schools of the Department of Defense. Directs the Secretary to allot the remainder among applicant States on the basis of numbers of children aged five through 17, with a $50,000 minimum allotment to each State. Sets forth provisions for reallotment of any State allotment exceeding the amount a State needs and will be able to use in a fiscal year. Directs the Secretary to designate an administrative unit within the Office of Education to administer and coordinate programs for gifted and talented children and youth. Provides that any Indian tribe which operates schools for its children shall be deemed an LEA for purposes of this Act. Limits financial assistance to any LEA to a five-year period, except assistance extended prior to the date of enactment of the Education Amendments of 1978. Makes the Federal share for any fiscal year 90 percent, but 100 percent for: (1) clearinghouse activities; (2) research, evaluation, and related activities; and (3) programs and projects involving participation of private school students. Makes conforming amendments to the Educational Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981. Makes a technical amendment to ESEA. Directs the Secretary of Education to reestablish the Office of Gifted and Talented in the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education."
