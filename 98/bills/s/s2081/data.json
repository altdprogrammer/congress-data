    "text": "Energy Information Administration Reports Reduction Act - Amends the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974 to repeal requirements that the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration promulgate rules requiring reports by persons engaged in the production, processing, refining, transportation by pipeline, or distribution of energy sources. Repeals the quarterly reporting requirements imposed on the Administrator with respect to energy imports, domestic energy reserves and production, refinery activities, and energy inventories as well as reporting requirements imposed by the Administrator on persons engaged in crude oil or natural gas production. Repeals the requirement under the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 that the Administrator maintain a file on U.S. exports of coal and refined petroleum products. Repeals requirements imposed upon the Energy Information Administration under the Department of Energy Organization Act for financial reports from major energy-producing companies and for annual reports to the Department of Energy. Repeals coal reserve disclosure requirements imposed on persons or governmental entities holding such reserves under the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978. Repeals the middle distillate monitoring program under the Emergency Conservation Act of 1979. Amends the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 to require that reports on energy supply and consumption done by the Administrator are less detailed than those required under current law."
