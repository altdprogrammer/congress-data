    "text": "Trade Improvements Act - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require that import relief actions recommended by the International Trade Commission shall take effect even though the President proposes different actions, unless Congress approves the presidential actions within 90 days of receiving such proposal. Requires a specified voting procedure. Requires the President to impose the action which was recommended by the Commission within 15 days after the end of the 90 day period, if Congress does not approve the presidential proposal. Provides that any import relief recommended by the Commission shall take effect within 15 days after the import relief determination date, unless the President announces on such date an intention to negotiate certain marketing agreements (in which case import relief shall take effect within 90 days after the import relief determination date). Authorizes the President to reduce or terminate any import relief after making a certain determination and seeking advice from the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Commerce and the chairmen of certain congressional committees. Makes conforming amendments. Requires the Commission to determine whether an article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a considerable cause (currently, a substantial cause) of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing like or competitive articles. Makes conforming amendments to reflect the considerable cause standard. Authorizes certain congressional committees to file resolutions with the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) requesting the President to take import relief action under the Trade Act of 1974. Requires the USTR to: (1) initiate an investigation regarding the issues raised in such resolutions; (2) publish such resolutions in the Federal Register; and (3) provide an opportunity for public comment on the resolution. Requires the USTR to request consultation with the foreign country or instrumentality concerned, upon an affirmative determination of a petition or resolution requesting the President to take import relief action. Makes conforming amendments."
