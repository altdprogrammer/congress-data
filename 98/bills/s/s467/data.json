Includes the following activities within the scope of this prohibition: (1) performance of an abortion by a Federal agency; (2) use of appropriated funds to perform or reimburse or refer for abortions; (3) promotion or assistance in the performance of abortions abroad; (4) contracting for insurance which pays or reimburses for abortions; (5) discrimination against an individual on the basis of that person's opposition to abortions; and (6) the withholding from a handicapped infant of nutritional sustenance, medical or surgical treatment by an institution receiving Federal assistance. Provides for expedited Supreme Court review of State laws restricting abortions or infanticide whenever such laws have been invalidated by a lower court."
