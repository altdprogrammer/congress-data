    "text": "Emergency Structural Unemployment Relief Act of 1983 - Title I: Training Block Grants - Authorizes appropriations for the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act through FY 1984 to carry out this title. Provides that any such appropriations not obligated or expended prior to the end of FY 1984 may be obligated and expended pursuant to specified provisions of the Job Training Partnership Act. Allots a specified amount of such funds to specified U.S. territories and possessions. Allots the remainder among the States (defined as the States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and specified U.S. territories and possessions) on the basis of relative numbers of: (1) unemployed residents of areas of substantial unemployment; (2) \"excess\" (number of unemployed above four and one-half percent of the civilian labor force in the State or in areas of substantial unemployment) unemployed residents; and (3) economically disadvantaged residents, with specified exceptions. Directs the Secretary of Labor to determine such allotments within 15 days of enactment of this Act. Makes eligible for program participation unemployed individuals who either lack job skills or have job skills which are no longer in demand in the labor market area in which they reside. Requires the appropriate U.S. Employment Service office in the State or the State employment agency to make such determination and issue a certification to applicants who meet such requirements. Allows such training block grants to be used for training assistance payments to business concerns. Requires States desiring to receive such block grants to apply to the Secretary. Sets forth application requirements. Directs the Secretary to approve applications which meet such requirements within 20 days of receipt. Sets forth provisions for restrictions on: (1) training grant program payments to businesses which discharge participants without cause; and (2) unemployment compensation benefits to participants who voluntarily leave jobs under the program. Provides for adjudication procedures relating to such restrictions. Sets forth training block grant program provisions relating to: (1) payments; (2) withholding of payments; (3) audit; (4) nondiscrimination; and (5) administration. Title II: Employment Guidance Programs for Secondary School Youth - Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to make grants to public agencies and nonprofit private organizations with special competence in job training and counseling of secondary school students to establish and operate programs for job training, counseling, remedial education, and placement services in secondary schools to enhance the employability of secondary school students. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983, which may be available for obligation and expenditure in the succeeding fiscal year. Requires applications for such grants to meet requirements set by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary, to the extent practicable, to attempt to obtain equitable distributions for such grants among the 50 States and the District of Columbia."
