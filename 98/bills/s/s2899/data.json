    "text": "American Conservation Corps Act of 1984 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, to establish and administer a public lands conservation, rehabilitation, and improvement program called the American Conservation Corps. Requires the Secretary to provide assistance to program agencies (any Federal or State agency responsible for the management of public lands) to establish and operate residential and nonresidential conservation centers to implement program projects. Describes the types of projects which will receive program preference. Limits program projects to those on public lands or Indian lands, except where projects on nonpublic lands provide documented public benefits. Sets forth requirements for establishing conservation centers and eligibility criteria for enrollees in the program. Makes persons eligible for enrollment and employment in the program if they are: (1) unemployed; (2) between the ages of 16 and 25 years; and (3) citizens, lawful permanent residents, or lawfully admitted alien parolees or refugees. Provides that in the selection of enrollees for the program, preference shall be given to economically, socially, physically, and educationally disadvantaged youth and youth residing in areas having substantial unemployment. Requires program agencies to provide services, facilities, supplies, and equipment for conservation centers as the Secretary deems necessary. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to, or enter into agreements with, program agencies for the funding and operation of conservation centers. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1988. Requires that such appropriations come from specified Treasury receipts. States that program enrollees shall not be deemed Federal employees, except for certain purposes. Imposes service obligations upon all but summer enrollees to: (1) work 40 hours per week; (2) make specified contributions to an educational trust fund; and (3) serve at least six months. Directs the Secretary to make arrangements with educational institutions to award academic credit to enrollees for competencies developed under this Act. Authorizes program agencies to make arrangements with such institutions for academic study by enrollees during nonworking hours. Requires program agencies to provide certification of skills acquired by program participants and to provide job guidance and placement information as necessary. Establishes in the Treasury the American Conservation Corps Education Trust Fund. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, as trustee of such Trust Fund, to report annually to the Congress regarding its status. Authorizes enrollees to withdraw certain amounts from the Trust Fund to attend specified educational institutions within six years after their completed service in this program. Directs the Secretary to submit an annual report to the President and Congress detailing the activities carried out under this Act. Entitles to an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board any Federal employee displaced by activities under this Act. Grants similar appeal rights to the employees of any displaced contract grantee."
