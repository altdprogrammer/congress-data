    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-06-28", 
    "text": "Civil Service Former Spouses Benefits Act of 1984 - Authorizes a retiring or retired Federal employee or Member of Congress, with the written consent of such individual's current spouse, to: (1) elect to receive a reduced annuity in order to provide a survivor annuity to one or more former spouses; and (2) modify such election at any time. Authorizes a State or District of Columbia court to order such an election in a decree of divorce or annulment or in a related property settlement agreement. Repeals a provision of Federal law terminating a survivor annuity if the surviving spouse remarries before becoming 60 years of age. Limits the maximum amount of such survivor annuity to 55 percent of the deceased employee's or Member's annuity. Bases the order of precedence of an entitlement of a spouse, widow, widower, or former spouse to such survivor annuity on the order in which the Office of Personnel Management receives notice of the employee's or Member's election to provide for such survivor annuity. Provides that the designation of only a portion of an annuity as the basis for a survivor annuity or the notification not to provide for a survivor annuity by an employee or Member shall not be valid without the notorized written consent of the affected spouse. Entitles the former spouse of a retired Member or employee who died before enactment of this Act to a survivor annuity provided such former spouse was married to such Member or employee when such Member or employee retired, unless: (1) the Member or employee notified the Office of Personnel Management that he or she did not want to provide for a survivor annuity; or (2) the Member or employee is survived by a widower or widow whom he or she married after retirement and for whom a survivor annuity has been provided. Permits a Federal employee's or retiree's former spouse who was enrolled in a Federal employee health benefits plan as a family member of such employee or retiree immediately before dissolution of the marriage to enroll in such plan as an individual and to transfer enrollment under the same conditions that apply to employees. Requires the former spouse to contribute the full subscription price for such enrollment. Directs OPM to publicize such entitlement of former spouses to health insurance and to carry out a program of open enrollment for eligible former spouses."
