Requires the Secretary to make grants to each institute to be matched at specified rates by non-Federal dollars. Requires each institute, prior to the receipt of funds each fiscal year, to submit to the Secretary a water research program. Requires the Secretary to establish procedures for a detailed evaluation of each institute to determine whether such institute warrants continued Federal support. Provides for such evaluations within two years of establishment and for reevaluations at intervals not to exceed four years. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1989. Permits the Secretary to make additional grants (on a dollar-for-dollar matching basis) to other qualified institutions and agencies of local or State government for research concerning any aspect of a water-related problem which the Secretary may deem to be in the national interest. States the application requirements for such grants. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1989. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to certain organizations for technology development concerning any aspect of water-related technology which the Secretary may deem to be of State, regional, or national importance. Authorizes the Secretary to establish any condition for the matching of funds for such grants in the best interest of the Nation considering the technology needs for water resources. States the requirements for applications for grants under this section. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1989. Repeals the Water Research and Development Act of 1978. Requires that rules and regulations established under such Act shall remain in effect until superseded by new rules and regulations promulgated under this Act. Title II: Directs the Secretary to convey to the city of Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, by January 24, 1984, and without consideration all right, title, and interest of the United States in real property located in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, known as the Wrightsville Beach Test Facility.
