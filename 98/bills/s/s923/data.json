    "text": "Mathematics and Science Education Assistance Act of 1983 - Title I: Grants to States for the Improvement of Skills of Teachers of Mathematics and Science in Elementary and Secondary Schools - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to States for training of elementary and secondary school teachers who wish to earn a degree in science or mathematics. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for FY 1984 through 1986. Directs the Secretary to: (1) reserve one percent of such funds for payments to specified U.S. territories and possessions; and (2) allocate the remaining funds among the States (including the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) on the basis of each State's relative number of children aged five through 17. Permits a State to use such grants for grants or loans to teachers wishing to study at an institution of higher education to earn a science or mathematics degree. Requires each State desiring such grants to submit to the Secretary a plan for its teacher assistance program. Lists plan requirements, including requirements that: (1) the State will make stipends to each participating teacher equal to 80 percent of the teacher's compensation for up to two years of study; (2) the State will loan each teacher up to $2,000 each year for educational expenses for not more than two years; (3) each teacher receiving assistance will agree to work as a mathematics or science teacher in an elementary or secondary school in the State for at least five years; (4) the State will cancel 20 percent of any loan to such teacher for each year of service in compliance with such agreement or will establish procedures for the prompt repayment of any loan by a teacher who fails to comply with such agreement; and (5) an annual report will be submitted to the Secretary identifying the number of teachers participating in the program and the local educational agencies at which the teachers were working prior to participating in such program. Directs the Secretary to withhold funds from any State he or she finds has failed to comply with plan requirements until he or she is satisfied that there is no longer such failure to comply. Title II: Grants to Local Education Agencies for the Acquisition of Mathematics and Science Equipment and Materials - Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States to pay for the acquisition of instructional equipment and materials for use in providing elementary and secondary education in mathematics and science. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for FY 1984 through 1986. Sets forth fund reservation and allocation requirements which are identical to such requirements under title I. Permits a State to use such grants for grants to local educational agencies for the acquisition of such equipment and materials. Requires each State desiring such grants to submit to the Secretary a plan for its acquisition program. Lists plan requirements, including requirements that: (1) the State will distribute 95 percent of its funds among local educational agencies based on each agency's need for equipment and materials; and (2) each local educational agency will use 75 percent of the funds it receives in secondary schools and 25 percent in elementary schools. Applies provisions of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 that require local educational agencies to provide equal expenditures and educational services to students of private and public schools to the assistance program under this title. Title III: State Councils on Education in Mathematics and Science - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1986 for allotments by the Secretary to States that establish a State Council on Education in Mathematics and Science. Requires that each State Council be appointed by the chief school officer of the State, subject to the approval of the State board of education. Directs each Council to: (1) examine the needs of public agencies, private nonprofit organizations, and businesses within the State for personnel who are well trained in mathematics and science; (2) assess the need for improving secondary and elementary mathematics and science programs; and (3) recommend ways to improve such programs. Requires a State to apply for assistance under this title."
