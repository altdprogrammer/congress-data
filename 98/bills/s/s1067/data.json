Requires an annual report to Congress on the implementation of this strategy. Directs the President, within one year of enactment of this Act, to submit a comprehensive report to Congress on such strategy. Amends the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 to authorize the President, in furtherance of the purposes of such Act, to provide for visits between the United States and other countries of experts in environmental science and environmental management. Provides for the financing of such program."
