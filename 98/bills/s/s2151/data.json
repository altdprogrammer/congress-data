    "text": "Public Capital Investment Act of 1984 - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to make grants to any State for the purpose of the construction or rehabilitation of public capital investment projects. Authorizes any State to submit to the Secretary an application for a public investment grant under this Act. Sets forth the requirements for such applications. Requires the Secretary to approve such an application upon a finding that the State has met the necessary requirements. Enumerates authorized uses for funds granted to States for public capital investment purposes. Provides that a qualifying State shall receive annual grants under this Act, provided that the Secretary does not find that such State has failed to maintain its program substantially as originally proposed. Requires the Secretary to prohibit additional grants where the Secretary determines that a State is failing to maintain its original program. Authorizes the use of grant funds by two or more States for the construction and rehabilitation of public capital investments of a regional character. Sets forth the method for allocating funds under this Act to individual States. Specifies the procedures for the return of grant funds if an application is either not received or not approved. Requires Federal agencies to expeditiously review and act upon any permit necessary for the construction and rehabilitation of any public capital investment undertaken by a non-Federal body. Requires the Secretary to report biennially to Congress concerning the disbursement of funds under this Title and the use of those funds by participating States. Amends the Clean Water Act to authorize States to use certain funds allotted to them for revolving loans or grants for the construction of waste water treatment works. Requires repayments of such loans to be made to the States. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through FY 1988."
