Requires the proceeds of such gifts or bequests to be deposited into an account in the National Archives Trust Fund and expended for the same purposes and objects for which appropriations for operating, maintaining, protecting, or improving such depository might be expended. Directs the Administrator to provide for the establishment in such Trust Fund of separate endowments for the maintenance of depository land, buildings, and equipment to which shall be credited any gift or bequest offered for that purpose. Restricts the use of the income of such endowments to the payment of maintenance or utility costs. Prohibits the Administrator from taking title to any land, building, or equipment for establishment of a depository unless a sufficient amount is available, by gift or bequest, for deposit into such endowments to cover the maintenance costs for such land, buildings, and equipment. Declares that no appropriated funds shall be available for such maintenance costs."
