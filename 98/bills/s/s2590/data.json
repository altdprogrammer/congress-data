Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental impact statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Tennessee shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Polk and Monroe Counties in Tennessee not designated as wilderness on or before the enactment of this Act from further review by the Secretary of Agriculture for their suitability as wilderness pending revision of initial national forest management plans and from management as wilderness areas. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to review the Big Frog Mountain Wilderness Study Area and the Little Frog Mountain Wilderness Study Area, both located in the Cherokee National Forest, to determine their suitability for preservation as wilderness."
