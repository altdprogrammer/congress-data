Enables any fund (whether set up for a vessel or for a processing facility) to be used to finance the purchase of either vessels or processing facilities. Provides for the transfer of monies from one fund to another. Allows contributions to a fund by more than one person. Prohibits the Secretary of Commerce from setting a minimum level for withdrawals from a fund. States that withdrawals may not be used for routine repairs and maintenance."
