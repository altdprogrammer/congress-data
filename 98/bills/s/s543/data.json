    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1984-10-02", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Wyoming Wilderness Act of 1984 - Title I: Short Title, Findings, and Purposes - Sets forth the short title, findings, and purposes of this Act. Title II: Additions to National Wilderness Preservation System - Designates the following lands in Wyoming as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Cloud Peak Wilderness in the Bighorn National Forest; (2) the Popo Agie Wilderness in the Shoshone National Forest; (3) the Gros Ventre Wilderness in the Bridger-Teton National Forest; (4) the Winegar Hole Wilderness in the Bridge-Teton National Forest; (5) Jedediah Smith Wilderness in the Targhee National Forest; (6) the Huston Park Wilderness in the Medicine Bow National Forest; (7) the Encampment River Wilderness Area in the Medicine Bow National Forest; (8) the Platte River Wilderness in the Medicine Bow and Routt National Forests of Wyoming and Colorado; (9) the Corridor Addition to the Teton Wilderness in the Bridge-Teton Wilderness; (10) the Silver Creek Addition to the Bridger Wilderness and the Newfork Lake Addition to the Bridger Wilderness in the Bridger-Teton National Forest; (11) the Glacier Addition to the Fitzpatrick Wilderness in the Shoshones National Forest; (12) the South Fork Addition to the Washakie Wilderness in the Shoshone National Forest; and (13) the High Lakes Addition to the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in the Shoshone National Forest. Abolishes the previous classification of the Cloud Peak Primitive Area, the Popo Agie Primitive Area, and the Glacier Primitive Area. Provides for the protection of the State II or III water development projects in Wyoming from the designation and existence of the Huston Park, Encampment River, Platte River, and Savage Run Wilderness. Title III: Wilderness Study Areas - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, upon revision of the initial land management plans for the Bridger-Teton, Targhee and Shoshone National Forests of Wyoming, to review the following lands as to their suitability for preservation as wilderness: (1) the Palisades Wilderness Study Area in the Bridger-Teton and Targhee National Forest; (2) the Shoal Creek Wilderness Study Area in the Bridger-Teton and Targhee National Forests; and (3) the High Lakes Wilderness Study Area in the Shoshone National Forest. Directs the Secretary to report to the President and the President to submit recommendations to Congress. Provides that, until Congress determines otherwise, the Palisades, High Lakes, and Shoal Creek Wilderness Study Areas shall be administered by the Secretary so as to maintain their presently existing wilderness character and potential for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation Systems, but provides that: (1) with respect to oil and gas exploration and development activities, the Palisades Wilderness Study Area shall be administered under reasonable conditions to protect the environment according to the laws and regulations generally applicable to nonwilderness lands within the National Forest System; and (2) the Palisades Wilderness Study Area is withdrawn from all forms of appropriation under the mining laws, subject to valid existing rights. Title IV: Release of Lands for Multiple Use Management - States that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental impact statement (dated January 1979) shall not be subject to judicial review with respect to national forest system lands in Wyoming. Releases national forest system lands in Wyoming which were reviewed in the RARE II from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Wyoming reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest sytem lands in Wyoming without express congressional authorization. Specifies additional lands to which this title applies, including national forest roadless lands in Wyoming of less than 5,000 acres. Title V: Miscellaneous Provisions - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to review Department of Agriculture policies and practices regarding livestock grazing in Wyoming's wilderness areas to ensure their compliance with the Wilderness Act and this Act. States that: (1) nothing in this Act shall constitute a claim or denial by the Federal Government as to exemption from Wyoming water laws; and (2) nothing in this Act shall be construed as affecting Wyoming's jurisdiction over wildlife and fish in the national forests in the State. Provides that it is not Congress' intention that the designation of wilderness areas in Wyoming lead to the creation of buffer zones around each such area. Provides for the protection of archaeological resources within areas described in titles II and III of this Act. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to cooperate with the Secretary of the Interior and the State of Wyoming in protecting such areas."
