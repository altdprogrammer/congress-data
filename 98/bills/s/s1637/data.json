    "text": "Amends titles II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) and XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act to require that benefit payments to a person other than the individual entitled to such payments be made on the basis of an investigation and on the basis of adequate evidence that such payments are in the interest of the individual so entitled, unless the benefit recipient is a relative of such individual or such individual is legally incompetent or a drug addict or alcoholic. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a system of accountability monitoring whereby a person receiving benefit payments to which another individual is entitled shall report annually (or more frequently if required by the Secretary) on the use of such payments, unless such person is a relative of and lives in the same household as such individual. Directs the Secretary to monitor and periodically review a statistically significant number of all payments made under titles II and XVI in order to ensure that payments are being made to the proper parties and to determine whether payee changes must be made. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress annually on the payment review and on cases involving inappropriate payees. Imposes criminal penalties on recipients of supplemental security income to which another individual is entitled if such recipients are convicted of fraud."
