    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to permit States to continue to elect to use a system of retrospective accounting and periodic reporting for purposes of determining benefits under the Food Stamp Act of 1977. Allows States (with the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture) to select categories of households subject to periodic reporting and retrospective budgeting to be recertified at more frequent intervals than once every six months. Permits the Secretary to authorize certification periods of longer than two months for households not subject to periodic reporting where the Secretary finds this would improve the administration of the program. States that those categories excluded from periodic reporting requirements are similarly exempt from retrospective budgeting. Authorizes States to provide temporary supplemental benefits to those households subject to periodic reporting and retrospective budgeting which experience a sudden and significant loss of income of more than $100 a month."
