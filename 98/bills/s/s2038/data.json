    "text": "Trucking Competition Act of 1983 - Amends the Interstate Commerce Act to revise the eligibility requirements for the issuance of certificates and permits to persons as motor carriers of property and motor contract carriers. Limits such requirements to such persons being fit, willing, and able to provide the authorized transportation. Exempts motor carriers of property from rate regulation and tariff filing requirements. Removes the exemption from antitrust immunity for all collective ratemaking agreements under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Authorizes the Commission to exempt motor carriers of property from any other regulatory requirements upon finding that such requirements are not necessary. Requires the Commission to submit to Congress and the President a comprehensive review of its implementation of this Act by January 1, 1986. Authorizes appropriations for such review. Declares that the Commission shall have no jurisdiction over motor carriers of property (except motor carriers of household goods) after December 31, 1986. Transfers to the Department of Transportation, on January 1, 1987, the Commission's authority to make safety fitness determinations for motor carriers of property, and to impose insurance requirements on such carriers."
