    "text": "Amends the Federal Supplemental Compensation Act of 1982 to extend the payment of benefits under the Federal supplemental unemployment compensation program for six months, through March 31, 1984. Provides for eligibility for additional weeks of such compensation to individuals who have exhausted their rights to such compensation before the first week beginning after September 30, 1983. Directs the Secretary of Labor to require modifications of agreements with States under such Act to conform to amendments made by this Act within a specified period. Amends the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 to permit a State to suspend, for a 52-week period beginning with the week in which this Act is enacted, the 120 percent State trigger requirement (i.e. the requirement that the insured unemployment rate in the State during the most recent 13-week period must equal or exceed 120 percent of the average of such rates for the corresponding period in each of the preceding two years in order for the Federal-State extended unemployment compensation program to be \"on\" in that State)."
