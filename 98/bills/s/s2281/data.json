Authorizes appropriations through FY 1987 for new and continuing National Health Service Corps scholarships. Limits new scholarships to 150 per fiscal year. Provides with regard to scholarship-obligated service deferrals for advanced clinical training that the Secretary of Health and Human Services: (1) shall grant such deferrals upon request for contracts entered into prior to October 1, 1984; (2) may do so for contracts entered into after such date; and (3) shall not count such periods of advanced training toward satisfying the service obligation. Revises special private practice assistance provisions to: (1) limit such assistance to loans (presently grants and loans); (2) extend the minimum obligated service period from one to two years; and (3) apply such provisions to obligated- and unobligated-service National Health Service Corps members. Requires the Secretary to submit to the appropriate congressional committees by October 1, 1985, a long-term personnel plan based on a maximum 2100 Corps size. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance to assist States in carrying out health manpower shortage data collection and public information activities. Authorizes FY 1985 through 1987 appropriations."
