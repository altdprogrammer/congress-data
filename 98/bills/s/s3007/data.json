    "text": "Federal Employees' Day Care Benefits Study Act of 1984 - Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to enter into a contract with a consultant to help: (1) identify options for a Government program of providing workday care benefits to dependent children of Federal employees; and (2) conduct a cost-benefits analysis of such options. Lists options to be considered including: (1) a program to furnish vouchers to pay for child care services; (2) programs to furnish child care at the place of employment, under a Government contract, or through a consortium of Government agencies and other employers using child care services; and (3) a program to provide information and referral services relating to child care. Requires the Comptroller General to determine through such cost-benefit analysis whether the Government would save money by conducting such a program by reason of such factors as: (1) increased productivity; (2) reduced employee turnover, absenteeism, tardiness, use of leave, or loss of worktime; (3) increased loyalty; and (4) reduced recruitment costs resulting from increased attractiveness of Government employment. Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress within one year on the analysis and any recommendations for administrative action or legislation. Authorizes appropriations."
