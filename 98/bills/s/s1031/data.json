Sets forth such percentages depending on the purpose of such projects. Requires the Secretary to agree in writing to such cost-sharing arrangements. Authorizes the Secretary to accept payments in kind toward the non-Federal share of such projects, provided that at least ten percent of the costs are provided in cash during the period of project construction. Authorizes the Secretary to delay the initial payment to be made by the non-Federal public interest at the request of such public interests."
