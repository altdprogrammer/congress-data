    "text": "Diplomacy Against Drugs Act - Authorizes U.S. assistance for a country which is a major producer of opium, cocoa, or marihuana only if the amount of opium, cocoa, or marihuana that was produced in that country during the preceding fiscal year is at least 20 percent less than the amount produced in that country during the fiscal year which preceded such preceding fiscal year. Requires the United States to give serious consideration to increasing U.S. aid to a major opium, cocoa, or marihuana producing country if such a country reduces its production by more than 20 percent. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Directors of specified international agencies to oppose the extension of aid or credit by such agencies to a country which is a major producer of opium, cocoa, or marihuana unless such country has reduced its production by 20 percent. Requires the Director of Central Intelligence to report annually to Congress and the Secretary of the Treasury on the opium, cocoa, and marihuana production in major producing countries."
