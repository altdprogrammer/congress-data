Permits the Commission, after offering interested persons an opportunity for a hearing, to order the manufacturer, distributor, or dealer either to repair such toy so that it will not create a risk of injury, to replace it with a safe equivalent toy or article, or to refund the purchase price. Declares that such an order may prohibit the person to whom it applies from manufacturing for sale, offering for sale, distributing in commerce, or importing into the customs territory of the United States (or any combination of such actions) the toy or article with respect to which the order was issued."
