    "as": "Indefinitely postponed in Senate", 
    "date": "1983-06-15", 
    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H. R. 2355 passed in lieu) Veterans' Emergency Job Training Act - Establishes a program of incentives to employers to hire and train wartime veterans who have been unemployed for long periods or whose job skills have been rendered obsolete by industrial changes. Directs the Administrator of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Labor to carry out this program through payments to employers to help defray training costs. Requires the Administrator and the Secretary to agree within 60 days as to respective responsibilities and standards for determining veteran eligibility. Entitles to this assistance any veteran who: (1) acquired entitlement to educational assistance benefits from the Veterans Administration (VA) under the Servicement's Readjustment Act of 1944, the Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1952, or the Veterans Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966; (2) served during a period of war; (3) has been unemployed for at least 15 of the previous 20 weeks; (4) is eligible for or has exhausted unemployment benefits; and (5) has no realistic expectation of being able to resume the same occupation in the same geographical area. Requires veterans wishing to participate in this program to apply to the administering agency, specifying the training objective to be pursued. Requires the administering agency to certify eligible veterans to employers offering training programs. Requires training programs to provide training for not less than six months in an occupation in a growth industry, one using new technological skills, or one in which demand exceeds supply. Limits training assistance to 12 months except in the case of certain disabled veterans who may receive extensions. Requires employers wishing to participate in this program to apply to the administering agency, certifying that: (1) a position for which the veteran is training is likely to be available at the end of the training period; (2) wages and benefits will be comparable to those received by other employee/trainees; and (3) currently employed workers will not be displaced as a result of this program. Specifies additional requirements. Permits employers to enter into agreements with approved educational institutions to provide the training program, or a portion of it. Prohibits assistance for training in: (1) seasonal, intermittent, or temporary jobs; (2) employment where commissions are the main source of income; (3) employment involving religious or political ctivities; or (4) a program not to be carried out in the United States. Directs the administering agency to make quarterly payments to an employer of a participating veteran. Sets the total payment level at 50 percent of the wages or $6,000, whichever is less. Increases such payment to $9,000 in the case of certain disabled veterans. Requires as a condition of payment a certification from both the veteran/employee and the employer concerning the training and its satisfactory progress. Prohibits veterans from participating in any other Federal training or employment assistance program while participating in this program. Prohibits the Secretary from continuing payments when the progress or conduct or the veteran is unsatisfactory or when the program of training or the employer's certification is faulty in a material respect. Establishes civil penalties for fraud. Entitles the United States to recover any overpayments from either the veteran or the employer, depending upon culpability. Directs the administering agencies to jointly conduct an outreach and public information program to industry and business. Directs the Administrator to obtain a listing of small business concerns from the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. Directs the agencies to advise educational institutions of opportunities for veterans under this Act. Directs the agencies to use the services of State and Assistant State Directors for Veteans' Employment in such outreach efforts, as well as the resources available under the Job Training Partnership Act. Sets forth recordkeeping and inspection requirements. Terminates this program after FY 1984 for initial veteran's applications and after December 31, 1984 for any program commencement. Extends such periods if funds are not appropriated or made available prior to FY 1984. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Veterans' Administration Reorganization - Exempts the planned administration reorgaization of the Veterans Administration Rehabilitation Engineering Center (VAREC) from the congressional oversight requirements governing reduction of personnel at covered offices or facilities."
