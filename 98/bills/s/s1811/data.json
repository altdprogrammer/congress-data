    "text": "High Plains States Groundwater Demonstration Program Act of 1983 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau), to conduct, in two phases, an investigation of and to establish demonstration projects for groundwater recharge of aquifers in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming (the High Plains States) as well as in Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah and Washington (the other Reclamation Act States). Directs the Bureau to consult with the U.S. Geological Survey, other appropriate Federal agencies and departments, the High Plains States, and the other Reclamation Act States to carry out this Act. Directs the Bureau, during phase I, to develop a detailed plan for not less than 12 demonstration projects in the High Plains States and for not less than 9 demonstration projects in the other Reclamation Act States. Requires such plan to determine whether various recharge technologies may be applied to diverse geologic and hydrologic conditions. Directs the Bureau to recommend the demonstration projects to be designed, constructed, and operated during phase II. Requires the Secretary, within six months of enactment of an appropriation Act to carry out phase I, to select and initiate projects to receive further planning and development. Requires the Secretary, within 24 months of enactment of an appropriation Act to carry out phase I, to transmit a report to Congress containing recommendations for phase II and a detailed statement of findings and conclusions. Directs the Bureau during phase II to design, construct, and operate such demonstration projects as are recommended in the Secretary's report to Congress. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Bureau, to contract with the High Plains States and the other Reclamation Act States to conduct a study to: (1) identify and evaluate alternative means by which the costs of groundwater recharge projects could be allocated among the project beneficiaries; and (2) identify and evaluate the economic feasibility of and the legal authority for utilizing groundwater recharge in water resource development projects. Requires the Secretary to submit interim reports to Congress on the progress of provisions of this Act within 12 months after the initiation of phase II and a final report within five years. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1983 for phases I and II. Authorizes the matching of Federal funds to meet the costs of phase II and authorizes the Secretary to enter into memoranda of agreement with the High Plains States and the other Reclamation Act States to meet the costs of phase II. Provides that inkind services or other contributions by the States, their political subdivisions, or other non-Federal entities shall be considered in the determination of the matching non-Federal share."
