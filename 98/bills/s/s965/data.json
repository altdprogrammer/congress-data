    "text": "National Industrial Development Act - Establishes the National Industrial Development Board which shall: (1) publish reports setting forth its recommendations on national industrial development priorities; and (2) at the request of a congressional committee or Federal agency, provide policy recommendations and reports on issues of national industrial policy pending before such committee or agency. Permits the Board to decline to respond to such a request if the Board determines that it concerns a matter that is not of immediate importance, unless: (1) it relates to a Government loan or loan guarantee; or (2) the President notifies the Board that it relates to an emergency situation. Directs the Board to establish procedures to ensure that no report is released to the public before seven days after it is issued, unless the Board determines that an earlier release is appropriate. Declares that members of the Board shall not be required to file any financial disclosure report under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. Provides for the appointment of a Director of the Board and personal staff for Board members without regard to specified Federal provisions governing civil service employment and compensation. Exempts the Board from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Requires the Board to submit to the President and each House of Congress an annual report on the major industrial development priorities of the United States and the policies needed to meet such priorities, along with any findings and legislative or administrative recommendations. Authorizes appropriations."
