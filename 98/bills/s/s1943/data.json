Authorizes the Administrator to participate with the Saint Lawrence Seaway Authority of Canada in the operation and ownership of a toll bridge company. Requires that the United States portion of toll revenues be applied solely to the cost of the bridge and approaches. Declares that there shall be no authority to collect tolls or other charges on vessels or cargo for the use of portions of the Saint Lawrence Seaway under the jurisdiction of the United States. Requires the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, to negotiate with the Saint Lawrence Seaway Authority of Canada to reduce or eliminate all tolls on the Seaway. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years after September 30, 1983. Transfers all property of the Corporation to the Administration."
