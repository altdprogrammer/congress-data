    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendment with an amendment) Preventive Health Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize FY 1985 through 1987 appropriations for: (1) childhood immunization; (2) tuberculosis prevention; (3) sexually transmitted disease (presently venereal disease) prevention, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) grants through the Centers for Disease Control; (4) preventive health and health services block grants; (5) home health services and personnel training; and (6) State planning grants. Obligates specified FY 1985 through 1987 amounts appropriated for sexually transmitted diseases for AIDS programs. Permits grants for sexually transmitted disease prevention to be used for research, demonstration projects, public information and education, and professional training. Increases the appropriation obligations limit from five to ten percent for such non-State project grants. Increases minimum population-based State allotments for preventive health services block grants from $3,000,000 to $3,500,000. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with appropriate national organizations, to develop model information collection criteria with respect to preventive health services block grants for State information sharing purposes. Makes technical changes to block grant application provisions. Authorizes the Secretary to make one-year grants (renewable at the Secretary's discretion for an additional one year) to up to four States in any fiscal year for children's emergency medical services demonstration projects. Authorizes FY 1985 through 1987 appropriations. Permits the Secretary, at the request of a grant recipient, to reduce the amount of a family planning services grant by the fair market value of any equipment or supplies furnished by the Secretary to such recipient. Makes such funds available to the Secretary to pay the cost of furnishing such items."
