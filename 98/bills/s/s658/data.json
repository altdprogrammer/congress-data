Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to reduce FY 1984 and FY 1985 support prices to $11.60 per hundredweight if it is determined, after consulting the dairy industry, that FY 1984 and FY 1985 milk purchases will exceed FY 1983 and FY 1984 purchases respectively. Provides for 50-cent increases (up to $12.60) if purchase levels fall below seven billion and five billion pounds respectively. Eliminates the two 50-cent milk producer assessments. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary should use his authority to reduce dairy surpluses."
