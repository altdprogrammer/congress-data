    "text": "Hazardous Waste Identification Improvement Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, when evaluating a petition to exclude a waste generated at a particular facility from being regulated as a hazardous waste, to consider criteria, constituents, or other related factors other than those for which the waste was listed. Requires notice and opportunity for public hearing before such a petition is granted or denied. Sets time limits on the temporary granting of such petitions prior to enactment of this Act without the opportunity for public comment and the full consideration of such comment. Requires that such petitions be accompanied by adequate information for evaluation, including information on samples of such waste determined to be representative on the basis of guidelines published by the Administrator. Requires that such information be certified by a responsible corporate official of the facility to be accurate, complete, and representative within the knowledge of employees or contractors of such facility. Directs the Administrator, within six months after the enactment date of this Act, to submit to the Congress a workplan: (1) for developing regulations identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste, including measures or indicators for toxicity; (2) identifying those particular wastes on which the Agency intends to decide whether to list as a hazardous waste within two years after such enactment date; and (3) developed by the National Toxicology Program in cooperation with the Administrator, evaluating the feasibility of determining whether the presence of certain constituents (such as known carcinogens, mutagens, or teratogens) at levels substantially in excess of levels commonly agreed to affect health may cause wastes to be hazardous per se. Directs the Administrator, within six months after the enactment date of this Act, to promulgate regulations listing dioxin-and dibenzofuran-containing wastes as hazardous wastes. Directs the Administrator, within two years after the enactment date of this Act, to: (1) promulgate regulations identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste; (2) reach decisions on all wastes identified for decision within two years and for each such waste either promulgate regulations listing such particular hazardous waste or publish a statement as to why such waste should not be so listed; and (3) report to the Congress on progress in evaluating the feasibility of determining whether health-threatening levels of certain constituents may cause wastes to be hazardous per se. Directs the Administrator: (1) within six months after the enactment date of this Act, to determine the appropriateness of using the extraction procedure toxicity characteristic for evaluating such petitions; and (2) within two years of such enactment date, make necessary improvements in the procedure to predict more accurately the leaching potential of wastes."
