    "text": "Federal Employee Recruitment and Retention Improvement Act of 1984 - Revises the special pay rate program for the recruitment and retention of Foreign Service or General Schedule employees or physicians, dentists, and nurses in the Department of Medicine and Surgery of the Veterans Administration to authorize the President to establish higher rates of pay when necessary to recruit and retain such employees because: (1) the pay or premium pay provided by private enterprise or by a State or local government is substantially higher or more extensive than that provided by the Federal Government for an occupation in an area; or (2) the area or working conditions for an occupation are undesirable. Repeals provisions limiting the minimum rate that may be established for a particular grade level. Authorizes the President to pay a bonus to an individual appointed to a hard-to-fill position each time the individual agrees to complete a specified period of service. Limits the maximum amount of such bonus to ten percent of the annual rate of basic pay of the individual. Requires the individual to repay the bonus if he or she does not perform the service for the period agreed upon."
