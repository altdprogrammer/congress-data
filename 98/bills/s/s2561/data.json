    "text": "Training Technology Transfer Act of 1984 - Establishes an Office of Training Technology Transfer in the Department of Education. Provides that the Director of the Office shall be appointed by the Secretary of Education. Sets forth provisions relating to staffing and staff compensation. Requires the Director to compile and maintain a current and comprehensive inventory of all training technology developed by or under the supervision of Federal agencies, especially that developed by or under the Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower, Reserve Affairs and Logistics of the Department of Defense. Requires that such inventory include specified contents with respect to each item of training technology listed. Requires the Director, in compiling such inventory, to: (1) consult with and fully utilize the resources of all Federal agencies engaged in the collection and dissemination of information concerning training technology; and (2) request the participation and cooperation of entities in the legislative and judicial branches. Requires the Director to disseminate the inventory and its revisions widely and on a regular basis to give all potential users of training technology ample notice of its development by Federal agencies. Requires the Director, in doing so, to use all interagency and intergovernmental communications mechanisms and to encourage the participation of independent private sector organizations. Requires the Director to develop and distribute detailed instructions and procedures for securing copies, and rights thereto, of training technology listed in such inventory and instructions for participating in a conversion assistance program established under this Act. Requires the Director to advise and consult with any entity which is a prospective user of training technology listed in the inventory and assist such entity in securing the transfer and conversion of such technology from the Federal agency which developed it. Requires the Director, if such agency has not established procedures for such transfer and conversion, to negotiate such transfer and conversion upon application by such entity. Requires the Director to enter into contracts with competent educational institutions and qualified private sector firms for the conversion of training technology in order to adapt such technology to the requirements of specified entities, upon application by such entity. Describes such an entity as: (1) a small business concern employing not more than 500 employees; (2) a public or private educational institution which is duly accredited, funded, or licensed by a State, including a college, university, community college, public school system, private preparatory school, or vocational school; (3) a trade association or a community-based organization; (4) a State or local government or agency or a private industry council; and (5) a consortium of State and local governments private industry councils, community-based organizations, or small business concerns each of which employs not more than 500 employees. Requires the Director, in awarding such contracts, to give preference to proposals by such entities which will result in the enhancement of the employability and potential earnings of a maximum number of individuals. Requires the Director to: (1) conduct analyses of national needs for conversions of training technology listed in the inventory, including analyses of the potential number of individuals who will benefit from such conversion, the content of computer software currently available for employee training, and the required levels of proficiency for the use of such software; and (2) encourage and promote multiple use of converted training technology by entities with similar training needs. Sets limits on the monetary amounts of individual contracts to specified types of entities. Authorizes the Director to allow matching payments by the applicants of up to 50 percent of the costs of conversion in cases where such costs exceed such contract limits. Prohibits any applicant which contributes to such conversion costs from receiving any proprietary interest, share of ownership or control, copyright, or patent in the technology converted with such contribution. Requires the Director to promulgate regulations and procedures for such contributions. Requires the Director, after the performance of a contract is completed, to provide a copy of the training technology converted pursuant to such contract to the entity which applied for the conversion. Requires that any training technology converted pursuant to a contract under this Act be: (1) listed in the inventory; and (2) available for conversion or transfer to any other entity pursuant to this Act. Requires any entity which is not described under this Act and which wishes to obtain the transfer or conversion of any training technology listed in the inventory to pay the full cost of such transfer or conversion. Limits the authority of the Director to enter into such contracts to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts. Requires the Director to conduct studies and analyses of conversions and transfers of training technology, including an evaluation of the effectiveness of training technology converted or transferred pursuant to this Act. Directs all Federal agencies to cooperate with the Director in implementing this Act. Directs any Federal agency head to report to the Secretary of Education any finding that the agency is unable to cooperate with the Director for reasons of national security. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress by July 1 of each year all such findings received by the Secretary during the preceding 12-month period. Sets forth administrative provisions. Establishes the Training Technology Transfer Advisory Board and sets forth provisions relating to Board appointments, compensation, and meetings. Provides that any training technology transferred or converted pursuant to this Act shall remain in the public domain and no recipient or beneficiary of such technology shall gain any exclusive right, patent, copyright, or ownership over such technology by reason of such transfer or conversion. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 and succeeding fiscal years."
