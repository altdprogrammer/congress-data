    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-01-26", 
    "text": "Maternal and Child Health Act of 1983 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) to provide medical assistance: (1) to any pregnant woman during her pregnancy and the 60 day period following the last day of pregnancy, if her resources do not exceed specified limitations; and (2) without limitation, to any individual under age six (and, beginning FY 1986 under 18), if the individual's resources do not exceed specified limitations. Requires a State plan to: (1) provide prenatal and postnatal services; (2) beginning FY 1988, continue assistance to any individual under age 18 who becomes ineligible because of increased resources for four months following such individuals' ineligibility; and (3) continue assistance for one year in certain cases for such individuals. Requires a State to report periodically to the Secretary of Health and Human Services concerning services to pregnant women and individuals under 18. Requires a maternal and child health program (the program) under Medicaid which to provide to eligible individuals under 18 the following: (1) child health assessments (as defined); (2) specified medical care and services including immunizations, clinic services, diagnosis and treatment of vision and hearing problems (including glasses and hearing aids), prescribed drugs, prosthetic devices, home health services, mental health services, and dental care; and (3) specified continuing care. Requires that child health assessments be performed only by physicians or providers who have entered into a written agreement with a State. Directs States to enter into arrangements with health maintenance organizations to provide services under the program at a rate equal to at lease 95 percent of the average expenditure for medical assistance to individuals under 18 in a State. Requires a State to list all dentists who agree to receive payments under Medicaid. Requires a State plan to provide \"outreach\" services to eligible pregnant women and children. Defines \"outreach\" as the identification and location of individuals eligible for the program. Provides penalties for a State which does not provide satisfactory outreach services. Requires a State plan to develop its maternal and child health program with substantial public input. Provides that the Federal matching rate to a State: (1) for all outpatient services to children under continuing care shall be increased by 30 percentage points up to a maximum of 95 percent; and (2) for health assessments and all outpatient services provided to all children who have been assessed and reassesed at appropriate intervals shall be increased by 25 percentage points up to a maximum of 90 percent. Provides that outreach services will be matched at 75 percent. Sets forth a system under which a State will be either financially rewarded or penalized depending on its performance under its program. Sets forth a method of determining a State's performance. Directs the Secretary to annually report to Congress concerning a State's performance. Directs the Secretary to make a continuing study on a State-by-State basis of the ratio of individuals under the age of 18 enrolled to receive Medicaid to the number of individuals under the age of 18 in families whose income is not above 66 2/3 percent of the applicable nonfarm income official poverty line. Directs the Secretary to report the results to Congress and, as determined by the results, the effectiveness of a State's performance with its program. Limits the Federal medical assistance percentage for child health assessments and for ambulatory services provided to an individual under 18 with a current health assessment under a program to a maximum of 83 percent if it is determined that a State has: (1) reduced the standard of income and resources for eligibility for medical assistance for individual under 18 below applicable standards; or (2) reduces the amount, duration, or scope of medical assistance made available to individuals under 18. Directs the Secretary to: (1) study the extent to which Federal programs provide, or assist in meeting the cost of providing, the cost of services to children and pregnant women required under Medicaid (including a requirement to specify the extent of duplication of services under maternal and child health programs); and (2) report the results to Congress. Directs the Secretary to study and conduct demonstration projects in order to evaluate: (1) the participation of health care providers in the maternal and child health programs under title XIX; and (2) methods of improving their level of participation in such programs. Directs the Secretary to develop and carry out experiments and demonstration projects designed to determine the effect of payment on a capitation basis for child health assessments under the program upon the level of participation and performance of providers. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress concerning such demonstration projects. Directs the Secretary to arrange for an ongoing study of the effectiveness of the program and to report to Congress biennially. Authorizes appropriations for the study. Sets forth: (1) effective date provisions; and (2) provisions providing for delays in the effective dates pending the determination by the President of the costs of the program established by this Act and effects of delays on the health of intended beneficiaries. Provides that if the House of Representatives and the Senate each adopt a resolution disapproving the President's determination to delay effective dates there will be no delay."
