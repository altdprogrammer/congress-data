Exempts States from such prohibition with respect to motor vehicles that exceed 102 inches in width until such States adopt regulations to conform to the prohibition. Excludes certain vehicle safety devices from width calculations. Allows States to grant special use permits to vehicles in excess of the width limitation. Authorizes States to enforce commercial vehicle width limitations on Federal-aid highways. Repeals certain provisions of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1983, to conform to this Act."
