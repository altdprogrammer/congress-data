    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Labor and Human Resources with amendment (without written report)) National Science Foundation Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1984 - Authorizes appropriations for the National Science Foundation for FY 1984 for the following categories: (1) mathematical and physical sciences; (2) engineering; (3) biological, behavioral, and social sciences; (4) astronomical, atmospheric, earth and ocean sciences; (5) Antarctic research programs; (6) scientific, technological, and international affairs; (7) program development and management. Earmarks specified authorizations for the NSF to make grants or enter into contracts with five institutions of higher education for the establishment and operation of supercomputer research centers for symbolic supercomputer research. Limits the amount available for numerical supercomputer research and high bandwidth network access. Authorizes the Director of the NSF to apportion funds to carry out this program between the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Engineering Directorate as the Director sees fit. Limits the amounts of appropriations which may be expended for consultation and for expenses of the NSF incurred outside the United States. Permits transfers of funds among categories, in excess of ten percent of appropriations, if the chairmen of the House Committee on Science and Technology and the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources each write the Director that there is no objection to the transfer or 30 days have passed after such committees were notified of the proposed transfer. Requires the Director to keep such committees fully informed of the activities of the NSF."
