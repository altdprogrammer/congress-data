    "text": "Rebuilding of America Act of 1983 - Establishes the National Commission on the Rebuilding of America (the Commission). Requires the Commission to: (1) assess the condition of the national public works infrastructure; (2) analyze causes of disinvestment in such infrastructure: and (3) evaluate the need to repair, maintain, replace and expand such infrastructure. Designates the composition of the Commission. Requires the Commission to conduct an inventory of existing major public improvements (highways, roads, bridges, mass transit systems, water supply and sewer system) by region, State, major U.S. metropolitan area; and by type of facility. Specifies areas of special concern for such survey. Requires the Commission to develop a National Public Improvements Plan (the Plan). Requires the Plan to include: (1) a list, in priority order, of necessary maintenance, repair, rehabilitation or replacement of public improvements: (2) recommended methods of financing such work: (3) suggested revisions in Federal law and regulations; and (4) suggested alternatives in current responsibilities of Federal, State and local governments. Specifies analyses and recommendations to be included in the Plan. Directs the Comptroller General to submit to specified congressional committees, within six months of enactment, model unified budgets for the fiscal year in which this Act is enacted, and for the immediately preceding fiscal year, that distinguish Federal civilian capital investment outlays from other Federal outlays. Requires the Comptroller General to submit a report describing how such model budgets differ from existing Federal budget documents and analyzing the usefulness of such model budgets. Directs the Commission to submit the national inventory of public improvements, the draft Plan and the final Plan to Congress and the President within specified time limits. Provides for approval of any portion of the Plan unless Congress enacts a joint resolution of disapproval of any portion within 120 days following receipt of the final Plan. Provides that such approval shall not alter any statute or regulation of the Federal government, a State or political subdivision thereof. Requires congressional hearings on proposed changes on existing law. Authorizes appropriations."
