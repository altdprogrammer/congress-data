Establishes the methanol powered vehicle technology research program. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to acquire and study the performance of methanol powered vehicles during FY 1985 through 1987. Authorizes other executive agencies, upon their request, to participate in such program. Requires such agencies to pay the Secretary for any vehicle received. Authorizes appropriations as necessary to carry out such program. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to any State or local government agency that applies for the acquisition of methanol powered vehicles to participate in such program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for such grants. Requires the Secretary to report annually to Congress on the research program. Amends the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to direct the Secretary to carry out a methanol powered bus demonstration program for FY 1986 through 1988. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to eligible recipients for the purpose of studying and testing the performance of such buses. Authorizes apropriations to carry out the program. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on such program by September 30 of each year from 1986 through 1989, with a final report by October 15, 1989."
