Sets the amount of such payments at ten percent of the aggregate tax revenue that would be available if the property were subject to taxation. Directs the General Accounting Office to submit a report containing recommendations on coordinating payments under this Act with existing Federal programs to avoid duplicative payments or windfalls and on the feasibility and constitutionality of subjecting Federal real property to full local property taxation. Authorizes appropriations."
