    "text": "Agricultural Export Equity Act of 1983 - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to sell for export in FY 1983 through 1985, not less than 150,000 metric tons per year of dairy products owned by the Commodity Credit Corporation (the Corporation). Requires such sales to be made under existing authorities available to the Secretary or the Corporation. Directs the Secretary to submit semiannual reports on the status of such sales, to specified congressional committees. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 to require the Secretary to use one-half of the proceeds from the sale of such dairy products each year for export assistance for U.S. agricultural commodities and products (in order to equalize the price and credit subsidies of foreign nations on their agricultural exports). Requires the use of specified Corporation funds for export assistance. Requires the Secretary to carry out this program through the Corporation. Authorizes the Secretary to formulate and carry out a program under which agricultural commodities and products acquired by the Corporation are made available, for export without charge, to U.S. exporters and users and foreign purchasers in order to promote export markets for such commodities and products. Requires the Secretary to: (1) ensure that equal treatment is provided to domestic and foreign purchasers and users in cases where the importation of a manufactured product made from agricultural commodities, made available for export under this Act, would place domestic users of such commodity at a competitive disadvantage; (2) consider all interested foreign purchasers for participation, giving priority to those who have purchased U.S. agricultural commodities in the past and who continue to do so in increased quantities; (3) ensure that agricultural commodities, made available for export under this Act, be used to encourage increased use of such commodities and to avoid unnecessary market displacement of domestic agricultural commodities; and (4) take reasonable precautions to prevent resale, transshipment or any use of such commodities other than domestic use in the importing country. Provides for bonus distributions to foreign purchasers who use funds realized from the sale of commodities made available for export under this Act to construct or rehabilitate facilities in the importing country for specified purposes. Requires the Secretary to determine the intervals and amounts of such bonus distributions. Requires the Secretary to carry out this program through the Corporation. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1947 to include other agricultural commodities and products (currently only dairy products), acquired by the Corporation, as donations for distributions to needy persons outside the United States. Provides for the direct distribution, barter or sale of such commodities. Requires the proceeds realized from the sale or barter of such commodities to be used exclusively for assistance to needy persons. Prohibits the use of such proceeds to defray operating or overhead expenses. Requires such donations to be coordinated with other U.S. foreign assistance through a specified mechanism. Requires the Secretary to submit a report to specified congressional committees, by July 1, 1983, on the use of export subsidies by foreign nations. Specifies the requirements of such report."
