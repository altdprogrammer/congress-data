    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-02-29", 
    "text": "Human Services Reauthorization Act - Title I: Low-Income Home Energy Assistance - Amends the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 to extend the authorization of appropriations for low-income home energy assistance to FY 1985 through 1989. Includes in the term \"energy crisis intervention\" household energy related emergencies. Requires that at least five percent of a State's allotment of funds for low-income home energy assistance be reserved until March 15 of each year for energy crisis intervention, which shall be administered by public or nonprofit entities having experience in and the capacity to administer such programs. Requires as part of the annual application for an allotment of funds for low-income home energy assistance that a State agree to: (1) describe the eligibility requirements for households desiring to participate in the low-income home energy assistance program and the manner in which the State determines benefit levels; and (2) indicate the amount which the State will reserve for energy crisis intervention and the administration procedures for designating an emergency and determining the assistance to be provided and for determining the use of funds reserved for energy crisis intervention but not expended for emergencies. Provides that home energy assistance payments provided to a household by a private nonprofit organization or by an entity whose revenues are derived primarily on a rate-of-return basis regulated by the State or Federal Government shall not be considered income for such household for purposes of Federal or State law if the appropriate State agency certifies that such assistance is based on need. Decreases the maximum amount of grant money allotted for a fiscal year to States for low-income home energy assistance which a State may request to be held available for the next fiscal year. Specifies additional home energy and home energy assistance data which the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to collect on a State-by-State basis. Specifies the dates by which the Secretary's annual reports on such data must be submitted to Congress. Prohibits the Secretary from using more than $350,000 in any fiscal year for demonstration and analysis of effective ways to meet the energy needs of low-income households. Title II: Community Services Block Grant - Amends the Community Services Block Grant Act to increase the authorization of appropriations for community services grants for FY 1985 and 1986 and to authorize appropriations for such grants for FY 1987 through 1989. Permits a State to revise the poverty line for purposes of community services grants to 125 percent of the official poverty line established by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget if the State determines that such revision will serve the objectives of such grants. Revises the amount of funds which a State applying for a community services block grant must agree to make available to community action agencies and organizations serving seasonal or migrant farmworkers. Requires that the remainder of such funds be used to permit existing community action agencies to serve geographic areas not being served or to establish new community action agencies. Sets forth waiver provisions with respect to such funding requirements. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Service to provide training and ongoing activities of national and regional significance related to the purposes of the community services grant program. (Under current law, the Secretary has discretionary authority to provide such training and activities.) Permits the Secretary to make grants, loans, and loan guarantees to nonprofit private organizations applying jointly with business concerns for funding. Title III: Head Start Program - Amends the Head Start Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to administer the Head Start program through the Administration for Children, Youth, and Families within the Department of Health and Human Services. Authorizes the appropriations for the Head Start program for FY 1985 through 1989. Requires the Secretary to reserve for training and technical assistance for each fiscal year funds which are not less than the amount spent for such activities under such Act in FY 1982. Requires the Secretary to designate as Head Start agencies any local public or private nonprofit agency which was receiving funds under any Head Start program on August 31, 1981, if such agency meets program and fiscal requirements established by the Secretary. (Under current law, the Secretary is required to give priority in the designation of Head Start agencies to such local agencies.) Authorizes the Secretary to designate a Head Start agency from among qualified applicants in a community if there is no Head Start agency or program serving such community. Permits each Head Start program operated in a community to provide more than one year of Head Start services to children from age three to the age of compulsory school attendance in the State where the program is located. Requires the Secretary to provide technical assistance and training in connection with Head Start programs. (Under current law, the Secretary is authorized to provide such activities.) Specifies the types of programs which must be included in such training activities."
