    "text": "Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to provide for a resolution of the rail labor dispute between the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York) in conjunction with the Connecticut Department of Transportation and the employees of such authorities represented by the United Transportation Union. Requires any work stoppage arising out of such dispute to terminate on the date of enactment of this Act. Directs that rates of pay, rules and working conditions shall be as agreed upon prior to April 11, 1983, with respect to the service transferred from Conrail to such authorities. Provides that the conditions under which such service was operated by Conrail shall govern over disputed issues until the arbitration panel issues its decision. Establishes such arbitration panel whose decision shall be binding upon the parties. Declares that nothing in this Act precludes the parties to the dispute from reaching agreement prior to such binding decision."
