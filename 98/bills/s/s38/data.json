    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 98-1027) Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (the Act) to revise the defintion of \"employee\" to exclude persons employed: (1) exclusively to perform office clerical, secretarial, security, or data processing work; (2) by a club, camp, recreation operation, restaurant, museum, or retail outlet; (3) by a marina and who are not engaged in construction, replacement, or expansion of such marina (except for routine maintenance); (4) by suppliers, transporters, or vendors, and persons temporarily doing business on the premises of specified employers and who are not engaged in work normally performed by employees of that employer under the Act; (5) as aquaculture workers; or (6) to build, repair, or dismantle any recreational vessel under 65 feet long. (Retains the current exclusion from coverage of a master or member of a crew of any vessel or any person engaged by the master to load or unload or repair any small vessel under 18 tons net.) Excludes such employees only if they are subject to coverage under a State workers' compensation law. Revises the definition of \"disability\" to add a definition of such term to be used with respect to a case in which the occupational disease manifests itself subsequent to the claimant's date of retirement. Provides, in such cases, that \"disability\" shall mean permanent impairment as determined by American Medical Association guidelines. Revises the definition of \"wages\" to exclude certain fringe benefits. Revises coverage provisions to exempt from coverage under the Act employees employed by facilities engaged in the business of building, repairing, or dismantling exclusively small vessels under specified circumstances. Provides that recoveries under other workers' compensation laws or under specified Federal law relating to recovery for injury to or death of seamen shall be credited against any liability imposed by the Act. Revises provisions relating to liability for compensation. Provides that the obligation of the contractor to secure compensation for the employee of the subcontractor is contingent upon the failure of the subcontractor to secure compensation for its own employees. Provides that the contractor is not immune from suit by its subcontractors' employees in those instances where the subcontractor-employer has fulfilled its obligation to secure compensation for its employees. Provides that if the subcontractor defaults in securing compensation and the contractor fulfills its obligation to secure compensation, then the contractor is deemed an \"employer\" and is therefore entitled to immunity from suit by the subcontractor's employees. Provides that if the contractor uses certain insurance policies to provide coverage which satisfies the subcontractor's primary obligation to secure compensation, then the contractor is not immune from suit by the subcontractor's employees. Provides that no person covered under the Act who is employed to provide shipbuilding, repairing, or breaking services may bring a negligence action against the employer in any capacity including as the vessel's owner, owner for this occasion, agent, operator, or character or against the employees of the employer. Removes the current proscription under the Act with respect to mutual indemnity agreements between employers and vessels engaged in operations on the Outer Continental Shelf. Provides that compensation for disability or death shall not exceed 200 percent of the applicable national average weekly wage. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to order a change of physicians or hospitals where the charges exceed those prevailing within the community for similar services. Directs the Secretary to annually list those physicians and health care providers who are not authorized to provide care and receive payments under the Act. Sets forth grounds for inclusion on such list of those barred from providing services under the Act. Prohibits reimbursement for medical services provided by those on such list, except emergency services. Provides that any such debarment determination shall remain in effect for at least three years and until the Secretary finds and gives public notice that there is reasonable assurance that the basis for the determination will not reoccur. Permits employee selection of any physician who is not on such list. Prohibits employees from changing their physician after their initial choice without prior consent of the employer, carrier, or deputy commissioner. Requires consent to be given in cases where the initial choice was not of a specialist whose services are appropriate and necessary. Permits such consent to be given, in all other cases, upon a showing of good cause for change. Revises provisions for employee recovery of expenditures for medical or other treatment or services. Retains the requirement that the treating physician furnish to the employer and the deputy commissioner an injury and treatment report within ten days of first treatment. Authorizes an administrative law judge (as well as the Secretary) to suspend payment of compensation benefits to employees who unreasonably refuse to accept medical or surgical treatment or to submit to an examination by a consulting physician selected by the employer. Authorizes the Secretary to make rules and regulations, and establish procedures, to carry out provisions relating to the listing of physicians and health care providers who are not authorized to render medical care or provide medical services under the Act, including the nature, extent, and methods of taking and furnishing proof and evidence. Requires that any such listing decision be based on specific findings of fact. Requires notice and opportunity for hearing. Provides for judicial review of such decisions. Allows an injured or disabled employee to obtain treatment by prayer or spiritual means alone by an accredited practitioner of, and in accordance with the tenets of, a recognized church or religious denomination. Prohibits such an employee from losing any benefits under this Act because of such treatment. Requires such employee to take all required physical examinations. Provides that an employee shall not be considered to have unreasonably refused medical treatment or vocational rehabilitation if such refusal is in adherence to the tenets of a recognized church or religious denomination. Makes an audiogram presumptive evidence, only under specified conditions, of the amount of hearing loss sustained. Provides that the time for filing a notice of injury, or a claim for compensation, shall not begin to run in connection with any claim for loss of hearing until the employee has been provided with an audiogram, and accompanying report, which indicates that the employee has suffered a loss of hearing. Requires that determinations of loss of hearing be made in accordance with American Medical Association guidelines. Increases the maximum amount awardable for serious disfigurement from $3,500 to $7,500. Repeals provisions for reconsideration of the degree of impairment by the deputy commissioner, for purposes of compensation of permanent partial disability. Repeals provisions for death benefits for survivors of employees receiving compensation for permanent partial disability who die from causes other than the compensable injury. Provides, for purposes of special fund provisions, that the employer be only responsible for the lesser of 104 weeks or the period of hearing loss for which the employer is directly responsible.
