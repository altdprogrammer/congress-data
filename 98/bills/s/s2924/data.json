    "text": "Requires any Federal officer or employee who is convicted of a felony to be removed from office or employment within 30 days after the employing agency receives notice of the conviction. Directs an agency to provide an employee at least 14 days' advance notice of his or her removal. Authorizes an agency to reinstate such a former employee upon such employee's written request if: (1) the employee's felony conviction is vacated by the court based on a finding that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction and the agency head determines that further judicial proceedings are unlikely to be commenced; or (2) in the case of a retrial, the former employee is acquitted or further judicial proceedings are terminated and the vacation of the previous conviction was based on a finding of insufficient evidence. Entitles an employee who is reinstated on such basis to be paid the amount of pay lost because of his or her removal. Permits an agency to provide such reimbursement to an employee reinstated for any other reason."
