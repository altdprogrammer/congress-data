Eliminates the limitation on the annual pay of a member of the Senior Executive Service who: (1) is awarded the rank of Meritorious Executive or Distinguished Executive; or (2) receives a performance award. Specifies amounts by which the aggregate amount paid to specified senior executives for FY 1982 may exceed the existing limitation of the annual rate paid for positions at level I of the Executive Schedule for such year. Requires any amounts collected as overpayments that do not exceed such new limitations to be paid to such executives. Declares that such payments shall be deemed to have been paid in FY 1982 for Federal tax purposes."
