    "text": "Water Projects Amendments of 1983 - Directs the Secretary of the Army, through the Corps of Engineers, to enter into agreements providing for owner contributions to public works projects which will produce increased land values for the owner. Repeals the provision abolishing tolls on government canals. Limits the Secretary of the Army's authority to maintain and rehabilitate navigation projects without congressional authorization. Requires certain reports to the appropriate congressional committees to contain information concerning: (1) the possibility of failure of dam facilities; and (2) the impact on existing recreational facilities of projects, including new recreational facilities. Makes the Secretary of Transportation responsible for all calculations of transportation-related benefits from future water resources projects. Revokes authorization for any project under the responsibility of the Chief of Engineers for which construction has not commenced within ten years of its authorization, unless otherwise directed by a resolution of the appropriate congressional committees. Revokes an authorization for any survey or study under the responsibility of the Chief of Engineers if funds are not expended for them within four full fiscal years following their approval. Directs the Chief of Engineers, within six months of the date of enactment of this Act, to submit to Congress a list of all existing inactive or deferred studies. Sets forth procedures for deauthorization of such studies. Establishes the Advisory Board on Water Resources Complaints to evaluate complaints concerning: (1) existing water resources projects; (2) changes in project operations; (3) construction of new facilities; and (4) changes in requirements for local interests. Directs the Board to transmit its recommendations to the Secretary of the Army, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, and to interested State or local public agencies. Authorizes appropriations."
