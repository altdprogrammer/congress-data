    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1984-06-20", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, in lieu of H.R. 1510) Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1983 - Title I: Control of Illegal Immigration - Part A: Employment - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make it unlawful for a person or other entity to: (1) hire, or recruit, or refer for a fee for U.S. employment any alien knowing that such person is unauthorized to work, or any person without verifying his or her work status (applies to employers of four or more employees); or (2) continue to hire an alien knowing of such person's unauthorized work status. Makes verification compliance an affirmative defense to any violation in the hiring or referral of an alien, including the situation of a State employment agency referral. Applies the sanctions under this Act to employers of four or more employees, except in the case of farm labor contractors. Directs the Attorney General, within two years, to establish an electronic data or telephone method to validate the social security account numbers of employee-applicants. Sets forth the verification process. Requires: (1) the employer to attest, on a form developed by the Attorney General, that the employee's work status has been verified by examination of a passport, birth certificate, social security card, alien documentation papers, or other proof; (2) the worker to similarly attest that he or she is a U.S. citizen or national, or authorized alien; and (3) the employer to keep such records for three years or one year after the employee leaves, whichever is longer. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize a national identity card or system. Makes it unlawful for an employer to require an employee to provide any type of financial guarantee or indemnity against any potential employment liability. Subjects violators, after notice and hearing opportunity, to civil penalties. Subjects employers to citations, graduated civil penalties, or injunctive remedies for hiring violations. Requires the Attorney General to provide notice and hearing opportunity. Permits judicial review of a final administrative penalty. Directs the Attorney General to file suit in U.S. district court to collect unpaid penalties. States that such employer sanction provisions preempt State and local laws. Directs the President to monitor and consult semiannually with Congress concerning implementation of such employment provisions and their impact on the U.S. economy and illegal entry of aliens. Directs the Civil Rights Commission to: (1) monitor the implementation and enforcement of such provisions; (2) investigate allegations of discrimination; and (3) report to the appropriate congressional committees at 18, 36, and 54-month intervals. Makes it an unfair immigration-related employment practice for an employer of four or more employees to discriminate against any individual (other than an unauthorized alien) with respect to the hiring, or recruitment or referral for consideration, because of such individual's origin or alienage. Vests authority to enforce employer sanction and non-discrimination provisions in the United States Immigration Board (created by this Act) through specially trained administrative law judges and a Special Counsel. Refers allegations of violations to the Special Counsel and requires the Special Counsel to: (1) notify the alleged violator of the complaint within ten days; and (2) investigate and determine whether to prosecute the complaint within 30 days. Authorizes the Special Counsel to independently investigate and prosecute violations. States that violation hearings shall be held before such administrative law judges, who shall submit recommended orders to the Board for final approval. Authorizes the Board to: (1) accept, modify, or otherwise dispose of such an order; (2) order a party to cease and desist from unlawful activity; or (3) seek judicial enforcement of the order. Sets forth graduated civil penalties and equitable remedies. Permits a prevailing party to be awarded a reasonable attorney's fee. Directs the Attorney General: (1) in cooperation with the Secretaries of Labor, Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Treasury, and Commerce, and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, to disseminate program information for the first year after enactment of this Act; and (2) issue implementing regulations within seven months. States that no penalties shall be imposed for the first seven months after enactment of this Act. Amends the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act to subject farm labor contractors to the requirements of this Act, beginning seven months after enactment. Makes it illegal to fraudently misuse or manufacture entry or work documents (up to $5,000 fine or two years' imprisonment or both). Part B: Improvement of Enforcement and Services - States that essential elements of the immigration control and reform program established by this Act are increased enforcement and administrative activities of the Border Patrol, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and other appropriate Federal agencies. Authorizes supplemental appropriations for INS service and enforcement activities for FY 1984, to be available for expenditure through FY 1985. Directs the Attorney General to develop and transmit to Congress within two months an INS funding and personnel plan for FY 1984, including an in-service training program. Requires FY 1985 and FY 1986 plan revisions as appropriate. Authorizes FY 1985 and 1986 INS appropriations. Subjects a person to criminal penalties for unlawful transportation of aliens into the United States for commercial advantage or private profit. Authorizes the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to impose maintenance fees on aliens for the use of INS facilities and services. Requires INS to have an owner's consent or a warrant before entering a farm or outdoor operations to interrogate persons to determine if undocumented aliens are present. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) develop, in consultation with State and local officials, an immigration emergency contingency plan; and (2) submit such plan to the appropriate congressional committees within four months of enactment of this Act. Authorizes permanent appropriations. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) provide in-service training to familiarize the personnel who deal with the public with the rights and varied cultural backgrounds of aliens and citizens; and (2) enhance the responsibilities of INS's community outreach program. Directs the Attorney General: (1) jointly with the Secretary of State, to initiate discussions with Mexico and Canada on a program to prevent the smuggling of illegal aliens into the United States; and (2) report to Congress within one year. Permits the owner or operator of an international bridge or toll road to request the Attorney General to inspect and approve measures taken to prevent aliens from illegally crossing into the United States. States that such approved measures shall be prima facie evidence of compliance with obligations under such Act to prevent illegal entries. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) U.S. immigration laws should be enforced vigorously and uniformly; and (2) the Attorney General, in so doing, shall safeguard the constitutional rights, personal safety, and human dignity of citizens and aliens. Part C: Adjudication Procedures and Asylum - Directs immigration officers to exclude without hearing or further inquiry aliens without proper documents or without any reasonable basis for legal entry or asylum. Directs the Attorney General, after consulting with the congressional judiciary committees, to establish procedures to assure that aliens are not excluded without an inquiry into their reasons for seeking U.S. entry. States that if an alien claims asylum, the exclusion hearing shall be limited to the asylum issue. Establishes in the Department of Justice a seven-member United States Immigration Board to hear appeals from final decisions of immigration judges. States that the Board's determination shall be binding on all immigration judges, immigration officers, and consular officers unless modified by a court. Requires deportation or exclusion appeals to the Board to be filed within 20 days. Sets forth administrative and operating provisions, including provisions regarding the Special Counsel. Replaces the existing special inquiry officer system with a system of immigration judges, to be appointed by the Chairman of the Immigration Board. Grants such judges responsibility for exclusion, deportation, asylum, and status rescission cases, as well as penalty assessments. Provides for judicial review of exclusion cases and those asylum cases encompassed within deportation or exclusion orders. States that such final orders shall be reviewed in U. S. appeals courts. Reduces the period for filing such appeals from six months to 60 days. Restricts judicial review of asylum determinations to questions of: (1) jurisdiction; (2) compliance with laws and regulations; (3) constitutionality; and (4) arbitrary decisionmaking. Prohibits judicial review decisions from reopening: (1) exclusion, deportation, or asylum determinations; (2) denials of stays of exclusion or deportation; or (3) expedited exclusions. States that such restrictions and prohibitions should not be construed as limiting habeas corpus. Revises asylum provisions. Requires an alien under an exclusion or deportation order to apply for asylum within 14 days and to complete such application within 30 days after notice of such order unless changed circumstances in the alien's country cause a change in asylum eligibility. Prohibits an alien from reapplying for asylum after having been denied such status unless such changes have occurred. Requires asylum applications to be heard before administrative law judges having special training in international law. Permits legal counsel at asylum hearings. Requires an alien to be an admissible refugee in order to be granted asylum. Places the burden of proof on the applicant. Prohibits the reopening of an application proceeding unless changed circumstances in the alien's country cause a change in asylum eligibility. Requires application determinations to be made within 30 days after the hearing (which shall be held within 45 days of the application's filing). Makes asylum hearings open to the public unless the alien requests otherwise. Requires an alien detained during asylum proceedings to be released on parole if: (1) the Board has not rendered a decision on such person's appeal of a denied asylum application within 60 days of filing; or (2) a reviewing court has not rendered a decision on the petition for review of such claim within 30 days of filing. Requires annual asylum reports to Congress. Exempts asylum and refugee records from disclosure, except that: (1) asylum applicants may obtain such records if the information is not otherwise exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act; and (2) the Attorney General or the Secretary of State may get such records if needed in court. Requires the President to nominate Board members within 45 days. Sets forth other administrative and operating provisions for the transfer of asylum proceedings from the existing special inquiry system to the administrative law judge system. Provides that during the two-year transition perod special inquiry officers shall be considered as meeting the minimum requirements for the administrative law judge examination.

Directs the President to report to Congress within one year regarding such program. Title II: Reform of Legal Immigration - Part A: Immigrants - Provides beginning with FY 1984 for: (1) an increase in the colonial quota from 600 to 3000; and (2) for additional immigrant visas for Canada and Mexico (20,000 each plus each other's unused visas from the previous fiscal year). Requires the President to report to Congress every three years (the first report due by January 1, 1987) on the overall impact of immigration admissions for such period, including the number and classifications of admitted aliens. Requires the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to hold public hearings on such reports. Includes within the definition of \"special immigrant\" unmarried sons and daughters and surviving spouses of employees of certain international organizations (\"I\" status). Grants nonimmigrant status to: (1) parents of children receiving \"I\" status while they are minors; and (2) other children of such parents or a surviving \"I\" status spouse.
