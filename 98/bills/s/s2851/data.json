    "date": "1984-09-13", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #238 (89-5)) Financial Services Competitive Equity Act - Title I: Financial Institutions Competitive Equity - Amends the Banking Act of 1933 to allow a member bank to be affiliated with a depository institution securities affiliate. Allows an officer, director, or employee of a member bank to serve at the same time as an officer, director, or employee of any of its depository institution securities affiliates. Amends the Securities Act of 1933 to exempt from the registration requirements of such Act the issuance of a holding company's shares in connection with a reorganization in which the holding company becomes the parent of a bank or thrift institution. Amends the definition of \"appropriate regulatory agency\" to make the Securities and Exchange Commission the appropriate regulatory agency for enforcing a depository institution securities affiliate's compliance with regulations governing transactions in municipal securities. Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to redefine the term \"bank\" to mean: (1) a bank insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; (2) any institution that both accepts deposits that are withdrawable by a check or similar means and engages in the business of making commercial loans; or (3) a State-chartered, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) - insured stock savings bank which was in existence on October 15, 1982, which is engaged in the business of making commercial loans and which, on the date of this Act, is not a Federal savings bank. Defines the terms \"commercial loans,\" \"depository institution securities affiliate,\" and \"depository institution holding company\" for the purposes of such Act. Provides a 30 day notice process for the formation of a bank holding company. Requires a bank holding company to divest itself of certain nonbank banks acquired after July 1, 1983. (A \"nonbank bank\" is a bank holding company subsidiary with a bank charter but which, by either not offering demand deposits or not making commercial loans, avoids the definition of \"bank\" under the Bank Holding Company Act, thus allowing the parent company to avoid certain activities restrictions and/or restrictions on interstate ownership of bank subsidiaries.) Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to expand the types of activities in which a bank holding company may directly engage. Sets forth certain grandfather rights for companies that acquired a nonbank bank before July 1, 1983. Permits bank holding companies, after notice and subject to approval by the Federal Reserve Board, to engage in the following: (1) ownership of thrift institutions subject to bank interstate operations and branching restrictions; and (2) activities closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks. Requires a bank holding company to submit a notice to the Federal Reserve Board 60 days in advance of engaging in any such activities. Authorizes bank holding companies to acquire one or more thrift institutions. Permits bank holding companies to operate a depository institution securities affiliate. Prohibits any bank holding company that establishes or acquires a securities affiliate, or that engages in securities affiliate activities, from permitting any of its subsidiary banks to engage in any of specified securities activities. Authorizes a depository institution securities affiliate to conduct all of the securities and securities-related activities that a national bank is not prohibited from conducting. Specifies activities that may be conducted by a bank holding company or a holding company securities affiliate. Subjects all transactions between a bank and its depository institution securities affiliate to the restrictions on interaffiliate transactions contained in the Federal Reserve Act. Permits savings and loan holding companies to acquire depository institution securities affiliates. Provides that no State may prohibit an affiliation between a national banking association and a company engaged in any of the activities authorized by this Act. Subjects Federal Reserve Board orders regarding bank holding companies and securities affiliates to judicial review solely on questions relating to the Board's findings on the issue of unfair competition and of whether a proposed activity is permissible for a bank holding company. Amends the Federal Reserve Act and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to set forth restrictions on transactions between member banks and their affiliates. Provides for exemptions from such restrictions. Amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to describe the depository institution service corporation activities permissible for depository institutions. Provides grandfather rights to service corporation investors and for service corporation activities where an investment was made and the activities were commenced prior to July 1, 1983. Amends the National Housing Act to subject unitary savings and loan holding companies which are not qualified thrift lenders to the same restrictions on their activities as multiple savings and loan holding companies. Grandfathers, under specified circumstances, certain activities of unitary savings and loan holding companies that were in existence on July 1, 1983, and which do not become qualified thrift lenders. Increases the number of the activities authorized for all savings and loan holding companies. Exempts a company that acquires a Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC)-insured institution pursuant to emergency thrift acquisition provisions from the restrictions on business activities applicable to savings and loan holding companies. Authorizes a holding company that was a unitary savings and loan holding company on July 1, 1983, to continue to engage in any activity in which it was engaged on June 27, 1984. Sets forth permissible activities for savings and loan holding companies. Requires a savings and loan holding company to notify the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation 60 days in advance of engaging in any such activity. Authorizes savings and loan holding companies to acquire one or more banks. Permits the activities of companies which own or control shares of a single savings and loan association to continue to engage in certain activities conducted exclusively overseas, provided such companies were chartered in a foreign country by June 1, 1984. Exempts from the prohibitions against interaffiliate transactions any transactions between FSLIC-insured thrifts and their affiliates engaged in permissible savings and loan holding company activities. Exempts from prior approval requirements the formation of a savings and loan holding company involving a simple reorganization of interest from individual ownership to holding company form. Subjects Federal Home Loan Bank Board orders under the National Housing Act to judicial review on questions related to the Board's findings regarding the issue of unfair competition and whether the proposed activity is permissible for a savings and loan holding company. Declares that no State shall prohibit the affiliation of any federally-chartered thrift institution with a company engaged in permissible activities for savings and loan holding companies. Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 to authorize Federal savings and loan associations to offer demand deposits to all their customers. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to require members of the Federal Home Loan Bank system to meet the qualified thrift lender asset test in order to obtain advances from a Federal Home Loan Bank. Authorizes a waiver of such requirement in appropriate circumstances. Amends the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 to extend the capital assistance programs for three years. Permits national banks to lease tangible personal property in amounts up to ten percent of the assets of the bank.
