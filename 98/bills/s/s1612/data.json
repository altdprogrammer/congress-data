    "date": "1983-07-13", 
    "text": "Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1983 - Enacts into law the short titles \"Civil Rights Act of 1968\" and \"Fair Housing Act.\" Adds new definitions of \"handicap\" \"conciliation\" and \"conciliation agreement.\" Excludes from the meaning of \"handicap\" any impairment consisting of alcohol, drug abuse or which would be a direct threat to the property or safety of others. Makes it unlawful to: (1) refuse to sell or rent to a handicapped person unless such handicap would prevent a prospective occupant from conforming to specified non-discrimination rules and practices; and (2) discriminate against a handicapped person in the conditions of sale or rental, or in the provision of related services or facilities. Includes within such discrimination a refusal to: (1) permit reasonable modifications to permit access to the premises (but only if a renter agrees to restore the premises to their original condition); and (2) make reasonable accommodations in policies, services, or facilities to afford handicapped persons ready access to and use of premises. Establishes a new administrative enforcement procedure within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Repeals the 30 day limitation imposed on the Secretary of HUD to respond to complaints. Requires the Secretary to give notice of his or her decision whether to resolve the complaint as promptly as possible. Provides that a conciliation agreement may provide for binding arbitration of the dispute. Permits the Secretary to join additional respondents as parties to a complaint. Grants authority to certified State or local agencies to investigate and conciliate complaints. Authorizes the Secretary to refer cases to the Attorney General while in the investigative stage for the purpose of seeking preliminary judicial relief pending the administrative disposition of the complaint. Allows the Secretary to refer other cases to the Attorney General in his or her sole discretion. Provides enforcement measures for conciliation agreements and civil penalties for noncompliance. Revises the enforcement procedure for private persons. Extends the statute of limitations for two years. Allows an aggrieved individual to enforce the terms of the conciliation agreement. Grants jurisdiction to the Attorney General to commence an action or intervene in a private civil action for violation of this Act."
