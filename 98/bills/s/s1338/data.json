    "date": "1983-05-23", 
    "text": "Housing and Community Development Act of 1983 - Title I: Rental Rehabilitation - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to: (1) make rental rehabilitation grants to State and local governments to support the moderate rehabilitation of private property for residential purposes; (2) make available contract authority for housing payment assistance to minimize the displacement of very low-income tenants and other lower income tenants from structures undergoing rehabilitation, to assist such tenants, and to assist other very low-income tenants in obtaining decent housing; and (3) make rental development grants to State and local governments to support the substantial rehabilitation or new construction of private property for residential purposes. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to allocate such grant amounts to cities with populations of 50,000 or more, urban counties, and States on the basis of a formula accounting for such factors as low-income renter population, rental housing market conditions, the condition of rental housing stock, and overcrowding of rental housing in each area. Authorizes the Secretary to establish minimum allocation amounts required for direct allocations to cities or urban counties and to adjust an area's allocation on the basis of the area's performance in carrying out its program in a timely manner and achieving low rents in 80 percent of its rehabilitated units. Conditions the receipt of such grants on the submission by grantees of satisfactory information in rental rehabilitation or development program descriptions. Requires that such a description describe the proposed program and activities to be assisted, certify that the grantee consulted with the public, show evidence of the grantee's capacity to undertake the project, show the financial feasibility of the program, indicate the criteria to be used in selecting projects and the effect of the program on neighborhood preservation, and certify compliance with civil rights laws. Prohibits the provision of grants for substantial rehabilitation or new construction unless the Secretary finds that: (1) the area is experiencing a severe shortage of rental housing and has extremely low vacancy rates; and (2) a program of other than moderate rehabilitation is necessary to improve rental opportunities or to advance a neighborhood preservation program. Limits the amount of a rental rehabilitation or development grant to 120 percent of the amount allocated by formula. Requires that at least 70 percent of grant amounts be used for the benefit of lower income families, but authorizes the Secretary to reduce such percentage requirement to 50 percent where the grantee cannot develop a program meeting such higher requirement. Allows the Secretary to limit allocation of housing payment assistance to the amount needed for the number of units to be rehabilitated. Requires such an assistance contract to: (1) permit a grantee to provide assistance for a unit for up to one year; and (2) assure the provision of assistance to all very low-income tenants of structures rehabilitated with assistance under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to reallocate grants and housing payment assistance based on the Secretary's assessment of each grantee's performance. Allows each grantee to shift up to 20 percent of the funds allocated from grants to housing payment assistance or vice versa. Requires grantees to submit annual performance reports and the Secretary to undertake annual reviews and audits of grantee performance. Permits the Secretary to adjust, reduce, or withdraw grants or assistance based on his or her findings. Requires a rental rehabilitation and development program to provide that: (1) grants shall only be used to rehabilitate or develop real property to be used primarily for residential rental property in neighborhoods where the median income does not exceed 80 percent of the median area income; (2) rehabilitated units shall meet housing standards for housing assistance payments under the United States Housing Act of 1937; (3) grant assistance shall not exceed 50 percent of the total rehabilitation or development cost, or 50 percent of such cost plus refinancing and acquisition costs in special circumstances; (4) assisted structures shall be exempt from State or local rent controls; (5) owners of assisted structures shall not discriminate against families receiving housing assistance payments; and (6) financing for an assisted structure shall require the borrower to be personally liable for repayment. Limits the amount of a grant for new construction or substantial rehabilitation to the amount required to provide decent rental or cooperative housing of modest design which is affordable to lower income families without other housing alternatives. Requires a project owner to: (1) enter agreements to assure the project's financial feasibility; (2) agree that for ten years after 50 percent of the project units are available at least 20 percent shall be occupied by lower income persons; and (3) agree, for ten years after project units are available for occupancy, to pass on to tenants any reduction in costs resulting from the assistance provided, not to discriminate against families receiving housing assistance payments, and not to convert the units to condominiums or cooperative units unaffordable for lower income families. Requires an owner who violates any such agreement to repay the total amount of assistance provided plus interest. Requires that an assisted project contain five or more units to be used for primarily residential purposes. Declares that mortgages on such projects are eligible for insurance under the National Housing Act. Requires rents charged for project units to be approved by the Secretary. Limits maximum rents to not more than 30 percent of the income of a family whose income equals 50 percent of the median area income. Exempts such projects from State or local rent controls. Directs a State to administer grants for cities with populations of less than 50,000 and for areas that do not qualify for direct grants and that are not eligible for rural housing assistance under the Housing Act of 1949. Permits a State to use such grant amounts to administer its own rental rehabilitation or development program, or to distribute amounts to local governments. Allows a city with a population exceeding 50,000 to elect to have a State administer its grant program and permits a State to elect to have the Secretary administer its grant program. Requires the Secretary to establish regulations governing relocation payments. Prohibits a State or local government from using grant funds for administrative expenses. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures that support national historical preservation objectives and that prohibit rehabilitation activities on historical structures unless certain standards are met or the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation is offered an opportunity to comment on such activities. Permits consortia of geographically proximate local governments to apply for grants. Establishes grant eligibility for such consortia with populations exceeding 50,000. Amends the National Housing Act to set forth coinsurance provisions for federally insured rental rehabilitation or development projects. Authorizes the Secretary, for purposes of insuring mortgages executed in connection with any purchase or refinancing of rental rehabilitation or development property, to: (1) include a specified amount of rehabilitation or development costs; (2) permit subordinated liens securing up to the full amount of mortgage financing provided by State or local governments; and (3) pay benefits in cash unless a mortgagee submits a written request for debenture payment. Title II: Community and Neighborhood Development - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to authorize appropriations for FY 1984 through 1986 for the community development block grant (CDBG) program, the urban development action grant (UDAG) program, and the special discretionary fund of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Earmarks a specified amount of the appropriations set aside for the discretionary fund for grants to Indian tribes. Requires the primary objective of the program of each CDBG recipient to be to benefit principally persons of low and moderate income. Conditions an entity's eligibility for a CDBG on the requirement for the use of funds taken as a whole, over a period not exceeding three years, to benefit principally such persons. Repeals the requirement that a State match ten percent of the CDBG funds provided to the State for nonentitlement areas (areas other than metropolitan areas and urban counties). Requires any State that elects after FY 1984 to administer such a small cities grant program to administer such program permanently. Requires the Secretary to administer the small cities grant program in any State that elects not to administer such program. Permits any State administering such a program to deduct from grant funds the first $100,000 of its expenses and 50 percent of its expenses exceeding $100,000, not to exceed two percent of the total grant amount. Requires grant amounts not received by a State because of its failure to comply with performance report or community development requirements to be added to amounts allocated to all States rather than the same State for the succeeding fiscal year. Allows a unit of local government that uses more than ten percent of its CDBG funds for public service expenditures in FY 1983 to allocate the greater of the same percentage or dollar amount of its CDBG funds for such expenditures in succeeding years. Requires any local government that receives a lump-sum drawdown of its CDBG to establish a revolving loan fund to make substantial expenditures from such fund within a specified period. Sets forth conditions under which a grantee may receive a lump sum advance of CDBG funds for a specific project. Requires a grant recipient to submit an annual performance and evaluation report on its activities to the Secretary and to make such report available to citizens in its jurisdiction. Directs the Secretary to: (1) encourage national associations of eligible grantees or States to recommend uniform recordkeeping and performance and evaluation reporting requirements for entitlement grantees and States; and (2) establish requirements based on approved recommendations. Allows the Secretary to guarantee loans to grantees only when such grantees cannot otherwise receive the financing needed for timely execution of their community development programs. Earmarks a specified amount of UDAG appropriations for technical assistance grants to States, municipal technical advisory services, and State associations of municipalities to assist cities with populations of less than 50,000 in developing and implementing programs eligible for UDAGs and in applying for such grants. Authorizes consortia of such cities to apply. Directs the Secretary to select criteria for a national competition for UDAGs. Authorizes UDAG eligibility for certain unincorporated portions of urban counties that are approved by the Secretary as identifiable communities. Revises activities eligible for CDBG funding to include the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or installation of all public facilities, except buildings for the general conduct of government. Authorizes the Secretary to issue an advisory opinion that a proposed innovative or prototypical activity is an eligible activity. Declares that such eligibility shall not be challenged unless the activity is conducted in a different manner than that proposed by the Secretary. Amends the Housing Act of 1964 to repeal provisions authorizing the Secretary to make rehabilitation loans directly to property owners and tenants. Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969 to repeal provisions authorizing the General Services Administration to transfer Federal surplus real property to the Secretary or the Secretary of Agriculture for sale or lease at fair value for use for low and moderate-income housing. Permits the transfer of property requested before enactment of this Act. Amends the Housing Act of 1949 to repeal provisions that prohibit an urban renewal plan from providing for the construction of transient housing unless the community involved has obtained a transient housing study indicating a need for such housing. Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 and the Housing Act of 1961 to repeal provisions requiring the Secretary's approval of the conversion of neighborhood facilities or open space land to uses not originally approved by the Secretary when awarding a grant for acquisition of such facilities or land. Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to provide that, for purposes of CDBG eligibility, entities classified as metropolitan cities until the decennial census of 1980 indicated that their populations dropped below 50,000 shall continue to be classified as metropolitan cities until September 30, 1984. Declares that the entitlement status of an entity designated as a metropolitan area or central city of such area shall not be affected by a withdrawal of such designation without one year's prior notice of such withdrawal. Permits the population of a central city that falls below 50,000 during the funding period of an urban county to be included in such county before the expiration of such period. Requires CDBG recipients to include in proposed and final statements on community development objectives and the projected use of funds a description of the use of funds received in specified past periods and an assessment of the relationship of such use to the objectives proposed for such funds. Provides that, under certain conditions, the CDBG amount for a government formed by the consolidation of metropolitan cities and urban counties shall be equal to the sum of amounts such cities and counties would have received if they had not consolidated. Requires the Secretary to distribute any excess metropolitan city and urban county grant amounts in a fiscal year on a pro rata basis. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to qualified groups and groups designated by governmental units to assist such units in carrying out the CDBG and UDAG programs. Permits a local government to retain program income realized from CDBG funds if: (1) such income was realized after the initial disbursement of such funds; and (2) such government agrees to use such income for eligible community development activities. Provides that after September 1, 1983, UDAG funds set aside for small cities that remain unobligated for two years may be made available for grants to metropolitan cities and urban counties. Authorizes appropriations for the urban homesteading program for FY 1984 and 1985. Provides for the payment of consideration by a State or local government to the Secretary and by an individual or family to such government for real property transferred under an urban homesteading program. Requires such a government to remit to the Secretary 50 percent of any amount by which the consideration it receives for such property exceeds the consideration it paid for such property. Authorizes the Secretary to undertake a program to demonstrate the feasibility of using homesteading techniques to facilitate the reuse of multifamily properties owned by the Secretary for home ownership purposes. Directs the Secretary to convey suitable properties to State and local governments for subsequent transfer to individuals under a cooperative or condominium form of ownership. Requires the Secretary to undertake a program to demonstrate the feasibility of providing assistance to lower income families for the rehabilitation of conveyed property. Establishes the amount of such assistance on the basis of the payment standard for rental assistance payments under the United States Housing Act of 1937. Directs the Secretary to conduct a program to demonstrate the feasibility of providing assistance to State and local governments for the purchase of unoccupied real property that is improved by a one- to four-family dwelling and designated for use in a single-family homestead program. Requires the property to be conveyed under such program to a low- or moderate-income family or individual who agrees to: (1) repair all dangerous defects within one year; (2) make repairs or improvements necessary to meet applicable local buildings standards; and (3) occupy such property as a principal residence for at least five years. Directs the Secretary to evaluate the success of the demonstration as a method of increasing the stock of housing available for the homesteading program and to submit a report to Congress by March 1, 1985. Directs the Secretary to conduct a three-year demonstration program to determine the feasibility of supporting neighborhood development activities by providing Federal matching funds to certain nonprofit neighborhood development organizations on the basis of monetary support from the private sector. Limits the amount of grants that may be multiyear awards. Directs the Secretary to use a competitive process in selecting program participants. Requires that a selected participant: (1) demonstrate measurable achievements in certain neighborhood development activities; (2) specify a plan for accomplishing one or more of such activities; and (3) specify a strategy for achieving long term private sector support. Directs the Secretary to establish a Neighborhood Development Advisory Council to evaluate the applicants and recommend selections. Requires the Secretary to: (1) assign each participating organization a program year during which time voluntary private contributions shall be eligible for matching funds; and (2) establish a ratio of between one and ten Federal dollars matched for each dollar privately contributed, which the Secretary shall pay to each organization at the end of each three-month period of the organization's program year. Limits the maximum amount the Secretary may pay to any organization for a year to $50,000. Requires the Secretary to insure that: (1) assistance may be provided only if the local government of the neighborhood to be assisted certifies that such assistance is consistent with such government's objectives; and (2) eligible neighborhood development activities comply with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the activities carried out under the demonstration program, an evaluation of the program, and any findings or recommendations concerning the program. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Housing Assistance Programs - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to require the Secretary to allocate certain Federal housing assistance on the basis of a formula accounting for the relative needs of different States, areas, and communities. Repeals the requirement that between 20 and 25 percent of such assistance be allocated to metropolitan areas. Requires the Secretary to allocate authority for assistance under the housing assistance payment program of the United States Housing Act of 1937 for the rural housing preservation grant program. Directs the Secretary to accommodate the desires of State and local governments regarding the types of assistance to be provided within the limits of each area's allocation. Authorizes the Secretary to approve the use of such assistance for existing public housing projects. Authorizes the appropriation of funds from the Secretary's discretionary housing fund for emergency shelter assistance grants to local governments, Indian tribes, and nonprofit organizations. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to establish FY 1984 limitations on reservations of authority for assistance to public housing agencies for annual contribution contracts for specified lower income housing assistance programs. Permits public housing agency annual contribution contracts using a payment standard for family-selected existing housing. Establishes such payment standard as the maximum monthly rent that an owner of an existing dwelling may receive for a unit assisted under such a contract. Revises procedures for selecting tenants for such units to establish a preference for families that pay more than 50 percent of their incomes as rent. Allows a public housing agency to adjust assistance payments to such an owner by up to 20 percent of the maximum monthly rent or payment standard for categories of families or for an individual family, provided such agency certifies to the Secretary that it has consulted the local government and public and determined that such adjustment is required. Requires the Secretary to establish and publish payment standards for various sizes and types of dwelling units in each market area and to use such standards to determine monthly assistance amounts under annual contribution contracts. Requires such standards to: (1) be established at the forty-fifth percentile of rents for recently rented units (excluding public housing units and units not meeting quality standards) unless such rents are found to be excessive; (2) be adjusted if the appropriate public housing agency provides information indicating that an excessive time is required for assisted families to rent standard quality units; and (3) include an amount for utilities. Sets the monthly assistance payment for an eligible family at the lowest of: (1) the amount by which the applicable payment standard exceeds 30 percent of the family's monthly adjusted income; (2) the amount by which the unit rent exceeds ten percent of the family's monthly income; or (3) the amount by which the lower of the rent or the payment standard exceeds a portion of the family's welfare assistance payment as designated by the Secretary. Requires a family to be a very low-income family or a family previously assisted in order to receive such assistance. Establishes preferences for families which occupy substandard housing, are involuntarily displaced, or are paying more than 50 percent of their incomes for rent. Authorizes the Secretary to override such preferences and use authority provided for such assistance for families: (1) previously assisted through annual contribution contracts; (2) occupying units in formerly assisted projects acquired by the Secretary; or (3) occupying dwellings to be rehabilitated under the rental rehabilitation and development program set forth in title I of this Act. Limits the duration of the initial term of a contract for annual contributions for such assistance payments to 60 months. Requires the public housing agency to inspect each unit before any payment is made and at least annually during the contract term to assure compliance with housing quality standards. Authorizes an agency to increase the assistance payments annually to assure continued affordability. Requires contracts for such assistance to provide ten percent more annual contributions than the estimated assistance required during the first year. Authorizes the use of amounts not needed for increases to provide assistance for other families. Permits a public housing agency to commit up to five percent of the payment standard assistance authority for assistance to low-income mutual or cooperative housing if such commitment will assist in maintaining the affordability of such housing for low-income families. Sets forth provisions governing payment standard assistance for families renting manufactured homes, spaces, or both. Amends the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act to exempt the establishment of the specific amounts for fair market rents or payment standards from congressional review procedures. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to allow the Secretary to establish an income ceiling higher or lower than 50 percent of the area median income when defining \"very low-income families\" for purposes of the housing assistance programs if such a variation is necessary because of unusually high or low family incomes. Excludes the value of food stamps from a family's income for purposes of such programs. Requires the adjusted income of an elderly family to exclude medical expenses exceeding three percent of the family's income. Requires the Secretary to identify the portion (not to exceed 30 percent) of a family's welfare payment that a family shall pay as a minimum rent under such programs. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for delayed application or staged implementation of procedures for determining rents or tenant contributions under housing assistance programs as required by specified provisions of this Act or the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1981 with respect to all tenants occupying assisted housing units on or before the effective date of regulations implementing the payment standard assistance program under this Act. Prohibits any annual rent or contribution increase exceeding ten percent for such tenants as a result of such provisions or any other change in Federal law.
