  "summary": {
    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-05-04", 
    "text": "Food Stamp and Commodity Distribution Amendments of 1983 - Title I: References to the Food Stamp Act of 1977 - Declares that amendments or repeals made by this Act, unless otherwise noted, shall be considered amendments or repeals to the Food Stamp Act of 1977. Title II: Food Stamp Budgetary Revisions - Amends such Act to revise the definition of household to remove references to parents, children, and siblings and insert references to groups of individuals living together. States that sanctions against any member of a household shall not disqualify the entire household from the food stamp program. Changes the thrifty food plan adjustments schedules for October 1, 1983, and October 1, 1984, to April 1, 1984, and April 1, 1985, respectively. Changes subsequent October 1 adjustments to the next April 1. Replaces the current standard deduction, excess shelter expense deduction, and the combined dependent care/excess shelter expense deduction with a standard/shelter deduction. Removes provisions for adjustments to the dependent care deduction and sets forth a maximum allowable amount. Conforms the standard earnings deduction with such deduction under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program (AFDC) under the Social Security Act. Requires that AFDC families be considered categorically eligible for food stamp benefits. Requires that allotment values for such families be determined under approved plans based upon household size and specified categories. Extends the work requirement for persons between the ages of 18 and 60 to persons between the ages of 16 and 60. Exempts persons between the ages of 16 and 18 under paternal control of another household member. Repeals the exemption for certain students from the work requirement. Makes mandatory (currently, at State option) that job search requirements commence at the time of application for food stamps. Grants State agencies the option of extending work requirements to caretakers of children between the ages of three and six, if adequate care is available for such children. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate guidelines to enable State agencies to design and operate community work experience programs. Makes participation in such programs a mandatory requirement for household members subject to food stamp work requirements. Repeals provisions for the workfare program. Revises State agency liability provisions to institute an error rate liability program under which State agencies shall be responsible for error rates in excess of three percent. Title III: Improving Administrative Procedures for the Food Stamp Program - Removes the income exclusion for student reimbursements. Makes certain aliens ineligible for the food stamp program. Allows the consideration of food stamp allotments in the determinations for Federal housing assistance. Allows the redemption of food stamp coupons at any bank or savings and loan association (currently, redemption is allowed only at certain federally insured institutions.) Changes the expedited coupon issuance procedure from providing such coupons not later than five days after application to providing such coupons not later than five working days after application. Allows State agencies to use sources other than the Social Security Administration and State unemployment agencies when making wage matching determinations. Requires State agencies to establish work registration and job search services to effectuate eligibility provisions of the food stamp program. Provides that, in the case of retailer/wholesaler disqualifications, stays of administrative action shall be considered under the applicable law governing such relief. Repeals the noncash benefit requirement for the Puerto Rico nutrition assistance program. Title IV: Administrative Funds for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program - Amends the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 to include the value of bonus commodities in determining the administrative cost ceiling for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. Title V: Effective Date - Provides that the amendments made by this Act shall be effective on dates prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture unless specified otherwise."
