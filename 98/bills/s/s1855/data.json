    "text": "Land Remote Sensing Satellite Authorization Act of 1983 - Declares that the Secretary of Commerce shall be responsible for the operation of the existing United States land remote sensing satellite (Landsat) system with authority to lease or contract such operation to the private sector. Directs the Secretary to acquire from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) all portions of the existing system, except those devoted solely to research and development. Directs the Secretary to: (1) prepare a comprehensive overall plan for managing the existing Landsat system; and (2) establish a competitive process that seeks to provide data continuity after a specified Landsat satellite is no longer operating. Permits the Secretary to guarantee leases or loans issued to finance private sector development of Landsat systems that meet basic Federal requirements. Prohibits the sale, distribution, or reproduction for sale or distribution of any data or basic information product produced by the existing United States Landsat system, except in accordance with the Secretary's conditions. Sets forth a civil penalty for violation of such prohibition. Confers jurisdiction on the U.S. district courts to restrain or enjoin violations. Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to determine the frequencies for use by United States Landsat and commercial Landsat systems. Declares that nothing in this Act reduces or otherwise affects the authority of NASA to continue the research and development of remote sensing components, subsystems, and systems for experimental purposes."
