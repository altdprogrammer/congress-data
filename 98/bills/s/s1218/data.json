Requires the Secretary of the Interior to identify Federal lands which may be exchanged for non-Federal lands within the boundaries of the recreation area. Requires the Secretary to determine ten years after the enactment of this Act which lands should be retained and included in the recreation area. Sets forth requirements with respect to the acquisition for inclusion in the recreation area of private lands used for single family residential purposes or for agricultural purposes. Specifies procedural rules for land transfers in the recreation area by private owners. Requires Federal and State agencies and instrumentalities which construct water supply or other projects which adversely affect the recreation area to mitigate such effects by acquisition of replacement lands of comparable resource value within the land corridors adjacent to the banks of the Chattahoochee River. Increases the amount of funds which may be used for land acquisition for the recreation area. Establishes the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area Advisory Commission, which shall advise the Secretary with respect to land acquisition for the recreation area."
