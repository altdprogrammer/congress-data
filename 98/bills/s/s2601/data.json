Limits the amounts of appropriations which may be expended for: (1) consultation; and (2) expenses of the Foundation incurred outside the United States. Permits the transfer of funds among the categories: (1) of up to ten percent of the amount authorized for such category; and (2) in excess of such ten percent when either 30 days have passed after specified congressional committees are notified of the proposed transfer or the chairmen of specified congressional committees write the Director of the Foundation that there is no objection to such transfer. Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to repeal: (1) the requirement that National Science Board members be notified of board meetings by registered or certified mail; (2) the prohibition against a Foundation employee registering a patent in his or her own interest which is related to the subject matter of and is made in connection with official duties; and (3) the prohibition against the Director, Deputy Director, or Assistant Director of the Foundation engaging in any other business, vocation, or employment while serving in such position. Increases the amount of money for which the Director may make contracts, grants, or other arrangements, without the Board's approval, providing certain other conditions are met. Amends the National Science Foundation Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1978 to repeal: (1) the requirement that the Director of the National Science Foundation establish a Resource Center for Science and Engineering at an educational institution enrolling a substantial number of minority and/or low-income students; and (2) the requirement that contracting officers of the Foundation report any financial or academic affiliation with a grant applicant."
