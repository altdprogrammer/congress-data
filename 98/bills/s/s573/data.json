Requires a depository institution to: (1) furnish its customers preprinted deposit slips, or envelopes for automatic teller machine deposits bearing a summary statement of such withdrawal policy; or (2) in the case of a particular deposit by check or similar instrument for which funds may not be immediately available for withdrawal, provide specific notice of the time the customer may withdraw such funds. Requires a depository institution to begin to compute interest on funds so deposited on the date on which such institution receives provisional credit for check or similar instrument. Requires depository institutions to comply with certain endorsement standards. Provides for expedited notice of nonpayment of a check or similar instrument. Requires the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to publish model disclosure forms and regulations to carry out this Act. Provides for administrative enforcement of compliance with this Act. Sets forth civil penalties for any depository institutions which fails to comply with the requirements of this Act."
