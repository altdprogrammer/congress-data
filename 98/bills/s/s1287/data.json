Prohibits any public building construction, renovation, repair, or alteration unless an appropriation for the estimated costs of such construction has been authorized in the same fiscal year. Prohibits entering into any lease, beginning in FY 1985, unless the authority to enter into contracts has first been made for the maximum cost of such lease. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 for certain real property management and related activities of the Public Buildings Service. Itemizes specified buildings and maximum expenditures. States that such appropriated funds for construction, renovation, repair, or alteration shall remain available for obligation and expenditure without regard to fiscal year limitations. Directs that ten percent of the funds authorized under this Act shall be available for repair or alteration projects and leases not authorized by this Act, if the Administrator of General Services certifies that such expenditures resulted from emergency building conditions or changing or additional programs of Federal agencies. Directs the Administrator of General Services to transfer a specified building in Washington, D.C. (currently occupied by the United States International Trade Commission and the United States Postal Service) to the Smithsonian Institution for the use of certain art galleries of the Smithsonian Institution. Directs the Administrator to relocate the United States International Trade Commission in a quality building that the Administrator and the Chairman of the United States International Trade Commission jointly determine is suitable to its headquarters operations in the downtown Washington, D.C. area. Authorizes the Administrator to enter into contracts to make the transferred building suitable to house certain art galleries and related activities of the Smithsonian. Prohibits obligation or expenditure of any General Services Administration funds for procurement by contract of any service which before enactment of this Act was performed by individuals in their capacity as employees of the General Services Administration in any position of mechanic.
