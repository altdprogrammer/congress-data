Directs the Secretary of Commerce to submit estimates to the Secretary of the Treasury on the number of new automobile sales in the United States. Requires such estimates to be made at the beginning of each calendar quarter. Requires the estimates to cover projected sales during: (1) the subsequent six quarters; and (2) the calendar year during which the estimate is being made. Limits the number of Japanese automobile imports to 14 percent of sales estimates for each of calendar years 1986-1987. Requires quarterly revisions of the estimates to reflect any changes in the estimate of auto sales for the calendar year."
