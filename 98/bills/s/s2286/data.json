Prohibits the consideration of any legislation which, directly or indirectly, authorizes the enactment of new tax expenditures to become effective during a fiscal year: (1) unless such legislation is reported to the House or Senate on or before May 15 preceding the beginning of such fiscal year; and (2) if such legislation authorizes the enactment of new tax expenditures to be effective for more than ten consecutive calendar years. Requires referral of any legislation authorizing the enactment of new tax expenditures to the congressional committee with jurisdiction over the activity such new tax expenditure is intended to affect. Defines the term \"new tax expenditures\" to mean the enactment of a tax expenditure or the increase of an existing tax expenditure. Sets forth the effective dates for the provisions of this Act."
