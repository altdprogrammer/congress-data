    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Amends the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) with respect to request procedures, time limits, fees, and exemptions. Directs each Agency to set forth regulations specifying a uniform schedule of fees for FOIA requests. Requires that these regulations provide for reasonable standard charges for the costs of processing FOIA requests. Provides that no fee shall be charged when the costs of routine collection and processing are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. Permits the charging of fair value fees in addition to processing fees, for records containing commercially valuable technological information acquired by the Government at substantial public cost. Permits an agency to waive or reduce a fee upon its determination that such allowance meets a substantial public interest. Permits, in unusual circumstances, the extension for up to 30 working days of the current time limits for compliance with FOIA requests. Defines six \"unusual circumstances\" for such purpose. Provides a procedure for business confidentiality with regard to information consisting of trade secrets, or commercial, research, financial or business information. Establishes procedures under which a submitter of information which may be subject to the commercial information exemption is to be notified of a decision allowing disclosure and permitted to provide written objections and seek de novo judicial review of a decision allowing disclosure over such objections. Extends the current exemption given to law enforcement records to include records which: (1) tend to disclose the identity of confidential sources; and (2) would endanger the physical safety of any natural person (currently, only law enforcement personnel). Authorizes an agency to offer a requester of public record information a choice between receiving an index of sources gratis or duplicates of the information for a fee. Exempts certain information maintained or originated by the Secret Service. Authorizes the Attorney General to prescribe regulations limiting the release of information to imprisoned Federal or State felons or persons requesting information on their behalf. Exempts from disclosure requirements any documents compiled in organized crime investigations, for five years after such compilation, except in specified circumstances. Requires an agency to list in the Federal register any statute relied upon to withhold certain information."
