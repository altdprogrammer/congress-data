Makes it a Federal offense for an attorney to fail to make timely disclosures to law enforcement authorities of his knowledge of a clients criminal behavior if such attorney's services have been used. Provides for a fine of up to $5,000 and/or imprisonment for up to one year for violations of this section. Applies these requirements only to an attorney who, within the course of representing a client, prepares or mails any document or other item that could assist the client in committing a criminal or fraudulent act."
