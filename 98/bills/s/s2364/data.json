    "text": "Military Construction Authorization Act, 1985 - Title I: Army - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to acquire real property and carry out military construction projects in specified amounts at specified installations and locations. Permits the Secretary to construct or acquire family housing units at specified installations in specified amounts. Permits the Secretary to improve existing military family housing units. Earmarks certain housing funds for energy conservation projects only. Title II: Navy - Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to acquire real property and carry out military construction projects in specified amounts at specified installations and locations. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a water supply and flood control project for the Santa Margarita River, Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, California. Authorizes the Secretary to construct or acquire family housing units at specified installations. Authorizes expenditures to improve existing military family housing units. Title III: Air Force - Authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to acquire real property and carry out military construction projects in specified amounts at specified installations and locations. Authorizes improvements to existing military family housing units. Earmarks certain housing funds for energy conservation projects only. Permits the Secretary to improve existing military family housing units as specified. Title IV: Defense Agencies - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to acquire real property and carry out military construction projects in specified amounts at specified installations and locations. Permits the Secretary to construct or acquire family housing units at specified installations. Permits expenditures to improve existing units. Amends the Military Construction Authorizations Act, 1984, to increase the authorizations level for defense agency construction in FY 1984. Title V: North Atlantic Treaty Organization Infrastructure - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to make contributions for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Infrastructure program. Title VI: Authorization of Appropriations and Recurring Administrative Provisions - Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years after FY 1984 for military construction, land acquisition, and military family housing functions of the Departments of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, and the defense agencies. Authorizes appropriations for the NATO Infrastructure program. Limits the total cost of all projects to the total amounts authorized to be appropriated for each military department concerned. States that such authorizations shall expire at the end of FY 1986 except as otherwise specified. Establishes maximum amounts on certain expenditures, including unspecified minor military construction projects and per unit improvement and rental costs for military family housing. Title VII: Guard and Reserve Forces Facilities - Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years after FY 1984 for the costs of acquisition, architectural and engineering services, and construction of facilities for the guard and reserve forces. Increases from $50,000 to $100,000 the ceiling on facility acquisitions which the Secretary of Defense may make using funds available for operations and maintenance. Expands the authority of the Secretary to contribute funds to a State for arms storage rooms to encompass any critical portion of State facilities related to a Federal military mission. Title VIII: General Provisions - Expands the liability of a member of the armed forces for damage to housing, equipment, and furnishing to include damage to an unaccompanied personnel housing unit as well as to a family unit. Permits the Secretary to establish limitations of liability or to compromise or waive claims. Sets 75 percent as an absolute rather than a ceiling for the amount of a member's basic allowance for quarters which will be charged when a member with dependents occupies a substandard family housing unit under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department. Treats land acquisition projects involving condemned lands the same as all other land acquisition projects conducted by a military department. Increases from five to 12 the percent of available real property funds a Secretary of a military department may use to acquire options. Authorizes a Secretary of a military department to use operation and maintenance or construction funds to restore land to a condition required by another military department or Federal agency which has permitted such land to the department. Authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to exchange specified lands with the Colorado Board of Land Commissioners to acquire title to or interests in lands in the vicinity of Consolidated Space Operations Center, Falcon Air Force Station, Colorado. Expands the Secretary of Defense's emergency construction authority to activate it whenever the President determines an imminent threat to the national security exists such that current facilities would be inadequate to meet a mobilization effort. Terminates such authority in six months or at the end of a declared war or national emergency. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress when contract cost variations are in excess of 25 percent of funds appropriated for the project and the total cost under the contract exceeds the maximum amount for a minor military construction project. Eliminates the 21-day congressional notice period before emergency or contingency military construction may proceed, but requires the Secretary to submit a detailed report to Congress on such projects prior to the obligation of funds. Title IX - Authorizes appropriations for military construction for FY 1986."
