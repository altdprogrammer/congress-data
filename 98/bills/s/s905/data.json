    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 98-1124) National Archives and Records Administration Act of 1984 - Title I: Establishment of an Independent National Archives and Records Administration - Establishes the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) as an independent establishment in the executive branch to be directed by the Archivist of the United States.

Directs the Administrator to provide guidance and assistance to agencies to ensure the economical and effective utilization of space, staff, equipment, and supplies for records management. Requires the Archivist and Administrator, to the extent practicable, to promulgate identical regulations governing the inspection of records the use of which is restricted for reasons of national security or the public interest. Amends the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act to provide that regulations relating to public access to certain tape recordings and other materials involving former President Richard M. Nixon cannot take effect until the expiration of 60 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after their submission to each House of Congress.

(Currently such fee may exceed such costs by up to ten percent.) Authorizes the NATF Board to: (1) use the services and personnel of NARA and other agencies to assist the Board in performing its functions; and (2) appoint necessary personnel, subject to laws governing appointments in the competitive service. (Currently, the Board may appoint employees without regard to civil service laws.) Authorizes the Board to authorize the transfer of funds to NARA to be expended on an archival or records activity approved by the Board or to accomplish the purpose of a gift or bequest. Permits the Board to solicit gifts or bequests. Requires that moneys received for the NATF be deposited within ten working days. Requires the Archivist to request that the Attorney General initiate action for the recovery of agency records unlawfully removed or for other legal redress against persons who remove or destroy agency records if the agency fails to take such action within a reasonable period of time after being informed of its necessity by the Archivist. Directs the Archivist to notify Congress of any such request. Permits the Archivist to authorize an agency to dispose of records only after publishing notice of, and providing an opportunity for public comment on, such disposal. Title III: General Provisions - Sets forth the effective date of this Act. Provides that any spending authority provided under this Act shall be effective for any fiscal year only to the extent provided in appropriations Acts."
