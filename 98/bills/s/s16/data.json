    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an individual taxpayer an income tax deduction for contributions to a savings account established to pay the educational expenses (tuition, supplies, meals and lodging) of such taxpayer or the taxpayer's child at an institution of higher education or a vocational school. Limits the amount of such deduction to $750 (adjusted for inflation) for each account per year, up to a maximum of $3,000 for all accounts that are established. Specifies that no account may have more than one beneficiary and that no individual may be a beneficiary of more than one account. Permits the deferral of income tax on income accumulated in such educational savings accounts as long as such amounts are used exclusively for educational expenses. Specifies penalties for the use of account funds for other than educational purposes. Excludes from the gross income of account beneficiaries any distributions from the account made on their behalf which are used for educational expenses."
