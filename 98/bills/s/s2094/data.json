Permits the Secretary of Health and Human Services to add additional substances to this list, through notice and comment rulemaking, if they become substances of abuse. Prohibits the manufacture and distribution of drugs which a reasonable person would believe to be a controlled substance. Repeals the prohibition on obtaining injunctions against the manufacturers and distributors of counterfeit drugs and the making, selling or concealing of the equipment used to make counterfeit drugs. Extends the FDA's seizure authority to prohibited look-alike drugs."
