Sets forth a formula for determining the quantities of each classification of material to be imported. Requires that each stockpile goal be reviewed at least every four years by the interagency committee. Requires the head of an agency, upon the committee's determination, to notify Congress of any proposed new formula for computing the stockpile goal for a particular material. Makes such formula effective 90 days after such notification unless either House of Congress, within such period, agrees to a resolution of disapproval."
