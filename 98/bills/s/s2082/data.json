    "text": "Olmsted Historic Landscapes Act - Requires the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to prepare a State-by- State inventory of Olmsted historic landscapes. Provides that all properties on the inventory shall be part of an Olmsted historic landscape system. Requires that property identified in the inventory as nationally significant by a State historic preservation officer or by a State outdoor recreation liaison officer be studied by the Secretary for possible designation as a national landmark and for the World Heritage List. Requires that property on the inventory which meets the appropriate criteria be nominated for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Requires periodic updating of the inventory. Directs the Secretary to: (1) promulgate general standards for preservation of historic landscapes; (2) provide technical assistance to Federal agencies, State and local governments, private organizations, and other interested individuals on the identification, commemoration, and preservation of Olmsted historic landscapes; (3) conduct and submit to Congress a thematic study of historic landscapes to identify those landscapes which would qualify as national historic landscapes; (4) establish a program for the use of the Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site in Massachusetts as a center for research and establish an advisory committee for the site; and (5) develop appropriate international activities related to the Olmsted historic landscapes. Requires the Secretary to provide for the coordination of applications for grants for the preservation of Olmsted historic landscapes. Permits State and local governments to use Federal funds made available to them for the preservation of any inventoried Olmsted historic landscape. Requires the Secretary to assist and coordinate public and private cooperation in carrying out the purposes of this Act. Requires the Secretary to conduct appropriate activities during the decade of 1985 to 1995 to commemorate the Olmsted achievements and influence on American life. Establishes the Advisory Committee on Olmsted Historic Landscapes, which shall assist the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in carrying out those of its duties under the National Historic Preservation Act that relate to Olmsted historic landscapes."
