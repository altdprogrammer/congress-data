    "text": "Technology Security Enforcement Act of 1983 - Amends the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute (RICO) to include within its offenses those involved with the control of arms exports and imports, technology exports, and the export of technical data. Amends the Federal criminal code to permit court-authorized surveillance where there is probable cause to believe that a violation of the Export Administration Act, the Arms Export Control Act or this Act exists. Amends the Arms Export Control Act to increase the penalties for violations of such Act to: (1) a fine of $1,000,000 or five times the value of the exports, whichever is greater for entities; and (2) a fine of up to $250,000, or imprisonment for up to ten years, for individuals. Urges the President to negotiate with foreign countries to promote cooperation in the enforcement of export laws. Urges the President to develop an improved system of export regulations for high technology items. Makes it a Federal offense to steal, receive or purchase technology with an intent to export it unlawfully. Prohibits any person from engaging in bribery to secure technology with the intent to export it unlawfully."
