Prohibits any State, or political subdivision thereof, from taxing or otherwise taking into account: (1) the amount of the deduction for dividends paid by a corporation which has elected the Puerto Rico and possession tax credit for the taxable year; or (2) a certain percentage (determined according to specified formulae) of any dividend received from a domestic corporation which is not treated as income from sources within the United States (or a dividend received by a corporation from a foreign corporation). Provides that nothing in this Act shall subject any dividend, other income item or portion thereof, to taxation if such taxation is otherwise prohibited by any law, or rule of law, of the United States."
