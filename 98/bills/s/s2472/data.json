Authorizes the Secretary to make an interim payment not to exceed $3,000 to a survivor who, in the Secretary's determination, probably will receive such a benefit. Declares that no such benefit shall be subject to execution or attachment. Prohibits payment of such benefit: (1) if death was caused by the intentional misconduct, suicide, or intoxication of the officer or firefighter; and (2) to any beneficiary whose actions contributed to the death of the officer or firefighter."
