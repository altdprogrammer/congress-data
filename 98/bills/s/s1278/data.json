Requires the Secretary to prepare a comprehensive program management plan for the magnetohydrodynamic research, development, and demonstration activities under this Act and to transmit such program to Congress. Directs the Secretary to enter into international cooperative agreements to conduct magnetohydrodynamic research and development. Requires the Secretary to offer to enter into an agreement with the owner of an existing, coal-fired, electric powerplant and other appropriate parties for a proof of concept demonstration of magnetohydrodynamic technology with respect to such powerplant. Provides that the parties to such agreement shall be selected on the basis of competitive bids. Requires the establishment of a Technical Review Panel for Magnetohydrodynamics which shall make recommendations to the Energy Research Advisory Board with respect to the magnetohydrodynamics research, development, and demonstration activities under this Act. Requires that the Panel's report be transmitted to the Secretary and Congress. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress annually on activities under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1986."
