    "date": "1983-01-26", 
    "text": "Budget Procedures Improvement Act of 1983 - Declares that the purpose of this Act is to establish a more thorough and timely process for the adoption of the Federal budget. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to revise the timetable with respect to the congressional budget process to provide for a two-year budget cycle, beginning with the Ninety-ninth Congress. Defines the term 'two- fiscal-year budget period' to be the period of two consecutive fiscal years beginning on October 1 of any even-numbered year. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, on or before April 15 of each odd-numbered year, to transmit to the Committees on the Budget of the House and of the Senate a fiscal policy report for each fiscal year in the succeeding two-fiscal-year budget period. Requires the Director, on March 31 of each even-numbered year, to transmit to such Committees any revisions necessary thanks to changing economic conditions or to any revisions in the President's budget. Requires Congress to complete action on the first concurrent resolution on the budget by July 31 of each odd-numbered year. Makes it out of order in either the Senate or the House to consider any first concurrent resolution on the budget which: (1) directs any committee to determine and recommend changes in bills, laws, or resolutions; or (2) includes any matter with respect to any subject other than budget outlays or authority, budget surplus or deficit, revenues, or the level of the public debt. Declares similarly out of order consideration of any revision to the first budget resolution before adoption of the second concurrent resolution on the budget for a two-fiscal-year budget period. Requires all bills and resolutions providing budget authority or spending authority for any two-fiscal-year budget period to be reported: (1) to the House no later than March 31 of the year in which such period begins; and (2) to the Senate no later than April 15 of the year in which such period begins. Prohibits bills and resolutions providing new budget or spending authority for any two-fiscal-year budget period from being enrolled until the concurrent resolution on the budget has been agreed to, and if a reconciliation bill or resolution, or both, are required to be reported for such period, until Congress has completed action on such legislation. Makes it out of order in the Senate or the House to consider any budget resolution if it directs any committee to determine and recommend changes in laws, bills, or resolutions directly or indirectly authorizing the enactment of new budget authority. Requires Congress to complete action on all bills and resolutions directly or indirectly authorizing the enactment of new budget authority for a two-fiscal-year budget period not later than December 1 of the year preceding the year in which such period begins. Requires the up to date tabulation of congressional budget actions by the Congressional Budget Office to compare the gross obligations for direct loans and loan guarantees for such fiscal years on which Congress has completed action to the gross obligations set forth in the most recently agreed to budget resolution. Limits the enrollment of bills and resolutions providing new budget or new spending authority for any two-fiscal-year budget period until the concurrent resolution for such two- fiscal-year period has been agreed to. Makes it out of order in either House to consider any bill or resolution which provides, extends, or enlarges authority to incur obligations for direct loans or loan guarantees unless that bill or resolution also provides that such authority is to be effective for any fiscal year only to the extent provided in appropriation Acts. Sets forth the information to be included in the budget of the United States Government submitted pursuant to the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921 for the two-fiscal-year budget period beginning on October 1, 1984. Amends the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921 to require the President to transmit to the Congress, by January 15 of each odd-numbered year, beginning with 1985, the budget for the two-fiscal-year budget period beginning on October 1 of the succeeding calendar year. Requires that all essential facts regarding direct loans and loan guarantees be included within such report. Requires the President to transmit revisions in the budget by January 15 of each even-numbered year. Sets forth the title and style of all appropriation Acts. Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to require each standing committee of the Senate and the House (except specified committees), during the period beginning on January 15th of each odd-numbered year and ending October 1 of the following year, to review and study: (1) the application, administration, execution, and effectiveness of those laws the subject matter of which is within the jurisdiction of such committee; and (2) the organization and operation of the Federal agencies and entities having responsibilities in or for the administration and execution thereof. Requires the findings to be reported to the House or the Senate no later than October 1 of such even-numbered year, and shall constitute the basis for such committee's legislative work during the succeeding Congress. Amends the Rules of the House and of the Senate to conform to this Act. Sets forth the effective dates for the provisions of this Act. Requires the President to submit a budget for FY 1986 to Congress, and Congress to act on it, according to current law."
