    "text": "Radiological Emergency Response Planning and Assistance Act of 1983 - Title I: Findings and Purposes - Sets forth the findings and purposes of this Act. Title II: Radiological Emergency Response Plans and Preparedness Assistance - Directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to provide grants, upon application, to State and local governments to assist them in preparing or updating radiological emergency response plans required by the Code of Federal Regulations. Authorizes appropriations to the NRC for such grants for FY 1984 and 1985. Establishes in the Treasury the Radiological Emergency Response Trust Fund which shall consist of annual fees imposed upon the operators of civilian nuclear powerplants for which radiological emergency response plans must be prepared. Makes the funds in the trust fund available to State and local governments for radiological emergency response training and testing activities and equipment required to implement radiological emergency response plans. Authorizes appropriations to the NRC for carrying out such activities. Title III: Federal Resource Assistance - Requires the President, upon a request by a State or local government and based upon a finding of availability, to make available Federal personnel and resources to be used in the implementation of State or local emergency response plans. Directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to prepare: (1) an inventory of the Federal personnel and resources that could be used to respond immediately to a radiological emergency at a civilian nuclear powerplant; and (2) an inventory of the resources needed for an effective and efficient response to a radiological emergency at each civilian nuclear powerplant required to have a radiological emergency response plan. Requires that such findings be reported to the President and the appropriate congressional committees within six months of enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations to FEMA to carry out such inventories."
