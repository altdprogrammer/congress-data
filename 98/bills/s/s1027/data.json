    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H. R. 653 passed in lieu) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to accept funds from any entity, public or private, to design, construct, operate, and maintain fish facilities within the Yakima River Basin. Authorizes appropriations beginning October 1, 1983, to the Secretary for planning, design, and construction of such facilities, provided that all costs related to anadromous fish which are in excess of present obligations shall be nonreimbursable and nonreturnable. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy, acting by and through the Bonneville Power Administration, to transfer funds to the Secretary of the Interior to design and construct such fish facilities, in accordance with the Northwest Power Act, provided that expenditures for certain screens and fish ladders are approved. Declares that fish facilities authorized by this Act shall become part of the Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement Project. Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements to provide for the operation and maintenance of such fish facilities. Authorizes costs incurred by the State of Washington, the Yakima Indian Nation, or other entity in the construction of any physical element (including any reregulation dam or fish passage facility) of the Yakima River Basin project (the project) to be credited to the total costs to be borne by the State, the Yakima Indian Nation, or other entity, respectively, as contributions to such project. Prohibits such credit unless the element was approved by the Secretary prior to its construction. Directs the Secretary to grant such approval when the Secretary determines that the element would be an integral part of the project. Directs the Secretary to maintain all such approved elements. Authorizes the Secretary to take title to any such facility constructed by the State of Washington, the Yakima Indian Nation, or any other entity, and to operate and maintain such facility in a manner consistent with the treaty rights of the Yakima Indian Nation, Federal and State laws, including the contract rights of irrigation users. Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements for the payment of operation and maintenance costs allocated to irrigation pursuant to Federal reclamation law. Makes technical and conforming amendments."
