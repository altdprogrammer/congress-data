Increases the threshold reporting level for foreign currency transactions from $5,000 to $10,000. Makes it an offense to attempt to transport currency or monetary instruments outside the United States without filing required reports. Applies the reporting requirement penalty only if the person required to file the report knowingly fails to file it. Permits a customs officer to stop and search, without a search warrant, a vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or other conveyance, envelope or other container, or person entering or departing from the United States, on which or whom the officer has reasonable cause to believe there is being transported a monetary instrument for which a report is required. Permits the Secretary of the Treasury to pay a reward to an individual who provides original information which leads to recovery of a criminal fine, civil penalty, or forfeiture exceeding $50,000 for a violation of such reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations. Adds criminal violations of Federal reporting requirements concerning monetary instrument transactions as one of the statutes under the Federal wiretap law."
