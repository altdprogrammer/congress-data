    "text": "Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to collect specified health and safety data on pesticides used on food. Directs the Administrator to revoke a tolerance or exemption based on false, misleading, or inaccurate information. Directs EPA to take action whenever it receives information indicating that specified food residues may not be safe. Grants the manufacturer an opportunity for a hearing. Directs EPA to cancel a tolerance or exemption for a pesticide whose use has been canceled, suspended, or voluntarily withdrawn under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. Revises the administrative procedures governing amendment and repeal of tolerances and exemptions for pesticide residues on food, including an expedited procedure when presented with an imminent hazard. Prohibits the importation into the United States of raw agricultural commodities containing detectable residues of prohibited pesticides. Requires random sampling of such imports to determine if pesticide residues meet the requirements of such Act. Directs the EPA to review the exemptions from pesticide residue limits within 12 months to determine whether or not they are safe."
