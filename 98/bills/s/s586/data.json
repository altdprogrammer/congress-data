    "text": "Neighborhood Development Demonstration Act of 1983 - Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to conduct a three-year demonstration program to determine the feasibility of supporting neighborhood development activities by providing Federal matching funds to certain nonprofit neighborhood development organizations on the basis of monetary support from the private sector. Limits the amount of grants that may be multiyear awards. Directs the Secretary to use a competitive process in selecting program participants. Requires that a selected participant: (1) demonstrate measurable achievements in certain neighborhood development activities; (2) specify a plan for accomplishing one or more of such activities; and (3) specify a strategy for achieving long term private sector support. Directs the Secretary to establish a Neighborhood Development Advisory Council to evaluate the applicants and recommend selections. Requires the Secretary to: (1) assign each participating organization a program year during which time voluntary private contributions shall be eligible for matching funds; and (2) establish a ratio of between two and ten Federal dollars matched for each dollar privately contributed, which the Secretary shall pay to each organization at the end of each three-month period of the organization's program year. Limits the maximum amount the Secretary may pay to any organization for a year to $50,000. Requires the Secretary to insure that: (1) assistance may be provided under this Act only if the local government of the neighborhood to be assisted certifies that such assistance is consistent with such government's objectives; and (2) eligible neighborhood development activities comply with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the activities carried out under this Act and any findings or recommendations concerning the demonstration program. Authorizes appropriations."
