    "text": "Small Business Competition in Contracting Act of 1983 - Amends the Small Business Act to prohibit Government procurement officers from using qualified bidders or similar lists to preclude small businesses from being awarded contracts without referring the matter for final disposition to the Small Business Administration (SBA). Requires the SBA to certify small businesses as eligible to perform specific Government subcontracts if the contract involved exceeds $100,000 or the approved limits of a contractor's procurement system, whichever is greater. Provides that a Government procurement officer may not refuse to include a product of a small business concern or group of small business concerns on a qualified products list without referring the matter for final disposition to the SBA. Prohibits the SBA from: (1) establishing an exemption from the requirements that Government procurement officers refer questions as to a small business' eligibility as a Government contractor to the SBA for disposition; or (2) refusing to accept such a referral. Requires prime contractors on Government procurement contracts (in excess of $500,000 or $1,000,000 for construction) to develop and submit a plan to Government agencies for placing subcontracts in designated areas of high unemployment. Declares it to be the policy of the United States that small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals shall have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in the award of Government prime contracts and subcontracts for appropriate portions of component systems, spare parts, and services for major weapon systems. Provides that during the planning for contracts for the procurement and performance of services or for the production or assembly of goods for major weapon systems, the head of each Federal agency shall maximize competition for such components or services so as to insure to the maximum extent practicable that small and small disadvantaged businesses are not precluded from performing as prime contractors and subcontractors on such contracts. Requires Federal agencies to publicly post and make available to small businesses information concerning the agencies' solicitations, unless such disclosure of information would be a breach of security or would disclose the Government's cost estimate for the procurement. Directs the Department of Defense to use funds appropriated for the development or production of any major weapon system to acquire manufacturing data relating to such system. Requires contracts entered into by any military department for the development or production of any major weapons system to contain provisions insuring the Government's acquisition of such manufacturing data, including conditions under which the contractor waives proprietary rights with respect to data necessary for the performance of such contracts. Provides waiver authority upon notification to specified congressional committees in instances where the military department determines that manufacturing technical data is not necessary. Directs each military department, within a specified time, to complete an inventory of the manufacturing technical data which the Government has in its possession or to which it has access. Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to transmit to Congress, within three years after enactment of this Act, a report evaluating each military department's efforts to compile an inventory of the manufacturing data in its possession or to which it has access. Provides that the exclusive remedy for the violation of protected information by the Government is a suit in the United States Claims Court for damages. States that Federal procurement rulemaking is to be covered under the Administrative Procedure Act."
