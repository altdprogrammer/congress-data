    "text": "Family Planning Amendments of 1984 - Amends title X (Population Research and Voluntary Family Planning Programs) of the Public Health Service Act to authorize grants and contracts for: (1) voluntary family planning projects; (2) pregnancy testing and counseling demonstration projects; and (3) infertility demonstration projects. Authorizes FY 1985 and 1986 appropriations. Gives priority to entities which did not receive a grant or contract under this title prior to October 1, 1984. States that participating entities shall seek to encourage family participation. Specifies that training grants and contracts shall include clinical training for personnel, including obstetrical and gynecological nurse practitioners, and training for educators and counselors. Authorizes FY 1985 and 1986 appropriations. Specifies that research projects may include contraceptive development, infertility, natural family planning methods, and program delivery and management. Eliminates formula grant provisions. Specifies that information and educational materials shall emphasize the parental role in transmitting values of family life and sexual responsibility to children. Prohibits support for projects for developing and making available information or materials designed for public school use. Authorizes FY 1985 and 1986 appropriations. States that: (1) unemancipated minors shall not be denied family planning services because of their economic situation; and (2) the financial resources of parents and minors shall be considered in determining assistance eligibility. States that a person's acceptance of family planning services shall be voluntary and not be an eligibility prerequisite for other services. Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from requiring a grantee to advise, refer, or provide particular methods of birth control, sterilization, or abortion which would be contrary to such grantee's religious or moral principles. Prohibits the use of funds appropriated under this title for programs that promote, encourage, refer, or provide abortion as a family planning method. Directs the Secretary to fully implement such provision. Directs the Secretary annually to: (1) submit to Congress a five-year plan for family planning services, research, and personnel training; and (2) collect data on the number of users, the types of services chosen, and the sources of financial assistance for subsidized family planning services in the United States. Authorizes States to establish their own policies respecting the provision of services to minors."
