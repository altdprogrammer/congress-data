    "text": "Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Federal Challenge Grants Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make challenge grants to any State in the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the State has collected funds for child abuse and neglect prevention activities through a trust fund or other funding mechanism. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act for FY 1985 through 1989. Sets forth State eligibility provisions. Sets forth specified activities for which such State funding must be available. Limits the amount of any such challenge grant to a State in any fiscal year to the lesser of either: (1) 25 percent of the total amount made available by such State for such activities in the previous fiscal year; or (2) an amount equal to 50 cents time the number of children residing in such State. Sets forth application requirements for such challenge grants. Requires the trust fund advisory board, or in States without a trust mechanism, the State liaison agency to the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect to be responsible for administering and awarding Federal grants to eligible recipients carrying out specified activities under this Act. Prohibits assistance under this Act from being used as a source for non-Federal funds for the matching requirements of any other provision of Federal law. Requires such State recordkeeping and reporting as the Secretary deems essential to carry out this Act. Sets forth provisions for withholding and auditing of such grants. Directs the Secretary to prepare and submit to Congress at the end of each year a compilation and analysis of any reports submitted by eligible States under this Act."
