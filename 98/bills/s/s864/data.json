    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendment with an amendment) Amends the Volunteers in the Parks Act of 1969 to increase the ceiling on the authorization of appropriations for the volunteers in parks program, for any one year, from $250,000 to $1,000,000. Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to recruit volunteers to aid in the activities administered by the Secretary through the Bureau of Land Management. Prohibits the use of such volunteers in hazardous duty or law enforcement work, or in policymaking processes, or to displace current employees. Authorizes the Secretary to pay the costs incidental to such volunteer services. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of the first sentence of this paragraph. States that Congress finds that the expansion of the contracting authority of the managers of certain conservation areas, parks, wildlife refuges, and lands should be considered only after careful study of the existing management mandates and contracting authorities. Exempts the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service from the provisions of the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 (relating to contracting authority), for activities involving ten full time equivalents or less. Prohibits for FY 1985 through FY 1988, by such agencies, activities which are subject to such circular, unless funds have been specifically provided for such activities by an Act of Congress. Permits such agencies to enter into contracts for services and materials under other provisions of laws, regulations, orders, rules, and policies. Requires the National Park Service, beginning FY 1985, to implement a maintenance management system into the maintenance and operations programs of the National Park System. Requires the National Park Service to annually transmit to specified congressional committees a report summarizing the status of implementation of a maintenance management system until such system has been implemented."
