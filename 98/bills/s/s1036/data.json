Prohibits any State or local government from imposing limitations on such collective conduct of professional sports leagues. Requires that any civil action under the antitrust laws to challenge a league decision granting permission to a member club to relocate be commenced in a U.S. district court other than the court for the district from which or to which the club is relocating Specifies the applicability of this Act to pending actions involving the relocation of a professional sports club."
