    "text": "Export Administration Improvement Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to prohibit requiring permission under the national security export controls for exports of goods or technology to countries which participate in multilateral export controls on such goods or technology. Authorizes the issuance of a comprehensive operations export license and a distribution export license. Declares that an item on the list of militarily critical technologies shall become part of the commodity control list only if: (1) the Secretary of Defense finds that an item would contribute directly and significantly to the military capabilities of countries subject to national security export controls and would permit a significant advance in the military system of such country; and (2) the Secretary of Commerce finds that countries subject to national security export controls do not have another source for nor possess the item or a like item. Prohibits imposing national security export controls on a good solely because the good contains an imbedded microprocessor or microcomputer. Authorizes imposing a national security export control on a good containing a microprocessor or microcomputer when: (1) the microcomputer's or microprocessor's capabilities exceed the COCOM general exception levels established for computer devices; or (2) the functions of the good itself would make a significant contribution to the military potential of another country or countries that would be deterimental to U.S. national security. Requires the Secretary to remove the national security export control on a good or provide notice of a determination to retain the control if, during the previous year, all export license applications for the export of such good have been approved. Declares that foreign policy export controls shall not apply to goods exported pursuant to a contract entered into before the controls were imposed. Prohibits denying, revoking, or modifying export licenses for such exports. Declares that short supply export controls shall not affect any export contract entered into before the date on which the controls are imposed, including any contract to harvest unprocessed western red cedar from State lands the performance of which contract would make the red cedar available for export. Authorizes the President to impose, expand, or extend foreign policy export controls only if the President makes specified determinations. Requires the President to transmit a report to Congress setting forth such determinations. Requires the Secretary to review the availability of goods or technology (which require a validated export license under the Act) to countries to which exports are controlled under a specified section of the Act from sources outside the United States. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring a validated license where such goods are available from sources outside the United States, unless the President determines that the absence of export controls would be detrimental to U.S. foreign policy. Directs the Secretary to accept the representations of applicants in making determinations of foreign availability, unless contradicted by specified reliable evidence. Extends the export controls on domestically produced crude oil until September 30, 1989. Makes a technical amendment to the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act."
