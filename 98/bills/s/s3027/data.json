    "text": "Head Start Reauthorization Act - Amends the Head Start Act to extend the authorization of appropriations for programs under the Act through FY 1986. Requires the Secretary of Education to reserve for training and technical assistance for each fiscal year funds which are not less than the amount spent for such activities under the Act in FY 1982. Provides that such minimum reservation shall not apply in any fiscal year in which the appropriation for the Head Start program is less than the amount appropriated for FY 1984. Revises provisions for designation of Head Start agencies. Requires that the designated agency be in the community which it serves. Requires the Secretary to give priority in the designation of such agencies to any local public or private nonprofit agency (or its successor agency) receiving funds under any Head Start program on a specified date, unless the Secretary makes a finding that the agency involved fails to meet program and fiscal requirements established by the Secretary. Requires that any such designation be governed by the same program and fiscal requirements, criteria, and standards as are applicable to existing Head Start programs. Requires that specified provisions relating to the initial designations of Head Start agencies be applied by the Secretary in the distribution of any additional appropriations made available under the Act during any fiscal year. Permits each Head Start program operated in a community to provide more than one year of Head Start services to children from age three to the age of compulsory school attendance in the State in which the Head Start program is located. Requires the Secretary to provide technical assistance and training in connection with Head Start programs. (Under current law, the Secretary is authorized to provide such technical assistance and training.) Requires that such training activities include: (1) a centralized child development training and national assessment program, which may be administered at the State and local level, leading to recognized credentials for such personnel; and (2) resource access projects for such personnel working with handicapped children. Prohibits any revision in Head Start performance standards which would result in either the elimination of or the reduction in the scope or types of health, education, parental involvement, social or other services required to be provided under the performance standards in effect on November 2, 1978."
