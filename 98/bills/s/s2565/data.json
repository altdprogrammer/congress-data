    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1984-10-04", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Human Services Reauthorization Act - Title I: Head Start - Amends the Head Start Act to extend the authorization of appropriations for programs under such Act through FY 1986. Makes a technical amendment referring to \"the Commonwealth of\" the Northern Mariana Islands. Requires the Secretary of Education (the Secretary, for purposes of this title) to reserve for training and technical assistance for each fiscal year funds which are not less than the amount spent for such activities under such Act in FY 1982. Provides that such minimum reservation shall not apply in any fiscal year in which the appropriation for the Head Start program is less than the amount appropriated for FY 1984. Prohibits such reserved funds from being combined with funds appropriated under any other Act if the purpose of combining funds is to make a single discretionay grant or payment, unless funds appropriated under the Head Start Act are separately identified in such grant or payment and are used for the purposes of such Act. Revises provisions for designation of Head Start agencies. Requires that the designated agency be in the community which it serves. Requires the Secretary to give priority in the designation of such agencies to any local public or private nonprofit agency (or its successor agency) receiving funds under any Head Start program on a specified date, unless the Secretary makes a finding that the agency involved fails to meet program and fiscal requirements established by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to designate a Head Start agency from among qualified applicants in a community if there is no Head Start agency or program serving such community. Provides that any such designation shall be governed by the program and fiscal requirements, criteria, and standards applicable on September 1, 1983, to then existing Head Start agencies. Prohibits the Secretary from making any change in the method, as in effect on April 25, 1984, of calculating income used to prescribe eligibility for the participation of persons in Head Start programs assisted under the Head Start Act if such change would result in any reduction in, or exclusion from, participation of persons in any such programs. Permits each Head Start program operated in a community to provide more than one year of Head Start services to children from age three to the age of compulsory school attendance in the State where the program is located. Requires the Secretary to provide technical assistance and training in connection with Head Start programs. (Under current law, the Secretary is authorized to provide such assistance and training.) Requires that such training activities include: (1) a centralized child development and national assessment program which may be administered at the State or local level leading to recognized credentials for such personnel; and (2) resource access projects for such personnel working with handicapped children. Revises provisions for research, demonstration, and pilot projects to include a prohibition against combining Head Start funds with funds appropriated under any other Act to make a single discretionary grant or payment, unless the Head Start funds are separately identified and are used for Head Start purposes. Prohibits any revision in Head Start performance standards which would result in either the elimination of or the reduction in the scope or types of health, education, parent involvement, social, or other services required by the performance standards issued by the Secretary as in effect on November 2, 1978. Amends community services programs provisions under chapter 8 of title VI of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to add new provisions for grants to States for planning and development of dependent care programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 and 1986 for allotments to States to carry out specified activities relating to dependent care services. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make payments to each State from its allotment. Sets forth a formula for determining such State allotments. Allows such State allotments to be used for the planning, development, establishment, expansion, or improvement by the States, directly or by grant or contract with: (1) public or private entities, for State and local resource and referral systems to provide information concerning the availability, types, costs, and locations of dependent care services; and (2) public or private nonprofit organizations, for programs to furnish school-age child-care services before and after school in public or private school facilities where available or else in community centers. Requires that specified types of information be included in such resource and referral systems. Requires that specified assurances be provided by the State with respect to such school-age child care services. Requires that the State allotment be made available as follows: (1) 40 percent for resource and referral systems; and (2) 60 percent for school-age child care services. Sets forth limitations on the use of such funds. Limits the Federal share to not more than 75 percent of any project supported under such grants program. Limits to not more than ten percent of the State allotment that portion which may be used for administrative costs. Prohibits duplication of prior services. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide technical assistance to States in planning and operating activities to be carried out under such grants program. Set forth application requirements under such grants program. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report, within three years after the enactment of this Act, to specified congressional committees on the activities conducted by the States with the amounts provided under such grants program. Title II: Community Services Block Grant - Amends the Community Services Block Grant Act (the Act, for purposes of this title) to authorize appropriations for FY 1985 and 1986 for the community services block grant program. Revises the definition of \"eligible entity\" under the Act to also include any organization to which a State which applied for and received a specified waiver from the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary, for purposes of this title) made a grant under the Act in FY 1984. Authorizes the State Governor to decide to serve any geographic area of the State not presently served by an eligible entity in specified ways. Permits a State to revise the poverty line for purposes of the community services block grant to 125 percent of the official poverty line established by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget if the State determines that such revision will serve the objectives of such block grant. Revises provisions for applications and requirements under the Act. Requires, for FY 1985 and subsequent fiscal years, that at least 90 percent of a State's community services block grant allotment be used to make grants for specified purposes to eligible entities or to organizations serving seasonal or migrant farmworkers, except that no more than seven percent of such reserved funds shall be granted to organizations which were not eligible entities during the previous fiscal year. Revises the formula for determining the maximum portion of such allotment which the State may use for administrative expenses. Includes services under the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 among those services for which a State may transfer a limited amount of its allotment. Requires States to provide assurances that any community action agency or migrant and seasonal farmworker organization which received funding in the previous fiscal year under the Act will not have its present or future funding terminated under the Act unless, after notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record, the State determines that cause existed for such termination subject to review by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct evaluations of the uses made of community services block grant funds in several States in each fiscal year; and (2) annually submit the results of such evaluations to specified congressional committees. Sets forth requirements for the Secretary's review of terminations of funding. Revises provisions for specified discretionary programs under the Act to limit funding for such programs to public agencies and private nonprofit organizations, but permits such funding to be made to a private nonprofit organization applying jointly with a business concern. Adds to those activities which may receive such discretionary funding training and technical assistance to aid States in carrying out their responsibilities under the Act. Revises withholding provisions under the Act. Requires (currently authorizes) the Comptroller General to investigate the use of funds received by a State to ensure compliance with the Act. Eliminates a prohibition against the Secretary's requesting any information not readily available to a State or requiring that any information be compiled, collected, or transmitted in any new form not readily available, for purposes of such compliance investigations. Adds new provisions for a community food and nutrition program under the Act. Authorizes the Secretary, through grants to public and private nonprofit agencies, to provide for community-based, local, and statewide programs to: (1) coordinate existing public and private food assistance resources where necessary to better serve low-income populations; (2) assist low-income communities to identify potential sponsors of child nutrition programs and initiate new programs in underserved or unserved areas; and (3) develop innovative approaches at the State and local level to meet the nutrition needs of low-income people. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 and 1986 for such community food and nutrition program. Provides that specified amendments made by this Act to the provisions for applications and requirements shall apply to the funds appropriated for the Act for FY 1985. Title III: Follow Through - Amends the Follow Through Act to extend the authorization of appropriations for Follow Through programs through FY 1986.
