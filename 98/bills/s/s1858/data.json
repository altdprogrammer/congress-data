Makes an amendment to the Charter effective after 35 days following its submission to Congress unless a joint resolution of disapproval has been enacted and presented to the President. Makes an act of the City Council effective after 30 days following transmittal to Congress unless a joint resolution of disapproval has been enacted and presented to the President. (Currently, an act of the Council becomes effective only if both Houses of Congress do not adopt a concurrent resolution of disapproval.) Authorizes the City Council to adopt resolutions to approve or disapprove, when specifically authorized by an act, proposed actions designed to implement a Council act. Repeals provisions of the District of Columbia Retirement Reform Act which permit either House of Congress by a concurrent resolution to reject any report submitted by the Retirement Board."
