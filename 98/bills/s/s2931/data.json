    "text": "Commercial Space Launch Act - Prohibits persons from: (1) launching a launch vehicle or operating a launch site within the United States (or, in the case of U.S. citizens, from outside the United States) unless they are properly licensed; and (2) in the case of a license holder, launching a payload (i.e., object to be placed in space) unless such payload compiles with all requirements of Federal law. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to ascertain whether a person has obtained a license to launch a payload. Directs the Secretary, if no license has been obtained, or if no license is required by Federal law and such launch is a safety or security jeopardy, to take appropriate action to prevent the launch of such payload. Grants exclusive authority to the Secretary to issue or transfer such licenses (except for licenses issued under the Communications Act of 1934) to persons who meet the requirements of this Act. Directs the Secretary to prescribe requirements for the issuance or transfers of a license. Allows the Secretary, in individual cases and under certain circumstances, to waive such requirements. Provides for: (1) license application and approval; and (2) license modification, suspension and revocation. Provides for administrative and judicial review of actions regarding issuing, transferring, modifying,, suspending, or revoking such licenses. Permits Federal officials to monitor the activities of licenses. Permits the use of Government property by such licensees and requires them to have liability insurance. Provides for the collection of fees by the Secretary for the use of such property. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act. Prohibits a State from adopting any law or rule inconsistent with this Act. Allows State laws and rules additional to or more stringent than those under this Act. Requires the Secretary to carry out this Act consistent with U.S. international obligations and with applicable foreign laws. Requires the Secretary, not later than one year after enactment of this Act, to submit to the Congress a report describing activities undertaken pursuant to this Act and recommendations for legislation regarding commercial launch activities. Directs the Secretary to consult with: (1) the Secretary of Defense on matters relating to the national security of the United States; and (2) the Secretary of State with respect to international matters. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985-1989."
