    "text": "Emergency Food and Shelter Act of 1983 - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Office of Community Services, to make grants to qualifying States and political subdivisions for the provision of emergency food, shelter, and medical assistance to economically disadvantaged individuals in distressed communities. Authorizes the governor of each qualifying State and the chief executive of each political subdivision to enter into agreements with nonprofit private organizations for delivery of such services. Directs the Secretary to reserve 25 percent of the funds appropriated for such assistance for grants for political subdivisions. Defines a qualifying State as any State in which the unemployment rate for any six months during the two years preceding enactment of this Act equals or exceeds 85 percent of the national rate. Directs the Secretary to allocate grant funds: (1) among qualifying States based on the number of unemployed individuals in each State relative to all qualifying States; and (2) among the political subdivisions of a qualifying State on the basis of sustained levels of high unemployment. Limits the maximum amount of funds a political subdivision may receive. Sets forth requirements for grant applications from States and political subdivisions. Directs the Secretary to withhold payments to any applicant that fails to comply with the terms of its application until the Secretary is satisfied that there is no longer any failure to comply. Requires the Secretary to submit an annual report of this grant program to the President and Congress. Requires that the Comptroller General have access to audit the records of any applicant and any contractee receiving assistance under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
