Requires identification of persons who paid for the broadcast of such advertisement. Requires the backdrop of any televised political advertisement to: (1) be filmed or televised simultaneously with the speaker; and (2) be an actual event at the time of filming or televising. Prohibits staged reproductions of any event. Authorizes citizens to: (1) file complaints with the Federal Election Commission for violations of this Act; and (2) institute civil actions in Federal district court for injunctions or restraining orders if the Commission does not act upon such citizens' complaints within a certain time."
