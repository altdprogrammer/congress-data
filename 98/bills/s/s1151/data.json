Requires such payments to include interest from the date the unauthorized disbursements were made. Prohibits such payments if the unauthorized disbursements fall below $50. Sets forth procedural guidelines for the notice and publication in the Federal Register of: (1) all trust estates from which unauthorized disbursements are known to have been made; and (2) additional unauthorized disbursement claims submitted within a certain period. Requires the Secretary to search Department of Interior records in order to ascertain: (1) persons entitled to any portion of unauthorized disbursements; and (2) the amount of such disbursements to which individuals are entitled. Directs the Secretary to make immediate payment without requiring filing of a formal claim if the Secretary has ascertained the identity of entitled individuals and the amounts to which they are entitled. Prescribes procedures to be used by the Secretary to notify entitled individuals of their right to receive payment. Provides for a full discharge of all claims after payment and acceptance has been made under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986, FY 1987, and following fiscal years. Exempts the funds distributed under this Act from being used as a basis to deny or reduce any Federal benefits for which a party would be otherwise eligible under the Social Security Act or (except for per capita shares over $2,000) any Federal or federally assisted program."
