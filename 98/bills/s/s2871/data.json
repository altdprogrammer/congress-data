    "text": "Chapter 1 Improvement Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to eliminate the requirement that the Secretary of Education allocate funds for basic grants to local educational agencies on the basis of a specified formula involving data from the 1975 survey of income and education conducted by the Bureau of the Census. Directs the Secretary to use the criteria of poverty from the most recent available decennial census in determining the number of children to be counted for purposes of such grants. Makes a technical amendment deleting the adjective \"nonfarm,\" in order to conform to current census data language. Reduces (from five years to three years for FY 1985 and to two years thereafter) the maximum period of continuation of migratory status for a child of a migratory agricultural worker or migratory fisherman who resides in the area served by the State or local educational agency carrying on this program for migratory children. Removes the minimum amount required to be reserved for coordination of activities under the migrant education programs (but retains the maximum limit on any such reservation of funds)."
