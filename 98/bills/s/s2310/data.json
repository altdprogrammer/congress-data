    "text": "Senior Citizen Tutorial Volunteer Network Act of 1984 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to local educational agencies (LEAs), or to public agencies and private nonprofit organizations applying jointly with one or more LEAs, to establish and operate senior citizen tutorial volunteer network programs for educationally disadvantaged children. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1989 to carry out this Act. Provides that 85 percent of such appropriations be used for such grants for such programs. Provides that such volunteers will tutor such children in their elementary and secondary schools and homes and will serve as liaisons between their schools and families. Provides that such funds may also be used to: (1) train volunteers, teachers, and other school personnel involved in such programs; (2) develop curricula materials; and (3) assist volunteers to pay for program-related expenses. Provides that 15 percent of such appropriations shall be used by the Secretary for: (1) a leadership training institute for project directors and other designated project personnel; and (2) ongoing technical assistance for projects. Requires that eligible applicants submit grant applications which describe the program, including plans for program continuation at the local level. Requires that such applications provide assurances that: (1) local senior citizen groups are involved in program design and operation; and (2) only elementary and secondary schools and families eligible for assistance under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 may receive assistance under this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) assure equitable distribution of assistance among the States; and (2) pay a Federal share for each fiscal year equal to 100 percent of the costs of the programs described in approved applications."
