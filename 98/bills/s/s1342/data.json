Directs the Secretary of State to conduct a study of each program of the United Nations or of its specialized agencies to determine whether U.S. contributions to the United Nations benefit the Palestinian Liberation Organization or the South West African Peoples Organization. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on such study by June 15, 1984. Prohibits making funds authorized by this Act available for any United Nations program if the President certifies to Congress that such program poses a threat to the national security or vital economic interests of the United States. Requires the President to make an annual report to Congress which assesses with respect to each foreign country associated with the United States in a defense pact or other security arrangement, the effectiveness of the contribution of that country to the pact or arrangement during the preceding 12 months."
