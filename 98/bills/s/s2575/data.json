    "text": "Amends the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to encourage, expedite, and facilitate the transportation of natural gas by an interstate pipeline on behalf of any person. Requires the rates for such transportation to be just and reasonable. Requires the Commission's implementing regulations to encourage negotiated carriage and provide incentive rates and any other necessary incentives for such transportation to assure carriage for all classes of customers. Authorizes the Commission, after opportunity for hearing, to require an interstate pipeline to transport gas on behalf of any person whenever the Commission finds that such pipeline's refusal to transport gas is discriminatory or the Commission deems that such transportation is required for the public convenience and necessity. Directs the Commission to: (1) monitor and gather data concerning the transportation of natural gas by interstate pipelines; and (2) submit a report to Congress based upon such data and information."
