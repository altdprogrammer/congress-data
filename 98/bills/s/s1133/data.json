States that eligible client nominees to the Board must have been eligible to receive legal assistance under this Act before such nomination. Sets quorum requirements for Board meetings. States that six Board members, including at least one eligible client member, shall constitute a quorum at Board meetings. Delineates conditions under which action suits may be brought against government entities. Directs the Corporation to: (1) provide funds each fiscal year to compensate private attorneys who render legal services to eligible clients; and (2) allow recipients to use Corporation funds to pay for communications intended to influence decisions by government entities or elected officials when such communications are made in response to requests by such entities or officials. Repeals authority for a comprehensive, independent study to determine: (1) alternative methods of delivering legal services; and (2) if specified groups have difficulty gaining access to legal services. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through FY 1986. Sets forth formulae to insure that funding for current grantees and contractors is maintained at previous fiscal year levels whenever the Board contains fewer than six members qualified as required by this Act."
