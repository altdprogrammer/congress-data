    "text": "Select Gas Use for Environmental Purposes Act of 1983 - Amends the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 to repeal prohibitions on the use of natural gas and/or petroleum in: (1) new major fuel-burning installations; (2) existing major fuel-burning installations; (3) certain boilers used for space heating; (4) decorative outdoor lighting; and (5) existing powerplants. Directs the Secretary of Energy to grant a permanent exemption to new electric powerplants and new major fuel-burning installations from prohibitions relating to the use of natural gas in a natural gas-coal mixture if: (1) the use of natural gas will result in reduced emissions; and (2) the proportion of natural gas in the mixture will not exceed the level necessary to comply with applicable environmental requirements. Repeals the incremental pricing provisions of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978."
