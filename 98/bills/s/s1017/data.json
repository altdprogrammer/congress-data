    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-04-12", 
    "text": "Natural Gas Competition Act of 1983 - Amends the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 to require interstate natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas upon request by either a seller or purchaser if: (1) such a request is received by an interstate pipeline and filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) at least 90 days before the date such transportation is requested to begin; and (2) the pipeline has available capacity. Creates a rebuttable presumption that an interstate pipeline has available capacity unless the FERC received notice of a protest to the proposed transportation and the FERC determined within a 90-day period that the pipeline's total capacity is to be used at all times to fulfill the current requirements of existing customers. Provides procedures for curtailments when an interstate pipeline does not have sufficient available capacity to meet its transportation and sales obligations. Provides an incentive allowance of $0.05 per million Btu's in excess of the just and reasonable rate for transportation as established by the FERC, unless and until the FERC determines by rule or order that some other amount is appropriate as an incentive in the public interest. Authorizes the FERC to order an interstate pipeline that does not have available capacity to construct or extend its facilities upon request of a local distribution company. Provides that whenever an interstate pipeline reduces its take from a natural gas producer or from another interstate pipeline to a level below 60 percent of contract volume for daily deliverability, the available production may not be sold until the expiration of a 30-day period during which local distribution companies served by the interstate pipeline shall be entitled to acquire a pro rata share of such production under regulations prescribed by the FERC. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed as imposing any obligations to transport natural gas upon any local distribution company or any intrastate natural gas pipeline."
