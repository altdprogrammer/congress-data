    "text": "Public Health Service Act Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to permit employers required under such Act to provide their employees with a health maintenance organization (HMO) option to provide either an HMO or a specified competitive medical plan (CMP) option. Provides such CMPs with the same waivers of State restrictions that apply to HMOs. Prohibits any State from preventing insurers or other third-party payors from entering into preferred provider contracts with health care providers. Stipulates that such agreements shall not allow discrimination for other than economic or quality of care considerations. Requires employers covered by such Act to provide employees with access at least once a year to a blood pressure test."
