    "text": "Amends the Public Health Service Act to revise community pay-back provisions for National Health Service Corps personnel services to provide that the pay-back amount for an eligible entity shall be the difference between expected annual fees and other revenues and expected costs. Sets forth entities required to use the old method. Permits the Secretary of Health and Human Services to allow such an entity to use the new method under this Act under specified conditions. States that in order to make such annual computation, an entity shall submit to the Secretary of a description of needed primary and supplemental health services and an expected budget. States that from such submission the Secretary shall determine needed health services and anticipated revenues and costs, which shall be used to determine community pay-back amounts. Authorizes the Secretary to waive such pay-back in whole or in part if an entity demonstrates it needs such money to: (1) expand services; (2) increase patient capacity; (3) construct or modernize facilities; (4) improve administration; or (5) establish a financial reserve. Requires any excess revenues to be used to recruit or retain health care professionals or for other specified purposes."
