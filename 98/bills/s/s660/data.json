Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to authorize the Secretary of State to allocate or transfer to any U.S. department, agency, or establishment funds appropriated to the Department of State for the purposes for which the funds were appropriated. Repeals specified reporting requirements imposed upon the Secretary of State."
