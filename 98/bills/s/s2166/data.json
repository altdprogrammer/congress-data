    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 98-1126) Indian Health Care Amendments of 1984 - Title I: Indian Health Manpower - Amends the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to authorize appropriations for specified Indian health programs for FY 1985-1988, including scholarship programs and continuing education allowances. Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) from denying scholarship assistance solely on the basis of an applicant's scholastic achievement if such applicant has been admitted to, or maintained good standing at, an accredited health professions institution. Directs the Secretary to grant Indian Health Scholarships to Indians enrolled full-time in certain schools for health professionals. States that the active duty service requirements of the Public Health Service can be met by specified services, including: (1) service under a contract pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act; and (2) the private practice of a health professional if such practice is in a health professional shortage area and addresses the health care needs of a substantial number of Indians. Title II: Health Services - Enumerates the health services for which the Secretary is authorized to expend certain appropriated funds. Prohibits the use of such funds to offset or limit appropriations made under other Acts. Conditions the allocation of such funds upon the health resource deficiency level of the affected Indian tribes. Allocates such funds on a service unit basis. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress a current health services priority system report, including the methodology for determining tribal health resources deficiencies, and the funds needed to raise all service units to a zero level deficiency. Directs the Secretary to establish a review mechanism for tribal petitions regarding the health resource deficiency level of a tribe. Requires the Secretary to provide a current update of tribal specific health plans. Makes programs administered by tribal organizations under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act eligible for specified funds on an equal basis with programs administered directly by the Indian Health Service.

Establishes a demonstration program under which an Indian's eligibility for health services (except medicaid benefits) provided in Montana by the Indian Health Service shall not be affected by such Indian's eligibility for indigent health assistance from such State, if: (1) such State assistance is funded by real property taxes; and (2) such Indian resides on tax-exempt Indian land. Terminates the demonstration program on September 30, 1988. Title III: Health Facilities - Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress a health facilities priority system report regarding the construction or renovation needs of the ten top priority inpatient and ambulatory care facilities. Requires the Secretary to consult with any Indian tribe that might be affected by an expenditure for health facilities before the Secretary makes a commitment for such an expenditure. Conditions the closure of any health care facility upon the Secretary's submission to the Congress of an impact assessment one year prior to the contemplated closing. Enumerates the data to be included in such assessment. Directs the President to include with the budgets submitted for FY 1986-1988 planning information documents for the construction of ten Indian health facilities. Directs the Secretary to implement a ten-year plan to provide safe water and sanitary sewage and solid waste disposal facilities to Indian homes and communities. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress regarding the Indian Health Service's current Indian sanitation facility priority system and the funds needed to raise all communities to a zero level of deficiency.

Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985-1988. Authorizes tribes to expend certain non-Indian Health Service funds for the renovation of Indian health facilities, subject to specified conditions. Authorizes the Secretary to exchange certain real property with the Bethel Native Corporation (Alaska). Specifies conditions under which the Secretary is required to negotiate an agreement to sell to such Corporation a specified Service hospital and appurtenant facilities. Conditions such sale upon a lease-purchase agreement whereby the Corporation shall purchase the hospital and its facilities and the Service shall lease and operate such hospital and its facilities. Title IV: Access to Health Services - Extends the authorization for specified appropriations for grants and contracts with tribal organizations from FY 1985 through 1988. Amends the Social Security Act to make certain providers of the Indian Health Service eligible for Medicare and Medicaid payments. Directs the Secretary to ensure that each service unit of the Indian Health Service receives at least half of the amounts to which its facilities are entitled, if such amounts are necessary to bring the facilities into compliance with this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish a demonstration project in which certain Indian (and Alaska Native) health organizations which provide health care services shall bill for medicare and medicaid payments directly. Requires the Secretary to monitor such organizations and to require quarterly reports on their operations. Sets forth eligibility and participation guidelines for such health service facilities. Requires a final report to Congress by September 30, 1988.

Title VI: Organizational Improvements - Requires the Secretary to establish an automated management information system for the Indian Health Service. Establishes the Office of Indian Health Service within the Public Health Service of the Department of Health and Human Services (thus terminating the Indian Health Service as part of the Health Resources and Services Administration). Places such Office under the direction of a Director of Indian Health Service who shall report only to the Secretary through the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Health. Directs the Secretary to implement through the Director all health programs and authorities which are provided specifically for Indians. Establishes the Commission on the Organization Placement of the Indian Health Service to conduct a study of the effects of placing the Indian Health Service within the Public Health Service. Delineates the membership of such Commission. Requires the Commission to report to the Congress by a certain date whether such placement of the Indian Health Service enhances its ability to provide health services to Indians.
