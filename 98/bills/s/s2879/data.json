    "text": "Indian Coal Mining Regulatory Act of 1984 - Makes Indian lands within the exterior boundaries of any Federal Indian reservation subject to this Act. Creates within the Treasury the Tribal Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund (The Tribal Fund), comprised of funds generated by surface coal mining activities within exterior boundaries of Indian reservations under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to expend specified funds in any State or to any Indian tribe for surface mining reclamation purposes. Directs the Secretary to invest on a quarterly basis all receipts accruing to the Tribal Fund in public debt securities. Requires a specified percentage of the Tribal Funds annual deposits to be allocated by the Secretary to: (1) tribes with ownership interests in the coal; and (2) Indian lands adversely affected by past mining practices. Requires specified funds to be allocated to Indian tribes from whose lands such funds were derived. Enumerates the purposes for which appropriations from the Tribal Fund may be expended by Indian tribes. Authorizes Indian tribes to submit tribal regulatory programs concerning surface coal mining operations within exterior reservation boundaries. Authorizes such tribes to adopt a partial, phased regulatory program to be implemented over a period of time. Directs the Secretary to: (1) approve or disapprove a tribal regulatory program within a certain time period; and (2) implement a Federal Indian lands program for certain aspects of Federal surface coal mining and reclamation law which have not been assumed by an Indian tribe under an approved tribal regulatory program. Authorizes any Indian tribe to contract: (1) with the Secretary for tribal participation in a Federal program; or (2) with the States for tribal participation in State regulatory programs where a mining operation extends beyond the exterior boundary of an Indian reservation. Declares the Federal Government to be the exclusive authority for the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on an Indian reservation if no tribal regulatory program exists. Makes certain Federal law regarding surface owner protection applicable to all coal owned or held in trust for Indians by the United States if the coal is to be mined by methods other than underground mining techniques. Confers original jurisdiction upon tribal courts and authorities to impose civil penalties for violations regarding surface coal mining reclamation operations on Indian lands. Makes final tribal court judgments appealable to a Federal district court. Precludes any criminal jurisdiction by tribal courts over non-Indians. Authorizes civil actions by private citizens to compel compliance with this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to Indian tribes for tribal regulatory programs. Sets conflict-of-interests guidelines regarding appointments to a tribal regulatory authority. Prohibits any consideration of a mining permit application until the appropriate tribe has evaluated an archaeological, historical and cultural resources investigation of the proposed mining area. Requires the Secretary to submit an annual report to the President and the Congress regarding implementation of this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
