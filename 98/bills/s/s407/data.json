    "text": "Export Administration Enforcement Act of 1983 - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to make the possession, or the attempted possession, of anything contrary to any provision of that Act, with an intent to export such things, a criminal violation of that Act. Makes the Commissioner of the United States Customs Service (and officers or employees of the Service specifically designated by the Commissioner) responsible for the enforcement of the Act. Authorizes such officers and certain other persons, with reasonable cause to suspect that any goods or technology have been or will be exported in violation of this Act, to: (1) stop, search, and examine a vehicle, vessel, or a person; (2) search any package or container; (3) seize and secure for trial any such goods or technology from such vehicle, vessel, person, or in such package or container; and (4) make arrests without warrants while in the performance of and in connection with official duties. Requires such officers to refer matters, involving a reasonable cause to suspect the violation of this Act, to the Secretary of the Treasury, his designee, or the Attorney General for civil or criminal action. Requires departments or agencies which obtain information which is relevant to the enforcement of this Act to furnish such information to the U.S. Custom Service and to specifically designated officers or employees of the Service. Authorizes the Commissioner and specifically designated officers and employees to impose civil penalties for violations of the Act. Requires the Commissioner and the Secretary of Commerce to consult with each other in order to effect an orderly transfer of the enforcement responsibility of the Act. Requires the Department of Commerce to monitor the performance of contracts between U.S. persons and communist countries to assure compliance with the Act."
