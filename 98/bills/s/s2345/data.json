Treats alimony as compensation for purposes of determining the income tax deduction for contributions to an individual retirement account. Allows an income tax credit in lieu of the income tax deduction presently allowed for contributions to an individual retirement account. Sets the amount of such credit at 35 percent of the amount which would be deductible under present law."
