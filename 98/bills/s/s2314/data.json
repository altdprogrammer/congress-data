    "text": "Panama Canal Amendments Act of 1984 - Amends the Panama Canal Act of 1979 to prohibit payment of damages for claims of injuries in the locks of the Canal unless the claim is filed with the Panama Canal Commission within three years after the injury or within one year after enactment of this Act, whichever is later. Prohibits the Commission from being responsible for or from considering any claim for demurrage or delays caused by investigation of a marine accident except: (1) to the extent that the investigation continues for more than 24 hours after the time the accident occurs; and (2) after such time only to the extent that the accident was caused, or contributed to, by the negligence of a Commission employee acting within the scope of the employee's official duties. Deletes the provision which requires the Commission to submit to Congress claims which exceed $120,000. Authorizes the Commission to settle such claims. Authorizes claimants for injuries that occurred outside the locks of the Canal to bring an action against the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana if the decision of the Commission does not satisfy the claimant. Requires that such action must be brought within one year of notification of the Commission's decision or within one year of enactment of this Act whichever is later. Authorizes the Commission to purchase insurance for claims arising from catastrophic marine accidents."
