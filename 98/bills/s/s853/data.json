Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. executive directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Development Association, International Monetary Fund, International Finance Corporation, Inter-American Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the African Development Bank to oppose assistance by these institutions (using any funds made available under U.S. law) to establish or enhance the capacity of any country to produce surplus competing commodities. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress on all applications for assistance which have been filed with the aforementioned institutions at 30-day intervals beginning 30 days after the enactment of this Act."
