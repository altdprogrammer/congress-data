    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Amends the Truth in Lending Act to prohibit issuers of credit cards from prohibiting a seller from charging different prices to induce a cardholder to pay by cash, check, or other means not involving the use of a credit card. Exempts differences in price offered by a seller from disclosure as a finance charge if the following requirements are met: (1) the price difference does not exceed five percent of the cash price of the property or service; (2) the same difference is available to all cash customers or is applicable to all credit card customers using the same card; and (3) the price difference is clearly and conspicuously disclosed at the seller's place of business and in any advertisement that includes a price. States that if such requirements are not met the entire price difference is a finance charge. Declares that a card issuer other than the seller is not required to treat a price difference offered by the seller as a finance charge even though such requirements are not met. Provides that price differences that meet such requirements will not be a charge for credit under State usury laws or any State laws relating to disclosure of information in connection with credit transactions. Permits any State, within three years of the effective date of this Act, to enact a prohibition of, or additional limitation upon, any transaction involving a difference in price which is otherwise subject to the provisions of this Act."
