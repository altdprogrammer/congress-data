    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-02-08", 
    "text": "Leadership in Educational Administration Development Act of 1984 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1990 to carry out this Act. Directs the Secretary of Education, from such appropriations, to make available amounts, up to a specified maximum per region, necessary to establish and operate a regional technical assistance center in each Federal region. Makes any remainder of such appropriations available for metropolitan training centers. Directs the Secretary to enter into a contract with an institution of higher education (or consortium of such institutions) in each Federal region to establish and operate a regional technical assistance center. Permits the contractor to associate with a private management agency for performance of such contract. Requires the contractor to: (1) make center services available to school administrators from any of the local educational agencies (LEAs) in the region; (2) collect information on school leadership skills; (3) assess leadership skills of individual participants; (4) conduct leadership skills training for new and practicing school administrators, especially women and minority administrators; (5) operate consulting programs for school districts; (6) maintain training curricula and materials on leadership skills drawing on expertise in business, academia, civilian and military governmental agencies, and existing effective schools; (7) conduct programs which make available business executives, scholars, and practicing school administrators and which offer internships in business, industry, and in effective school districts to school administrators; (8) disseminate information on leadership skills associated with effective schools; and (9) establish model administrator projects. Directs the Secretary in selecting such contractors to take into account whether their programs would: (1) emphasize development of leadership skills identified by graduate schools of management and of education; and (2) assure provision of assistance to school administrators from LEAs in which the number of pupils in the average daily attendance is less than 2,500. Directs the Secretary to enter into contracts with LEAs, intermediate school districts, State educational agencies (SEAs), institutions of higher education, private management organizations, or nonprofit institutions (or consortium of such entities) to establish and operate metropolitan training centers in eligible LEAs. Defines an eligible LEA as any LEA which is located, in part or in whole, within a standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA) with a population of 250,000 or more. Requires such contractors to: (1) make center services available on an equitable basis, taking account of the contributions of various LEAs to center costs, to school administrators from each of the LEAs located, in part or in whole, within the SMSA; (2) perform specified functions which are also required of regional center contractors; and (3) coordinate metropolitan center operations with those of the regional center. Directs the Secretary, in selecting such contractors, to: (1) accept only those applications which demonstrate the existence of a prior agreement, among LEAs with more than one-half of the pupils in average daily attendance within the SMSA, to utilize the center; and (2) take into account whether their programs would emphasize provision of assistance to school administrators from LEAs in which the number of pupils in average daily attendance is more than 2,500 and would give preference to consortia of LEAs. Requires contracts under this Act to: (1) assure involvement of private sector managers and executives; (2) assure ongoing organizational commitment through obtaining matching funds, making in-kind contributions, demonstrating commitment to continue after expiration of funding under this Act, and organizing a policy advisory committee including representatives from business, private foundations, LEAs, and SEAs; (3) demonstrate the level of development of human relations skills which its programs will instill; and (4) establish a system of program evaluation. Provides that each contract under this Act shall be for a three-year term, subject to availability of funds. Makes such contracts non-renewable, but allows a single three-year extension to be granted if the contractor agrees to maintain the programs with assistance under this Act reduced by one-half. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations to carry out this Act."
