Provides that no annual charge shall be assessed in those cases where the United States has already entered into a contract with a licensee that provides that: (1) such licensee may build and own power plants using irrigation facilities constructed by the United States; (2) such powerplant shall remain in the exclusive control or ownership of the licensee; and (3) all revenues derived from such power plants shall remain the property of the licensee. Requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to review and report to Congress every five years on the appropriateness of the annual charge limitations under this Act."
