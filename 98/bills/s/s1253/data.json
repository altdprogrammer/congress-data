    "text": "High Technology Trade Act of 1983 - Authorizes the President to negotiate with foreign governments and instrumentalities to obtain and preserve maximum openness in international trade and investment in high technology and to strengthen the international trading system. Authorizes the President to enter into bilateral and multilateral agreements to achieve the objectives of this Act. Authorizes the President, in order to carry out an agreement under this Act, to proclaim tariff changes and to use procedures contained in the Trade Act of 1974 if changes in U.S. law are required. Requires the President to determine whether or not a key country is providing national treatment for U.S. exports of high technology products and investments in high technology industries. Defines \"key country\" to mean Japan, the European Economic Community, Canada, and any other foreign country so designated by the President. Defines \"national treatment\" to include treatment not less favorable than that accorded to any national in specified economic respects. Requires the President to enter into consultations with key countries not providing national treatment. Requires the President to consider taking necessary actions under trade agreements if such consultations do not establish national treatment. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to report annually to Congress on: (1) the extent to which any key country uses industrial policies or measures that distort international trade and have significant adverse effects on the U.S. high technology industry; and (2) the measures the United States is taking to remedy such adverse effects. Sets forth material to be analyzed in such report. Directs the President to take whatever steps are necessary to eliminate foreign industrial policies which: (1) significantly distort international trade or investment to the detriment of any U.S. high technology industry; and (2) may result in sales of articles at less than fair value in the U.S. market or subsidization of imports and cause material injury to any U.S. high technology industry. Directs the Secretary to analyze high technology trade and investment patterns, to evaluate the equivalency of competitive opportunities, and to further the objectives of this Act. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the President on such analysis. Directs the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and the Secretary to report annually to the President concerning: (1) measures in violation of U.S. international agreements; or (2) unreasonable or discriminatory burdens or restrictions on U.S. high technology products, services, or investments. Directs the President to consider what action may be taken to reduce or eliminate such measures. Directs the Secretary and the USTR to establish a High Technology Industry Advisory Committee. Requires the USTR and the Secretary to consult with the Committee on negotiating positions, concluding agreements, imposing restrictions under this Act, and monitoring the results of any such agreement or restriction."
