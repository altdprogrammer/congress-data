    "text": "Dam Safety Act of 1983 - Amends Federal law to revise the national dam inspection program. Exempts dams located in States with an approved dam safety program from the Secretary of the Army's national inspection program. Authorizes the Secretary to enter and inspect a damsite at reasonable times. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such Act through FY 1987. Sets forth the formula for distributing such funds among the States. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide assistance to States maintaining approved dam safety programs; and (2) review periodically the implementation and effectiveness of such programs. Specifies the standards such programs must meet. Directs the Secretary to provide guarantees to insurers in order to enable dam owners, in States with approved dam safety programs, to obtain liability insurance at reasonable rates. Authorizes appropriations to provide such guarantees. Requires the Secretary, with the Secretary of the Treasury, to report to Congress with an analysis of the effects of such guarantees, together with any recommendations for a more comprehensive dam safety insurance program. Authorizes appropriations for a revolving fund to be used for loans to dam owners making repairs or other safety improvements on such dams. Establishes a Federal Dam Safety Review Board to be responsible for reviewing dam safety procedures and monitoring State implementation of this Act. Requires the head of any U.S. agency that owns or operates a dam, when requested, to consult with the State in which the dam is located on the design and safety of such dam and to allow such State officials to participate with agency officials in dam safety inspections. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide training for the State dam safety inspectors; and (2) develop, with the National Bureau of Standards, improved dam inspection techniques. Requires that dam construction proposals submitted to specified congressional committees contain information concerning dam failures and preventive measures that may be taken."
