    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Radio Broadcasting to Cuba Act - Directs the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) to provide for radio broadcasting to Cuba. Requires such broadcasting to be part of the voice of America radio broadcasting to Cuba. Sets forth the radio frequencies and facilities that shall be used for such broadcasting. Provides that the Director of the USIA may lease time on other stations if broadcasts to Cuba are subject to a specified amount of jamming or interference. Requires that any U.S. Government radio broadcasts to Cuba shall be designated \"Voice of America: Cuba Service\" or \"Voice of America: Radio Marti Program.\" Provides for using other facilities if the regular facilities are destroyed. Requires the Director of the USIA to establish within the Voice of America a Cuba Service which shall be responsible for radio broadcasts to Cuba. Establishes within the Office of the President the Advisory Board for Radio Broadcasting to Cuba which shall review the activities carried out under this Act and shall make recommendations as it deems necessary. Authorizes appropriations for the Board. Authorizes other Federal agencies to assist the USIA in carrying out the purposes of this Act. Expresses the intent of Congress that the Secretary of State should seek settlement of U.S. claims against the Government of Cuba arising from Cuban interference with broadcasting in the United States. Authorizes the USIA to make payments to U.S. radio broadcasting station licensees for expenses which such such licensees have incurred or will incur in mitigating the effects of Cuban interference with the transmission or reception of broadcasts by these licensees. Directs the FCC to regulate and establish procedures for providing compensation to U.S. broadcasters. Authorizes appropriations for such compensation. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should establish a task force to analyze the level of interference from the operation of Cuban radio stations experienced by broadcasters in the United States and to seek a solution to this problem. Authorizes appropriations to the USIA for FY 1984 and 1985 to provide radio broadcasts to Cuba and to establish a Cuba service within the Voice of America. Authorizes appropriations to the USIA for FY 1984 and 1985 for expenses incurred in modernizing facilities and operations of the Voice of America. Requires the USIA to arrange an independent evaluation of Cuba Service programming and to transmit the results of such evaluation to Congress."
