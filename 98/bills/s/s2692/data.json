    "text": "Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to grant rights-of-way which traverse public lands within the national forest system for certain water usages. Identifies right-of-way grants to be subject to Federal fees. Exempts from fees all grants issued before October 21, 1976. Prescribes recordation requirements for right-of-way grants. Requires re-recording every 30 years, upon notice by the Federal Government. Authorizes the Federal Government to charge a maximum annual fee of $100 for rights-of-way granted after October 1976. Requires holders of right-of-way grants to indemnify the United States for damages caused by the holders' negligent use or occupancy of the granted right-of-way. Empowers the Secretary of the Interior to incur repair and maintenance costs caused by a holder's refusal to perform necessary repairs, and to assess such holder for such costs."
