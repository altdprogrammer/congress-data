    "date": "1983-08-03", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, in lieu of H. R. 2957) International Recovery and Financial Stability Act - Title I: Export-Import Bank Act Amendments of 1983 - Export-Import Bank Act Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to extend the authority of the Export-Import Bank of the United States until September 30, 1985. Declares that it is the policy of the United States to insist that participants in the Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits honor their pledge not to offer \"tied aid credit\" containing a grant element less than the minimum specified in the guidelines. Defines \"tied aid credit\" to mean credit which is: (1) provided for development aid purposes; (2) financed by public funds or, as a mixed credit, partly from public and partly from private funds; and (3) tied to the purchase of exports from the country granting the credit. Declares that the United States shall try to negotiate an increase in the minimum grant element of tied aid credits. Requires the Board to report to Congress if, at the end of any quarter of any fiscal year after FY 1983, the value of the total capital stock and retained earnings of the Bank falls below 50 percent of the capital stock and retained earnings of the Bank at the end of FY 1983. Emphasizes that the Bank's primary policy is to support U.S. exports in all the Bank's programs. Requires the Bank to reserve not less than: (1) six percent of the Bank's new FY 1984 loans and loan guarantees for financing exports by small businesses; and (2) ten percent of the Bank's new FY 1985 loans and loan guarantees for financing exports by small businesses. Requires the Bank to submit its annual report to Congress on January 1 of each year. Requires the report to contain a comprehensive and detailed description of plans for implementing the provisions relating to loans and loan guarantees to small businesses. Requires that the Bank's annual report to the appropriate congressional committees shall be submitted within three months of the end of the reporting period. Requires the President to appoint at least one member of the Bank's Board to represent the interests of small business. Requires the Bank to work to ensure that U.S. companies are afforded an equal opportunity to bid for insurance in connection with transactions assisted by the Bank. Directs the Chairman of the Bank to review the Bank's policy with respect to insurance and to undertake actions to promote equal and nondiscriminatory opportunities to bid for insurance in connection with international trade. Requires the Bank to report by May 15, 1984, to the appropriate congressional committees concerning insurance problems. Increases the number of members of the Bank's Advisory Committee from nine to 12. Requires at least three of those members to be representatives of the small business community. Requires the Committee to meet once each quarter and to submit with the Bank's annual report its comments and suggestions to the Congress. Lists information which must be included in the Bank's annual report to the Congress. Authorizes appropriations to prepare the U.S. International Trade Commission report on the adverse effect of the Bank's loans and guarantees on domestic industries. Imposes a 60 day deadline for completion of inquiries into purported foreign noncompetitive financing. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the Bank to issue financing to U.S. sellers who are competing with foreign exporters who have received noncompetitive financing only if: (1) the availability of foreign official noncompetitive financing is likely to be a \"significant\" (currently \"determining\") factor in the sale; and (2) such foreign noncompetitive financing has not been withdrawn. Requires the Bank, in order to be competitive with the financing programs of other countries, to: (1) provide medium-term financing at interest rates equal to the rates established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and in amounts up to 85 percent of the costs of the exports involved; and (2) cooperate with the Secretary of Commerce and the Small Business Administration to inform small businesses about such medium-term financing. Title II: International Economic Recovery - Directs the President to encourage industrialized nations to: (1) take multilateral actions to adopt fiscal policies which will result in sustainable, noninflationary economic growth and increased worldwide employment; (2) develop plans for reducing the financial pressures on certain debt-ridden nations by extending the maturity of such debt; and (3) begin to promote the effectiveness and consistency of the regulation and supervision of international banking. Requires the President to report to Congress on such activities and to include in such report recommendations for legislation. Title III: International Monetary Fund - Amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to express the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund to work for the adoption of specified policies. Requires the U.S. Executive Director of the Fund, in negotiating with third World countries, to work for policies which assist low- and moderate-income families to increase their level and standard of living and which foster democratic institutions. Directs the Secretary to instruct the Director to propose and work for the adoption of policies that would strengthen efforts to promote conditions contributing to greater stability of exchange rates. Requires the Secretary to report semiannually to Congress on these instructions to the Director. Increases the amount which the Secretary is authorized to lend to the Fund from $2,000,000,000 to $4,250,000,000 Special Drawing Rights. Requires that the Secretary, before making a loan to the Fund, shall certify that supplementary resources are needed to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system and the Fund has fully explored other means of funding. Authorizes appropriations. Prohibits any representative of the United States from instructing the U.S. Executive Director of the Fund to consent to any amendment to the February 24, 1983, decision of the Fund's Executive Directors if the amendment would significantly alter the terms of U.S. participation in the General Arrangements to Borrow. Authorizes the U.S. Governor of the Fund to consent to an increase in the U.S. quota in the Fund. Directs the Secretary to consult with specified Members of Congress to discuss international negotiations concerning any future quota increase for the International Monetary Fund which may involve an increased U.S. contribution, subscription, or loan. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the lack of sufficient information currently available to international lenders threatens the stability of the international monetary system; and (2) the Fund should adopt measures to ensure the availability of more complete and timely financial information. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the Fund to: (1) initiate relevant discussions with other directors of the Fund and with the Fund management; and (2) propose and vote for certain information collection and publication procedures. Authorizes the President to require persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction to provide information to the Fund. Requires the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees on progress made toward establishing information collection procedures within the Fund. Amends the Special Drawing Rights Act to prohibit any representative of the United States from approving a new allocation of Special Drawing Rights unless Congress authorizes such action. Amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to require the U.S. Executive Director of the Fund to oppose any credit drawings on the Fund or any of its facilities by countries which practice apartheid or Communist dictatorship. Requires the U.S. Executive Director of the Fund to present proposals to the Fund's Executive Board that ensure that each member country using Fund resources takes steps to eliminate import restrictions and unfair export subsidies which are inconsistent with international agreements and which have serious adverse impact on any member's exports or employment. Requires the Secretary, if the Fund does not adopt such proposals, to consult with the appropriate congressional committees before instructing the U.S. Executive Director to provide Fund resources for a country which has such import restrictions or unfair export subsidies. Requires the Secretary to be informed of all such restriction and subsidies implemented by member countries. Directs the President to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the role of the Fund and the U.S. Government with regard to maintaining realistic market-related exchange rates with other currencies and making recommendations on how to avoid exchange rate manipulation. Directs the President to instruct the Secretary to propose and work for the adoption of proposals by the Fund to promote conditions contributing to the stability of exchange rates and to avoid the manipulation of exchange rates between major currencies. Directs the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the Fund to work for the adoption of a policy requiring that Fund borrowers, before receiving any Fund assistance, must eliminate all predatory agricultural export subsidies which might result in the reduction of other member countries' exports. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress within 180 days of enactment on the progress achieved in enacting this policy. Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, a report on the policies of the Fund. Sets forth the information to be contained in the report. Directs the President to instruct the appropriate Federal officials to encourage countries to formulate economic adjustment programs to deal with their balance of payment difficulties and external debts. Directs the U.S. Executive Director of the Fund to recommend and work for changes in Fund guidelines which would: (1) convert short-term bank debt into long-term, lower-interest debt; (2) assure that the annual external debt service is a manageable percentage of the projected annual export earnings of such country; and (3) require the Fund, in approving any economic adjustment program, to take into account the number of countries applying for such programs and the aggregate effects of such programs. Requires the U.S. Executive Director of the Fund to oppose Fund assistance for an economic adjustment program for a country in which the annual external debt service exceeds 85 percent of the annual export earnings of such country unless the Director first determines and notifies Congress that the program meets specified conditions. Prohibits the Director from opposing such a program if the Director notifies Congress that: (1) an emergency exists that requires an immediate short-term loan to avoid disrupting orderly financial markets; (2) a sudden decrease in export earnings in the country applying for assistance has increased the ratio of the annual debt service to annual export earnings to greater than 85 percent; or (3) other extraordinary circumstances exist. Requires the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies to include in its annual report to Congress copies of the Director's notifications to Congress and other materials. Requires the appropriate Federal banking agencies to develop regulations to prohibit banking institutions which have excessive foreign loans from making any new loans to foreign countries if the growth rate of such institution's aggregate loans to all such foreign countries shall exceed a specified rate. Defines a banking institution's foreign loans as excessive if at any time between June 30, 1983, and January 1, 1986, the institution's foreign loans exceed its primary capital. Permits a banking institution with excessive foreign loans to exceed the limit on foreign loans if the annual growth rate of the institutions domestic lending exceeds a specified limit. Prohibits enforcement of these limits if the Secretary and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board find that such enforcement would adversely affect the domestic economy or if the President determines that enforcement would be detrimental to the national interest. Prohibits any banking institution from charging, in connection with the restructuring of an international loan, any fee exceeding the administrative cost of the restructuring unless it amortizes such fee over the effective life of each such loan. Directs the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the Fund, except in specified circumstances, to: (1) oppose any Fund drawing by a member country where the Fund resources would be used mainly to repay loans which have been imprudently made by banking institutions to member countries; and (2) work to insure that the Fund encourages debt rescheduling negotiations where consistent with sound banking practices and the country's ability to pay. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the U.S. Trade Representative, to begin discussions with other countries regarding the economic dislocations resulting from structural exchange rate imbalances. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress within 180 days of enactment on proposals to reform the floating exchange rate system. Requires the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems to report at intervals of 180 days for the next three years to the President and the Congress on all applications filed with the Fund for project assistance which would establish or enhance a foreign country's capacity to produce a commodity for export if: (1) the commodity is in surplus or is likely to be in surplus on world markets by the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative; and (2) such project assistance will cause substantial injury to U.S. producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. Requires the general policy objectives of the Fund and the Export-Import Bank to take into account the effect that country adjustment programs have on individual industry sectors and international commodity markets: (1) to minimize projected adverse impacts; and (2) to avoid government subsidization of production and exports of international commodities without regard to economic conditions in the markets for such commodities. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress within 180 days of enactment on the actions taken to consider basic human needs in economic adjustment programs supported by the Fund. Requires the U.S. Executive Director of the Fund, in carrying out his or her duties, to consider, if appropriate, whether a recipient country: (1) has detonated a nuclear device; (2) is not a party to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; and (3) is not a party to the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere in Outer Space, and Under Water. Directs the Secretary to instruct the Director to propose that the Fund adopt specified policies relating to international lending. Directs the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies to study and report to Congress and the President on the impact on the U.S. steel industry of steel subsidies by nations who are borrowers from the Fund.
