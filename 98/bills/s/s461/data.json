    "text": "(House agreed to Senate amendment with amendments) Amends the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to establish a five year term of office for the Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). Authorizes the Director, in consultation with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), to issue regulations pertaining to conflicts of interest and ethics in the executive branch. (Currently, the Director may only recommend rules for promulgation by OPM or the President.) Directs the President to: (1) include in each annual Government budget transmitted to Congress the estimated expenditures and proposed appropriations necessary to support OGE for the next five fiscal years; and (2) include in each statement of changes in budget authority, expenditures, or receipts the effect of such changes on OGE funding. Authorizes the Director to request assistance from agency inspectors general in conducting investigations. Includes certain high level White House aides among those officials whose financial disclosure reports must be transmitted to the Director. Limits the outside earned income of such individuals for a calendar year to 15 percent of their salary for such year. Requires a presidential nominee to update his or her financial report by the date of the first Senate confirmation hearing with respect to income and honoraria received as of five days before such hearing. Permits an individual whose nomination the President or President-elect has publicly announced to file such financial report at any time after such announcement but not later than five days before such hearing. Requires an individual to notify the designated agency official, OGE, or a Senate confirmation committee upon completing actions the individual agrees to take to comply with this Act or other laws or regulations governing conflicts of interest or establishing standards of conduct for Federal employees and officials. Requires the individual to make such notification by the date specified for completion of action in the agreement or, if no date is specified, within three months after the agreement is made. Directs an individual who agrees to recuse himself or herself from particular categories of official action to: (1) reduce to writing those subjects to which the agreement applies and the process for determining whether such individual must recuse himself or herself in a specific instance; and (2) file a document setting forth such information with the designated agency official, OGE, or the appropriate Senate committee by the time prescribed by such agreement or within three months after such agreement is made if no time is prescribed. Revises the conditions a trust must satisfy to be considered a qualified blind trust which is exempt from certain reporting requirements of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. Includes among the new conditions a requirement that the supervising ethics office determine that approval of the trust as a qualified blind trust is necessary and appropriate to assure compliance with applicable ethics laws and regulations. Repeals the requirement that a reporting individual file a copy of the trust instrument and a list of the trust's assets and their value with the supervising ethics office within 30 days of its approval as a qualified blind trust. Requires certain individuals who perform staff functions for Federal advisory committees composed of one or more special Government employees to file financial disclosure reports. Extends the authorization of appropriations for OGE for five years."
