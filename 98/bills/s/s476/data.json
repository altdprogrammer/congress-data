    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 3755 passed in lieu) Social Security Disability Amendments of 1984 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to set forth the review procedures for the termination of disability benefits under title II on the basis of a finding that the physical or mental impairment on which such benefits were based has ceased, did not exist, or is no longer disabling. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) notify the individual receiving such benefits that a review will take place; (2) provide for the individual to be interviewed and informed as to the details of the review process; and (3) review the medical evidence with respect to the individual's condition to determine if there has been any medical improvement in the condition since the most recent disability determination for the individual. Requires that the individual's disability benefits be continued if the medical evidence establishes that the individual's condition has not improved. Provides that the individual's disability benefits shall be terminated if: (1) the medical evidence does not establish that the individual's condition is of the same or greater severity as it was at the time of the individual's most recent disability determination and the Secretary determines that the individual is able to engage in substantial gainful activity; (2) the individual has benefitted from medical or vocational therapy or technology, diagnostic techniques indicate that the individual's condition is not as disabling as was believed at the time of the prior disability determination, or the prior determination was fraudulently obtained or erroneous and the Secretary determines that the individual is able to engage in substantial gainful activity; (3) the individual is engaging in substantial gainful activity at any point during the review; or (4) the individual cannot be located or fails without good cause to cooperate in the review or to follow prescribed treatment which could restore his or her ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act to provide that a termination of disability benefits under title XVI on the basis that the physical or mental impairment on which such benefits are based has ceased, does not exist, or is no longer disabling may be made only in accordance with the review procedures set forth in this Act for the termination of disability benefits under title II of the Social Security Act. Provides that the review procedures set forth in this Act shall not apply to disability determinations made under titles II or XVI after December 31, 1987. Specifies those disability determinations to which such review procedure shall apply. Sets forth procedures for the remand to the Secretary of certain disability cases for which judicial review has been requested.
