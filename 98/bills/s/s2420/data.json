    "text": "Criminal Justice Act Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Federal criminal code to revise provisions concerning the appointment of counsel in Federal criminal proceedings. Makes the representation of material witnesses in custody a right of such witnesses instead of a matter discretionary with the court. Authorizes the representation of financially eligible persons charged with a petty offense for which a sentence of confinement is authorized. Authorizes appointment of an additional attorney in complex or difficult cases where the court finds it to be in the interest of justice. States that counsel should be provided as soon as feasible after custody begins and that the authorities should notify the official responsible whenever a person in custody requests counsel or is without counsel. Authorizes the Judicial Conference of the United States to set and modify the maximum hourly rates within a certain range which appointed counsel shall receive. Increases the maximum amounts appointed counsel may receive: (1) in a felony case, from $1,000 to $5,000; (2) for a misdemeanor, from $400 to $1,500; and (3) for an appeal, from $1,000 to $3,000. Provides that for any other kind of representation authorized the compensation shall not exceed $1,000. Provides for an additional authorization of $300 for investigative, expert, or other service with prior request of counsel and for an additional amount in certain circumstances. Increases the maximum amount of compensation paid to a person for services other than for legal counsel to $1,000. Requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to provide liability insurance for employees of a Federal Public Defender Organization or Community Defender Organization receiving grants. Authorizes appropriations to the U.S. courts for representation plans, including funds for the continuing education of persons providing representational services."
