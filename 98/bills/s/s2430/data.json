    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-03-15", 
    "text": "Family Violence Prevention and Services Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to States to assist in supporting the establishment, maintenance, and expansion of programs and projects to: (1) prevent incidents of family violence; and (2) provide shelter and related assistance for victims and dependents of victims of family violence. Sets forth requirements for grant applications. Limits to five percent of such grant funds the amount which may be used for State administrative costs. Requires that at least 70 percent of such funds be distributed to nonprofit private organizations (including religious and charitable organizations and voluntary associations). Requires that the remainder be distributed to local public agencies. Requires the State, in distributing such funds, to give special emphasis to the support of community-based projects of demonstrated effectiveness, particularly those with the primary purpose of operating shelters for victims and dependents and those which provide counseling, alcohol and drug abuse treatment, and self-help services to abusers and victims. Prohibits projects receiving grant funds from: (1) requiring a minimum length of stay for shelter residents; or (2) censoring mail or telephone calls of shelter residents, or interfering in any way with reconciliation efforts, unless requested to do so by the resident. Requires States receiving grants to certify, within one year after receipt of such funds, to the Secretary that the State has a procedure for the eviction of an abusing spouse from a shared residence. Permits grant funds to be used to provide shelter and related assistance to victims of violence by individuals with whom they reside, provided that victims of family violence are first served. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to Indian tribes and intertribal organizations for such projects for the prevention of family violence and for shelters and related assistance for victims and dependents. Sets forth limits on the amount of such grants to single entities other than States. Prohibits direct payments to victims or dependents. Prohibits imposition of income eligibility standards. Requires local grant recipients to provide local shares of grant funds. Requires that at least 75 percent of grant funds be distributed to entities to provide immediate shelter and related assistance to victims and dependents. Sets forth formulas for allotment of such grant funds to States and to specified U.S. territories and possessions. Sets forth provisions for administration of programs under this title. Directs the Secretary to: (1) maintain records on programs under this title and coordinate all Federal programs relating to family violence; (2) support research on the provision of shelter and related assistance to victims and dependents; and (3) establish a national information and resource clearinghouse on family violence to be coordinated with the information clearinghouse maintained by the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to, or contracts with, public or nonprofit private entities to provide technical assistance, training, and outreach services. Directs the Secretary to review, evaluate, and report to the Congress on the effectiveness of the program (particularly in relation to repeated incidents of family violence) under this title, within two years after funds are first obligated for program grants. Sets forth prohibitions against discrimination in programs funded under this title. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1986 to carry out this title. Requires that: (1) 90 percent of such appropriations be used for grants to States, with between one-half and one percent of those appropriations to be available for grants to Indian tribes and intertribal organizations; and (2) ten percent of such appropriations be used by the Secretary to carry out this title. Directs the Secretary to establish an office to be known as the National Center on Elder Abuse. Directs the Secretary, through the Center, to do the following with respect to elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation: (1) compile, publish, and disseminate a summary annually of recently conducted research; (2) develop and maintain an information clearinghouse on all programs showing promise of success in prevention, identification, and treatment; (3) compile, publish, and disseminate personnel training materials; (4) provide technical assistance to public and nonprofit private agencies and organizations in planning, improving, developing, and carrying out related programs and activities; (5) conduct research into causes, prevention, treatment, and identification; and (6) make a complete study and investigation (in consultation with the National Institute on Aging) of the national incidence, including a determination of the extent to which incidents are increasing in number or severity. Directs the Secretary, within 18 months after enactment of this Act, to report to the President and Congress on the results of such research, with appropriate recommendations. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the activities of the Center. Directs the Attorney General to make grants for regionally-based training and technical assistance for local and State law enforcement agency personnel to respond to incidents of family violence. Provides for awarding of such grants on a competitive basis. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) select recipients who have demonstrated their effectiveness in preparing such personnel to handle such incidents; and (2) give priority to application proposals to develop, demonstrate, or disseminate information about improved techniques for law enforcement officers' response to such incidents. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for each of the fiscal years for which this title is in effect. Directs the Secretary to study: (1) the necessity and impact of mandatory reporting requirements relating to incidents of family violence, particularly elder abuse; and (2) the effect of immunity on the mandatory reporting process. Directs the Secretary, within 18 months after enactment of this Act, to report to Congress on the results of such study, with appropriate recommendations. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such study."
