    "text": "Columbia River Gorge Act of 1983 - Establishes the Columbia River Gorge Scenic Area as a unit of the national forest system. Extends the boundaries of the Mount Hood National Forest in Oregon and of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington State to include all the lands in their respective States lying within the Area which are not within their boundaries on the enactment of this Act. Provides that national forest system lands in Oregon which are within the Area shall be treated as components of the Mount Hood National Forest and national forest system lands in Washington which are within the Area shall be treated as components of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest for purposes of providing forest system revenues to a State or local government. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to administer the Area and to provide all interested parties with an opportunity to participate in plans and programs for the management of the Area. Establishes in the Department of Agriculture the Columbia River Gorge Scenic Area Regional Commission, which shall be composed of members from both Oregon and Washington as well as the Chief of the Forest Service. Makes the Commission responsible for: (1) assisting the Chief of the Forest Service in the establishment of a management plan for the Area; (2) facilitating communication and coordination among the Federal, State, and local governmental agencies with jurisdiction within the Area and with residents and landowners within the Area; (3) reviewing and monitoring the implementation of the management plan by such governmental agencies; (4) reviewing all land acquisition proposals submitted by the Secretary in cases involving the potential use of eminent domain; (5) reviewing all Federal development projects within the Area for consistency with the management plan; and (6) preparing an annual report for the Secretary, Congress, and the Governors of Oregon and Washington on the status and implementation of the management plan. Requires the Chief of the Forest Service to prepare a management plan for the Area. Requires the Chief of the Forest Service to consult with the Commission and with State and local government authorities within the Area during preparation of the management plan. Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial and technical assistance to such authorities to carry out land use management activities. Directs the Secretary to incorporate State and local policies, management plans, standards, and requirements into the management plan and resolve any conflicts with the State and local authorities concerned. Requires that the management plan be submitted to the Commission for approval. Authorizes the Secretary to modify and resubmit any plan disapproved by the Commission. Authorizes the Secretary to adopt a resubmitted management plan without the Commission's approval. Permits requests for amendments to or variances from the management plan to be submitted to the Secretary. Prohibits the construction or modification of any facility in the critical portions of the Area before the Secretary's adoption of interim guidelines which shall govern all land use activities within the Area until the management plan is adopted. Requires that Federal activities within the Area be consistent with the interim guidelines and the management plan. Sets forth the procedure for the Secretary's approval of any such activities. Requires the Secretary to permit hunting and fishing on lands and waters under his or her jurisdiction within the Area. Directs the Secretary to monitor all land use activities within the Area prior to the adoption of the management plan to prevent violations of the interim land use guidelines. Requires local governments which have land use planning authority under State law and wish to enforce the management plan within the Area to submit to the Secretary and the Commission a land use plan consistent with the management plan. Requires the Secretary to approve or disapprove such a local plan within six months after its submission. Authorizes the Secretary to make annual grants to local governments to assist them in establishing such land use plans. Directs the Secretary to enforce the management plan if no approved local land use plan is in effect. Imposes criminal penalties for violations of regulations or orders issued pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the Attorney General, at the Secretary's request, to institute a civil action for an injunction or other order to prevent the use of lands in the Area in violation of the management plan. Provides for administrative and judicial review of such violations. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire lands classified as critical lands under the management plan without the owner's consent, unless, as of July 1, 1981, such lands were used primarily for single family residential purposes, farming, or grazing. Requires the Secretary to consider sale offers made by Area landowners. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire non-Federal lands within the Area by exchange. Provides that State lands may be acquired only by donation or exchange. Permits the transfer of Federal property within the Area to the Secretary without consideration. Requires that property thus acquired be: (1) transferred to the jurisdiction of the National Forest Service for inclusion in the national forest system; or (2) sold on terms to assure the use of such property in a manner consistent with the management plan. Authorizes appropriations. Makes appropriations from the Land and Water Conservation Fund available for land acquisition within the Area. Establishes an acquisition fund for land acquisition within the Area. Authorizes appropriations for the initial capital of the fund. Authorizes the Secretary to accept contributions which shall be credited to the fund. Authorizes the Secretary to make payments to local governments to mitigate property tax revenue losses resulting from Federal acquisition of real property within the Area. Limits the authority under this Act to enter into contracts or to make payments to the extent and the amounts provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Makes provisions of this Act which authorize new budget authority effective only for FY 1983 and thereafter."
