Requires such report to include: (1) a current inventory of the strategic and critical minerals in the Stockpile; (2) a list of minerals, broken down by the degree to which the United States is either self-sufficient or dependent on foreign sources, the degree to which each such mineral is essential for military, industrial, or civilian needs, and amounts in reserve; and (3) an analysis on the impact of interruption of access to foreign sources. Directs the President to establish a program under the Director to assess on a continuing basis the requirements for and availability of strategic and critical materials. Sets forth the elements of such program, including identification, monitoring, and review of Federal policy on material needs and sources. Authorizes appropriations."
