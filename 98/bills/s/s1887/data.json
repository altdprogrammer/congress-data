    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H. R. 3929 passed in lieu) Federal Supplemental Compensation Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Federal Supplemental Compensation Act of 1982 to extend the payment of benefits under the Federal supplemental unemployment compensation program for 18 months, through March 31, 1985. Revises provisions for determining the number of weeks for which such benefits are payable to an individual or in a State. Provides that the amount established in an individual account shall be the equal of the lesser of: (1) 50 percent of the total amount of regular compensation (including dependents' allowances) payable to the individual with respect to the benefit year (as determined under State law) on the basis of which the individual received regular compensation; or (2) specified applicable limits (during certain State unemployment periods) times the individual's average weekly benefit for the benefit year. Provides for the following applicable limits on weeks of such benefits: (1) 12 weeks in States with an insured unemployment rate (IUR) of five percent or greater (a \"five-percent period\"); (2) ten weeks for an IUR between four and five percent (a \"four-percent period\"); (3) eight weeks for an IUR between three and four percent (a \"three-percent period\"); (4) six weeks for an IUR below three percent (a \"low-unemployment period\"). Provides that, if the applicable limit in effect for a State for the week beginning September 25, 1983, was 14 weeks, that 14-week limit shall remain for any consecutive week thereafter for which such limit would have remained at 14 under provisions in effect prior to the amendments made by this Act. Provides that the total amount established in any account of an individual who received Federal supplemental compensation for any week beginning prior to October 1, 1983, shall not be less than the amount to which such individual would have been entitled under provisions in effect prior to the amendments made by this Act, including the termination date and reduced compensation amount contained in such provisions as then in effect. Sets forth formulas for determining the type of unemployment period for which a State qualifies. Directs the Secretary of Labor to require modifications of agreements with States under such Act to conform to amendments made by this Act within a specified period. Directs the Secretary of Labor, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the Attorney General to enter into arrangements to make available to States computer or other data regarding current and retired Federal employees and Federal prisoners so that States may review the eligibility of these individuals for unemployment compensation and take action where appropriate. Directs the Secretary to report, with recommendations for further legislation, to the Congress, before January 31, 1984, on such arrangements and any arrangements which could be entered into with other appropriate State agencies, to ensure that unemployment compensation is not paid to retired individuals or prisoners in violation of law. Amends the Social Security Act to require that direct repayment of general revenue advances. Requires that amounts appropriated as repayable advances be repaid, without interest, by transfers from the Federal unemployment account to the general fund of the Treasury, at such times as the amount in such account is adequate for such purpose, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of Labor. Provides that any amounts transferred from the Federal unemployment account to the employment security administration account as of September 30, 1983, shall be transferred back to the Federal unemployment account. Directs the Secretary of Labor to report, with recommendations for further legislation, to the Congress, before December 31, 1983, on arrangements which have been, or could be, entered into with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, the Attorney General, and any appropriate State agencies, to ensure that unemployment compensation is not paid to retired individuals or prisoners in violation of the law. Amends the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 to extend for one year, through October 1, 1984, specified provisions relating to Federal payments for dependent children voluntarily placed in foster care. Amends the Social Security Act to increase the amount of the allotment to a State for FY 1984 under the title XX program of block grants to States for social services. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to provide financial assistance to the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation to assist in the development of the Mansfield Center for Pacific Affairs and the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Center at the University of Montana. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend the exemption of wages paid to certain alien farmworkers from Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) unemployment taxation for two additional years, until January 1, 1986. Delays by two years the application of specified amendments made by the Social Security Amendments of 1983. Provides that remuneration received by retired Federal judges for continuing to perform judicial services shall not be treated as wages for social security tax purposes until January 1, 1986. Amends the Social Security Act to make a technical amendment relating to the repayment of cash flow loan advances from the unemployment insurance trust fund by State unemployment insurance funds. Amends the Social Security Act to extend until January 1, 1984, the period for which the provisions continuing payment of social security disability benefits during appeal are applicable. Amends the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act to reinstate the program of supplemental railroad unemployment compensation benefits (which provides for an additional ten weeks of unemployment compensationf or railroad workers with less than ten years' service) for one year, from July 1, 1983, to June 30, 1984."
