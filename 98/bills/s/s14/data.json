    "text": "Agricultural Market Expansion Act of 1983 - Amends the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to give away excess Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) stocks to U.S. processors and exporters and to foreign nations to encourage U.S. commodity exports. Directs the Secretary to: (1) aid domestic industries hurt by imports made in whole or in part from such commodities; (2) use such commodities to increase use and to avoid displacing existing U.S. overseas markets; and (3) prevent the resale or transshipment of such commodities. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to permit the donation abroad of CCC commodity and dairy stocks through foreign governments and humanitarian organizations. Coordinates such donations through the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (P.L. 480). Permits the use of such stocks to expand foreign exports under such Act. Directs the Secretary to donate abroad at least 50,000 metric tons of CCC dairy stocks during each of the fiscal years 1983 through 1985. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress semiannually during such period. Permits the Secretary to sell CCC stocks of long staple cotton for unrestricted use at appropriate price levels. Amends the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 to provide that whenever a commodity is made available without charge or credit, the Secretary shall encourage its consumption through agreements with private companies under which the commodity is processed into end products for use by eligible recipients, with the expense to be borne by the recipients."
