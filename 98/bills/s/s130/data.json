Extends the rescheduling and reamortizing period on FmHA loans from seven to 15 years. Prohibits interest rates on such rescheduled loans from being higher than the original interest charge. Extends additional disaster loan eligibility periods for specified borrowers. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of Agriculture should provide maximum credit assistance to those farmers temporarily unable to meet their debt obligations."
