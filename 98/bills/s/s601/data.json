Directs the Secretary of Labor to develop and publish a list of skilled occupations with substantial shortages. Directs the Secretary of Defense to then select from that list occupations which will have an adverse impact on defense procurement if the shortage is not reduced. Requires the Secretary of Defense to carry out demonstration projects with selected contracts for defense procurement, requiring the contractors to provide training in the shortage area. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress within two and one-half years on the demonstration projects. Amends the Defense Industrial Reserve Act to authorize the Secretary to donate surplus machine tools and related equipment to specified educational institutions or training schools having loan agreements on such property if it is no longer needed by the Department."
