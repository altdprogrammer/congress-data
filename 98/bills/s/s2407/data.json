    "text": "Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) (\"Superfund\") to establish certain requirements with respect to hazardous substances released from Federal facilities. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to enter into specified interagency agreements with any Federal agency. Directs the Administrator, in addition to undertaking response action, to take action under CERCLA against any Federal agency in the same manner and to the same extent as against a nongovernmental entity, unless such an interagency agreement is reached within specified time periods. Sets forth procedures for interagency agreements and emergency actions applicable to Federal agencies under CERCLA. Directs the Administrator to establish a special Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket. Directs the Administrator to report annually to Congress on: (1) progress in reaching interagency agreements; (2) cost estimates and budgetary proposals involved; (3) public comments regarding each proposed agreement; and (4) instances in which no agreement has been reached, including an explanation of why no agreement was reached. Authorizes citizen lawsuits under CERCLA against: (1) any person (including the United States and any other governmental instrumentality or agency, to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment to the Constitution) who is alleged to be in violation of any requirement which has become effective pursuant to CERCLA; or (2) the Administrator where there is an alleged failure to perform any non-discretionary act or duty under CERCLA. Sets forth requirements relating to such citizen lawsuits, which are to be brought in the appropriate U.S. district court. Directs the President, within 90 days after the enactment of this Act, to publish a schedule for including on the national priority list under CERCLA any federally owned or operated facilities which present a risk or danger to public health or welfare or the environment. Provides that such facilities shall be included on such list in the same manner and subject to the same criteria as facilities which are owned or operated by other persons."
