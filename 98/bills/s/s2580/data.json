    "text": "Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate certain portions of the Cache la Poudre River (in Colorado) and the South Fork of such river as components of the Wild and Scenic Rivers system. States that this designation does not preclude the construction, management, or operation of water resources projects at specified dam sites, nor does the designation affect development, management, and use of existing water resources projects on the Cache la Poudre or any of its tributaries. Adds another specified portion of the Cache la Poudre to the list of rivers designated for potential addition to the national wild and scenic rivers system. Sets a completion date for a study of such portion three years after enactment of this bill. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out such study, which shall identify: (1) a 100-year flood plain; and (2) existing and potential land uses within such flood plain which may be inconsistent with the addition of the segment to the national wild and scenic rivers system."
