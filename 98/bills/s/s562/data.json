Requires the Secretary in granting or denying an extension to consider, among other factors: (1) whether the private foundation has in good faith taken reasonable steps to dispose of such holdings throughout the initial five-year period; (2) whether orderly dispositon of such holdings can reasonably be expected to occur before the expiration of the extension period; and (3) all other facts and circumstances which the Secretary considers relevant. Requires that any extension so granted be no less than twenty-four months in duration."
