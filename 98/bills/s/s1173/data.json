    "text": "Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 to exempt States and political subdivisions of States from coverage under the Act. Replaces the requirement that the Secretary of Labor make inspections of surface mines at least twice a year with the requirement that the Secretary establish criteria to determine the minimum number of inspections to be made at each surface mine. Directs the Secretary to issue a notice of violation to a mine if the Secretary believes that there is a violation of any mandatory health or safety standard (currently, a citation is issued in such situations). Directs the Secretary to issue a citation if a violation is found that is a significant health and safety hazard (meaning, a situation likely to result in a serious injury or illness). Revises requirements for mandatory health and safety training. Eliminates the present requirements for refresher training and provides that such refresher training shall be at such intervals as the Secretary determines is necessary. Authorizes the Secretary to provide consultation and assistance to any mine operator in order to assist the operator in meeting the requirements of the Act and in improving the health and safety conditions and practices in the mine. Prohibits: (1) such consultation and assistance from being considered an inspection or investigation; and (2) the issuance of any notice of violation, citation, or order as the result of such consultation and assistance."
