    "text": "Barrow Gas Field Transfer Act of 1984 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey to the North Slope Borough, Alaska, the subsurface estate held by the United States to the Barrow gas fields and the Walakpa gas discovery site, related support facilites, other lands, interests, and funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement between the Secretary of the Interior and the North Slope Borough dated September 22, 1983. Incorporates such agreement into this Act. Authorizes the North Slope Borough, upon conveyance, to explore for, develop, and produce fluid hydrocarbons within the lands and interests granted. Directs the Secretary to convey to Ukpeagvik Inupiat Corporation (UIC) all right, title, and interest held by the United States to sand and gravel underlying the surface estate owned by UIC in the Barrow gas fields and Walakpa gas discovery site, upon execution of an easement agreement with the North Slope Borough, satisfactory to the North Slope Borough in consideration for the conveyance to UIC of such sand and gravel, providing for easements, for all purposes associated with the production of energy, including the transmission of electricity, from the Barrow gas fields, from any source of energy chosen by the North Slope Borough, to supply energy to Barrow, Wainwright, and Atkasook, and providing such easements when and where required as determined by the North Slope Borough. Amends the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976 to authorize the Secretary to grant such rights-of-way to the North Slope Borough as may be necessary to permit the North Slope Borough to provide energy supplies to villages on the North Slope. Provides that, in consideration for the relinquishment of rights that the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation has under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to the subsurface resources in the Barrow gas fields and the Walakpa gas discovery site conveyed to the North Slope Borough and UIC pursuant to this Act, the Secretary and Arctic Slope Regional Corporation are authorized to exchange lands and interests as set forth in the separate agreement between the Secretary and the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation dated January 24, 1984. Incorporates into this Act and ratifies the specific terms, conditions, and covenants of such agreement as to the rights, duties, and obligations of the United States and the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation and as to the rights and interests of the North Slope Borough."
