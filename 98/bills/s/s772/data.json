Rept. 98-177) Smoking Prevention Health and Education Act of 1983 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to inform the public of the health hazards of cigarettes through research, demonstration, and educational activities. Establishes an Interagency Committee on Smoking and Health to coordinate such Federal and private activities. Requires the Committee to meet at least four times a year. Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress on the status of health and smoking in the United States. Makes it a misdemeanor (with maximum $10,000 fine) to manufacture, import, or package cigarettes without first filing a list of chemical additives (types and amounts) with the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to report at least annually to Congress regarding cigarette additives and their health hazards. Amends the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act to change existing label warning provisions to require cigarette packages to carry a conspicuously displayed specified warning. Makes it unlawful to manufacture, import, or package cigarettes commercially without disclosing tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide levels on the package."
