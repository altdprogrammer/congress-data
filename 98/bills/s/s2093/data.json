    "text": "Contract Disputes Improvement Act of 1983 - Amends the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 to eliminate certain certification requirements for claims by contractors against the Government for more than $50,000. Requires that prospective members of agency boards of contract appeals be examined in the same manner as are prospective administrative law judges. Provides that a decision by such a board on any question of fact shall not be final and conclusive if it is clearly erroneous. (Current law provides that such a decision shall not be final and conclusive if it is so grossly erroneous as to imply bad faith, not supported by substantial evidence.) Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to determine and publish in the Federal Register the rates of interest to be paid on amounts determined to be due to contractors for each six-month period beginning on January 1, 1984. Prohibits the payment of interest for any period preceding the date on which the contractor actually incurs the cost forming the basis of his or her claim or, in the case of a contract for services, the date such services are rendered. Authorizes a board of contract appeals to assess a charge for the fees and other expenses of a proceeding against any party that does not prevail, upon finding that the action upon which the proceeding was based was frivolous or vexatious or was brought in bad faith."
