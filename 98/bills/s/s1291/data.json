    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Authorizes appropriations for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for FY 1984 and 1985. Allocates funds for: (1) nuclear reactor regulation; (2) inspection and enforcement; (3) nuclear material safety and safeguards; (4) nuclear regulatory research; (5) program technical support; and (6) program direction and administration. Limits the NRC's authority to enter into grants and cooperative agreements with universities to not more than one percent of the amount authorized to be appropriated for nuclear regulatory research. Prohibits the NRC from reprogramming any funds authorized for any activities under this Act so that any program would be increased or decreased by more than $500,000, unless: (1) a period of 30 calendar days passes after notice of such reprogramming has been sent to specified congressional committees; or (2) such committees transmit within such 30-day period a written notice that they have no objection to such reprogramming. Authorizes the NRC to use the cooperative nuclear research program funds and the material access authorization program funds to pay salaries and expenses under such programs. Authorizes the NRC to transfer sums from the amounts appropriated under this Act to other Government agencies which perform the work for which such appropriations were made. Prohibits the use of funds authorized to be appropriated under this Act to carry out any policy or program for the decentralization or regionalization of NRC authorities regarding nuclear reactor licensing until 60 days after the NRC submits to Congress an evaluation of the effect of such policy or program on nuclear reactor safety. Authorizes the NRC to conduct a pilot program to evaluate the concept of delegating authority to regional offices for issuance of specific types of operating reactor licensing actions and to address nuclear reactor safety issues. Authorizes funds for the NRC for: (1) the acquisition and installation of equipment for the small test prototype nuclear data link program or for any other program for the collection and transmission to the NRC of data from licensed nuclear reactors during abnormal conditions; and (2) a complete analysis of the NRC's role during abnormal conditions at a licensed nuclear reactor. Requires that any equipment acquired and installed include a fully automated electronic nuclear data link. Authorizes the NRC to use funds authorized under this Act to issue an operating license for a nuclear reactor in the absence of a State or local emergency preparedeness plan if there exists a State, local, or utility plan which provides that public health and safety is not endangered by the reactor's operation. Authorizes the NRC to transfer Facility Operating License numbered R-81 to a U.S. entity or corporation owned or controlled by a foreign corporation if the NRC finds and if license conditions ensure that such transfer would not be adverse to the common defense and security or to the public health and safety."
