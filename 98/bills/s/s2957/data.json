    "text": "Arms Race Control Act of 1984 - Directs the President to propose to the Soviet Union that the two sides agree to halt for a limited time: (1) the flight, testing, and deployment of strategic ballistic missiles under development; (2) the testing of antisatellite weapons against objects in space; and (3) the detonation of any nuclear explosive device. Prohibits the obligation or spending of any funds, beginning six months after enactment of this Act, for any such testing, deployment, or detonation unless the President provides a determination and certification to the Congress, together with an unclassified report and a detailed classified report setting forth the basis for the decision stating that: (1) the President has tried in good faith and has failed to achieve a mutual and verifiable agreement with the Soviet Union to impose the constraints on such testing, deployment, and detonation; (2) the President has reliable evidence that the Soviet Union is proceeding with such testing, deployment, or detonation; and (3) failure of the United States to do the same would undermine the national security. Provides for the allocation of personnel as may be appropriate to ensure continued progress toward the goal of a comprehensive halt in the nuclear arms race. Directs the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Director of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, to transmit to the Congress an annual report regarding the status of and prospects for bilateral and multilateral negotiations to accomplish the goal of a comprehensive halt in the nuclear arms race."
