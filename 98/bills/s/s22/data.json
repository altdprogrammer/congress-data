Repeals the authority of the Commission under such Act to revoke a station license or construction permit for willful or repeated failure of a station to grant or sell broadcast time to a candidate for Federal elective office. Repeals the requirement that a licensee grant equal opportunities to all political candidates who use the licensee's broadcasting station. Repeals the prohibition under such Act against editorializing and support of political candidates by noncommercial educational broadcasting stations."
