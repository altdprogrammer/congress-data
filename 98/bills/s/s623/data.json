Directs the Administrator to inform the Council of any budget modifications proposed by the Administrator, the Secretary of Energy, or the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Requires the Administrator to submit a report to the Council and to Congress whenever the Administrator finds an alternative budget proposal by the Council unacceptable. Provides that the Administrator shall cooperate with and assist the Council in order to facilitate the Council's review of the draft budget and modifications. Requires the Administrator to conform the budget to the requirements of the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act and to the regional electric power and conservation plan and the fish and wildlife program adopted pursuant to such Act. Amends the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act to require the Council to: (1) review, and report to Congress on, the initial budget proposal plus any budget modifications for the Bonneville Power Administration; and (2) submit to Congress an alternative budget or alternative figures for parts of the budget."
