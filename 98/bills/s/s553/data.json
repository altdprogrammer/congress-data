    "text": "American Defense Education Act - Authorizes a national program to provide incentives to local educational agencies to improve: (1) instruction in mathematics, science, and communication skills, foreign languages, and technology; and (2) guidance and counseling. Title I: Elementary and Secondary Education Programs - Requires local education agencies which desire to participate in such national program to develop and carry out a program of improvement of instruction and student achievement. Sets forth requirements for such programs. Entitles participating local educational agencies to receive basic payments for each fiscal year equal to two percent of an established payment rate multiplied by the average daily attendance. Entitles agencies which show substantial evidence of meeting program goals to an incentive payment equal to an additional two percent of the established payment rate multiplied by the average daily attendance. Sets forth formulae for establishing such payment rate. Sets forth requirements for applications for payments. Directs the Secretary of Education (\"the Secretary\") to approve applications which meet such requirements. Title II: Teacher Training and Postsecondary Programs - Authorizes the Secretary to establish a program of grants to institutions of higher education for coordination between such institutions and local educational agencies in improving science and mathematics education, through precollege teacher training, development, and recruitment programs. Sets forth requirements for grant proposals and priorities in grant selection. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for such grants. Title III: Research to Improve Instruction - Directs the Secretary to administer, through the National Institute of Education (NIE) in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies, a program to support research and development into effective education in mathematics, the sciences, foreign languages, and technology. Authorizes appropriations in the Department of Education to be made available to NIE to carry out such educational research program for FY 1985 through 1987. Title IV: General Provisions - Directs the Secretary to administer the program and to pay each local educational agency with an approved application the amount to which it is entitled for each fiscal year under title I provisions. Provides for a joint survey and report to Congress by the Secretaries of Defense and Education, for each year from 1984 through 1987, on the academic achievement levels of U.S. 18-year-olds and the personnel training and educational needs of the armed forces."
