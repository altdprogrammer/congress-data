Authorizes the establishment of a just and reasonable rate for such gas in excess of the above rate (the average price for number six fuel oil) upon a determination that: (1) alternative domestic supplies of natural gas are not available in the market to which such liquefied natural gas is proposed to be delivered at the proposed price; (2) the source of supply of such liquefied natural gas is reasonably secure from interruption; and (3) the agreement under which such liquefied natural gas is supplied includes a provision for reducing the quantity or price, or both, of such imports, if circumstances change such that alternative domestic supplies at reduced prices become available."
