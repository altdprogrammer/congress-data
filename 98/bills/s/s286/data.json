Specifies seven duties of a supplier to a dealer. Title II - Procedures for Termination - Allows a supplier to terminate a dealer agreement before a specified expiration date (or at any time if such agreement does not contain an expiration date) by offering the dealer, within 60 days of the intended termination, fair and reasonable compensation for the value of the agreement. Permits the parties to resort to arbitration to determine the amount of such compensation if a controversy occurs. Title III - Miscellaneous Provisions - Grants any party the right to file an action for damages or equitable relief in Federal district court for violations of this Act. States that this Act shall not be construed to modify any provision of the antitrust laws or to supersede any State law which provides additional or stronger standards than those in this Act."
