    "text": "Preventive Health Care Incentive Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers an income tax credit for up to ten percent of the costs of providing a preventive health care program to employees. Limits such credit to $50 times the average number of full-time employees regularly participating in such a program. Requires that such a preventive health care program must: (1) be administered by or for the employer; (2) have regular participation of at least 25 percent of the full-time employees of the employer; (3) not discriminate in favor of employees who are officers, shareholders, or highly compensated employees; (4) be recognized as contributing to and fostering improved health; and (5) be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury (after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services). Requires the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports to study the effectiveness of such preventive health care programs. Requires the Council to report the results of such study to specified committees of the Congress before January 1, 1986."
