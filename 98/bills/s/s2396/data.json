    "text": "Adoption Identification Act of 1984 - Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978 to provide for the establishment of a voluntary reunion registry demonstration program for biological parents and adoptees, biological siblings or other relatives of adoptees, and estranged family members, including runaways or those estranged as the result of social upheaval. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a voluntary identification system by grant or contract with public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations. Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress on all activities carried out under this Act. Requires that the voluntary reunion registry operate so as to provide a centralized nationwide capacity, utilizing computer and data processing methods. Requires that participation be voluntary by all parties involved. Provides for initiation of the locating process, by submission of an application to the agency or organization operating the system, by a biological parent, an estranged family member, or an adoptee over age 21. Provides that such process may also be initiated by a sibling or other biological relative of an adoptee or an estranged family member, whenever: (1) the biological parent of an adoptee or estranged family member is dead or missing; (2) such parent has consented in writing to the initiation of such process; or (3) the Secretary determines the circumstances to be appropriate after consideration of the privacy rights and interest of all parties who may be affected. Sets forth other requirements relating to the locating process. Provides for protection of confidentiality and privacy rights, followup activities, and reasonable fees. Provides that the registry may include the operation of a similar statewide identification computer system in any State which chooses to participate in the registry and agrees to provide coordination, consistent standards and procedures, and financial participation. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act for FY 1984 through 1986."
