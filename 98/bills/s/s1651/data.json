Maintains such presumption even in the absence of records. Directs the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to establish guidelines and criteria for resolving claims for benefits resulting from a service-connected death or disability based on a veteran's exposure during service on active duty to: (1) herbicides containing dioxin in Vietnam during the Vietnam era; or (2) ionizing radiation from the detonation of a nuclear device, either in connection with testing or the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, prior to July 1, 1946. Sets forth procedures for the development of such regulations, including: (1) opportunities for public hearings and comment; and (2) amendment of such regulations upon the annual reporting of the results of the epidemiological study on the effects of exposure to agent orange required by the Veterans' Health Programs Extension and Improvement Act of 1979."
