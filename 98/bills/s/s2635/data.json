Prohibits any public building construction, renovation, repair, or alteration unless an appropriation for the estimated costs of such construction has been authorized in the same fiscal year. Prohibits entering into any lease, beginning in FY 1986, unless the authority to enter into contracts has first been made for the maximum cost of such lease. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 for the real property management and related activities of the Public Buildings Service, with specified outlays for: (1) construction of public buildings at specified locations; (2) construction of public buildings of less than 10,000 gross square feet of space; (3) deficit balances relating to FY 1982 construction projects; (4) purchase of sites and buildings at specified locations and costs; (5) renovations, alterations, and repairs of public buildings at specified locations and costs; (6) design and construction services; (7) rental increases due to lease expirations and for expansion space; (8) payments in FY 1985 to provide for space under lease prior to FY 1985; (9) FY 1985 real property operations; (10) FY 1985 program direction; and (11) FY 1985 payments of principal, interest, taxes, and any other obligation for public buildings acquired by purchase contract. Directs that funds appropriated for construction or repair shall remain available without fiscal year limitation, provided that such construction or repair has commenced in the same year in which funds for such work was authorized. Regards commencement of design as commencement of construction. Requires that ten percent of the funds made available for renovation, alteration, and repair of public buildings and for payment of leases on buildings, shall be available for repair or alteration projects and leases, respectively, not otherwise authorized by this Act, if the Administrator of General Services (the Administrator) certifies such to be the result of emergency building conditions or changing or additional programs of Federal agencies. Prohibits the obligation of funds for such projects until 30 days after submission by the Administrator of an explanatory statement to the appropriate congressional committees which includes the reasons why such project or lease cannot be deferred for authorization until the next succeeding fiscal year."
