    "text": "Cable-Porn and Dial-Porn Control Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to include communication by means of television or cable television within the prohibition against broadcasting obscene language. Prohibits the distribution of any indecent or profane material by means of radio, television, or cable television. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to revise the provisions prohibiting obscene phone calls. Permits a civil penalty to be imposed of not more than $50,000. Allows a court, upon petition and a proper showing, to issue a preliminary injunction against such calls. Eliminates as a defense to a violation that access to the prohibited communications was restricted to persons 18 years of age or older."
