    "text": "Home Recording Act of 1983 - Amends the copyright law to exempt from liability for infringement of copyright any individual who makes a single video recording of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, or a single audio recording of a musical work or sound recording, in his or her private home solely for private household use. Requires the compulsory licensing of manufacturers and importers of video and audio recording devices and media. Sets forth procedures for: (1) determining royalty fees to be paid by such manufacturers and importers; and (2) distributing such fees to the owners of copyright of audiovisual works included in television transmissions and musical works and sound recordings included in radio or television transmissions or distributed in the form of phonorecords. Provides for the determination of royalty fees by: (1) voluntary negotiation between importers and manufacturers and representatives of copyright owners; or (2) compulsory arbitration when a voluntary agreement is not reached. Specifies criteria to be considered by an arbitration board in determining royalty fees. Authorizes the Register of Copyrights to confirm fees determined under arbitration or, under specified circumstances, to deny such fees and initiate new arbitration proceedings. Provides for the judicial review of the Register's decision. Requires royalty fees to be redetermined every three years. Sets forth penalties for violations of the requirements of this Act."
