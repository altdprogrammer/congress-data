Increases from $2,000 to $100,000 the dollar value of contracts to which such Act applies. Directs the Secretary of Labor to base the determination of the wages prevailing for the corresponding classes of laborers, mechanics, and helpers on: (1) the wage paid to 50 percent or more of such corresponding classes of workers employed on projects similar to the contract work in the urban or rural subdivision of the State; or (2) if the same wage is not paid to 50 percent or more, the weighted average of the wages paid to the corresponding classes employed on such similar projects."
