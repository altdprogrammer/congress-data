    "text": "United States International Aviation Support Act of 1983 - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) initiate technical assistance programs with aviation authorities of other governments; and (2) initiate programs to assist U.S. firms in the export of aerospace products and services. Amends the International Aviation Facilities Act to include private entities as parties from which the Secretary and the Chief of the Weather Bureau may accept funds for facilities supplied or services performed. Declares that such funds include the receipt of in-kind services and describes such services. Provides for the imposition of compensating charges to foreign aircraft whose governments impose excessive or discriminatory user charges to U.S. registered aircraft. Authorizes the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to establish an international aerospace exchange program. Establishes the International Aviation Services Fund for the deposit of funds received under the International Aviation Facilities Act, funds received by the FAA for certain certification services, and such sums as may be credited as provided by this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to expend from the Fund such amounts as necessary to carry out the provisions of such Act. Requires an increase in personnel ceilings for the Department of Transportation for which the costs are substantially reimbursed under this Act and the International Aviation Facilities Act."
