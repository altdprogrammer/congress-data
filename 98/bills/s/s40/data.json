    "text": "Small Business Motor Fuel Marketer Preservation Act - Makes it unlawful for a refiner, other than an independent or small refiner, to operate a gas station in the United States. Makes it unlawful for any person to interfere with the purchasing, selling, or storing of motor fuel by a dealer. Permits contracts requiring a dealer to purchase motor fuel exclusively from a particular refiner if such contract assures the dealer the right to purchase fuel elsewhere in cases where the refiner does not have such fuel readily available. Makes it unlawful for a dealer at a station displaying a trademark or identifying symbol of a particular refiner to sell motor fuel not refined by such refiner unless the dealer provides notice to purchasers. Requires that, within 90 days after enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, refiners provide the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with information on the number of barrels of crude oil they produced and refined during the preceding year. Requires such information for calendar year 1978. Requires the FTC, and permits private parties directly affected, to bring civil actions against persons who violate this Act. Directs the FTC to prescribe regulations required by this Act."
