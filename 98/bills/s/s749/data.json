(Currently the Secretary is authorized to approve such training). Directs the Secretary to pay a daily supplemental assistance benefit to any worker who begins approved job training after enactment of this Act and who is not eligible for trade adjustment allowances. Increases the maximum job search and relocation allowances to $800. Establishes an Adjustment Assistance Trust Fund in the Treasury. Authorizes appropriations to the Trust Fund, payable out of the general fund of the Treasury attributable to the collection of customs duties, to carry out provisions for adjustment assistance for workers. Amends the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 to amend the definition of \"suitable work\" for a worker who would be eligible for a trade readjustment allowance if the worker were not eligible for extended compensation. Establishes the Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance in the Department of Labor. Directs that such office be headed by the Assistant Secretary for Trade Adjustment, who shall be appointed by the President. Makes conforming amendments. Transfers the Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance in the Employment and Training Administration of the Department of Labor to the Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance established by this Act. Terminates the position of Director of the Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance."
