    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H. R. 5167 passed in lieu) Omnibus Defense Authorization Act, 1985 - Title I: Procurement - Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1985 - Part A: Procurement - Authorizes appropriations for the Army for FY 1985 for procurement of aircraft, missiles, weapons, tracked combat vehicles, and ammunition and for other procurement. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to enter into multiyear contracts for the procurement of the UH-60A aircraft and EH-60A aircraft and for the execution of the CH-47D aircraft modernization program. Permits such contracts to include an unfunded cancellation ceiling. Prohibits the use of funds for the Division Air Defense System until: (1) initial testing is completed; and (2) 30 days elapse after the Secretary of Defense reports the results of such testing and certifies to Congress that continued production is in the national interest. Amends the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1984, to repeal the prohibition against establishing a second source for producing the M-1 tank engine. Authorizes appropriations for the Navy and Marine Corps for FY 1985 for procurement of aircraft, weapons (including missiles and torpedoes), shipbuilding and conversion, and other procurement. Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to enter into multiyear contracts for the procurement of the CH-53E aircraft. Permits such contracts to include an unfunded cancellation ceiling. Prohibits the use of funds for the fourth year of the multiyear contract for the procurement of the KS-153 low altitude aerial reconnaissance camera for the Marine RF-4B aircraft. Directs the Secretary of the Air Force to test the CA-810 aerial reconnaissance camera's suitability for high speed, low altitude aerial reconnaissance missions by November 1, 1984. Permits the fourth year procurement of the KS-153 if the CA-810 proves unsatisfactory or is not completed in time. Directs the Secretary to conduct competitive procurement for such cameras should they meet or exceed the Navy's requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to maintain one or more alternate sources of procurement for a common aircraft ejection seat for specified aircraft. Authorizes appropriations for the Air Force for FY 1985 for procurement of aircraft, missiles, and other procurement, including Air National Guard equipment. Prohibits the use of funds for sole source procurement of a strategic weapons loader or the modification of an existing loader to meet the performance requirements for the B-1B bomber or the Advanced Technology Bomber aircraft. Limits MX missile procurement to 21 operational missiles. Authorizes the transfer of specified FY 1984 funds for the procurement of aircraft in FY 1985. Limits the amount available for procurement associated with the Consolidated Space Operations Center. Earmarks certain Air National Guard equipment procurement funds for the procurement of \"smoke kits\" for the F-4 aircraft. Requires such Guard aircraft to be \"de-smoked\" at the same rate as regular Air Force F-4s. Expresses the sense of Congress that the F-4D \"smoke kit\" modification program for the Guard and the Air Force Reserve should be a priority program and funded accordingly in FY 1986. Authorizes appropriations for the defense agencies. Extends through FY 1985 the authority of the Secretary of Defense, in carrying out the Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding Between the NATO Ministers of Defense concerning the NATO AWACS program, to waive the reimbursement for the cost of specified functions performed by certain personnel and to assume contingent liability for program losses and specified charges. Part B: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation - Authorizes appropriations for the armed forces and defense agencies for FY 1985 for research, development, test, and evaluation. Authorizes the appropriation of additional sums as necessary for civilian employee salaries and benefits.
