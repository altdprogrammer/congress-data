(Currently, only Government employees are eligible for such awards.) Requires the President and any inspector general or other official who makes such an award to submit to the Comptroller General documentation substantiating such award. Directs the Comptroller General to review procedures used to make such awards to verify the cost savings for which the awards were made. Limits the number of awards presented in a fiscal year. Terminates the authority to make such awards after September 30, 1984."
