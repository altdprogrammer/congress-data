Requires the General Accounting Office to investigate and report to Congress, during such moratorium, on: (1) mismanagement of the leasing of Federal coal resources; (2) possible alternatives to the current coal lease bidding process that would avoid single bids at below market prices; (3) changes in Federal law that would assure that the United States receives fair market value for coal leases; and (4) near term and future needs of the United States for coal and the impact of releasing large quantities of coal from Federal lands into the marketplace."
