Limits the kinds of computers covered by this Act to those operating in interstate commerce or operating on behalf of the Federal Government or a financial institution, where the prohibited conduct directly affects the computer operation. Makes it a separate offense to damage or destroy such a computer or to alter or delete any computer program or data stored in such a computer without authorization. Establishes criminal penalties for any person who buys, procures, or sells the password or access code for a computer with the purpose to defraud or obtain money by false pretenses. Sets forth a fine of not more than three times the amount of the gain derived from the offense or $50,000, whichever is higher, or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both. Makes it a federal offense to use such computer without authorization. Sets forth a fine for unauthorized use of not more than $5,000, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both."
