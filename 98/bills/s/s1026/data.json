    "text": "Federal Capital Investment Act of 1983 - Directs the National Commission on Capital Investment, established by this Act, to conduct an inventory of existing major national public improvements (highways, roads, bridges, mass transit, main water supply and distribution systems, and sewer systems) by region, State, and major metropolitan areas of the United States. Requires the Commission to develop a National Public Improvements Plan listing in priority order needed construction, rehabilitation, or repair of public improvements in each region to sustain regionally balanced national economic development. Requires the Commission, as a part of the plan, to suggest specific revisions in Federal laws, regulations, and policies that may be necessary to reverse the pattern of disinvestment in national public improvements. Sets forth procedures for the submission of such plan to Congress and for review and implementation of the plan. Establishes the National Commission on Capital Investment to assess the condition of national public works infrastructure. Amends the Budget and Accounting Act, 1982, to require the President to include with each budget submitted on or after January 1, 1984, a special analysis which shall identify for each function, agency, and program the amount of appropriations and expenditures which may be classified as national public improvements. Requires the President to also include with the budget after January 1, 1985, a capital investment budget which identifies by State the amount of appropriations and expenditures which may be classified as national public improvements. Authorizes appropriations."
