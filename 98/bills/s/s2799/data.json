    "text": "Civilian Travel Expense Amendments of 1984 - Authorizes the United States Postal Service to provide an employee a special per diem allowance for official travel outside the continental United States when the per diem allowance otherwise available for travel in the same locality is inadequate to cover the actual and necessary expenses of such travel. Provides that the maximum per diem allowance for travel in each locality inside the continental United States by Government employees, experts, or consultants shall be prescribed by the Administrator of General Services at a rate not exceeding $75 per day. Authorizes the Administrator to prescribe conditions under which such an individual is entitled to a per diem allowance and travel expenses to his or her duty post, home, or regular place of business if such person, while traveling on official business: (1) becomes incapacitated by illness or injury not due to misconduct; or (2) returns prior to completing his or her assignment, with the approval of the agency concerned, because of a personal emergency such as an injury or death of a family member or general emergency situation such as fire, flood, or other natural disaster. Limits to $75 per travel day the amount an employee may be reimbursed under any conditions for actual and necessary expenses for travel within the continental United States when the applicable per diem allowance is either inadequate or inappropriate. Authorizes the Administrator to provide for the payment of a special per diem allowance within current limitations when the applicable per diem allowance is inadequate to cover the actual and necessary expenses of travel outside the continental United States. Authorizes an agency, under conditions prescribed by the Administrator, to pay a per diem allowance and transportation expenses to any employee serving in a law enforcement, investigative, or protective capacity and any member of the employee's family who necessarily occupy temporary living accommodations away from the employee's duty post because of a threat to life or property or because official law enforcement, investigative, or protective interests might otherwise be compromised. Directs the Administrator, at least every two years, to review and analyze the travel and transportation expenses paid in a fiscal year by each agency which paid more than $5,000,000 for such expenses in either of the preceding two fiscal years."
