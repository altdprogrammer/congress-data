    "text": "Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals Act - Amends the Animal Welfare Act to revise the humane standards for animals transported in commerce. Requires each research facility to establish an institutional animal studies committee with sufficient expertise to assess the appropriateness of animal care and treatment in experimental research. Requires the committee at each facility to: (1) meet regularly, with a quorum needed for all formal actions; (2) make inspections at least semiannually of animal study areas and facilities; (3) review and evaluate the research methods involving direct use of conscious animals and the condition of research animals in order to ensure compliance with humane standards and to minimize pain and distress; and (4) file with the Secretary of Agriculture and the appropriate Federal agency a certification that such inspections have occurred (includes in such certification a report of any violations of standards). Requires the committee to notify, in writing, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture and any appropriate Federal agency of unacceptable conditions of animal care, treatment, or methodology not included in the certification. Directs the committee to provide for annual sessions for scientists, animal technicians, and other qualified personnel to provide instruction or training in humane standards for laboratory animals. Prohibits discrimination against research facility employees for reporting violations of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to waive certain standards under exceptional circumstances. Directs the Secretary to establish an information service at the National Agricultural Library to provide information on improved methods of animal experimentation, including: (1) reducing or replacing animal use; (2) minimizing pain and distress; and (3) preventing unnecessary duplication of animal experimentation. Requires a research facility to provide a statement of assurance of compliance with humane standards to the Secretary and the appropriate Federal agency before requesting a Federal award for animal research, experimentation, or testing. Sets forth terms and conditions under which the agency may approve or suspend such award."
