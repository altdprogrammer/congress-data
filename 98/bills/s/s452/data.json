    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Public Buildings Act of 1983 - Title I: General Authorities - Declares that the Administrator of General Services (GSA), acting through the Public Buildings Service, shall have sole authority to acquire, design, construct, lease, manage, maintain, repair, renovate, and assign and reassign space in buildings and services, except to the extent that Federal agency heads retain specific statutory authority in these matters. Establishes within GSA a Public Buildings Service (Service) to be headed by a Commissioner of Public Buildings. Creates the position of supervising architect to supervise all design activities of the Service. Revokes delegations of Service authority, delegated by the Administrator prior to the enactment of this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to delegate to the head of another Federal agency all or part of his or her authority under this Act with respect to the public building need of that agency. Requires the Administrator and the Federal agency heads with similar authority to submit annual reports to Congress. Requires the Administrator to collect and maintain information necessary to keep the Congress informed of the conduct of the Service and to manage Service activities. Sets forth the information the Administrator is required to make available. Directs the Administrator to require certification from either the owner of space to be leased or the contractor, before executing any lease or contract obligating more than $10,000 authorized under this Act. Makes any owner or contractor who fails to complete such certification ineligible to receive such lease or contract award. Sets forth certification requirements. Requires the Administrator to include in the annual report to Congress the name of each principal owner of leased blocks of space exceeding 50,000 square feet. Establishes procedures for keeping Congress and specified congressional committees informed of the policies and activities of the GSA within the purview of this Act. Authorizes the Administrator by partial relinquishment to establish between the Federal Government and a State or territory concurrent jurisdiction over certain lands and public buildings. States that the Administrator shall be responsible for the interpretation of all contracts entered into to carry out this Act and for the approval of materials, workmanship and services supplied under such contracts. Authorizes the Administrator to conduct research and post-occupancy evaluation to determine and improve the effectiveness of existing and planned public buildings. Title II: Locations for Federal Agency Offices - Requires the headquarters offices of each department and major executive establishment to be located in the National Capital region. Provides location requirements for regional, district, area, local and other Federal agency offices. Establishes factors the Administrator shall take into account in locating Federal agency offices. Authorizes the consolidation of Federal agency offices in a locality to the extent justified by the need for immediate physical proximity and by anticipated cost savings. Authorizes the head of a Federal agency to appeal the decision of the Administrator to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget where such head determines that the location assigned to any office of fifty or more employees of that agency would be deleterious to the efficient accomplishment of the office's responsibilities. Establishes appeal procedures. Directs that noncompliance with this Act shall not be construed to require relocation. Requires any action to locate or relocate any Federal agency be taken in accordance with this Act. Title III: Design and Management of Public Buildings - Requires the Administrator to design and maintain public buildings in a specified architectural manner. Requires the Administrator to design and construct public buildings to approximate the costs, durability, and ratio of net usable space to gross space of commercial buildings that serve similar purposes. Requires the Administrator to explain any excess over such commercial building standards in any authorization for appropriation requests. Requires the Administrator to use higher standards of quality for the design and construction of public buildings expected to attract significant public use in any locality that serves as a center of its geographical area, or as a headquarters building for any Federal agency. Directs the Administrator to assure specified requirements in the design, acquisition, renovation, and management of public buildings. Requires the Administrator to provide sheltered and secure bicycle parking locations and equipment for new public buildings, and similar facilities at existing and leased public buildings where bicycle use warrants the expense. Requires public buildings to be maintained at a high level of appearance, cleanliness, and mechanical and structural fitness for specified reasons and to preserve historic, architectural, or cultural values. Provides that nothing in this Act shall affect the applicability of the provisions of the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968. Amends the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 to include buildings acquired by the United States under the coverage of such Act. Requires that buildings subject to such Act be fully accessible to physically handicapped persons. Requires that any contract for the design, construction, or alteration of any public building include standards necessary to insure whenever possible, that such buildings are fully accessible to physically handicapped persons. Requires the head of the agency concerned to: (1) submit standards assuring compliance with the minimum requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 to the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board; and (2) prescribe regulations to assure conformity with such standards. Authorizes the Administrator, upon the request of local and State officials, to name a public building after, and establish a memorial therein in honor of, any person who has made notable contributions to government, science, industry, education, the arts, or other fields of human endeavor. Prohibits naming any public building for a sitting Member of Congress or for a former Member who holds any elective public office. Limits the amount of money the Administrator can spend for such memorial. Directs the Administrator to study the efficiency and economy of the use of space in public buildings by Federal agencies and to employ appropriate means to increase cost-effectiveness of such use.

Sets forth standards for such works of art and exhibitions. Requires the Administrator to avoid the development of an official style in architecture or art. Authorizes the Administrator to use one-half of one percent of the sums available for the construction, repair, and acquisition of public buildings for such purposes and one-twentieth of one percent of the sums available for the lease of buildings for such purposes. Title VI: Architectural Services - Directs the Administrator to employ architects, designers, and urban planners to prepare, under the supervision of the Supervising Architect, plans for such public building projects as the Commissioner of Public Buildings may designate. Requires those architectural designs not prepared in accordance with the above to be procured in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and requires a design competition between at least three qualified architectural firms, with respect to a substantial portion of the public building construction and renovation projects each year. Directs the Administrator to make public the reasons for the selection made. Requires that firms participating in such competition receive no more than one-half of one percent of the expected project costs. Title VII: Leasing - Requires the Administrator to provide long term comparisons of costs and benefits of construction, acquisition and leasing in recommending public building projects.
