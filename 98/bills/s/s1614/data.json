    "text": "Health Care Coordination Act of 1983 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to authorize any State, subject to a waiver being granted, to establish as a component of its State plan a comprehensive program under which individuals who are eligible for benefits under Medicaid and under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Act (other than an individual having end stage renal disease) shall be furnished health care and other services as described by such program. Requires any such program to provide at least the following services: (1) all services for which payment would be made under title XVIII; (2) all medical assistance for which an individual would otherwise be eligible under the State Medicaid plan; (3) case management, including assessments and periodic reassessments; and (4) to the extent the State determines such services to be required by an individual enrolled in the program homemaker and home health aid services, and adult day health care services. Authorizes a State to provide, in addition, any other community-based services necessary to maintain an enrolled individual in the community who would otherwise be institutionalized. Provides that: (1) a program established under this Act need not be in effect statewide; and (2) in any case in which more than one program is in effect in a State, each program shall be considered independently for purposes of meeting program requirements. Requires all services provided under the program to be provided by providers qualified under title XVIII or XIX. Makes any individual eligible for coverage under the program who is eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare (excluding those with end stage renal disease). Makes enrollment optional with the individual. Prohibits enrollment of any individual who is an inpatient in a skilled nursing or intermediate care facility if more than 25 percent of the individuals enrolled in the program already are inpatients in such facilities. Requires the percentage of individuals enrolled in a program who are disabled or frail elderly individuals to be approximately equal to or greater than the percentage of the population of such individuals eligible under Medicare and Medicaid in the area served by the program. Provides that the amounts and methods of payment under the program may be any one of several specified methods used under titles XVIII and XIX. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to grant a waiver of Medicaid and Medicare requirements to any State as may be necessary to establish a program or programs if such State provides satisfactory assurances that: (1) the total cost to State and Federal Governments will not exceed the total cost which would have been incurred if the program were not in effect; (2) quality of and access to health care under the program will be maintained; and (3) the program meets the requirements of this paragraph. Permits a waiver of: (1) the skilled care, intermittent care, and homebound requirements for the provision of home health services under Medicare; (2) the skilled care and post hospital requirement for extended care under Medicare; (3) Medicaid requirements relating to state coverage, comparability of services, and freedom of choice of providers; (4) any Medicaid or Medicare provision relating to methods and amounts of reimbursement; and (5) specified other Medicare and Medicaid requirements relating to amount and duration of covered services, enrollment fees, premiums, deductions, cost sharing, and similar charges. Requires a State to provide for quality assurance review of any program established under this Act. Directs the Secretary to make payments to a State on a per capita basis with respect to each individual enrolled in a program. Provides that the amount of such payment shall be 95 percent of the adjusted average per capita cost of institutionalized individuals as determined for purposes of Medicare health maintenance organization reimbursments in the case of any individual who is an inpatient in a skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility, or who: (1) has been determined to require the level of care provided in a skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility, but for the provision of home or community-based services under this program; and (2) is dependent on personal assistance on a daily basis for at least two of the following activities eating, bathing, use of the toilet, transferring to and from bed, or dressing. Requires the State to pay the premium under part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of title XVIII for each individual enrolled in the program. Requires: (1) each State with a program under this Act to report to the Secretary at least annually; and (2) the Secretary to report to Congress one year after enactment, and then again three years after enactment."
