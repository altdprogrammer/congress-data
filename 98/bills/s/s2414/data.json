Extends through FY 1985 the authority of the Secretary of Defense, in carrying out the Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding Between the NATO Ministers of Defense concerning the NATO AWACS program, to waive reimbursement for the cost of specified functions performed by certain personnel and to assume contingent liability for program losses and specified charges. Title II: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 for the armed forces and the defense agencies for research, development, test, and evaluation. Authorizes additional appropriations as needed for increases in civilian employee benefits. Title III: Operation and Maintenance - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 for the armed forces and the defense agencies for operation and maintenance. Authorizes additional appropriations as needed for increases in civilian employee benefits. Title IV: Working Capital Funds - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 for the working capital funds of each of the armed forces and for the Defense Stock Fund. Title V: Active Forces - Authorizes strengths for active duty personnel as of the end of FY 1985. Title VI: Reserve Forces - Authorizes average strengths for the selected reserve components of the armed forces for FY 1985. Permits the reduction and increase in such strengths as specified. Authorizes a specified number of reserves to serve on full-time active duty in order to organize, administer, instruct, recruit, or train the reserve components. Permits the end strength levels to be increased by two percent in the national interest. Increases the number of certain personnel who may be on active duty in specified grades. Title VII: Civilian Personnel - Authorizes civilian personnel levels for the Department as of the end of FY 1985. Directs the Secretary to apportion such personnel among the various armed forces and defense agencies and to report to Congress within 60 days on such apportionment. Specifies which personnel shall be included in computing the strength for civilian personnel. Permits the Secretary to increase the strength by up to two percent in the national interest. Title VIII: Military Training Student Loads - Authorizes average military training student loads for each component of the armed forces for FY 1985. Requires the adjustment of such loads as the manpower strengths of each component are adjusted. Title IX: General Provisions - Amends the Selected Acquisition Reports provisions to: (1) redefine a major defense acquisition program to mean a Defense Department acquisition program with a firm program baseline and cost estimate that has received congressionally approved funding and a departmental decision to proceed with full-scale engineering development, in addition to current requirements; (2) establish in excess of $5,000,000 the floor for major contracts; (3) permit less than five percent changes in cost and performance and less than six months delay in a major defense acquisition program before second, third, and fourth quarter status reports are required; (4) increase the time allowed for the submittal of the comprehensive annual and the Quarterly Selected Acquisition Reports to Congress; and (5) terminate reporting requirements once 90 percent of planned deliveries or expenditures have been incurred. Amends the Unit Cost Report provisions to: (1) redefine Baseline Selected Acquisition Report to mean the first comprehensive Selected Acquisition Report prepared subsequent to the award of the first production contract rather than the selected Acquisition Report in which information on the program is first included; (2) define Baseline Report with respect to unit cost reports submitted during subsequent quarters of the preceding fiscal year, depending upon when or whether such reports were submitted; (3) require the program manager for a defense acquisition program to breakdown the quarterly and other required unit cost reports and determinations by constant base-year dollars as well as current dollars; (4) exclude from the prohibition on expending further funds when a major defense acquisition program overruns cost by a certain percentage when changes in the program are a result of congressional action and the Secretary concerned reports to Congress within 30 days; (5) require reports triggered by unit cost overruns to express such costs for the succeeding fiscal year in both base-year and current dollars; and (6) trigger reporting requirements only in the first quarter of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the first production contract is awarded. Permits the issuance of withdrawal credits to customer accounts in connection with the capitalization of aviation depot level repairable assets. Repeals provisions of the Department of Education Organization Act which would have transferred from the Department of Defense to the Department of Education the responsibility for overseas schools for Defense Department dependents. Permits the Secretary to enter into agreements with the Governments of any friendly foreign country or international organization under which the United States agrees to provide communications support or related supplies and services in return for the reciprocal provision of an equivalent amount of support or supplies. Amends the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1983 to repeal the prohibition against consolidating functions of the military transportation commands."
