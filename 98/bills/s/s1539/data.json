Permits the Secretary to provide States with planning and operating technical assistance. Prohibits the use of funds for: (1) inpatient services; (2) cash payments to intended recipients; (3) land purchase or construction; (4) purchases of major medical equipment; or (5) financial aid to other than public or nonprofit entities.
