Sets limits on the amount of assistance which may be advanced. Requires the veteran to repay the advance with interest at the rate specified by the Administrator for veterans' guaranteed loans within 48 months. Makes the Administrator's decisions regarding advances final and nonreviewable. Terminates the advance program after two years."
