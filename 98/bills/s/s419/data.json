Requires that such funds be paid by the Secretary or the tribe directly to tribal members or to the legal guardians or trust funds of members who are minors or legally incompetent. Specifies conditions under which trust funds may be liable for the payment of previously contracted obligations. States that such conditions are the only provisions of this Act which apply to the Shoshone Tribe and the Arapahoe Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming. Authorizes tribes to make per capita payments if the payment plans are approved under specified Federal law. Directs the Secretary to establish regulatory standards for the approval of tribal payments. Absolves the United States from liability once a tribe has distributed funds after obtaining such approval. Repeals the requirement that per capita payments to individual Indians be made by an officer of the Federal Government."
