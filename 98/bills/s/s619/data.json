    "text": "Renewable Energy Consumer Incentives Act of 1983 - Amends the Solar Energy and Energy Conservation Act of 1980 to extend the life of the Solar Energy and Energy Conservation Bank until September 30, 1990. (Under current law, the Bank will not exist after September 30, 1987.) Requires that a portion of the payments by the Bank to financial institutions to provide financial assistance for the installation of solar energy systems in residential, commercial, and agricultural buildings be allocated for active solar energy. Provides that there shall be no Federal preference with respect to financial assistance between single-family and multifamily residences. Permits all financial institutions to apply directly to the Bank for financial assistance. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1990 for the financial assistance program under the Solar Energy and Energy Conservation Act of 1980 for the purchase and installation of residential and commercial energy conserving improvements and solar energy systems. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to make the residential energy credit applicable to expenditures for items which serve a purpose in addition to increasing energy efficiency in a dwelling (such as thermal draperies). Includes passive solar energy property which uses convective, conductive, or radiant energy transfer and which has significant impact on home energy savings as \"renewable energy source property\" which is eligible for the residential energy credit. Makes the residential energy credit inapplicable to energy conservation and renewable energy source expenditures made after December 31, 1990. (Under current law, such credit is inapplicable to expenditures made after December 31, 1985.) Amends the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 to permit a State to transfer up to ten percent of its allotment under the low-income home energy assistance program for States to block grants for support of energy related information systems. Requires the Secretary of Energy to develop a formalized information exchange on the Federal, State, and local levels with respect to conservation and renewable energy. Authorizes appropriations to provide financial assistance to States and local governments to coordinate such program. Amends the Solar Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1974 to require the Secretary of Energy to maintain a renewable energy and energy conservation information program. (This program replaces the solar energy information program required to be established under current law.) Requires the Secretary to establish a National Appropriate Technology Assistance Service to provide individualized technical assistance to anyone interested in renewable energy and energy efficient technologies. Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to require the Secretary of Transportation to consider the use or integration of renewable fuels and any approaches which maximize conservation and renewable energy applications in determining maximum feasible average fuel economy. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to require the Federal Trade Commission to prescribe labeling requirements for consumer goods particularly in cases where there is a direct consumer benefit to save energy or utilize renewable energy. Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Small Business Administration to provide reduced-rate loans to small businesses for acquisition of system performance ratings from testing laboratories for energy conservation and renewable energy systems and technologies. Requires State regulatory authorities to implement standardized contracts for renewable energy systems generating less than 100 kilowatts for: (1) the sale of electric energy from utilities to small power production facilities; and (2) the purchase of electric energy produced by small power production facilities by such utilities. Requires the Secretary of Energy to include renewable energy as a discrete energy sector in all publications of \"The Monthly Energy Review\". Requires Federal agencies with renewable energy programs to submit annual reports on such programs to Congress. Sets forth reporting requirements which apply to specified Federal agencies."
