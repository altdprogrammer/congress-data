    "text": "Domestic Food Assistance Act of 1984 - Title I: Food Stamp Program - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to raise food stamp allotments from 99 to 100 percent of the thrifty food plan. Increases the earned income deduction from 18 to 20 percent. Makes households each of whose members receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) categorically eligible for program participation. States that denial of eligibility or termination of benefits from such programs cannot be a basis for denial of food stamp eligibility or termination of benefits. Increases the resources limitation from $1500 to $2250, and from $3000 to $3500 for the elderly and disabled. Increases the threshold for accounting a vehicle's value against resources from $4500 to $5500. Permits States to stagger coupon issuance. Requires (currently permits) the Secretary to provide for alternative means of coupon issuance if doing so would improve program integrity. Prohibits financial institutions from charging retail food stores coupon redemption fees. Directs States to periodically assess the need to keep food stamp offices open during weekend or evening hours. Makes homeless persons eligible for food stamps. Prohibits appropriations under such Act from being transferred to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture. Requires States imposing a sales tax on food stamp purchases to transfer such revenues to the Secretary of the Treasury within 15 months of the end of each fiscal year. Authorizes States to establish community work experience programs. Title II: Nutrition Surveillance - Amends the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 to include periodic health and nutrition samplings of vulnerable low income groups in the Department of Agriculture's continuing food consumption survey. Title III: Food Distribution and Emergency Shelters - Authorizes the transfer of specified agricultural commodities to public or nonprofit organizations for low-income assistance. Authorizes military commissaries to donate surplus food to local food banks. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States to assist the homeless. Authorizes FY 1984 through 1986 appropriations. Title IV: Effective Dates - Makes the provisions of this Act effective within 45 days after enactment."
