Prohibits the Office of Personnel Management from contracting for or approving either such plan or any employee organization plan that does not provide for: (1) 50 outpatient visits and 60 inpatient days of nervous and mental disorder benefits; and (2) two 28-day alcoholism or substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation benefits for individuals who have not previously received such treatment. Provides that limits on nervous and mental disorder benefits under the service benefit plan and the indemnity benefit plan shall be exceeded on a case-by-case basis to the extent determined necessary and appropriate by an established peer review mechanism. Requires a specified percentage of such catastrophic benefits to be paid out of the Employees Health Benefits Fund. Earmarks for such payments whatever funds remain from one percent of all contributions to the Fund after deducting the expenses of administering the Federal employees health benefits program."
