    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 98-1093) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atmospheric and Oceanic Research and Services Act of 1984 - Title I: Declaration of Findings and Purposes - Sets forth the findings and purposes of Congress concerning the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Title II: General Program Authorization - Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Commerce to enable NOAA, for FY 1984 and 1985, to carry out: (1) atmospheric and hydrological research and service functions and duties; and (2) satellite and environmental data and information services duties. Directs the Administrator of NOAA to make the NOAA-D spacecraft available for the Navy Remote Ocean Sensing System. Directs the Secretary of the Navy to provide the Administrator with access to the civil data produced by the System. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Commerce to enable NOAA, for FY 1984 through 1986, to carry out: (1) oceanic research and services duties, mapping, charting, and geodesy; and (2) executive direction and administration, marine services, and aircraft services. Prohibits the transfer of funds among categories in excess of ten percent unless Congress has been given 30 days written notice. Prohibits the use of funds for either a request for proposals, or to award any contract, for the performance of any functions or activities currently performed by NOAA employees without 30 days written notice to Congress, complete with reasons and supporting materials. Title III: Reporting Requirements - Directs the Administrator to keep all appropriate committees informed of the atmospheric and oceanic research and services activities of NOAA. Directs the Administrator to submit to Congress and the President with the FY 1986 budget request a report on the importance of meteorological satellites to weather forecasting, including lifetimes and replacement times for NOAA weather satellites. Earmarks funds for the continuation of a civil land remote sensing satellite system if no alternative is implemented. Directs the Secretary, through NOAA, to enter into an agreement with the National Research Council of the Academies of Science and Engineering to conduct a study of the National Weather Service and related activities. Requires the Administrator to report to Congress within six months on NOAA's efforts to negotiate such study. Requires that a final report be made to Congress within two years. Authorizes appropriations for such study for FY 1984 and 1985. Title IV: National Climate Program - National Climate Program Amendments of 1984 - Amends the National Climate Program Act to direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish and maintain an interagency Climate Program Policy Board (Board) to coordinate planning, review all executive branch budget requests relating to climate, and establish other groups as necessary. Establishes the position of Director to head the National Climate Program Office, represent the Board, and be the spokesperson for the program. Requires the Office to analyze agency budget requests, coordinate interagency participation in international climate-related activities, and work with the National Academy of Sciences and other groups in preparing and implementing the five-year climate plan. Permits the Office to provide financial assistance for activities needed to meet the goals of the program set forth in such plan. Expands the mechanisms for intergovernmental climate-related studies and services under the program. Requires that the plan be revised and extended not more than biennially but not less than quadrennially. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 and 1985. Requires that at least 25 percent of such authorizations be made available each fiscal year for intergovernmental climate-related activities and at least 20 percent for experimental climate forecast centers. Title V: Selected Ocean and Coastal Authorizations - Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to consolidate various reporting requirements into an annual report to Congress due each March. Includes within National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) long-term research activities: (1) techniques to define and quantify marine environment degradation; (2) assessment of marine adaptability; (3) continuation of ongoing monitoring programs; and (4) dumping improvements. Requires the Environmental Protection Agency: (1) in cooperation with Federal, State, and local agencies to study comprehensive regional waste management plans; and (2) in cooperation with NOAA, to report to Congress within one year on sewage sludge disposal options in the New York area. Authorizes FY 1984 and 1985 authorizations, including amounts for such New York Study. Amends the National Ocean Pollution Planning Act of 1978 to: (1) authorize appropriations for FY 1984 and 1985 to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to carry out such Act; and (2) provide for the coordination of research on the environmental quality of the Great Lakes. Title VI: Miscellaneous - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984-1986 for weather modification reporting activities. Authorizes appropriations for increases in salary and employee benefits for NOAA. Establishes criteria and procedures the Secretary of Commerce must follow before closing or consolidating a Weather Service Office or Weather Service Forecast Office, including a sixty-day public comment period."
