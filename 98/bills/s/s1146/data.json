Rept. 98-1085) Aviation Drug-Trafficking Control Act - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to revoke the airman certificate of any person who has been convicted of violations of State or Federal law relating to controlled substances (other than simple possession). Requires the Administrator to revoke the airman certificate of any person who has knowingly transported any controlled substance, where such transportation is prohibited. Prohibits the Administrator from reissuing any revoked certificate for a period of five years. Grants the Secretary discretionary authority to reissue such certificate in certain circumstances before the end of a five-year period, but not before the end of the first year after revocation. Requires the Administrator to revoke the certificate of registration of an owner of an aircraft if it is determined that such aircraft has been used to transport controlled substances illegally. Sets forth certificate reissuance guidelines similar to those for the reissuance of airman certificates. Provides criminal penalties for violations of this Act, including selling or using fraudulent certificates."
