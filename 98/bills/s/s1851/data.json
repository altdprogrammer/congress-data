Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in New Hampshire and Maine shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in New Hampshire and Maine which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in New Hampshire and Maine reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in New Hampshire and Maine without express congressional authorization."
