    "text": "Declares that it is the intent of Congress to provide for limited exceptions to the requirements of the use of U.S.-built hulls for fishing and coastwise transportation of fisheries products in Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands and of U.S. citizenship for the documentation and operation of vessels. Provides that any vessel of at least five net tons that is not registered under the laws of a foreign country is eligible for documentation under this Act if it is owned by: (1) an individual who is a citizen or national of the United States domiciled in Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands or a citizen of the Northern Mariana Islands; (2) an entity capable of holding title to a vessel under the laws of the United States or of Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands, all the members of which are citizens or nationals of such locations; (3) a partnership whose general partners are citizens or nationals of such locations and the controlling interest in the partnership is owned by citizens or national of such locations; (4) a corporation created under the laws of the United States, Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands if certain conditions are met; or (5) the government of Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands. Entitles foreign-built vessels documented under this Act to engage in: (1) fishing within the territorial sea and fishery conservation zone adjacent to Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands in accordance with applicable U.S. laws; and (2) coastwise trade of fisheries products in and among Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Deems nationals of the United States domiciled in Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands, and citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands to be citizens of the United States for all citizenship requirements related to the operation of vessels documented under this Act while the vessel is engaged in permitted activities. Declares that upon the effective date of the termination of the Trusteeship Agreement over the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands with respect to the Northern Mariana Islands all references to the Northern Mariana Islands contained in this Act shall cease to be effective. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be deemed to render applicable to the Northern Mariana Islands the coastwise laws of the United States or any prohibition in the laws of the United States against foreign vessels landing fish or unfinished fish products in the United States."
