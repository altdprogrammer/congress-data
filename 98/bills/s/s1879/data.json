Increases the number of pounds of household goods and personal effects which Federal agencies are authorized to pay for moving in connection with the transfer or reassignment of an employee. Eliminates the 20 cents per mile limitation on the transportation allowance to which an eligible employee is entitled for transportation of a house trailer or mobile dwelling. Requires that Federal regulations relating to moving expenses for Federal employees shall provide that the reassignment or transfer of an employee for permanent duty outside the employee's commuting area shall take effect only after the employee has been given a reasonable period of advance notice. Provides for payment of living expenses to such Federal employees for 60 (currently 30) days while they are occupying temporary quarters. Permits extending such payments for an additional 60 days if the head of the agency concerned determines that there are compelling reasons for the continued occupancy of temporary quarters. Limits reimbursement in connection with the sale of an employee's residence to 10 percent of the sale price or $15,000 whichever is less. Limits reimbursement in connection with the purchase of a new residence to 5 percent of the purchase price or $7,500 whichever is less. Links increases in such amounts to the Consumer Price Index. Provides for reimbursement of: (1) Federal, State, and city income taxes incurred by an employee for moving or storage expenses; and (2) income taxes incurred due to the reimbursement of such taxes."
