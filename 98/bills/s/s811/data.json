    "text": "Health Care for Displaced Workers Act of 1983 - Establishes a State block grant program to provide unemployed workers and their families with health care benefits directly or through insurance or otherwise. Defines \"eligible unemployed worker\" as a person who: (1) is entitled to regular, extended, or Federal supplemental compensation; (2) has exhausted such benefits within the past 12 months, and is still unemployed; and (3) was a participant in an employer-supported group health plan. Creates a 52- week eligibility period (after workers' compensation eligibility has been exhausted). Bases a State's allocation upon its figures (as compared to national figures) of unemployed, excess unemployed (in excess of six percent), and persons unemployed for 15 weeks or more. Sets forth State application requirements and nondiscrimination provisions. Requires withholding of funds, after notice and hearing opportunity, for noncompliance. Requires the Secretary to conduct fund use investigations in several States annually. Authorizes the Comptroller General to conduct fund use investigations. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1986."
