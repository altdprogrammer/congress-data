Prohibits sending U.S. armed forces into such countries for training exercises or any other purpose until: (1) Congress has authorized their presence in advance by a joint resolution signed by the President; or (2) the presence of such forces is necessary to provide for the immediate evacuation of U.S. citizens, or to respond to a clear and present danger of military attack on the United States. Declares that, in either case, the President should advise and, to the extent possible, consult in advance with the Congress."
