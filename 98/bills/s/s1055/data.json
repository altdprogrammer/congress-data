    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-04-14", 
    "text": "Mathematics and Science Block Grant Act - Amends the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 to establish a new block grant program for the improvement of education in mathematics and science. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1987. Sets forth provisions for allotment of such funds to States based on school-age populations. Sets a minimum State allotment. Reserves a specified amount for U.S. territories and possessions. Provides that up to 50 percent of each State's allotment shall be available to the State agency for higher education for specified authorized activities. Requires the State educational agency (SEA) to reserve from the remainder at least 15 percent of the State's allotment for specified authorized programs and activities to be conducted at the State level. Directs the SEA to distribute the remainder of the State's allotment to local educational agencies (LEAs) according to the relative enrollments in public and nonpublic schools within the school districts of such LEAs, adjusted in accordance with criteria approved by the Secretary, to provide higher per pupil allocations to LEAs which have the greatest numbers or percentages of children whose education imposes a higher than average cost per child (such as children: (1) from low-income families; (2) in economically depressed areas; or (3) in sparsely populated areas). Sets forth authorized programs and activities for which each SEA and LEA may use funds under this Act. Includes among such authorized activities special projects for: (1) in-service training and retraining of elementary and secondary school teachers of mathematics, science, and computer science; (2) summer institutes in such fields for elementary and secondary school students; and (3) making science an integral part of the elementary and secondary school curricula. Includes, also, among such authorized activities a secondary school industry partnership exchange program involving: (1) exchange of roles by secondary school teachers of mathematics, science, or computer science and personnel of local businesses; and (2) training and retraining of secondary school teachers in such fields under cooperative arrangements between SEAs or LEAs and appropriate businesses. Includes, also, among such authorized activities projects designed to: (1) identify gifted and talented students in the fields of mathematics, science, and computer science; (2) provide summer institutes and career assistance for such students; and (3) provide training and retraining for their secondary school teachers. Sets forth authorized uses of funds under this Act by State agencies for higher education. Includes among such authorized uses: (1) a State program for awarding scholarships to students for the third and fourth years of undergraduate study at institutions of higher education in the State, to enable such students to qualify to teach mathematics and science in secondary schools in the State; and (2) grants to institutions of higher education in the State for demonstration centers for mathematics and science education designed to furnish technical assistance to educational agencies in mathematics, science, and computer science, train and retrain elementary and secondary school teachers of mathematics and science (including computer-aided instruction), and develop tests and curriculum materials for elementary, secondary, and continuing education. Sets forth requirements for State, local, and institutional applications for funds under this Act."
