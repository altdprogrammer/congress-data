    "text": "Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act of 1984 - Title I: Special Supplemental Food Program - Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to require that when special supplemental food benefits are issued for part of a month, the monthly food package must be reduced accordingly. Declares that a pregnant woman shall be considered two individuals for purposes of income eligibility standards. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to report biennially to Congress on the income and nutritional risk characteristics of program participants. Revises the requirements for State plans of operation and administration. Requires State agencies to establish procedures to obtain public comment on the development of the State plans. (Currently, public hearings are required.) Extends the time after application to the program that State agencies must notify persons of their eligibility from 20 days to 30 days. Eliminates the requirement for State agencies to publicize at least once annually the availability of program benefits. Provides for coordination of the child care food programs under this Act and the National School Lunch Act. Requires State agencies to seek repayment in cash from families who have received benefits as a result of fraud or intentional misrepresentation. Increases authorized appropriations for FY 1984 and authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1988 for the special supplemental food program. Authorizes the Secretary to use specified funds to provide technical assistance to improve State agency administrative systems. Directs the Secretary to keep to a minimum required State paperwork with respect to nutrition education funds. Limits to two percent of a State's allocation the amount of supplemental food funds that may be expended for expenses incurred in the prior fiscal year for such foods. Eliminates the annual report to Congress on migrant participation in the special supplemental food program. Title II: Other Child Nutrition Programs - Amends the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 to extend from two to five years the authority under the commodity supplemental food program to operate two pilot projects directed at low-income elderly persons. Permits local agencies administering such program to provide supplemental commodities to low-income elderly persons in a manner that does not interfere with commodity assistance to women, infants, and children. Extends program authority through FY 1988. Amends the National School Lunch Act to extend the authorization of appropriations from FY 1984 through 1988 for: (1) the summer food service program for children; and (2) the commodity distribution program. Amends the Child Nutrition Act to extend the authorization of appropriations from FY 1984 through 1988 for State administrative expenses. Extends and increases, from FY 1984 to 1988, the authorized appropriations for nutrition education and information programs. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to study the feasibility of making the school lunch program a universal program for all children in the United States, and various methods of operating a self-financing school lunch program. Requires the Secretary to submit the results of such study to Congress not later than January 1, 1987. Title III: Technical Corrections - Makes technical corrections to the National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. Title IV: Effective Dates - Provides for the effective dates of provisions of this Act."
