    "text": "1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism - Title I: Rewards for Information on International Terrorism - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide a reward not to exceed $500,000 to any individual who furnishes information regarding an act of terrorism directed against a U.S. person or U.S. property. Authorizes the Attorney General or the Secretary of State to determine whether an individual is entitled to a reward and the amount to be paid. States that a reward of $100,000 or more may not be made without the approval of the President. Allows for the protection of the identity of a reward recipient if it is determined that such measures are necessary. Authorizes appropriations. Makes Federal, State and local officers and employees ineligible for such payments. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to authorize the Secretary of State to pay such a reward. Title II: International Cooperation - Urges the President to seek more effective international cooperation in combatting international terrorism, including: (1) severe punishment for acts of terrorism; and (2) extradition of all terrorists to the country where the terrorist incident occurred or whose citizens were victims of the incident. Declares that priority should be given to negotiations to establish a permanent international working group for combatting terrorism. Title III: Security of United States Missions Abroad - Requires the Secretary of State to report to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives no later than February 1, 1985, on the findings and recommendations of the Advisory Panel on Security of United States Missions Abroad. Authorizes additional appropriations for security enhancement at United States missions abroad. Requires the Secretary of State and the Director of the United States Information Agency to report to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives on how their agencies have allocated funds. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 with regard to hiring additional individuals for services abroad. Allows for additional procurement for overseas security requirements. Authorizes the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State to use government-owned vehicles for security purposes. Expresses the sense of the Congress that due to the current epidemic of worldwide terrorist activity, U.S. missions abroad should utilize danger pay allowance more extensively."
