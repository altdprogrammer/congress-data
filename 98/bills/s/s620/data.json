    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire property within the Gran Marais, Michigan, and Munising, Michigan, corporate limits lying outside the boundary of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in Michigan for the purpose of providing visitor information and administrative centers for the lakeshore. Prohibits the Secretary from acquiring by condemnation any property used in a manner consistent with zoning regulations adopted by local zoning authorities pursuant to this Act with respect to the inland buffer zone of the lakeshore. Defines the term \"improved property\" for purposes of such prohibition as any one-family dwelling on which construction was begun before September 1, 1982, together with the land in the same ownership as the dwelling. (Under current law, the term \"improved property\" means any one-family dwelling on which construction was begun before December 31, 1964, together with the land in the same ownership as the dwelling.) Permits local zoning authorities with jurisdiction over the inland buffer zone of the lakeshore to develop a land use plan and zoning regulations for the management of such zone. Requires the land use plan to: (1) define land uses to stabilize and protect the land and waters within the zone; (2) establish standards to encourage private development and operation of visitor facilities; (3) provide for resource management; (4) maintain and improve access roads to the lakeshore; and (5) provide for the establishment of standards for improved residential properties and other land uses. Requires that the zoning regulations provide for the continuance of land uses which existed before September 1, 1982, and be consistent with existing State and local zoning laws. Sets forth the procedural requirements for approval of the land use plan and the zoning regulations by the Secretary and their adoption by the local zoning authorities. Requires the Secretary, before initiating condemnation proceedings against such property, to request the appropriate local zoning body to remedy any land use in the inland buffer zone which is inconsistent with the zoning regulations adopted pursuant to this Act. Increases the authorization of appropriations for the development of the lakeshore. Authorizes appropriations for up to five years, beginning in FY 1984, for the maintenance and improvement of primary access roads within the boundary of the lakeshore."
