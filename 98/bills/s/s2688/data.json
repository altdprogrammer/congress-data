(Current law requires that the reports be submitted to the President for transmittal to Congress on June 15 of each year). Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) study issues relating to the transportation of methanol through the interstate liquid pipeline system and make recommendations for the safe and efficient transportation of methanol through such pipeline, and report the results of the study to Congress; and (2) study the feasibility of and costs connected with requiring various methods of testing and inspecting hazardous liquid pipeline facilities subject to provisions of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 and to report the results to Congress. Directs the Secretary to: (1) make recommendations, based on the study undertaken under clause (2) of the previous sentence and on consultation between the Secretary and the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee, as to the frequency and type of testing and inspection of pipeline facilities which should be required; and (2) report the recommendations to Congress. Requires any person owning or operating interstate transmission facilities, within 180 days of the enactment of this Act, to submit a report to the Secretary which: (1) identifies the location and condition of all pipeline facilities owned or operated by such owner or operator whose construction was completed before January 1, 1940; and (2) includes the most recent leak survey information compiled by such owner or operator with respect to such pipelines. Directs the Secretary, within 90 days after the expiration of such 180 day period, to: (1) inspect such pipeline facilities; and (2) identify any pipeline facilities which may be hazardous to life and property. Directs the Secretary, within 120 days after the expiration of such 180 day period, to report to Congress on: (1) any actions taken with respect to pipeline facilities identified as hazardous; and (2) the recommendations of the Secretary for any additional action considered necessary with respect to pipeline facilities completed before January 1, 1940. Prohibits the Secretary, in conducting training activities for State or local government personnel in the enforcement of regulations issued under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 or the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, from assessing any charge or tuition fee."
