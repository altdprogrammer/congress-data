Directs the Secretary to review each State's compliance with national bridge inspection standards and to revise such standards to decrease the maximum time lapse between inspections. Declares that the Secretary, by January 1, 1984, shall implement a plan of action designed to achieve full compliance by State and local governments with national bridge inspection standards. Directs the Secretary to inventory all bridges maintained by Federal agencies. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the administrative actions taken under this Act."
