    "text": "Unfair Trade Remedies Simplification Act - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to allow petitioners to elect a \"fast track\" procedure when filing a petition with the Department of Commerce (the Department) in antidumping and countervailing duties cases. Eliminates preliminary determinations by the International Trade Commission (ITC) and the Department in such cases and provides a timetable within which determinations under the fast track procedure must be made. Establishes within the Department the Small Business International Trade Advocate Office (Advocate) which shall assist small businesses in the preparation for, and participation in, any proceedings related to the administration of the U.S. trade laws (including arguing on behalf of petitioners who are financially unable to prosecute antidumping and countervailing duties investigations). Provides that the Advocate may request the ITC to conduct on behalf of small businesses no more than three fact-finding investigations in a given fiscal year. Requires the Advocate each fiscal year to report its activities to the specified congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations. Eliminates the judicial review of antidumping and countervailing duties cases by the U.S. Court of International Trade. Provides such review by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit."
