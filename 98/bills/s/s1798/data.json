    "text": "Federal Motor Vehicle Expenditure Control Act of 1983 - Directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to: (1) direct the head of each executive agency to designate one person from the agency to establish and operate a central monitoring system for the oversight of agency motor vehicle operations and related activities; (2) require the head of each executive agency to develop a system to collect and analyze all costs incurred by the agency with respect to motor vehicles used by the agency; and (3) promulgate standards governing the establishment and operation by executive agencies of such system. Directs the head of each executive agency to include with its requests for each fiscal year a statement containing specified information concerning motor vehicle acquisition, leasing, operating, maintenance, and disposal costs. Requires such statement to explain: (1) why the agency's motor vehicle requirements cannot be met through the Interagency Motor Pool System operated by the Administrator of General Services; or (2) how such requirements could be met through a qualified contractor in the private sector. Directs the President to report to Congress with a summary and analysis of such statements. Directs the Director and Administrator of General Services to direct the heads of executive agencies to consolidate motor vehicle administration and maintenance facilities if consolidation would be cost effective. Directs the Administrator to take such actions as necessary to reduce motor vehicle storage and disposal costs. Provides that of the total amount of budget authority provided for FY 1985 that would otherwise be available for the operation, maintenance, leasing, and acquisition of nontactical, nonlaw enforcement motor vehicles, $100,000,000 of the amount intended for such purposes in the President's FY 1985 budget shall not be made available. Directs the Director to report to the appropriate House and Senate committees with respect to the implementation of the requirement of the preceding sentence. Requires reports to Congress from the Director, the Administrator, and the U.S. Comptroller General with respect to the implementation of this Act."
