    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended(Inserted Text of Title III of S. 675 as passed Senate)) Department of Energy National Security and Military Applications of Nuclear Energy Authorization Act, 1984 - Title I: National Security Programs, Fiscal Year 1983 - Authorizes appropriations for the Department of Energy for FY 1983 for plant and capital equipment and operating expenses in carrying out national security programs concerning the military applications of nuclear energy in the following areas: (1) naval reactors development; (2) weapons activities; (3) verification and control technology; (4) materials production; (5) defense waste and byproducts management; (6) nuclear safeguards and security; and (7) security investigations. Authorizes the Secretary to expend funds on the 155-millimeter artillery-fired atomic projectile (AFAP) production facilities if the President certifies to Congress that such project is essential to national security. Title II: National Security Programs, Fiscal Year 1984 - Authorizes appropriations for the Department of Energy for FY 1984 for plant and capital equipment and operating expenses in carrying out national security programs concerning the military applications of nuclear energy in the following areas: (1) naval reactors development; (2) weapons activities; (3) verification and control technology; (4) materials production; (5) defense waste and byproducts management; (6) nuclear safeguards and security; and (7) security investigations. Title III: General Provisions - Prohibits the use of funds authorized under this Act where the costs of the program exceed 105 percent of the program authorization or the costs exceed by more than $10,000,000 the amount authorized by this Act, whichever is the lesser. Prohibits the use of funds authorized by this Act for programs which have not been presented to, or requested of Congress, unless 30 calendar days have elapsed since the Secretary of the Energy has presented to all the appropriate congressional committees a full and complete statement of the action proposed. Allows the written waiver of such requirement where such waiver is approved in writing by each appropriate committee of Congress. Authorizes the Secretary to start any general plant project only if the maximum estimated cost of such project does not exceed $1,000,000. Sets forth procedures for approval of projects that exceed the 25 percent estimated cost provision, and exempts from such procedures any project which has an estimated cost of less than $5,000,000. Allows the transfer of funds from specified projects to other Government agencies for the performance of work for which the appropriation is made. Authorizes the Secretary to perform construction design services for construction projects in support of national security programs as appropriated under this Act. Directs the Secretary to give at least 30 days notice to the appropriate committees of Congress of specific cost overruns. Authorizes funds for emergency construction design and pay increases. Directs the Secretary to terminate the use of seepage basins associated with fuel fabrication within 24 months. Directs the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees by January 1, 1984 on a plan to protect the goundwater at the Savannah River Plant, including: (1) methods for discontinuing the use of seepage basins; (2) actions to mitigate the damage of chemical contaminates; and (3) an expanded monitoring program involving the appropriate South Carolina agencies. Makes the United States ultimately liable under any civil action brought against a contractor carrying out the United States atomic weapons testing program for injury to person or property due to exposure to radiation based on acts or omissions by such contractor. Requires a sued contractor to submit all processes served to the Attorney General. Sets forth other procedural matters concerning such suits. Repeals all authorizations and prohibits the expenditure of any funds for the 155-millimeter artillery-fired atomic projectile (AFAP) production facilities. Directs the Secretary to implement mitigating measures reducing the thermal impact of heated water discharge from the L-Reactor at the Savannah River Plant, Aiken, South Carolina, before such reactor may be restarted. Permits a delay in such implementation and a restart of the reactor if necessary to the national security interests of the United States, but requires compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act by December 31, 1987 at the latest. Directs the President to provide the appropriate congressional committees, congressional delegations of Georgia and South Carolina, and the Governors of these States with five days notice of any justification for determining that national security interests require the earlier restarting of the reactor. Directs the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees by the start of FY 1984 on plans to implement the required measures."
