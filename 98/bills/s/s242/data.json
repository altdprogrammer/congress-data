    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1983-07-14", 
    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Labor and Human Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 98-181) Employment Opportunities Act of 1983 - Title I: Employment Impact of Federal Programs - Directs the Secretary of Labor to maintain a continuing capacity to estimate the employment impact of Federal programs, including programs of financial assistance. Requires that such estimates include both direct and indirect effects of Federal expenditures. Title II: Dislocated Workers - Designates as a dislocated worker any individual who: (1) has at least 20 quarters of coverage under title II of the Social Security Act; and (2) has exhausted all rights to regular compensation under State unemployment compensation law in the individual's most recent benefit year. Directs the Secretary of Labor to provide for issuance of documentation to individuals identified as dislocated workers. Allows documented dislocated workers to withdraw contributions to, and interest on, an individual retirement account without incurring the tax penalty under the Internal Revenue Code. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to direct the Secretary of Education to disregard, in any case in which a student is a certified dislocated worker (under this Act or title III of the Job Training Partnership Act), all equity in a single place of residence and the amount of unemployment benefits, for purposes of computation of assets and income for the proposed family contribution schedule for determination of Pell grants. Authorizes appropriations to cover such additional entitlements, but prohibits payment of such entitlements unless funds are provided for in an appropriation Act. Amends HEA to provide that, in the case of any such identified dislocated worker, determinations of need for purposes of the Guaranteed Student Loan program shall be based on current income. Authorizes the Private Industry Council in every service delivery area (SDA) established under the Job Training Partnership Act to provide information on training opportunities in the SDA to all individuals seeking training and, retraining. Excludes funds used for such purposes from specified cost limitations under such Act. Title III: Procurement Targeting in Labor Surplus Areas - Directs the head of each Federal agency which procures supplies and equipment at a rate in excess of $1,000,000,000 in FY 1982 to set targets, in each fiscal year, for such procurement within labor surplus areas, as defined by the Secretary of Labor. Directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to report to specified congressional committees on: (1) the amount and percentage of contracts awarded by each Federal agency in labor surplus areas; (2) the impact of such contracts on the area unemployment rate; and (3) whether such contracts could be increased without adverse impact on Federal procurement. Title IV: Defense Procurement Training Demonstration Projects - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to establish and carry out demonstration projects to provide training in skilled occupations related to defense procurement in which there are substantial shortages of workers. Directs the Secretary of Labor to develop and publish a list of skilled occupations with substantial shortgages. Directs the Secretary of Defense to then select from that list occupations which will have an adverse impact on defense procurement if the shortage is not reduced. Requires the Secretary of Defense to carry out demonstration projects in connection with selected defense procurement contracts, requiring the contractors to provide training in the shortage area. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress within two and one-half years on the demonstration projects. Amends the Defense Industrial Reserve Act to authorize the Secretary to donate surplus machine tools and related equipment to specified educational institutions or training schools having loan agreements on such property if it is no longer needed by the Department. Title V: Health Benefits for Unemployed Workers - Health Benefits for Unemployed Workers Act of 1983 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require employer-provided group health plans (with 25 or fewer employees) to provide coverage availability to involuntarily unemployed worker: (1) for 90 days at the same rate as during such person's period of employment; and (2) for an additional 90 days at such person's total expense. Requires such plans to permit working employees to elect health insurance coverage within 30 days after an unemployed spouse's coverage loss. Makes such provisions effective as of January 1, 1984. Establishes State block grants for unemployed workers' health care benefits. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 through FY 1985. Makes such authorizations contingent upon enactment of specified revenue increases. Requires States to use such funds for preventive health services and pregnancy, prenatal, and post-partum services. Authorizes other services as the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines. States that eligible persons are previously employed persons (and family members) who have been unemployed for at least 26 weeks and are no longer receiving unemployment insurance or eligible for health care under a spouse's plan or other public or private group health plan. Permits States to provide health care directly or through insurance or otherwise. Allocates funds according to specified categories of unemployed persons in a State. Sets forth State application requirements. Title VI: Home and Community Based Services for the Elderly and Disabled - Home and Community Based Services for the Elderly and the Disabled Act of 1983 - Amends title XIX (Block Grants) of the Public Health Service Act to authorize a block grant program for home and community based services. Authorizes appropriations for: (1) FY 1985 for program planning and implementation; and (2) FY 1986 through FY 1988 for program services. Allots a State's funds on the basis of its elderly population compared to such national population. Makes Indian tribes or tribal organizations eligible grant recipients. States that grants may be used to: (1) coordinate existing services and maximize the use of funds under this Act; (2) develop means to identify elderly and disabled individuals who are at risk of institutionalization or who could be deinstitutionalized if home and community based services were available; (3) develop cost-effective services; and (4) provide specified medical and related social, occupational, educational and supportive services. Permits the Secretary to provide States with planning and operating technical assistance. Prohibits funds from being used for: (1) inpatient services; (2) cash payments to intended recipients; (3) land purchases or construction; (4) purchases of major medical equipment; or (5) financial aid to other than public or nonprofit entities. Sets forth State application provisions, including requirements that public hearings regarding fund distributions be held and that a State agency will be established or designated to administer such funds and programs."
