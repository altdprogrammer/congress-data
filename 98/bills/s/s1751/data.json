    "text": "Age Discrimination in Employment and Apprenticeship Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to remove the existing 70-year upper age limit of the class to which the discrimination prohibitions apply, thus extending coverage to all individuals who are at least 40 years of age. Abolishes the exemption in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act for those employed in bona fide executive or high policymaking positions. Prohibits any employee benefit plan from suspending an employees benefit accrual or reducing the rate of accrual because of age. Amends the National Apprenticeship Act to direct the Secretary of Labor to assure that no apprenticeship program discriminates on the basis of age."
