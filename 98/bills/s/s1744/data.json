    "text": "Pilot Project In Educational Excellence Act - Directs the Secretary of Education, within 30 days of enactment of this Act, to notify each State education agency (SEA) of a pilot program to test the theory of the National Commission on Educational Excellence (\"the Commission\") concerning extending the school year and the length of each schoolday. Sets deadlines for notifications by SEAs and local education agencies (LEAs) to schools and for pilot program applications by schools. Directs the SEA, by a specified deadline and in consultation with the State educational excellence advisory committee, to identify appropriate schools of the types described under this Act and submit a list of such schools to the Secretary. Sets forth requirements for the composition of the State educational excellence advisory committee which is to be appointed by the chief State school officer. Directs the Secretary, from among applications submitted and in consultation with the members of the Commission (or a Commission of persons of equal competence and experience which the Secretary may appoint), to select specified types and minimum numbers of schools for the pilot program. Directs the Commission to evaluate the results of the pilot project and disseminate its findings to Congress and to the public. Guarantees each school selected, for each school year beginning in the Fall of 1984 and for each of the succeeding two years, funds in an amount equal to 35 percent of the school's operating costs during the 1983-84 term, if specified conditions are met. Directs the Secretary to transmit such payments to pilot schools by specified deadlines, with increases for each year of participation by a school. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1986 to carry out such Act, with specified amounts reserved to the Secretary for notification and selection. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 for evaluation, including appropriate testing, and for wide dissemination of the Commission's findings with respect to such pilot project. Prohibits a Federal officer or employee from: (1) having any control over any school selected for such pilot project; or (2) when acting in official capacity, requiring, recommending, suggesting, or otherwise indicating any policy, or practice as appropriate for any such pilot school."
