    "text": "Alien Education Assistance Act - Title I: General Provisions - Defines \"alien children\" as aliens to whom State or local educational agencies (SEAs or LEAs) provide educational services, including Cuban and Haitian refugee children (as defined under the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980). Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1986 for payments to which SEAs are entitled under this Act and payments for State administrative costs. Reserves up to one percent of such funds for grants to specified territories and possessions of the United States in amounts to be determined by the Secretary of Education. Reserves up to one percent of such funds for payments for State administrative costs. Sets forth provisions relating to withholding of payments. Permits classroom facilities obtained by an LEA with assistance under specified provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to be used in any fiscal year for educational services of alien children if the number of alien children enrolled in the elementary or secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of such agency during that fiscal year is equal to at least 500 or at least five percent of the total number of students enrolled in such schools. Title II: General Assistance for Local Educational Agencies - Directs the Secretary to make payments to SEAs for FY 1984 through 1986 to assist LEAs to provide basic education for alien children. Bases the amount of such a grant to an SEA on the number of alien children in the public schools multiplied by the average per pupil exepnditure in the State, or $1,000, whichever is less. Sets forth requirements for applications by SEAs for such grants and for payments by the Secretary to SEAs having applications approved."
