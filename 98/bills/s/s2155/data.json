    "date": "1984-08-09", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Utah Wilderness Act of 1984 - Title I: Findings, Purposes, and Wilderness Designation - Sets forth congressional findings and purposes. Designates the following lands in Utah as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Mount Naomi Wilderness in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest; (2) the Wellsville Mountain Wilderness in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest; (3) the Mount Olympus Wilderness in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest; (4) the Twin Peaks Wilderness in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest; (5) the High Uintas Wilderness in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest; (6) the Mount Timpanogos Wilderness in the Uinta National Forest; (7) the Mount Nebo Wilderness in the Uinta National Forest; (8) the Dark Canyon Wilderness in the Manti-LaSal National Forest; (9) the Ashdown Gorge Wilderness in the Dixie National Forest; (10) the Box-Death Hollow Wilderness in the Dixie National Forest; (11) the Pine Valley Mountain Wilderness in the Dixie National Forest; and (12) the Deseret Peak Wilderness in the Wasatch National Forest. Abolishes the previous classifications of the Mount Timpanogos Scenic Area and the High Uintas Primitive Area. Title II: Release of Lands for Nonwilderness Uses - Sets forth the findings of Congress that: (1) the Department of Agriculture has completed the second roadless area review and evaluation program (RARE II); and (2) Congress has made its own review of national forest system roadless areas in Utah and of the environmental impacts associated with alternative allocations of such areas. Provides, on the basis of such review that: (1) the RARE II final environmental impact statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest systems lands in Utah shall not be subject to judicial review; (2) with respect to national forest system lands in Utah reviewed in RARE II and certain other lands, the review and evaluation shall be deemed for the purposes of the initial land management plans to be adequate so as to include such lands in the National Wilderness Preservation System and the Department of Agriculture shall not be required to review the wilderness option prior to the revisions of the plans, but shall review the wilderness options when the plans are revised; (3) areas in Utah reviewed in such final environmental statement and certain other lands which were not designated as wilderness upon enactment of this Act shall be managed for multiple use; (4) in the event that revised land management plans in Utah are implemented, areas not recommended for wilderness designation need not be managed so as to protect their suitability for wilderness designation prior to or during plan revisions, and areas recommended for wilderness designation shall be managed to protect their suitability for that designation; and (5) unless expressly authorized by Congress, the Department of Agriculture shall not conduct any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Utah in order to determine their suitability for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Provides that the provisions of this title shall also apply to: (1) those national forest system roadless areas in Utah which were evaluated in any unit plan or which are being managed pursuant to a multiple use plan; and (2) national forest system roadless lands in Utah of less than 5,000 acres. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Provides that the grazing of livestock in wilderness areas established by this Act, where established prior to the enactment of this Act, shall be administered in accordance with provisions of the Wilderness Act and other related provisions of law. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to review the Department of Agriculture's policies and regulations regarding livestock grazing in national forest wilderness areas in Utah in order to ensure compliance with this Act. Requires reports from the Secretary to specified committees of the House and Senate concerning grazing. States that nothing in this Act shall constitute an express or implied claim or denial on the part of the Federal Government as to an exemption from Utah water laws. Sets forth other requirements with respect to water rights. Permits limited motorized access by local municipalities. Prohibits establishing buffer zones around Utah wilderness areas. Provides for continuing mineral assessments in Utah wilderness areas. Permits the installation of certain scientific and telecommunications equipment and limited motorized access to designated Utah wilderness areas under certain conditions. Requires the Antone Bench Area and areas two, three, four, and five of the Box-Death Hollow Wilderness to be managed in accordance with the following provisions: (1) all such lands are withdrawn from appropriation under all mining laws and mineral and geothermal leasing laws, except that for five years following the enactment of this Act competitive carbon dioxide leases may be issued; (2) a carbon dioxide lease in such area shall be for ten years and for so long thereafter as carbon dioxide is produced annually in commercial quantities; and (3) exploration in the Antone Bench area shall be permitted only by helicopter and other methods which do not cause significant surface disturbance. Sets forth provisions applicable in the event development of a lease within the Antone Bench area is proposed."
