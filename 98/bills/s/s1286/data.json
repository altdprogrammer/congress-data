Rept. 98-1078) Manufacturing Sciences and Robotics Research and Development Act of 1984 - Permits the Secretary of Commerce, through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Productivity, Technology, and Innovation, to award grants and enter into contracts and cooperative agreements to provide for research on advanced manufacturing processes and methods, including: (1) computer-assisted design; (2) automated materials handling; (3) automated testing; and (4) integrated manufacturing systems. Requires grants to be made on a competitive basis. Permits the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with consortia (a group of organizations) to establish and support Centers for Manufacturing Research and Technology Utilization. Permits such Centers to conduct applied research on a matching funds basis. Authorizes appropriations for both the grants and cooperative agreements for FY 1985-1988. Establishes, at the National Bureau of Standards, the Federal Research Center on Robotics and Manufacturing to provide research and development on measurements and standards required in robotics and automated manufacturing systems. Authorizes the Secretary to support, on a matching funds basis, the training of scientists and technicians needed for the construction and use of robots and automated manufacturing systems. Authorizes appropriations for such support for FY 1985-1988. Directs the Secretary to establish a program to identify the impact on workers of enhanced utilization of technologically advanced manufacturing methods, including the potential for retraining displaced workers. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress within two years on such program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985. Directs the Secretary to: (1) select specific domestic technology-sensitive industrial sectors to analyze their long-term capability for remaining competitive; and (2) consult with and solicit comments from representatives of the industrial sector which is the subject of such study. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose for FY 1985-1988. Directs the Secretary to establish a Manufacturing Science and Technology Enhancement Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary concerning the activities to be conducted under this Act. Requires such Committee to submit to Congress an annual report."
