    "text": "Youth Employment Opportunity Act of 1983 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to permit employers, without prior or special certification by the Secretary of Labor, to pay 85 percent of the minimum wage (or the applicable wage in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) for a 180-day period to youths under the age of 20. Requires compliance with applicable child labor laws. Prohibits such special wage rate if: (1) the youth has been employed at a wage rate which is at least the minimum wage; or (2) the employer has employed the youth for at least 180 days. Authorizes the Secretary to assure compliance with requirements relating to such special wage provisions. Prohibits employers from engaging in a pattern and practice of: (1) substituting younger workers employed at less than the minimum wage for older workers employed at or above the minimum wage; or (2) terminating the employment of some youths and employing other youths in order to gain continual advantage from the youth opportunity wage. Establishes rates of compensation and fines for such violations. Repeals the amendments made by this Act, effective three years after the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to report biannually to the Congress on the effect of the amendments made by this Act, including the effect on adult and youth employment rates."
