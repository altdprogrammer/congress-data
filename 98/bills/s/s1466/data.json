    "text": "Education for Peace, Arms Control, and Conflict Resolution Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency to make grants to institutions of higher education to establish, strengthen, and operate graduate and undergraduate centers that will be national resources for academic and professional training and research in the disciplines of international affairs, in the study of international conflict, and in the techniques of conflict resolution, arms control, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. Sets forth the primary criteria the director shall apply in allocating awards to institutions. Authorizes the Director to pay stipends to persons undergoing training at such centers. Authorizes the Director to make grants to U.S. public and private nonprofit agencies and organizations whenever the Director determines that such grants will make an especially significant contribution toward developing knowledge, resources, and trained personnel for fields requiring understanding in international affairs. Authorizes the Director to: (1) conduct conferences for practitioners, policymakers, and other qualified persons to develop their skills in international peace, conflict resolution, and arms control; (2) conduct research into the causes of war and the elements of peace and into the experiences of nations in ending conflicts and resolving disputes without violence; (3) establish a method for disseminating information; and (4) develop programs to make such research and educational activities more available and useful to persons in government, private enterprise, and voluntary associations. Requires the Director to publish an annual report on all such peace, arms control, and conflict resolution programs. Prohibits using any grant awarded under this Act to: (1) support or encourage intervention in any current or pending dispute or crisis, except for Federal employees who otherwise have the authority and responsibility to do so; or (2) influence the passage or defeat of any Federal, State, or local legislation, except that recipients of such funds may testify before legislatures. Prohibits using a political test or political qualification in selecting individuals and institutions for participation in, or awarding of any grant, under this Act or for participation in any public activities conducted under authority of this Act. Requires the Director to coordinate activities under this Act: (1) with the activities conducted under the international and foreign language studies provisions of the Higher Education Act; and (2) with programs of public research, development, and other studies carried out under the Arms Control and Disarmament Act. Establishes an Advisory Board on Peace, Arms Control, and Conflict Resolution to consider the grants made under this Act and to advise the Director on specified matters. Authorizes appropriations."
