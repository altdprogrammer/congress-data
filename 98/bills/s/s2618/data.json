    "text": "Title I: Trade in Telecommunications - Telecommunications Trade Act of 1984 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize the President, during the three years following enactment of this Act, to enter into multilateral or bilateral trade agreements with foreign countries or instrumentalities which provide for the reduction or elimination of barriers to trade in telecommunications products. Authorizes the President to enter into such agreements whenever the President determines: (1) that any barriers to international trade of any foreign country or the United States unduly burden and restrict U.S. foreign trade in telecommunications products or adversely affect the U.S. economy or the imposition of such barriers is likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect; and (2) that attainment of the negotiating objectives will be promoted by entering into such agreement. Declares that the U.S. negotiating objectives shall be: (1) to obtain agreements that would provide competitive opportunities for U.S. exports of telecommunications products in foreign countries which are substantially equivalent to the competitive opportunities provided by the United States after the restructuring of the U.S. market for telecommunications; and (2) to avoid uncompensated reductions in barriers to foreign access to the U.S. market. Sets forth factors to be taken into account in pursuing such objectives. Directs the President, after not more than 90 days of consultations with the appropriate foreign countries or instrumentalities, to: (1) terminate, withdraw, or suspend all or part of any trade agreement entered into under this Act, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, or the Tariff Act of 1930 with respect to any U.S. duty or other import restriction on telecommunications products; and (2) terminate, withdraw, or suspend the obligation of the United States with respect to such duty or other import restriction. Suspends the effect of the President's action on such duty or import restriction until three years after enactment of this Act. Directs the President to consult with the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee in carrying out this title. Title II: Telecommunications Product Classification - Telecommunications Product Classification Act - Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to create a tariff classification for and impose a duty on: (1) data processing machines designed for connection with telegraphic or telephonic apparatus, instruments, or networks; (2) office machines designed for connection to such apparatus, instruments, or networks; (3) parts designed for connection to such apparatus, instruments, or networks; and (4) machines designed for connection to such apparatus, instruments, or networks. Defines the term \"entertainment broadcast band receivers\" to mean radio receivers designed principally to receive signals in the AM and FM entertainment broadcast bands whether or not capable of receiving signals on other bands. Creates a tariff classification for and imposes a duty on: (1) telephone switching apparatus (including private branch exchange and key system switching apparatus); (2) telephone sets and terminal equipment; (3) other switching apparatus; and (4) other terminal apparatus. Grants duty free treatment to communications satellites to be launched in the United States for use in a global communications satellite system and other communications satellite. Creates a tariff classification for and imposes a duty on: (1) radio receivers, other than solid-state receivers; (2) solid-state radio receivers designed for motor vehicle installation; (3) other entertainment broadcast band receivers; (4) hand-held citizens band transceivers; (5) low-power radio-telephonic transceivers operating on specified frequencies; (6) cordless handset telephones; (7) transmitters; (8) telephone answering machines; (9) radio-television-phonograph combination articles designed for connection to telegraphic or telephonic apparatus, instruments, or networks; (10) insulated electrical conductors with modular telephone connectors; (11) electrical equipment designed for connection to telegraphic or telephonic apparatus, instruments, or networks; (12) optical fiber bundles; and (13) optical fibers and optical fiber cables."
