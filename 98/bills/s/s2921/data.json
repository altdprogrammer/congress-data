    "text": "Federal Forum Equity Act - Amends the judicial code to require an administrative body to notify the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation if multiple appellate review petitions concerning the same agency action have been filed in multiple appellate courts within less than 15 days. Requires the administrative body to identify each court in which such proceedings are pending. Requires the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation to select the court in which the record shall be filed according to a statutorily prescribed system of random selection. Authorizes any court in which appellate proceedings have been instituted to postpone the effective date of the agency action until 15 days after the judicial panel has selected the court in which the record is to be filed. Requires the court in which the record has been filed upon motion by any party to transfer proceedings to another division in which the agency action would have a substantially greater impact. Requires the transferring court to consider the proportionate impact of an agency action on the affected areas instead of relying solely upon the numbers of people affected. Amends the venue provisions to provide that a cause of action shall be deemed to arise in the judicial district in which residents would be substantially affected by the agency action. Sets procedural guidelines for plaintiffs filing an action of a local regulatory nature in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Amends the change of venue provisions to provide that in actions involving a Federal agency or officer as a party, the district court shall transfer the action, upon motion by any party, to the district where it might have been brought and where the action would have a substantially greater impact upon the affected area. Specifies exceptions."
