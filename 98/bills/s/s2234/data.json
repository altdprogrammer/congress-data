    "text": "State Infrastructure Financing Act of 1984 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to make grants to States for the purpose of providing capital to State infrastructure lending institutions which are authorized to make loans to local governments and their agencies and instrumentalities for the repair or construction of bridges, roads, ports, tunnels, water delivery facilities, waste facilities, and mass transportation. Sets forth the eligibility requirements a lending institution must meet in order to receive such a grant. Declares that grant funds made available under this Act shall be only for the purpose of capitalizing State infrastructure lending institutions. Limits such grants to the lesser of $2 per resident of the State or four times the State's capital contribution to the State lending institution. Authorizes the Secretary to take appropriate action to recapture any funds made available under this Act which are used for unauthorized purposes. Requires State infrastructure lending institutions to report specified information to the Secretary annually. Authorizes appropriations."
