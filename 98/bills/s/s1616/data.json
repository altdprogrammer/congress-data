    "text": "Government-Impelled Cargo Act of 1983 - Requires that all waterborne cargo affecting the national security of the United States be transported in U.S.-flag vessels. Requires transportation in such vessels of 50 percent of cargo not affecting the national security, where the government is involved directly. Makes certain exceptions when no U.S.-flag vessel is available at competitive rates, and when a declared emergency exists. Sets forth directives for agency compliance with this Act and repeals specified laws to conform to its provisions. Establishes a similar requirement where the governments involvement is indirect, consisting of financial assistance used to pay for at least half of the cargo or for any of the foreign charges."
