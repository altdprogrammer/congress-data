    "text": "State Merit Grants Act of 1984 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to extend through FY 1987 the authorization of appropriations for the program of Grants to States for State Student Incentives. Provides for an additional authorization of appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 under such program for grants to students based on merit. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to pay a State one-third of the amount of such merit-based student grants under a State program which meets specified requirements. Requires that such State program be administered by a single State agency under specified HEA provisions. Limits each such merit-based student grant to no more than $2,000 per academic year for full-time attendance at an institution of higher education. Requires that merit-based student grant recipients be selected on the basis of criteria established by the State. Requires that, effective with respect to any academic year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, all nonprofit institutions of higher education in the State be eligible to participate in such State's program, except where such participation is in violation of a State constitution or a State statute enacted prior to such date. Requires that the payment of the non-Federal portion of such grants be from non-Federal sources including, when applicable, private resources. Sets forth auditing and reporting requirements for such State programs."
