States that, in using nonprofit voluntary agencies to distribute food commodities, the President shall consider the nutritional and developmental objectives of such agencies. Provides for an increased role of U.S. voluntary agencies in the Food for Development Program (title III). Directs the President to expand such Program through required fiscal year contract goals. Requires a report to Congress if such goals are not attained. Requires agreements under title III to provide for the use of food commodities to lessen food shortages in famine-prone countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa."
