    "text": "Wheat Improvement Act of 1984 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to reduce target prices for the 1984 and 1985 wheat crops from $4.45 per bushel to $4.38 per bushel, and from $4.65 per bushel to $4.38 per bushel, respectively. Requires wheat farmers, in order to qualify for 1984 price support assistance, to reduce their planted acreage by 30 percent under a combined (20 percent) acreage reduction and (ten percent) diversion program. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to permit such land to be devoted to hay and grazing. Sets the program sign up date at not earlier than March 30, 1984. Provides, with regard to the 1984 diversion program, for payments of not less than $3.00 per bushel, except that the Secretary may reduce such payment by up to ten percent if appropriate to meet program objectives. Requires advance payments of at least 50 percent. Sets payment-in-kind rates at not less than 85 percent of the farm program yield. Provides for 1984 wheat crop advance deficiency payments."
