Recognizes the compelling interest of each State to protect the lives of those whom the State regards as human beings, independent of the status of unborn children under the fourteenth amendment. Eliminates inferior Federal court jurisdiction to issue any order in any case involving a State or local law that: (1) protects the rights of persons between conception and birth; or (2) limits or regulates abortion or provides funding or other assistance for abortions. Declares that this shall not deprive the Supreme Court of the authority to render appropriate relief in any case."
