Authorizes an agency head to waive such notice requirement and institute a proposal temporarily when compliance with such requirement would be impracticable, if the agency head publishes notice of the temporary policy, procedure, regulation, or form in the Federal Register and provides a 60-day public comment period. Allows the agency head to issue the final policy, procedure, regulation, or form after considering the comments received."
