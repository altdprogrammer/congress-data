    "text": "Community Nursing Centers Act of 1983 - Amends titles XVIII and XIX (Medicare and Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to include coverage for community nursing center services. Defines \"community nursing center services\" as any of the following items and services furnished by a community nursing center (or through such a center) either at the center, an individual's home, or other location: (1) part-time or intermittent nursing care; (2) physical, occupational, or speech theraphy; (3) necessary supportive social services; (4) part-time or intermittent services of a home health aid; (5) medical supplies; (6) well-baby and health supervision services for infants and children; and (7) related support services. Defines a \"community nusing center\" as either a public or private free-standing center primarily engaged in providing nursing services and which meets stated requirements with respect to items and services furnished, personnel, individuals served, and record keeping. Requires a nursing plan of care to be developed for each patient. Provides for an independent review committee to provide plan reviews and utilization reviews. Directs the Secretary to designate community nursing service areas, and no more that one community service center to serve such area (unless the Secretary determines that one such center is not adequate for such area). Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct demonstration programs under which payment will be allowed for community nursing services provided to individuals requiring services for periods of less than three months. Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress concerning the cost effectiveness of community nursing center services under titles XVIII, XIX and V (Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant) of the Act."
