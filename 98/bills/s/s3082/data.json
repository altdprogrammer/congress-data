Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for such purpose. Allows an institution of higher education to use payments received under this Act in any fiscal year for such purpose. Requires the Director of the Foundation, for purposes of this Act, to prepare and publish in each fiscal year in the Federal Register a list of new technologies. Sets forth application requirements for such grants. Requires that the non-Federal share of project costs be furnished by businesses. Directs the Foundation to establish criteria for approval of applications and to adopt approval procedures designed to assure equitable distribution of such grants among the States and among types of institutions of higher education making applications. Directs the Foundation to pay a Federal share not to exceed 50 percent of project cost for each fiscal year. Allows the non-Federal share to be in cash or in kind. Limits to not more than two percent the portion of appropriations under this Act in any fiscal year which may be paid to any single institution of higher education."
