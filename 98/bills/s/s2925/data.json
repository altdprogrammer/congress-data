    "text": "Food Stamp Amendments of 1984 - Title I: References to the Food Stamp Act of 1977 - Declares that, unless otherwise stated, this Act shall amend the Food Stamp Act of 1977. Title II: Food Stamp Budgetary Revisions - Provides categorical food stamp eligibility for households in which all members receive assistance under the aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) program. Lowers the minimum food stamp program work registration age from 18 years old to 16 years old. Makes mandatory certain State program job search requirements which are currently optional. Gives a State the option of extending work requirements to currently exempt caretakers of three-year old to six-year old children. Repeals the student work requirement exemption. Establishes a nationwide community work experience program. Sets forth program provisions. Revises State agency liability provisions to make States liable for errors in excess of three percent, beginning in FY 1985. Bases sanctions on actual overissued benefits. Title III: Food Stamp Administrative Improvements Definition of Thrifty Food Plan - Changes the age range in the four-person family used in calculating the thrifty food plan. Authorizes State agencies to disqualify individuals for fraud or intentional misrepresentation without an automatic hearing. Permits the use of food stamp information provided by retail stores by State agencies administering the supplemental food program for women, infants, and children (WIC) program. Amends the definition of \"financial institution\" which may redeem food stamp coupons to include all banks or savings and loan associations (presently includes only federally-insured institutions). Provides for State agency administration of work registration and job search services. Amends the procedures regarding judicial review of retailer-wholesaler disqualifications or administrative penalties to: (1) prohibit the reduction of disqualification periods or penalty amounts; and (2) permit a stay action only if the appellant can present a strong showing that he is likely to prevail on the case's merits. Title IV: Food Stamp Technical Amendments - Deletes the income exclusions for students' reimbursements. Title V: Effective Date - States that the provisions of this Act shall be effective upon enactment, except for Title II which shall be effective October 1, 1984."
