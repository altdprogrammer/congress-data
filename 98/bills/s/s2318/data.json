    "text": "Single Parents and Homemakers Education Assistance Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to States to provide occupational education and training to single working parents and homemakers. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 to carry out this Act. Directs the Secretary to apportion one-half of one percent of such funds for each fiscal year on the basis of need among specified territories and possessions of the United States. Directs the Secretary, from the remaining funds, to make State allotments on the basis of relative populations of certain age groups. Allots 20 percent of such funds on the basis of population aged 15 through 19 and 80 percent on the basis of population aged 20 through 65. Provides for reserving a portion of the State allotment for direct assistance to Indian tribal organizations upon their request and upon the Secretary's determination that the members of the tribe would be better served by such means. Authorizes States to use grants under this Act to: (1) provide, subsidize, reimburse or pay for education and training activities, including basic literacy instruction and necessary educational materials, to furnish single parent workers and homemakers with marketable skills; and (2) make education and training more accessible to single parent workers and homemakers through child care, transportation, and program scheduling assistance. Sets forth provisions for State applications, State plans, and program requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations to carry out this Act, but prohibits the Secretary from promulgating any regulations that define or explain the purposes of the program, the criteria for eligibility for assistance, and the contents or the format of State assurances of the State plan. Directs the Secretary to make payments to States under this Act in a specified manner."
