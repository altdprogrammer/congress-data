Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Arkansas shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Arkansas which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of national forest management plans. Releases lands in Arkansas reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Arkansas without express congressional authorization. Applies these provisions to National Forest System roadless lands in Arkansas which are less than 5,000 acres. States that Congress does not intend that designation of wilderness area in Arkansas lead to the creation of buffer zones around each wilderness area."
