Requires such projects with an anticipated Federal cost exceeding $10,000,000 to be authorized by an Act of Congress. Prohibits making appropriations for certain watershed improvement projects, unless benefits directly related to agriculture account for at least 20 percent of the total benefits of the project. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Administrator of the Soil Conservation Service, to study and report to the appropriate congressional committees by April 1, 1984 on requiring full public access to all water impoundments that have recreation-related potential and that were authorized by such Act."
