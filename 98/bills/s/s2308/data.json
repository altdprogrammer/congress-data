    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Primary Health Care Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to prescribe criteria for determining the specific shortages of personal health services of an area or population group. Permits designation of underserved populations not meeting such criteria if recommended by appropriate State or local officials based on unusual local conditions. Prohibits the Secretary from designating a medically underserved population in a State, or terminating an existing designation, without prior consultation with appropriate State officials or organizations. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into memoranda of agreement with States to permit them to: (1) analyze the need for primary health services for medically underserved populations; (2) assist in planning and developing new community health centers (CHCs); (3) review CHC program plans and budgets; (4) assist CHCs in developing clinical practices and fiscal and administrative systems; and (5) share relevant information. Authorizes CHC appropriations for FY 1985 through 1988. Limits expenditures for prepaid CHC services and \"non-criteria\" medically underserved populations. Replaces the existing primary care block authority with a program of State grants for primary care research, demonstration, and services. Authorizes FY 1985 through 1988 appropriations for: (1) improving access to and delivery of primary health services for medically underserved populations; and (2) reducing costly inpatient and long-term care services, and reducing the incidence of preventable illnesses and premature death. Allocates funds on the basis of the ratio of low-income people residing in a State to the total number of low-income people in all States. Sets forth minimum State and territorial allotments. Provides for direct allotments to Indian tribes or tribal organizations. Permits the carryover of unobligated funds not in excess of 20 percent of a State's total allocation. Authorizes grants to be used for: (1) providing medically underserved populations with primary health services; (2) research and evaluations of alternative reimbursement systems, new methods of providing services and retaining health professionals, and medical cost reductions. Requires at least 80 percent of allocated funds to be used to provide primary health services. Permits the carryover of unobligated funds not in excess of 20 percent of a State's total allocation. Sets forth application provisions. Authorizes FY 1985 through 1987 appropriations for migrant health centers."
