Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Virginia shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Virginia which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Virginia reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Virginia without express congressional authorization. States that the provisions above shall also apply to national forest system roadless lands in Virginia which are less than 5,000 acres in size. Requires the Secretary to review the following lands in Virginia to determine their suitability for preservation as wilderness: (1) the Rough Mountain Wilderness Study Area in the George Washington National Forest; (2) the Rich Hole Wilderness Study Area in the George Washington National Forest; (3) the Barbours Creek Wilderness Study Area in the Jefferson National Forest; and (4) the Shawvers Run Wilderness Study Area in the Jefferson National Forest. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress within two years after enactment of this Act on the effects on air quality of the proposed industrial development site at Covington, Virginia, on the areas designated as wilderness study areas by this Act. Requires an interim report to the appropriate congressional committees. States that Congress does not intend that designation of wilderness areas in Virginia lead to the creation of buffer zones around each wilderness area."
