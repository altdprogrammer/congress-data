    "text": "War Powers Act of 1983 - Amends the War Powers Resolution to rename the resolution the War Powers Act. Authorizes U.S. armed forces, in the absence of a congressional declaration of war, to be introduced into hostilities or into a situation where the imminent introduction of such forces into hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, only: (1) to repel an attack upon the United States, to take retaliatory actions in the event of such an attack, and to forestall the direct and imminent threat of such an attack; (2) to repel an attack against U.S. armed forces located outside the United States and to forestall the direct and imminent threat of such an attack; (3) to protect U.S. citizens while evacuating them from a country where they are being subject to a direct and imminent threat to their lives either sponsored by the country's government or beyond the power of such government to control, provided the President shall make every effort to terminate the threat without using U.S. armed forces and provided that the President shall where possible obtain the consent of the government before using U.S. armed forces; or (4) pursuant to specific statutory authorization. Requires the President to report to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate whenever U.S. armed forces are introduced into hostilities or into one of the other situations listed above. Requires the President to report to Congress at least once every six months for as long as U.S. armed forces are engaged in hostilities outside the United States. Limits the length of time that U.S. armed forces may be used in hostilities or in such situations to 30 days unless Congress enacts a law providing otherwise. Permits Congress by law or joint resolution to terminate U.S. involvement before the expiration of the 30 days. Provides for expedited consideration of proposals to continue or terminate the use of U.S. armed forces in such situations. States that statutory authorization for introducing U.S. armed forces into or for sustaining their use in hostilities or situations where imminent introduction of such forces into hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances shall not be inferred from: (1) any provisions of law unless such provision specifically authorizes such introduction or use of the armed forces and states that it is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of this Act; or (2) any treaty unless the treaty is implemented by a law specifically authorizing such introduction or use of such armed forces and stating that it is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of this Act. Permits U.S. armed forces to participate jointly with members of military forces of other countries in high-level military comands that were established before enactment of this Act and pursuant to a treaty which was ratified before such enactment."
