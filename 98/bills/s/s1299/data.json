    "text": "Export Administration Improvement Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to prohibit the Secretary of Commerce from requiring an individual validated license for the export of goods or technology to destinations in countries cooperating with the United States in the establishment and maintenance of export controls if the goods or technology or like goods and technology are available from sources outside the United States. Declares that exports of goods and technology to communist countries shall be eligible for a distribution license or other bulk export license instead of an individual validated license under the national security controls provisions. Makes exports of technology and related goods, including items classified as militarily critical technologies, eligible for comprehensive operations licenses instead of individual validated licenses. Authorizes the Secretary to require a validated license or specific authorization for the export or reexport of a good or technology on the commodity control list which is not subject to international controls only after the Secretary determines that such good or technology is available in foreign countries and the President determines that such action is required by extraordinary national security circumstance. Limits the duration of such requirement to one year with a possible one year extension. Declares that an item on the list of militarily critical technologies shall become part of the commodity control list only if: (1) the Secretary of Defense finds that an item would contribute directly and significantly to the military capabilities of countries subject to national security export controls and would permit a significant advance in the military system of such country; and (2) the Secretary of Commerce finds that countries subject to national security export controls do not have another source for nor possess the item or a like item. Prohibits imposing national security export controls on a good solely because the good contains an imbedded microprocessor or microcomputer. Authorizes imposing a national security export control on a good containing a microprocessor or microcomputer when: (1) the microcomputer's or microprocessor's capabilities exceed the COCOM general exception levels established for computer devices; or (2) the functions of the good itself would make a significant contribution to the military potential of another country or countries that would be detrimental to U.S. national security. Requires the Secretary to remove the national security export control on a good or provide notice of a determination to retain the control if during the previous year all export license applications for the export of such good have been approved."
