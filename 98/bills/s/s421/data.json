Directs the Comptroller General to notify an agency and report to Congress concerning any determination of such a cost increase for a program. Prohibits any obligation or expenditure of funds on such program after an agency receives such notice unless new program authority is specifically authorized, for no longer than one year, by a subsequently enacted law. Directs the Comptroller General to implement procedures applicable to all agencies for reflecting the effects of general economic inflation on cost data."
