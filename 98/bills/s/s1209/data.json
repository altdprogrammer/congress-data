    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-05-04", 
    "text": "Child Nutrition Amendments of 1983 - Amends the National School Lunch Act to base the amount of cash or commodity assistance given for meals on the actual number of meals served during the previous school year. Permits an adjustment of the amount of assistance if there is a substantial difference between the number of lunches served in the preceding school year and the number of lunches served in the second preceding school year. Delays the inflation adjustment for reimbursement rates and commodities from July 1, 1983, to January 1, 1984 and each January 1 thereafter. Bases the adjustment on the period between the preceding May and the second preceding May of each year. Requires school food authorities to submit reimbursement claims to the State within 60 days after the claiming month. Requires States to submit claims to the Secretary of Agriculture within 90 days after the month for which reimbursement is claimed. Eliminates the two special assistance certification alternatives which base assistance on prior year free or reduced price lunch eligibility. Establishes a special-assistance factor for free lunches at 104 cents. Creates a special-assistance factor for reduced price lunches of 64 cents. Provides for an annual adjustment of the factor for reduced price lunches based on the change in the Consumer Price Index for food away from home. Terminates the following programs: (1) Summer Food Service Program for Children; (2) Child Care Food Program; (3) School Breakfast Program; and (4) Nutrition Education and Training Program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984-1988 for General Nutrition Assistance Grants to States. Directs the Secretary to allot to a State an amount bearing the same ratio to the total appropriated funds as the State's allotment under the Summer Food Service Program, the Child Care Food Program, and the School Breakfast Program for FY 1982 bore to the total funds appropriated for those programs. Permits adjustment to the allotment level based on the funds transferred to the Head Start Program. Requires the allotment of funds among the remaining States where excess funds result from a State's failure to meet certain requirements. Declares that funds unobligated by the States at the end of the fiscal year shall remain available to a State for the next fiscal year for the same purposes as originally given. Limits the use of funds to the provision of nutrition assistance to children, planning, administration, education technical assistance, evaluation and other related activities. Prohibits certain uses of such funds. Requires each State to submit an intended use report as a prerequisite to receipt of funds. Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to provide for the verification by State food stamp agencies of information contained in applications for the National School Lunch Program. Eliminates the 20 percent refusal of commodities option available to schools participating in the food service programs. Requires States to offer alternative commodities to any school which does not accept the first commodities offered."
