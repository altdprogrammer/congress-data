Part A: Vocational Rehabilitation Services - Extends the authorization of appropriations for grants to States for basic vocational rehabilitation services (other than the client assistance program) in a specified amount for FY 1984, and for FY 1985 through 1987 in amounts to be determined by increases in the consumer price index.

Provides that any additional appropriations shall be allocated in the same manner as State allotments for basic vocational rehabilitation services. Eliminates the requirement that the determination of eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services under the State grants program be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt following initial evaluation. Requires the Secretary to make grants to States to establish and carry out client assistance programs to provide assistance in informing and advising clients and client applicants of available benefits under such Act. Disallows a State from receiving such grants unless the State has in effect by a specified date a client assistance program which meets certain requirements.

Sets forth provisions, similar to those for the PWI program, for: (1) evaluation plan descriptions by applicants for independent living center grants; (2) independent living center evaluation standards, comprehensive evaluation, and report to Congress by the Commissioner; and (3) NCH approval of such evaluation standards. Title II: Reauthorization of the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youth and Adults - Helen Keller National Center Act - Repeals provisions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 relating to the Helen Keller National Center.
