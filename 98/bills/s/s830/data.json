    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-03-16", 
    "text": "National Security and Violent Crime Control Act of 1983 - Title I: Narcotics Law Enforcement - National Narcotics Act of 1983 - Establishes an Office of Director of National and International Drug Operations and Policy in the executive branch to plan and coordinate drug enforcement efforts of the Federal Government. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require the revocation of the airman certificate of any person who violates any Federal or State law relating to the transportation or distribution of controlled substances. Provides criminal penalties for the use or sale of fraudulent certificates with the intent or knowledge that such certificates will be used to violate any such laws. Establishes criminal penalties for operating an aircraft with knowledge that such aircraft is used or intended to be used to violate any such laws. Directs the Attorney General to move expeditiously to conduct negotiations to secure the cooperation of law enforcement authorities in foreign countries in order to deprive domestic criminals of use of foreign havens for proceeds of crimes. Title II: Bail, Sentencing, and Criminal, Procedure Reform - Bail Reform Act of 1983 - Repeals the Bail Reform Act of 1966 and sets forth new bail procedures. Retains execution of a money bond as a condition for pretrial release. Authorizes a judicial officer to consider the safety of any person or the community when making a pretrial release determination. Establishes as a mandatory release condition that the person not commit a Federal, State, or local crime during release. Expands the discretionary release conditions to include that the defendant: (1) maintain employment or an educational program; (2) avoid contact with an alleged victim or potential witness; (3) report to a law enforcement or pretrial service agency; (4) comply with a curfew; (5) refrain from possessing a firearm or using alcohol or narcotic drugs; (6) undergo medical treatment; (7) agree to forfeit designated property, including money, upon failure to appear; and (8) return to custody at specified hours. Prohibits a judicial officer from imposing financial conditions that result in the pretrial detention of a person. Authorizes a judicial officer to order the detention for up to ten days if a person: (1) who is presently on pretrial release for a felony under Federal, State, or local law or on probation or parole or release pending sentencing or appeal for any offense, upon a determination that such person may flee or pose a danger to any person or the community; or (2) is not a U.S. citizen or lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Requires that a detention hearing be held in any case involving: (1) a crime of violence; (2) any offense punishable by life imprisonment or death; (3) a narcotics offense punishable by at least ten years' imprisonment; (4) a serious risk of flight or obstruction of justice; or (5) any felony committed after the person has been convicted of two or more offenses for which a hearing is mandated. Authorizes a judicial officer after such a hearing to order the pretrial detention of a person upon finding that no condition will reasonably assure such person's appearance and the safety of any other person and the community. Enumerates additional factors to be considered by the judicial officer in making a release determination, including the defendant's past conduct, history of drug or alcohol abuse, criminal history, and the nature and seriousness of the danger to the community or any person and the weight of the evidence against the person. Requires the detention of a person who has appealed his conviction unless the judicial officer finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) such person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community and; and (2) the appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial. Requires the detention of a person awaiting sentencing unless the officer finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to any other person or the community. Authorizes a U.S. attorney to appeal a release order. Allows the person released to move for amendment of the conditions of release. Allows a person to file a motion for revocation or amendment of a detention order. Makes a person guilty of an offense for failing to appear after having been released. Provides increased penalties for persons charged with more serious offenses. Makes it an affirmative defense to such crime that uncontrollable circumstances prevented the person from appearing. Establishes mandatory additional penalties for commission of an offense while on pretrial release. Subjects a person who has been conditionally released and violates a condition of release to revocation of release and prosecution for contempt of court. Authorizes a surety to arrest a person charged with an offense who is released upon execution of an appearance bond with such surety. Requires such person to be delivered promptly to a judicial officer for a revocation determination. Grants new authority to law enforcement officers to arrest a person who violates pretrial release conditions. Sentencing Reform Act of 1983 - Sets forth a new sentencing structure applicable to a defendant who is found guilty of an offense under any Federal statute. Permits an individual to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment or probation and a fine, and to receive additional sanctions, including: (1) forfeiture for certain racketeering crimes and drug-related offenses; (2) an order of notice to victims of crimes in cases involving fraud or deceptive practices; or (3) an order of restitution in cases involving bodily injury or property damage. Permits an organization to receive these penalties, with the exception of imprisonment. Authorizes the imposition of a term of probation, unless specifically prohibited, for all but the most serious class of felonies. Requires as a mandatory condition of probation that a defendant not commit another crime. Enumerates 20 discretionary conditions. Sets forth a fine schedule for the categories of offenses generally at higher levels than current law. Includes higher maximums for organizational defendants. Directs the court to consider the defendant's financial status in determining the amount of a fine and the method of payment. Sets maximum terms of imprisonment for five classes of felonies (A to F), three classes of misdemeanors (A to C), and an infraction (five day maximum). Allows the court, in imposing a sentence of imprisonment for a felony or misdemeanor, to include a term of supervised release after imprisonment. Imposes maximum penalties for the \"Career Criminal\". Eliminates the parole system. Permits a defendant to petition for a sentence reduction upon a showing of extraordinary and compelling reasons. Limits this motion for defendants who are sentenced to six or more years of imprisonment. Allows the defendant or the government to file a notice of appeal in the district court for review of a final sentence. Creates the United States Sentencing Commission. Specifies factors to be considered by a sentencing court, including the guidelines and policy statements issued by the United States Sentencing Commission. Requires the court to impose a sentence within the range set forth by the Commission unless aggravating or mitigating circumstances exist that were not adequately considered by the Commission in formulating the guidelines. Requires the court to state in open court at the time of sentencing the reason for imposing a sentence at a point within the prescribed range, or the specific reason for imposing a sentence outside of such range. Eliminates the special sentencing provisions under current law for dangerous special offenders, youth offenders, and drug addicts, but provides for these categories of offenders under the proposed sentencing guidelines. Excludes capital punishment as an authorized penalty, but leaves unaffected the current death penalty and procedures for aircraft hijacking. Provides for congressional review of the operation of the sentencing system after receipt of a study by the General Accounting Office. Amends the Federal criminal code to establish a mandatory term of imprisonment whenever: (1) serious bodily injury results from the defendant's participation in the offense; or (2) the offense is a felony and the defendant was previously convicted of a Federal or State felony, unless a substantial period of time has elapsed. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Defines such offense as using a firearm to commit a felony over which the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction or carrying a firearm during such a felony involving violence. Deletes the requirement that the firearm be carried \"illegally.\" Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense from one to ten years' imprisonment to five to ten years' imprisonment for a first offender and from two to 25 years to ten years to life imprisonment for a second or subsequent offender. Extends to first offenders the directions, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence or grant probation and that the additional sentence not run concurrently with any term of imprisonment imposed for the offense itself. Makes a first offender ineligible for parole for five years and a second or subsequent offender ineligible for ten years. Expresses the sense of Congress that the executive prosecute vigorously such offenses. Violent Juvenile Offender Act of 1983 - Amends the juvenile delinquency provisions of the criminal code to lower the age to seventeen for purposes of the section. Permits a juvenile to be proceeded against in Federal district court upon certification of the Attorney General that the offense charged is a felony and that there is substantial Federal interest in the case or the offense to warrant the exercise of Federal jurisdiction. Revises the factors (including the age of the individual and the type of crime) to be considered in delinquency proceedings in district court. Revises procedures for the use of juvenile records. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Service Act to authorize the donation of surplus Federal property to a State for housing violent juvenile offenders. Federal Diversion Act of 1983 - Authorizes the preparation of a diversion program for eligible individuals charged with non-violent Federal offenses. Includes in such program, among other activities: medical, educational, vocational, social, and psychological services; corrective and preventive guidance; counseling; restitution to the victim of the offense; and uncompensated community service. Includes among the criteria for eligibility that the person has not exhibited a continuing pattern of criminal behavior. Sets forth the admissions procedure for such program. Requires a person admitted to the program to waive formally all applicable statutes of limitations and his or her right to a speedy trial. Provides that upon the expiration of the diversion period the Government shall dismiss with prejudice the indictment, information, or complaint. Authorizes the Government to resume prosecution upon finding that the person is not fulfilling his or her obligations under the plan or that new facts demonstrate that the individual is unsuitable for the program. Allows the person charged to contest such a determination. States that the district planning panel established by current law, with other individuals as the group may appoint, shall constitute a diversion advisory committee to plan for implementation and review of the diversion program. Directs the Attorney General to conduct research and report to the President, Congress, and the Judicial Conference of the United States with respect to the diversion program. Title III: Organized Crime - Directs the Attorney General to submit annually to the congressional Judiciary Committees a report on how reorganization of the Drug Enforcement Administration and narcotics and organized crime control policies of the Department of Justice will accomplish specified goals, including: (1) immobilizing at least one organized crime entity each year; (2) reducing narcotic trafficking by meeting annual goals; and (3) reducing the economic incentives for drug traffickers by forfeiting assets of major narcotics traffickers. Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties for anyone who commits or commissions a contract murder, attempted murder, or assault.
