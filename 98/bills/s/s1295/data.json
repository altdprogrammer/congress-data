Amends the Customs Procedural Reform and Simplification Act of 1978 to authorize appropriations for FY 1984 for the U.S. Customs Service. Earmarks a specified amount for the enforcement of laws relating to steel imports. Directs the Commissioner of Customs to notify the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee at least 90 days before taking any action which would: (1) result in a significant reduction in force of employees other than by means of attrition; (2) eliminate or relocate a Customs Service office; (3) eliminate a port of entry; (4) reduce the number of employees assigned to an office or port of entry. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require that a ship's manifest include the names of the shippers of merchandise on board the vessel. Requires certain information, when contained on a ship's manifest, to be available for public disclosure. Exempts such information from public disclosure if: (1) the Secretary determines that disclosure is likely to pose a threat of personal injury or property damage; or (2) the information is otherwise exempt under Federal law. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures to provide access to manifests. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize appropriations for the Office of the United States Trade Representative for FY 1984. Limits the amount that may be used for entertainment and representation expenses."
