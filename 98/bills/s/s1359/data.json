Reduces such percentage by one percent for each full $1,000 by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $10,000. Makes such credit refundable. Allows such credit to be claimed on the short tax return form. Grants tax-exempt status to organizations which provide nonresidential dependent care services to the general public for purposes of enabling individuals to maintain employment."
