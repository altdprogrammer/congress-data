    "text": "Amends the Rattlesnake National Recreation Area and Wilderness Act of 1980 to provide that if bidding rights on coal lease sales or coal lease modifications issued by the Secretary of Interior in exchange for lands in the Rattlesnake National Recreation Area or the Rattlesnake Wilderness have not been exercised within two years from the enactment of this Act (currently three years from October 19, 1980), such bidding rights may be used as a monetary credit against bonus, rental, or royalty payments paid into the Treasury and retained by the Government on Federal coal leases held by the holder of such rights. Requires the holder of such rights to pay the balance due on such payments in cash. Permits the transfer or sale of such bidding rights to another party with all the rights of the owner to the credit. Requires the Secretary to issue bidding rights to the Montana Power Company in exchange for lands owned by the Company within the Rattlesnake National Recreation Area and the Rattlesnake Wilderness."
