    "text": "Federal Witness Security Program Reform Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the Attorney General to relocate and protect witnesses and their families involved in Federal or State proceedings dealing with organized crime. Authorizes the Attorney General to take action to protect the person from bodily injury or otherwise to assure the health, safety and welfare of that person. Requires any person protected under this Act to enter into an agreement with the Attorney General. Requires the agreement to set forth such person's responsibilities, including agreement: (1) if an actual or potential witness, to provide information to all appropriate law enforcement officials and testify in all proceedings; (2) to refrain from committing any act punishable by a prison term; (3) to take all necessary steps to avoid detection by others of the facts concerning the protection provided; (4) to cooperate with all reasonable requests of government employees; (5) to regularly inform authorities of activities and address; and (6) to make an inventory of debts, fines and other financial obligations and establish a plan for the equitable disposition of such debts. Establishes a procedure for the termination of protection upon substantive breach of such agreement. Provides for service of process on a protected person and compliance with a judgment in a civil proceeding. Establishes a Victims Compensation Fund in the Treasury. Funds the trust fund, in part, with fines received from prosecution of racketeering offenses. Directs the Attorney General to promulgate guidelines for the administration of the fund. Requires all Federal agencies to cooperate with the Attorney General in carrying out this Act. Allows the Attorney General to agree with a State government to provide protection for a person."
