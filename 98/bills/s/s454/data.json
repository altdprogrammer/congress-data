Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to study and report, within the five-fiscal- year period following the submission of the final comprehensive National Acid Precipitation Assessment plan under the Energy Security Act of 1980, to the Congress and the President on acidic deposition. Sets forth required inclusions and procedures for such report. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to any State or interstate agency to develop and implement on-site methods of mitigating the harmful effects on ecosystems resulting from high acidity which may be due to acidic deposition. Limits such grants to 75 percent of project costs. Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator for the five fiscal years following the enactment date of this Act for the preparation of such report and the making of such grants."
