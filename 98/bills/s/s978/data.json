    "text": "Protect Our Wetlands and Duck Resources Act of 1983 - Title I: The Protect Our Wetlands and Duck Resources System - Establishes the Protect Our Wetlands and Duck Resources System, comprising environmentally significant wetlands of at least five acres that: (1) are undeveloped; (2) provide significant wildlife habitat, particularly for migratory birds, endangered species, or other species protected by law; (3) contribute to the production of fish, shellfish, or other aquatic organisms; or (4) contribute significantly to water quality. Excludes from the System coastal barrier areas. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to publish a map identifying System components after preparing a draft map made available for public comment and after consultation with appropriate Federal agencies, State and local officials, and private, academic, or scientific organizations. Requires the Secretary to establish regulations under which persons or entities owning wetland areas may elect to have such areas identified as components of the System. Prohibits new Federal expenditures for components of such System other than for purposes specified in this Act. Requires certification of compliance with provisions of this Act by affected Federal agencies. Title II: Financial Assistance to States for Wetlands Conservation - Authorizes the Secretary to provide to States annually, for not more than ten fiscal years, financial assistance from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for wetlands conservation. Title III: Extension of Wetlands Loan Act - Amends the Wetlands Loan Act to extend from September 30, 1983, to September 30, 1993, appropriations to promote the conservation of migratory waterfowl by the acquisition of wetlands and other essential waterfowl habitat. Eliminates provisions for the repayment of such funds. Title IV: Increases for Migratory Bird Conservation Fund - Authorizes the requirement of a migratory bird hunting and conservation stamp or a single visit permit for entry into certain units of the National Wildlife Refuge System. Increases the price of such stamps from $7.50 to $15. Title V: General Provisions - Declares that this Act is not intended to interfere with existing State laws. Authorizes appropriations."
