States that payment shall not be considered to have been made if the supplier, seller, or agent receives a payment instrument which is dishonored. Exempts cooperative association-member transactions from such provisions. States that an unpaid seller or supplier shall lose such trust benefits unless he or she: (1) gives written notice of intent to preserve such benefits to the commission dealer or agent; and (2) files such notice with the Secretary of Agriculture within specified times. Vests U.S. district courts with jurisdiction over actions to preserve a trust or to enforce a trust beneficiary's payment. Makes a failure to properly maintain a seller trust or violation of such Act."
