Declares specified lands presently owned by the United States to be held in trust for the Zuni Indian Tribe. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to exchange certain lands for other specified lands in the reservation area now owned by the State of Arizona. Authorizes either the Secretary of the Interior or the Zuni Indian Tribe to acquire certain private lands not presently owned by either the United States or the State of Arizona. Declares that upon acquisition title to such lands shall be held by the United States in trust for the Zuni Indian Tribe. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to acquire immediately the permanent right of ingress and egress to specified lands by voluntary agreement. Restricts Zuni use of such lands to religious purposes. Directs the Secretary to make certain lands available for sale to Apache County, Arizona, and to designate such land within two years after enactment of this Act. Prescribes a formula to calculate the price of such lands if Apache County agrees to use any portion of the lands for public purposes. Provides that neither the value of the interests in the conveyed lands nor any funds expended under this Act shall be used to offset any awards of judgment against the United States in favor of the Zuni Indian Tribe in specified claims pending before the United States Court of Claims. States that for Federal income tax purposes any transfer of specified private lands shall be deemed to be an involuntary conversion. Provides for the continuation of Federal payments to State or local governments on the lands exchanged with the State of Arizona."
