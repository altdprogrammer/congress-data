    "text": "Surplus Food Commodities Trade and Donation Act of 1984 - Declares that it is the policy of Congress to increase the quantities of surplus dairy products and wheat that are provided by the United States to other nations by authorizing the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to undertake additional concessional sales and foreign donation programs. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to require the CCC, to the extent the Secretary of Agriculture determines appropriate, to export dairy products and wheat acquired by the CCC through price support operations through: (1) concessional sales; (2) donation; or (3) any combination of such sales and donations. Prohibits making such exports in amounts that will reduce the amounts of commodities traditionally available through donations to domestic nonprofit feeding programs or agencies. Authorizes the CCC to: (1) export dairy products and wheat under agreements with foreign governments and humanitarian organizations; (2) enter into agreements to provide dairy products and wheat in installments over an extended period of time; (3) exchange its stocks of such commodities for similar products produced domestically that will more nearly meet the needs of importing nations; (4) finance the concessional sales and exportation of such commodities and serve as the purchaser's shipping agent; and (5) pay certain incidental costs, freight, and transportaiton charges relating to commodities furnished for donations. Requires the provision of such commodities to be coordinated with other U.S. foreign assistance programs. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to ensure that: (1) the commodities exported for donation will be used for humanitarian feeding programs that directly benefit needy persons except that the sale or barter of such commodities may be permitted; and (2) dispositions of such commodities encourage increased use of commodities and agreements avoid displacing usual marketings of such commodities by the United States or any other nation. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish three special U.S. Agricultural Trade Offices to assist in the implementation of the program of concessional sales and donation of dairy products and wheat established by this Act. Requires the offices to be maintained until September 30, 1994. Requires that one office be located in each of Manila, Philippines, Mexico City, Mexico, and Dakar, Senegal. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the effectiveness of such Offices. Authorizes appropriations."
