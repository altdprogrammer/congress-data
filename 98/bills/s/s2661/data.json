    "text": "Withdraws certain public lands in the Fort Wainwright Maneuver Area, Alaska, from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws. Reserves such lands for use by the Department of the Army as a training and weapons testing area. Apportions management responsibility for the withdrawn lands between the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior. Assigns top priority to the military use of the lands, and requires the concurrence of the Secretary of the Army before any easements, leases, or rights-of-way may be issued by the Secretary of the Interior. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, after consultation with the Secretary of the Army, to develop a land resource management and implementation program. Requires both Secretaries to enter into a memorandum of understanding to implement such plan. Reserves specified water rights in the withdrawn lands for use by the Secretary of the Army. Returns the lands to their pre-withdrawal status 25 years from the effective date of this Act unless the Secretary of the Army determines a continuing need exists for them. Sets a timetable and notification procedure for either the retention or relinquishment of the withdrawn lands. Requires the Secretary of the Army to determine the degree of contamination incurred by such lands prior to filing a notice of intention to relinquish the lands. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to refuse jurisdiction of contaminated lands proposed for relinquishment by the Secretary of the Army. Sets five-year re-assessment periods to determine the feasibility of land decontamination procedures. Identifies the delegable duties of the Secretaries of the Army and the Interior."
