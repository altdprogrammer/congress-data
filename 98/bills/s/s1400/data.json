    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1984-05-23", 
    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation with amendment, S.Rept.98-478) Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act of 1984 - Title I: Improved Identification for Motor Vehicle Parts and Components - Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to direct the Secretary of Transportation to publish a proposed initial motor vehicle theft prevention standard applicable to new motor vehicle parts and components, and new replacements for such parts and components, for certain lines of passenger cars. Provides an exemption from such standard for any line of passenger cars if the manufacturer offers an approved antitheft device as standard equipment on such cars. Directs the Secretary, by rule, to require manufacturers to provide information necessary to implement the theft prevention standard. Requires the Department of Justice to report annually to the Secretary: (1) the name of each manufacturer of motor vehicles which have been reported stolen or recovered; and (2) the numbers of such motor vehicles reported stolen or recovered, categorized by manufacturer, make, line, and model year. Directs the Secretary to publish on the fourth anniversary of the initial motor vehicle theft prevention standard a preliminary report to Congress on its effectiveness. Sets forth procedures for the Secretary to conduct further rulemaking proceedings, taking such report into account, which may result in continuance or rescission of the standard or promulgation of a subsequent standard. Prohibits such standard from imposing additional costs upon manufacturers in excess of $15 per motor vehicle, or a reasonable lesser amount per replacement part or component. Establishes a procedure by which the cost to manufacturers from such standard is indexed for each calendar year. Prohibits the initial standard from requiring the numbering or other identification of more than 14 parts for any passenger car. Sets forth numbering limitations for other types of vehicles in any subsequent standard. Provides for judicial review of the initial or subsequent standard. Sets forth methods for determining whether manufacturers are in compliance with, prohibited acts with respect to, and civil penalties for violations of the initial and any subsequent standard. Provides that information obtained under this title shall be considered confidential. Preempts any similar standard which may be in effect under State law. Grants the Secretary discretionary authority to conduct studies regarding the development of security devices and systems for motor vehicles. Requires the Secretary, not later than one year after enactment of this Act, to report to Congress on such theft prevention systems, including legislative or administrative recommendations. Title II: Antifencing Measures - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties for removing or altering any identification number of any motor vehicle or motor vehicle part required by regulation. Requires the forfeiture of any vehicle or part which has had such number removed, with specified exceptions. Applies to the seizure and forfeiture of motor vehicles and parts those provisions of law relating to the seizure and forfeiture of vessels and merchandise under the customs laws. Establishes penalties for anyone who buys, receives, possesses, or obtains control of, with intent to sell or otherwise dispose of, any motor vehicle or motor vehicle part knowing that such identification number has been removed or altered. Designates as nonmailable matter any manipulative type device which is designed or adapted to operate, circumvent, remove, or render inoperative the ignition switch or lock, or door or trunk lock of two or more motor vehicles, or any advertisement for the sale of such device. Title III: Importation and Exportation Measures - Establishes criminal and civil penalties for anyone who imports, exports, or attempts to import or export any motor vehicle, off-highway vehicle or vehicle part knowing that it has been stolen or that its identification number has been altered. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require persons who export or attempt to export a used motor vehicle or off-highway mobile equipment to present to the appropriate customs officers the vehicle and a document describing that vehicle. Authorizes customs officers to cooperate and exchange information concerning such vehicles with law enforcement or governmental authorities and organizations involved in theft prevention activities. Title IV: Reporting Requirements - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a task force to study problems relating to motor vehicle titling and controls over motor vehicle salvage which may affect the motor vehicle theft problem. Directs the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Treasury and Transportation and the Postmaster General, to report to Congress on the implementation of this Act. Title V: Bumper Standards - Requires the Secretary of Transportation to reinstate the Federal bumper standard as it existed on January 1, 1982. Declares that the Secretary is not prohibited from imposing a standard more strict than the standard to be reinstated."
