    "text": "Veterans' Administration Health-Care Program Improvements Act of 1984. Expands the definition of the Vietnam era to include service by veterans in South Vietnam during the period July 8, 1959, through August 4, 1964, (Currently law starts such period on August 5, 1964). Authorizes the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to continue to provide ancillary counseling or mental health services to family members of a veteran whose care or counseling required such family counseling for up to six months after the death of such veteran. Directs the Administrator to provide readjustment counseling to members of the armed forces currently on active duty who served on active duty during the Vietnam era or since May 7, 1975, in an area during a period of hostilities. Makes permanent the Veterans Administration's (VA) pilot program for the treatment and rehabilitation of veterans suffering from alcohol or drug abuse dependencies or disabilities in halfway houses and other community-based programs. Authorizes the Administrator to increase rates of pay for protective service employees at VA health care facilities. Modifies the due date of the Comptroller General's report on the Compliances of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget with certain statutory requirements relating to funded personnel ceilings for the VA's Department of Medicine and Surgery. Directs the Administrator to develop criteria for grants for the construction or alteration of State veterans' home facilities on other than a first-come, first-served basis. Directs the Administrator and the Secretaries of Defense and Health and Human Services to report to the Congress on alternative approaches for establishing a benefits program for non-military Federal and support organization personnel who served for at least 30 days in Vietnam during the Vietnam era."
