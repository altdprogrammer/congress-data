Amends the U.S. Code to establish a new judicial system of bankruptcy administrators to administer cases and civil proceedings arising under or related to Title ll - the bankruptcy code.

Sets five-year terms for bankruptcy administrators. Allows reappointments.

Establishes guidelines for temporary service, recall of retirees, compensation and staff accommodations and expenses. Delineates powers and duties of bankruptcy administrators and prohibits them from determining any contested matters arising under Title ll. Declares such administrators serve as officers of the court and authorizes them to appoint standing trustees, subject to circuit council approval. Details procedures to be followed under Title ll cases and proceedings. Mandates that proceedings and voluntary cases arising under Title ll be referred to a bankruptcy administrator. Entitles any party to file objections to such administrator's actions or proposals.

Title III: Technical and Conforming Amendments - Makes technical and conforming amendments to the United States Code regarding judges, magistrates, bankruptcy administrators and bankruptcy proceedings. Title IV: Transition Provisions, Effective Dates, and Severability - Establishes a transition period during which bankruptcy judges and bankruptcy courts will continue to operate. Sets a specific date for the transfer to bankruptcy administrators of all cases and proceedings pending under the Bankruptcy Act or Title ll. Authorizes the Attorney General to discontinue, during this transition period, any office of U.S. trustee, upon certification by the appropriate judicial council that the office is no longer necessary. Directs circuit executives to furnish the Director with notice of all actions taken by the judicial councils under this Act. Authorizes the Judicial Conference of the United States to issue regulations for the transfer of functions and records to the new bankruptcy administrators' system.
