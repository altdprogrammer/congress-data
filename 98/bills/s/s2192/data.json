    "text": "National Commission on the Public Lending of Books Act of 1983 - Establishes in the Library of Congress a National Commission on the Public Lending of Books. Directs the Commission to: (1) evaluate, report upon, and assess the relevance to the United States of systems, either, in operation or under consideration in foreign countries for compensating authors for the public lending of their books; and (2) study and compile data on the various types of lending of books and similar publications by libraries and other lending institutions. Directs the Commission, if it recommends the establishment of a compensation system for public lending of books or similar publications, to also: (1) consider the advantages or disadvantages of establishing such compensation by legislation and/or administrative action; (2) consider, evaluate, and identify appropriate criteria for determining the amount of compensation; (3) identify procedures for determining and paying such compensation without imposing burdensome administrative requirements on public libraries; (4) assess whether eligibility to receive compensation should be subject to specific limitations, such as the copyright status of the work or the nationality or domicile of the author; and (5) recommend whether a compensation system should be administered by an existing Government agency or by a new agency. Sets forth provisions for Commission membership. Requires that the Librarian of Congress be a Commission member. Directs the President to select the other members from authors, publishers, librarians, and the public. Authorizes the Commission to appoint a staff which shall be an administrative part of the Library of Congress and which shall be headed by an Executive Director. Authorizes the Commission to procure temporary and intermittent services. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act. Directs the Commission to submit to the President and the Congress: (1) a preliminary report, within one year after its first meeting; and (2) a final report, within two years after its first meeting, with recommendations and any proposals for legislation and/or administrative action. Authorizes the Commission to publish interim reports. Sets forth provisions for Commission hearings and meetings. Terminates the Commission, and all offices and employment under it, 60 days after the submission of its final report."
