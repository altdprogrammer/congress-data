    "text": "Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to require each insured credit union to post and maintain with the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund a refundable deposit in the amount equalling one percent of the credit union's total insured member accounts. Makes such deposit amount refundable to an insured union in the event that the insurance coverage is terminated (but not in the event of liquidation on account of insolvency). Permits a phased-in payment of the deposit requirements over a number of years. Permits the National Credit Union Association to issue regulations concerning the distribution of a liquidating Federal credit union's assets. Provides that the National Credit Union association's recovery of insurance payout in the case of a State credit union shall be the same as in the case of a Federal credit union."
