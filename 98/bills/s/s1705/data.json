    "date": "1983-07-28", 
    "text": "Fire Island National Seashore Amendments Act of 1983 - Requires the Secretary of the Interior to sell any property within the boundaries of the Fire Island National Seashore in New York which is acquired by condemnation under this Act (except for certain undeveloped tracts within the Dune District, certain beach areas, property within a specified eight-mile park area, and any property acquired before October 1, 1982, which the Secretary determines should be retained to further the purposes of this Act). Requires that the Secretary sell the property: (1) to the highest bidder; (2) at not less than fair market value; and (3) subject to covenants or restrictions to ensure that the use of the property conforms to standards protecting the national seashore and to any approved zoning ordinance to which the property is subject. Provides that money from such sales shall be available to the Secretary only for purposes of acquiring property within the seashore. Authorizes the Secretary, upon or after the commencement of any condemnation action, to apply for a temporary restraining order or injunction to prevent any use of, or construction upon, the property involved that would fail to conform to the standards protecting the seashore or that would result in undeveloped tracts in the Dune District not being maintained in their natural state. Provides for the termination of the suspension of the Secretary's authority to acquire property within the seashore boundaries by condemnation because of nonconforming variances and uses with respect to any property, including improved property but excluding undeveloped property in the Dune District, which becomes subject to such a variance or use after the enactment of this Act. (Currently, the suspension of the Secretary's authority to acquire property by condemnation because of non-conforming variances and uses is terminated with respect to any improved property which becomes subject to such a variance or use.)"
