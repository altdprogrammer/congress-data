Excludes from this tax-loss limitation those individuals, partnerships, or corporations which receive more taxable income from farm than non-farm sources in three out of the previous seven years. Provides that where the taxpayer engages in more than one trade or business of farming, all such trade or businesses shall be treated as a single trade or business."
