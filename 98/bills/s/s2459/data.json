    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended (inserted Title III of S. 2723 as postponed in Senate)) Department of Energy National Security and Military Applications of Nuclear Energy Authorization Act, 1985 - Title I: National Security Programs - Authorizes appropriations for the Department of Energy (DOE) for FY 1985 for plant and capital equipment and operating expenses in carrying out national security programs concerning the military applications of nuclear energy in the following areas: (1) naval reactors development; (2) weapons activities; (3) verification and control technology; (4) materials production; (5) defense waste and byproducts management; (6) nuclear safeguards and security; and (7) security investigations. Title II: General Provisions - Prohibits the use of funds authorized under this Act: (1) where the costs of the program exceed 105 percent of the program authorization or the costs exceed by more than $10,000,000 the amount authorized by this Act, whichever is the lesser; and (2) for programs which have not been presented to or requested of Congress, unless 30 calendar days have elapsed since the Secretary of Energy has presented to the appropriate congressional committees a full and complete statement of the action proposed. Authorizes the Secretary to start any general plant project only if the maximum estimated cost of such project does not exceed $1,000,000. Sets forth procedures for approval of projects that exceed the 25 percent estimated cost provision, and exempts from such procedures any project which has an estimated cost of less than $5,000,000. Allows the transfer of funds from specified projects to other Government agencies for the performance of work for which the appropriation is made. Authorizes the Secretary to perform construction design services for construction projects in support of national security programs as appropriated under this Act. Directs the Secretary to notify the appropriate committees of Congress within 30 days of planning and design costs in excess of $300,000. Authorizes funds for emergency construction design and pay increases. Permits funds to remain available until expended if so specified in an appropriation Act. Requires all litigation involving the atomic weapons testing program, including suits now filed against contractors who operate or operated Government-owned facilities relating to atomic energy national defense activities including weapons testing, to be maintained against the United States under the substantive and procedural requirements of the Federal Tort Claims Act. Directs the President to establish a Blue Ribbon Task Group to examine the Departments of Defense's and Energy's procedures for funding the nuclear weapons programs. Requires the President to submit to the Armed Services Committees the names and qualifications of Group members together with a plan to complete the required report. Directs the Group to report to the President and the Armed Services Committees within 180 days on ways to improve interdepartmental coordination and cost effectiveness and to make recommendations as to whether the Department of Defense should assume funding authority. Directs the President to establish within 30 days the Technical Review Group on Inertial Confinement Fusion to review the current inertial confinement fusion program of the United States and report the results to the President and Congress in interim reports, with a final report due January 1, 1986. Terminates such Group upon the submission of the final report. Continues in force the provisions of Executive Order Numbered 12344 pertaining to the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. Permits the Secretary of Energy to obligate specified funds for 155-millimeter artillery-fired, atomic projectile production facilities. Sets forth conditions for such projectile and the 8-inch atomic-fired artillery projectile, including limits as to the number and versions of such weapons which may be produced at specified times. Prohibits the Secretary from moving forward with such projectiles until the Secretary of Defense submits an implementation plan to the Armed Services Committees."
