    "date": "1984-04-06", 
    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 98-383) Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1983 - Title I: Extension of Wetlands Loan Act - Amends the Wetlands Loan Act to extend from September 30, 1983, to September 30, 1993, the authorization of appropriations for the preservation of wetlands and other waterfowl habitat. Repeals provisions which provide that such funds shall be treated as an advance and require the repayment of such funds. Title II: Revenues for Migratory Bird Conservation Fund - Increases the price of the migratory bird hunting and conservation stamp. Requires an amount equal to the amount of all import duties collected on hunting arms and ammunition to be paid into the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. Establishes in the Treasury a Wetlands Conservation Fund consisting of $75,000,000 transferred from the Land and Water Conservation Fund each fiscal year beginnning in FY 1985 through 1994. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to carry out Federal acquisitions consistent with the national wetlands priority conservation plan established under title III of this Act. Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to add migratory waterfowl areas to those wetlands that may be acquired under such Act. Authorizes appropriations from the Wetlands Conservation Fund for all such acquisitions. Title III: Financial Assistance to States for Wetlands Conservation - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide up to $50,000,000 annually from the fund to the States for wetlands conservation during the period between October 1, 1984, and September 30, 1994. Includes both acquisition of wetlands and wetlands enhancement projects in the conservation program. Requires a State in order to receive its allotment to: (1) submit a comprehensive fish and wildlife resource management plan to the Secretary which ensures the perpetuation of these resources; or (2) submit to the Secretary full and detailed statements of any proposed wetlands acquisition project. Authorizes the Secretary to finance up to 75 percent of a State's plan or project, if the Secretary approves the plan or project. Allows the Secretary to make agreements to fund an initial portion of a project and to agree to fund remaining costs from subsequent apportionments if available. Makes the liability of the United States contingent upon the continued availability of such funds. Directs the Secretary to establish, and periodically review and revise, a national wetlands priority conservation plan specifying on a region by region or other appropriate basis the types of wetlands that should be given priority with respect to their acquisition and the implementation of enhancement projects. Directs the Secretary to consider certain criteria in establishing such priorities, including the loss or threat of loss of the respective types of wetlands. Title IV: Wetlands Inventory and Trend Analysis - Directs the Secretary, acting through the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to continue the National Wetlands Inventory Project and to: (1) produce final National Wetlands Inventory maps for the entire United States (specifies dates at which different maps are to be completed); and (2) produce, by September 30, 1986, and at ten year intervals thereafter, reports to update and improve the information contained in the report dated September 1982 and entitled \"Status and Trends of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitat in the Coterminous United States, 1950's to 1970's.\" Authorizes appropriations for the above maps and reports. Directs the Secretary, by September 30, 1985, to prepare and submit to Congress a report regarding wetlands losses in the United States. Authorizes appropriations for such report."
