Treats such income as farm income for all tax purposes including the Social Security Act. Provides that farm land diverted from production under a qualified diversion program shall be treated as used in a farming business for purposes of the estate tax special use valuation. Defines \"qualified diversion program.\" Specifies that farmers' cooperatives shall not forfeit tax- exempt status by the marketing of commodities received under a payment-in-kind program."
