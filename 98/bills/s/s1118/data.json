    "text": "Amtrak Improvement Act of 1983 - Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to prohibit a State or political subdivision from requiring the National Railroad Passenger Corporation to employ persons to perform any particular operation in the provision of rail passenger service. Authorizes the Corporation to continue service which it planned to discontinue under an agreement with a State (or local or regional transportation agency) that such State will: (1) reimburse the Corporation for 100 percent of its long-term avoidable losses and associated capital costs; and (2) assume the Corporation's liability for labor protective arrangements in the event of a discontinuance of service. Directs the Secretary of Transportation and employee representatives, not later than 90 days after the effective date of this Act, to enter into an agreement providing protection for Corporation employees who are deprived of employment by a discontinuance of intercity rail passenger service. Requires the Secretary to prescribe the benefit schedule if the parties are unable to reach such an agreement. Sets forth terms and conditions for such agreement and makes it inapplicable to Amtrak Commuter. Authorizes appropriations for the Corporation for FY 1984 and 1985."
