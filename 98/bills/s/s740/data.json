    "text": "Natural Gas Consumer Protection Act of 1983 - Amends the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 to require that any existing or future contract for the first sale of natural gas, excluding any contract for the first-sale of gas which is forever regulated, contain a market-out clause. Provides that such clause shall allow the buyer to nominate a new lower price or escape the contract if the gas is not marketable at the contract price. Declares that contracts not containing such a clause within 60 days after enactment of this Act shall be unenforceable. Sets limitations on the volume reductions and maximum new lower prices that may be established through renegotiation of such a purchase contract."
