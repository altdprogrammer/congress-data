    "text": "Requires that any concurrent resolution on the budget reported by the House Committee on the Budget which includes any procedure which has the effect of changing any rule of the House shall be referred to the Committee on Rules with instructions to report it within 5 days. Grants the Committee on Rules jurisdiction to report any such concurrent resolution with amendments which change or strike out any such procedure. Makes it out of order in the House to consider any concurrent resolution on the budget which contains directions to one or more committees to change laws, bills, or resolutions to increase or decrease an authorization for enactment of budget authority (other than spending authority) within their jurisdictions for any fiscal year. Requires a committee only to subdivide its allocations and report to the House the subdivisions made by it of discretionary action amounts. Declares that requirements of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the Rules of the House of Representatives concerning budget waivers and referral of entitlements in excess of budget ceilings shall not apply to bills estimated not to exceed $5,000,000. Declares that certain points of order shall not apply to any bill or resolution which, as reported to the House, would not be in violation of them. Declares that the requirement that the House consider certain budgetary legislation only after adoption of the first budget resolution shall not apply to any bill or resolution that: (1) provides new budget authority which first becomes effective in the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the bill or resolution is to be considered by the House; or (2) increases or decreases revenues which first become effective in the second fiscal year. Allows the Budget Committee to file its report on the first concurrent resolution on the budget while the House is not in session. Permits consideration of the concurrent resolution on the budget at any time after the fifth legislative day following the day on which the report of the Committee on the Budget has been available to Members. Permits the Committee on Appropriations to report its individual appropriations measures as soon as committee consideration is completed. Repeals the provisions of this resolution immediately prior to noon on January 3, 1985."
