Prohibits a committee from reimbursing a Member or employee for travel expenses unless: (1) such person requests the committee to authorize the travel; (2) the request sets forth the itinerary, legislative objectives, and projected costs; and (3) the committee authorizes such travel by rollcall vote. Revises the prohibition on the use by a lame duck Member of local currencies owned by the United States for travel outside the United States to prohibit such use after a primary where the Member has been defeated for nomination to a Federal office (other than President)."
