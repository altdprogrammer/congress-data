    "text": "House Broadcasting Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to establish Rule LI to provide for television and radio coverage of House proceedings. Establishes the House Broadcast System to provide complete and unedited audio and visual broadcast coverage of chamber proceedings while the House is in session. Prohibits the restriction of broadcast coverage except as directed in adopted resolution or when Rule XXIX (secret session) is invoked. Vests in the Speaker of the House the responsibility for implementing Rule LI. Establishes a Broadcast Advisory Board, consisting of majority and minority party Members, to assist the Speaker. Vests the daily operation and supervision of the broadcast system in the Executive Committee of the Radio and Television Correspondents' Galleries. Authorizes appropriations to carry out Rule LI. Declares such rule inapplicable to joint congressional sessions. Provides access to the live coverage of House proceedings to: (1) accredited television and broadcast stations, networks, services systems (including cable sytems), and radio and television correspondents; (2) Member and committee offices; and (3) such other places as the Speaker deems appropriate. Prohibits commercial sponsorship as part of the broadcast coverage, the use of such coverage in commercial advertisements, and the use of such coverage as partisan campaign material. Requires the Librarian of Congress to arrange for the recording, permanent maintenance, and viewing of such coverage for reference and research purposes."
