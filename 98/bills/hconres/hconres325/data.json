Urges that the correction of such violations be accorded the highest priority in negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the United States should assess the military significance of such violations and take appropriate action to deny the Soviet Union any military advantage it may have derived from such violations; and (2) the defense of the United States should not be constrained by adherence to arms control agreements or portions thereof which are violated by the Soviet Union. Supports the negotiation of new arms control agreements with the Soviet Union provided compliance with such agreements may be verified and the United States is satisfied that any military imbalance from Soviet violations has been removed through Soviet or U.S. action."
