States the U.S. should assure that any findings or recommendations reached by the UNCTAD VI will be referred to the appropriate international bodies for futher consideration. Urges the President to: (1) continue to pursue consultations with member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development concerning common positions at UNCTAD VI; and (2) designate a U.S. delegation to UNCTAD VI and instruct the U.S. delegation to engage in discussions with other nations with respect to the state of the world economy."
