Requests the President to: (1) report to the Congress by December 31, 1984, regarding the steps he has taken with respect to this resolution; and (2) submit a final report to the Congress by September 30, 1985, on the U.S. Government's reassessment of the Joint Statement and the progress made in discussions with the Soviets. Encourages private organizations, foundations, and citizens to assess the continued relevance of the Joint Statement and to determine a practical approach to achieve the agreed principles set forth therein."
