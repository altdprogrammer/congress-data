States that the Congress expects: (1) democracy to be restored to the Philippines; and (2) free elections to be held there in May 1984 with a free press and the full participation of the opposition parties. States that if the Marcos government refuses such tribrunal and elections, the United States should reevaluate its relations with the Marcos government, including the status of military and economic aid. Expresses congressional condolences to the Aquino family and the Filipino people."
