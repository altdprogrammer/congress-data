Declares that it is the sense of Congress that the President and the Congress should limit to specified amounts for FY 1983 and FY 1984 total Federal Financing Bank origination of direct loans guaranteed by other Federal agencies and purchases of certificates of beneficial ownership from Federal agencies. Declares that direct borrowing transactions of Federal agencies should be, to the maximum extent possible, restricted to the Federal Financing Bank. Declares that it is the sense of Congress that the budgets of Federal agencies initiating Federal Financing Bank purchases of certificates of beneficial ownership and originations of guaranteed loans should include the budget authority and outlays resulting from the transactions. Recommends that the committees with proper jurisdiction consider legislation to require that the budgetary impact of such Federal Financing Bank transactions be included in the budgets of the initiating agencies beginning with the FY 1985 budget."
