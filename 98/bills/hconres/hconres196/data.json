Declares that the President should explore a program which would: (1) serve as the ultimate coordinating body of collaborative programs between Mexico and the United States; (2) contribute to economic development in Mexico; (3) serve as a source of financial and technical assistance; (4) target assistance based on findings of need and take into consideration the findings of the United States-Mexican Science and Technology Mixed Commission; (5) draw extensively on and foster the development of local Mexican businesses, civic and labor organizations, and rely on private sector initiatives; and (6) rely on volunteers with skills not sufficiently available in Mexico. Urges the President to study how the program should be administered. Requests that the results of such study be transmitted to the Congress."
