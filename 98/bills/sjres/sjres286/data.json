    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 98-626) Grants congressional approval of the Compact of Free Association between the United States, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands. Declares that the defense sites of the United States established in the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia in accordance with such Compact and its related agreements are within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Provides that upon the effective date of the Compact of Free Association the laws of the United States generally applicable to the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands shall continue to apply to the Republic of Palau. Makes the Republic of Palau eligible for such proportion of Federal assistance as it would otherwise have been eligible to receive under such laws prior to the effective date of the Compact, as provided in appropriation Acts. Declares that: (1) any mutual agreement which results in amendment, change, or termination of all or any part of such Compact shall be effected only by Act of Congress; and (2) no unilateral action by the United States provided for in the Compact, and having any such result, may be effected other than by Act of Congress. Sets forth the purposes for which specified funds may remain available after the effective date of the Compact with respect to the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Declares that appropriations made pursuant to this Compact, or any other provision of this Act, may be made only to the Secretary of the Interior, who shall have authority over any program or activity provided therein. Declares that all programs and services provided to the Federated States of Micronesia or the Republic of the Marshall Islands by Federal agencies may be provided only after consultation with, approval by, and under the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior."
