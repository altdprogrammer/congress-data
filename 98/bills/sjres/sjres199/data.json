    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Declares the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike free of restrictions on the imposition of tolls upon the repayment by the Commonwealth of Virginia of certain Federal-aid highway funds relating to such Turnpike. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a demonstration project for a period of 12 months on Interstate Highway 66, in Virginia, which restricts the use of such highway to high occupancy vehicles (three or more occupants, not four or more, as now) during the morning and evening rush hours. Exempts vehicles which enter the highway at specified points from such restriction. Directs the Secretary to carry out an environmental assessment of such restrictions and report to Congress on the results of the assessment and demonstration project. Declares the Ohio Turnpike free of restrictions on the imposition of tolls upon the repayment by Ohio or the Ohio Turnpike Commission of certain Federal-aid highway funds relating to such Turnpike. Authorizes appropriations out of the Highway Trust Fund for FY 1984 for emergency relief, in addition to any other authorized amounts. Makes the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands eligible for such relief funds. Removes the limitation on amounts available for projects in any State for funds authorized by this Act. Makes the following projects eligible for emergency relief assistance: (1) the project to alleviate flooding conditions under an Interstate Highway near Carencro, Louisiana; and (2) the project to reconstruct a Federal-aid primary route in San Mateo County, California. Authorizes the construction of a bridge on the Federal aid primary system in the vicinity of Valley City and Florence, Illinois, under the highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation program."
