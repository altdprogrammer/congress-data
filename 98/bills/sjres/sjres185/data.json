    "text": "Suggests that a Strategic Arms Reduction Talks agreement should provide for reductions to equal levels in the aggregate number of ICBMs and SLBMs and the aggregate number of warheads deployed on such systems in a manner which enhances stability and deterrence. Suggests as a U.S. goal of such negotiations the elimination of MIRVed ICBMs, including the MX and its Soviet counterparts. Commends the President for endorsing the mutual guaranteed builddown concept and urges him to work with Congress in formulating a specific builddown proposal to the Soviet Union. States that the United States should refrain from actions which would undercut the SALT I and SALT II agreements provided the Soviet Union shows equal restraint. States actions which maintain such interim restraints. Suggests that an Intermediate-Nuclear Forces (INF) agreement should provide for an equal balanced of U.S. and Soviet INF systems at the lowest level. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Soviet Union's current INF proposal is unacceptable; (2) the United States should respond flexibly to any constructive Soviet proposal; and (3) any agreement reached at the INF negotiations should not permit an increase in the level of Soviet INF systems in Asia. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States will seek to negotiate procedures to assure Soviet compliance with specified kiloton limits set out within the Threshold Test Ban Treaty. States that the United States should continue to try to achieve balanced arms reductions, with the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons."
