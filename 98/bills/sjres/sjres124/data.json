Calls for the United States and other nuclear supplier and consumer nations to begin negotiations leading to an agreement to: (1) reject the commercial use of separated plutonium as a nuclear power reactor fuel; (2) base civilian nuclear power technology only on nonweapons usable fuel; and (3) make available reliable supplies of natural and low-enriched uranium."
