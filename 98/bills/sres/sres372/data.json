    "text": "Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Initiative of 1984 - Expresses the sense of the Senate that it should be the policy of the United States that veterans' disability compensation be provided veterans for all disabilities arising subsequent to military service where a consensus of medical opinion would recognize such disability as having a connection to exposure during such service to ionizing radiation from atmospheric nuclear test or the occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, or to a herbicide such as Agent orange. Directs the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to establish guidelines for using findings of epidemiological and clinical studies examining the possible relationship between such exposure and the manifestation of adverse health effects to resolve claims for compensation. Requires the addition of cloracne and possibly prorphyria cutanea tarda to the list of chronic diseases presumed to be service-connected for benefit purposes. Requires consideration of estimates of attributable risk when adjudicating claims for compensation based on leukemia or other cancers suffered by veterans exposed during service to ionizing radiation. Restates the function of Congress to authorize compensation to veterans for disabilities connected to exposure to such substances during service. Directs the Director of the Defense Nuclear Agency to specify minimum standards governing the preparation of radiation dose estimates for use in VA disability claims. Requires the Director to report to the Administrator and the Veterans' Affairs Committees of Congress, by December 1, 1984, on a review of the current state of determining previous radiation exposure."
