Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should appoint a task force on agricultural credit to: (1) examine agricultural credit problems; (2) report to the President and Congress on the credit-related problems confronting agricultural producers and related businesses; and (3) make recommendations on how to resolve problems that might be identified. Directs the task force to: (1) identify and describe the components of the existing agricultural credit system; (2) identify and describe the credit needs of agricultural producers and related businesses; (3) evaluate the current agricultural credit system's ability to meet producer credit needs; and (4) develop for the President and Congress specific recommendations for policies and legislation to ensure the availability of adequate agricultural credit at reasonable cost. Directs the task force to report to the President and Congress by January 1, 1985. Terminates such task force not later than 12 months after its establishment."
