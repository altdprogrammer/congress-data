    "text": "Unfair Trade Practices Act of 1983 - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to amend the definition of \"subsidy\" for purposes of determining countervailing duties to include the requirement or inducement to provide at preferential rates any materials used in the manufacture of merchandise imported into the United States when it is determined that the total cost of production of such merchandise, exclusive of the fair value of materials supplied at preferential rates, is equal to or less than three times the fair value of such excluded materials. Sets forth the method of calculating, for purposes of antidumping duties, the foreign market value of foreign merchandise which is composed of materials that are available to the manufacturer of the merchandise at below cost prices and which is being or is likely to be sold in the United States. Sets forth another method for determining the foreign market value of such merchandise if it is exported from a State-controlled economy country. Requires the administering authority, if such foreign merchandise is from a country which has a State-controlled economy and is not a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to: (1) simultaneously declare that a U.S. industry is materially injured, or threatened with material injury, or the establishment of a U.S. industry is materially retarded by reason of such imports of foreign merchandise; and (2) in the event of such declaration inform the International Trade Commission (ITC) not to make an investigation relating to a preliminary or final determination on antidumping duties; and (3) make its (the administering authority's) final determination within 45 days of its preliminary determination relating to antidumping duties, or within 105 days after such preliminary determination if an extension is granted under the Act. Authorizes the administering authority to suspend an antidumping duty investigation if: (1) the government of a State- controlled economy country (but not exporters) agrees to restrict the volume of imports into the United States of merchandise which is the subject of an antidumping investigation; and (2) petitioners who requested the investigation accept the agreement. Requires the administering authority, if such an agreement is made, to instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to prohibit further entry of such merchandise if the agreed restricted level is exceeded. Requires the administering authority with respect to countertrade or barter transactions to treat the parties whose merchandise is the subject of an antidumping duty investigation as related parties for purposes of determining U.S. prices for such merchandise. Prohibits the importation of certain merchandise which is composed of materials obtained below-cost. Authorizes the President, if the President determines that market disruption has been caused by imports from communist countries, to decline to provide import relief in accordance with ITC findings and recommendations or to provide other import relief solely on the basis of foreign relations or national defense considerations. Amends the definition of market disruption to provide that it exists within a domestic industry whenever imports of an article, like or directly competitive with an article produced by such domestic industry, are a cause or threaten to become a cause of injury to such domestic industry."
