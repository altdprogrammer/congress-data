    "text": "National Fish Hatcheries System Act - Establishes a National Fish Hatcheries System (System). Sets forth the purposes of the System, including: (1) mitigating damage to fish stocks as a result of the construction or operation of Federal projects; (2) restoring certain significant or interjurisdictional fish stocks; (3) carrying out fisheries research and development; and (4) implementing recovery plans for endangered species. Includes in the System fish hatcheries which are: (1) directly operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service); or (2) federally supported in their construction (on or after the date of enactment of this Act), operation, or maintenance. Prohibits moneys made available through specified Federal law from being considered as federally supported construction, operation, or maintenance. Requires the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to administer the System. Requires fish hatcheries not directly operated by the Service to be operated in accordance with a cooperative agreement entered into with the Service. Prohibits the production of fish within the System for purposes of restoring interjurisdictional fish stocks unless a restoration plan has been prepared and agreed to by specified parties. Authorizes the Secretary, for up to four years, to produce fish within the System for private uses, including commercial fish farming. Provides for the reimbursement of fish production costs from: (1) water or power users benefiting from the Federal project; (2) the Federal agencies or State governments exercising fishery management jurisdiction; and (3) private users. Prohibits the construction of any new fish hatcheries after the effective date of this Act, unless authorized by law enacted after that date, unless for mitigation of damaged fish stocks, and unless all costs will be reimbursed. Authorizes the Secretary, under certain procedures, to close any fish hatchery within the System, subject to congressional review within a specified time. Requires (after consultation between the Secretary and affected States, interstate fishery commissions, or Indian tribes) that specified regulations, dealing with useful life, production capacity, and the costs of production at such hatcheries, be established for each System hatchery within one year of the effective date of this Act."
