Increases the number of weeks for which such benefits are payable to an individual. Provides that the rate of insured unemployment for any period, for purposes of the Act, shall be determined in the same manner as under the Federal State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, except that individuals filing claims for any type of compensation (whether regular, extended, additional, or Federal supplemental compensation) shall be taken into account. Sets forth transitional rules. Directs the Secretary of Labor to require modifications of agreements under the Act to conform to the amendments made by this Act within a specified period."
