Exempts qualified ventures, participants, and employees thereof from criminal prosecution under the antitrust laws based on conduct that is part of a research and development program that has been disclosed to the Attorney General. Requires a venture to disclose and annually update specified information concerning its formation to the Attorney General in order to be a qualified venture. Limits the liability of qualified ventures, participants, and employees thereof to actual damages, interest thereon, and the cost of suit for antitrust violations based on conduct that is part of a research and development program that has been disclosed to the Attorney General. Directs the court to award a qualified venture, participants, or employees thereof the cost of defending against a claim brought under the antitrust laws if the alleged violation is based on conduct which is part of a disclosed research and development program which does not violate antitrust laws. Sets forth restrictions on the disclosure of information submitted to the Attorney General."
