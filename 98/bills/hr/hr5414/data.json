Title II: Amendments Regarding the Administration on Aging - Replaces provisions establishing the Administration on Aging in the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services with provisions establishing, under the general authority of the Secretary, an Office on Aging (the Office). Provides that the Office shall assume the duties and functions of the Administration on Aging. Provides that the Office shall, as was the Administration on Aging, be headed by the Commissioner on Aging. Requires the Office, in addition to the duties and functions of the Administration that it has assumed, to consult with national organizations representing minority individuals to develop and disseminate training packages and to provide technical assistance efforts designed to assist State and area agencies in providing services to older individuals with the greatest economic or social needs. Authorizes funds to be appropriated for FY 1985 through 1987 for the Federal Council on Aging. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations for the administration of the Older Americans Act of 1965. Prohibits the Secretary from making grants or contracts under such Act for training, research, and discretionary projects and programs until the Secretary develops and publishes general standards to be used in evaluating such projects and programs. Title III: Grants for Programs on Aging - Defines: (1) an \"older individual\" as any individual who is 60 or older; and (2) \"multipurpose senior centers\" as community facilities for the organization and provision of a broad spectrum of services, including health, social, nutritional, and educational services and facilities for recreational activities for older individuals. Authorizes funds to be appropriated for FY 1985 through 1987 for social service grants and nutrition project grants under the Older Americans Act of 1965. Requires each area agency on aging to: (1) specify annually in its area plan the amount of funds spent for each category of services in the preceding year; (2) conduct efforts to coordinate community- based, long-term care services designed to keep individuals in their homes, thereby deferring unnecessary institutionalization; (3) provide assurances that it will give particular attention in providing services to low-income minority older individuals; and (4) include minority individuals on the advisory councils which the agencies are required to establish. Requires a State's plan under such Act, in planning and operating its long-term care ombudsman program, to consider the views of area agencies on aging, older individuals, and provider agencies. Authorizes funds to be appropriated for FY 1985 through 1987 for the surplus commodity program under such Act. Provides for grants for counseling regarding appropriate health and life insurance coverage. Title IV: Training, Research, and Discretionary Programs Related to Aging - Revises provisions of the Older Americans Act of 1965 relating to training, research, and discretionary programs. Directs the Commissioner to make grants and enter into contracts for training, research, and discretionary programs related to aging in order to: (1) provide comprehensive and coordinated nondegree education, training programs, and curricula at institutions of higher education and at other educational organizations for practitioners in the fields of nutrition, health care, supportive services, housing, and long-term care; (2) provide inservice training opportunities to the personnel of State offices, area agencies, senior centers, and nutrition sites to strengthen their capacity to remain responsive to the needs of older individuals; and (3) provide courses on aging and dissemination of information about aging. Directs the Office on Aging to conduct both: (1) long-term educational activities to prepare personnel for careers in the field of aging; and (2) short-term inservice training and continuing education activities for State and area agency personnel, and other personnel, in the field of aging. Requires multidiscriplinary centers of gerontology to: (1) conduct research and policy analysis and function as a technical resource for the Commissioners, policy makers, service providers, and Congress; (2) recruit and train personnel; (3) conduct research toward the development of information related to aging; (4) stimulate the incorporation of information on aging into the teaching of biological, behavioral, and social sciences at colleges and universities; (5) develop training programs in the field of aging; (6) serve as a repository of information and knowledge on aging; (7) provide consultation to organizations servicing older individuals under provisions of this Act; and (8) provide data to the Commissioner on projects and activities for which training, research, and discretionary program funds are provided. Sets forth the purposes of research and development projects under the Older Americans Act of 1965. Directs the Commissioner to select for research assistance research activities which will, within three years of enactment of this Act: (1) contribute to the establishment and maintenance of a demographic data base which contains information on the population of older individuals; (2) identify the future needs of older individuals; (3) identify the kinds and comprehensiveness of programs required to satisfy such needs; and (4) identify the kinds and number of personnel required to carry out such programs. Authorizes making grants and contracts for projects designed to identify older individuals who suffer from Alzheimer's disease and other neurological diseases and provide family respite services and other community-based care services to such individuals. Revises provisions relating to special demonstration projects on legal services for older individuals. Directs the Commissioner to make grants and enter into contracts to: (1) provide nationwide legal services support activities to State and area agencies on aging for providing, developing, or supporting legal services for older individuals; and (2) support demonstration projects to expand or improve the delivery of legal services to older individuals with social or economic needs.
