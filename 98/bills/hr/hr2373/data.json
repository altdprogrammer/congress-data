Amends the Internal Revenue Code to specify additional information which must be included in statements furnished to taxpayers who receive interest or dividend payments. Increases additions to tax and penalties for failure to report interest and dividend income and to pay the tax on such income. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to modify income tax forms to provide for the separate listing of tax-exempt interest or dividend income. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations requiring taxpayers to attach statements of interest and dividend income to their tax returns. Permits the Secretary of the Treasury to correct tax returns which show a different amount of interest or dividend income than that reported by the payor of such income and to assess any resulting tax deficiency."
