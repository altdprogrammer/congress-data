    "text": "Congressional Regulatory Review Procedure Act - Provides that no agency rule shall become effective prior to 90 days of continuous session of Congress following publication in the Federal Register and submission to each House of Congress. Provides that a rule shall not be effective if a deauthorization resolution is adopted by Congress within 90 days of continuous session of Congress after the date of promulgation and such resolution is signed by the President or, if vetoed by the President, is passed over such veto. Requires that a rule be considered temporarily effective for up to 90 days of continuous session of Congress if eminent loss of life or property or public threat requires expeditious implementation of such rule and such rule is submitted to both Houses of Congress simultaneously with its promulgation for review in accordance with this Act. Prohibits an agency from promulgating a new rule identical to one which has been disapproved under this Act. Requires an agency to comply with the procedures under this Act with respect to any new rule it proposes dealing with the same subject matter as a rule which has been disapproved. Provides that a statutory time limit shall apply to renewed rulemaking only from the date on which a deauthorization resolution is enacted in the case of a disapproved rule which was being promulgated subject to a statutory time limit. Sets forth House and Senate procedures for the consideration of rules transmitted to Congress by agencies. Establishes in each House a Resolutions on Regulations Calendar to which any resolutions on rules shall be referred."
