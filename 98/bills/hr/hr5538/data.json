Obligates specified FY 1985 through 1987 amounts appropriated for sexually transmitted diseases for AIDS programs. Permits grants for sexually transmitted disease prevention to be used for research, demonstration projects, public information and education, and professional training. Increases the appropriation obligations limit from five to ten percent for such non-State project grants. Increases minimum population-based State allotments for preventive health services block grants from $3,000,000 to $3,500,000. Bases a State's post-FY 1984 hypertension allotments upon 65 percent of its total preventive health services project grant amounts. Requires States, as prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to collect specified preventive health services data by October 1, 1984."
