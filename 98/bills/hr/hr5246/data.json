    "text": "Public Broadcasting Support Act of 1984 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize to be appropriated to the Public Broadcasting Fund for each fiscal year after FY 1986 an amount equal to 50 percent of the non-Federal financial support received by public broadcasting entities during the fiscal year second preceding such fiscal year. Prohibits any public broadcasting station from making its facilities available for commercial advertising by nonprofit organizations. Permits any such station to broadcast announcements which include the use of any logogram used for the purpose of identifying any product, service, or facility of a corporation, company, or organization. (Continues the prohibition against the broadcast of an announcement using a logogram to promote such a product, service, or facility.) Repeals provisions requiring a public telecommunications entity to refund to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting an amount of Federal funds equal to the amount of any unrelated business income tax paid by such entity."
