Directs that certain funds expended by the Pearl River basin development district be credited toward the local share of project costs. Requires that non-Federal interests agree to: (1) hold and save the United States free from damages due to the construction of such project (not due to negligence on the part of the United States or its contractors); (2) provide without cost to the United States all necessary lands, easements, rights-of-way and utility relocations; and (3) operate and maintain such project in accordance with certain regulations."
