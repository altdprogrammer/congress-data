    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-08-10", 
    "text": "Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (the Act) to increase the authorization of appropriations for low-income home energy assistance for FY 1984 and to extend such authorization through FY 1988. Revises the term \"poverty level\" for purposes of such Act to mean, with respect to any household in a State, the income poverty line as prescribed and revised pursuant to the Community Services Block Grant Act. Provides that the State median income promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall be adjusted to prevent any change in income calculation procedures which would result in the reduction in or exclusion from participation of households in programs under the Act. Prohibits the allotment of funds to a State for low-income home energy assistance unless the Secretary determines that the State's application for funds satisfies the requirements of the Act and reviews such application for completeness. Provides that such applications will be considered to have satisfied such requirements unless the Secretary decides to the contrary within 30 days. Requires at least five percent of a State's allotment to be reserved until May 15 of each year for energy crisis intervention. Requires that a State's annual application for funds for low-income home energy assistance indicate: (1) the number and type of households in the State eligible for such assistance; (2) the level of and method for determining household benefits under the assistance program; and (3) the method of program administration to be used. Requires as part of such application that a State agree to: (1) provide assurances that such State, except as otherwise provided in this Act, will not differentiate between specified households when administering such assistance; (2) provide that such State may not use more than ten percent of its low-income energy assistance allotment (based on the amount of funds remaining for a State after funds for such assistance are reserved by the Secretary for Indian tribes) for planning and administering of such assistance; (3) describe energy usage and the average cost of home energy in the State; (4) designate local community-based public or nonprofit entities to administer energy crisis intervention programs; (5) indicate the amount which the State will reserve for energy crisis intervention and the administrative procedures for designating an energy crisis, for determining the amount of assistance to be provided during such a crisis, and for determining the use of funds reserved for energy crisis intervention but not so used; and (6) cooperate with the Secretary with respect to data collecting and reporting relating to home energy consumption and use. Requires that the State plan which is part of the annual application contain funding estimates for the State's low-income home energy assistance programs, describe the eligibility requirements to be used under such programs, and describe weatherization and other energy-related home repair the State will provide. Requires any substantial revisions of a State plan to be made available for public inspection. Provides that a State shall expend funds in accordance with a State plan reviewed by the Secretary. Requires that the periodic evaluation by the Comptroller General of State expenditures of grants received under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 occur at least every three years. Increases the maximum amount of funds received under the Act which a State may use for low-cost residential weatherization or other energy-related home repair for low-income households. Decreases the maximum amount of grant money allotted for a fiscal year to a State for low-income home energy assistance which a State may request to be held available for the next fiscal year. Provides that such request shall include a statement of the reasons that such amount allotted to such State for a fiscal year will not be used by such State during such fiscal year and a description of the types of assistance to be provided with the amount held available for the following fiscal year. Provides that an amount allotted to a State for a fiscal year shall be determined on the amount of funds remaining for such State after funds for energy assistance are reserved by the Secretary for Indian tribes. Specifies additional home energy and home energy assistance data which the Secretary is required to collect on a State-by-State basis. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on such data by June 30 of each year."
