    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during the commission of a Federal felony. Establishes a mandatory term of imprisonment of five years for a first offender (currently, one to ten years) and eight years for a second or subsequent offender (currently, two to 25 years). Extends to first offenders the requirement, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence. Makes offenders ineligible for parole and requires that the additional sentence be served consecutively to the terms of imprisonment imposed for the offense itself."
