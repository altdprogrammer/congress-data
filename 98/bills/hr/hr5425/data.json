    "text": "Idaho Forest Management Act of 1984 - Title I: Findings, Purposes, and Wilderness Designation - Sets forth congressional findings and purposes. Designates the following lands in Idaho as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Selkirks-Canyon Wilderness in the Panhandle National Forest; (2) the Salmo Priest Wilderness in the Panhandle National Forest; (3) the Scotchman Peaks Wilderness in the Panhandle National Forest; (4) the Mallard Larkins Wilderness in the Panhandle and Clearwater National Forests; (5) the Kelly Creek-Hoodoo Wilderness in the Clearwater National Forest; (6) the North Lick Creek Wilderness in the Payette National Forest; (7) the White Clouds Wilderness in the Sawtooth National Forest; (8) the Worm Creek Wilderness in the Caribou National Forest; and (9) the Borah Peak Wilderness in the Challis National Forest. Title II: Release of Lands for Multiple Use Management - Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental impact statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Idaho shall not be subject to judicial review. Provides that national forest system lands in Idaho which have not been designated as additions to the National Wilderness Preservation System by this Act or which have not been previously designated as wilderness by an Act of Congress shall be managed for multiple uses other than wilderness. Prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Idaho without express congressional authorization. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Sets forth requirements with respect to livestock grazing policies, State water allocation authority, buffer zones, mineral resources assessment, and aircraft landing. Specifies procedures for the disposition of existing mining claims in the White Clouds Wilderness designated by this Act. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct an inventory of, and report to Congress on, the structures which exist within the wilderness areas designated by this Act. Sets forth procedural requirements for judicial review of any decision by the Secretary with respect to any of the plans and environmental statements referred to in this Act."
