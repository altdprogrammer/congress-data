    "text": "Emergency Immigrant Education Act of 1983 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1986 for special impact aid payments to State and local educational agencies which provide educational services to immigrant children. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to pay each State educational agency (SEA) for its administrative costs under this Act, in an amount up to one percent of the funds to which the SEA is entitled under this Act. Sets forth provisions for withholding of payments under this Act. Directs the Secretary to make, for FY 1984 through 1986, State entitlement payments equal to $500 for each immigrant child in public and nonpublic elementary or secondary schools within eligible local educational agencies (LEAs). Requires that the number of such children in the public and nonpublic schools within an eligible LEA be at least the lesser of: (1) 500; or (2) five percent of the total enrollment in such public or nonpublic schools during the fiscal year. Excludes, for purposes of determining the amount of the grant for any SEA for any fiscal year, the number of immigrant children for whom such SEA receives funds under the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980 for such fiscal year. Permits payments to States under this Act to be used for supplementary public educational services and costs for immigrant children in public and nonpublic schools within districts served by eligible LEAs. Includes among such services: (1) English language instruction; (2) other bilingual educational services; (3) special materials and supplies; (4) additional basic instructional services; and (5) inservice personnel training. Sets forth requirements for SEA applications for payments under this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) make payments to SEAs having applications approved; and (2) arrange for the provision of public educational services under this Act to children enrolled in nonpublic schools, in cases where a State is prohibited by law from providing such services to such children and where the LEA has substantially failed or is unwilling to provide for the participation on an equitable basis of such children in such services."
