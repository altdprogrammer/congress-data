Requires the Secretary to publish notice in the appropriate media regarding the per capita distribution of the judgment funds and the application procedures for the distribution. Requires the Secretary to allocate the judgment funds between the Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma and the Absentee Wyandottes according to prescribed guidelines. Requires that the Wyandotte Tribe allocation be divided: (1) 80 percent for per capita distribution; and (2) 20 percent for specified uses for the benefit of the Tribe. States that such 20 percent allocation may be distributed by the Wyandotte Tribe without seeking the Secretary's approval. Exempts the Secretary from further trust responsibility regarding the 20 percent allocation. Exempts the judgment funds distribution from: (1) Federal, State or local income taxes; or (2) any consideration as a resource for purposes of public assistance eligibility criteria. Repeals specified law regarding the use and distribution of specified judgment funds. Title II: Fort Berthold Reservation Mineral Restoration Act - Fort Berthold Reservation Mineral Restoration Act - Declares that mineral rights in specified lands are held in trust by the United States for the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation. Requires any exploration or development regarding such mineral rights to comply with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Army. Authorizes the United States to renew or extend leases or contracts concerning such mineral interests under certain conditions. Declares that revenues from such mineral interests which accrue to the United States after enactment of this Act are held in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior to enter into agreements to transfer to the United States specified lands held in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes or any individual Indian. Conditions such transfer upon approval by the affected beneficiaries. Authorizes both Secretaries to enter into agreements to hold certain lands no longer needed for the Garrison Dam and Reservoir Project in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes.
