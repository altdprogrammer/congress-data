Allows the adjustment or exchange of an income interest or remainder interest transferred for charitable purposes where the donee receives an interest in property not less in value than that of the original transfer. Allows an estate or gift tax charitable deduction for a partial interest where the reformable interest in the charitable trust had not been corrected and there had been a termination of all intervening interests in the trust. Provides that interest on underpayment of tax will not be collected where the underpayment results from a disallowance of a charitable deduction involving a reformable partial interest. Extends until December 31, 1985, the period for filing a claim or credit for refund of overpayment of tax where the overpayment resulted from the allowance of a charitable deduction as a result of amending or conforming the transfer instrument."
