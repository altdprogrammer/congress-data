    "text": "Amends the Bilingual Education Act to revise provisions for personnel training. Requires that such training be designed to develop knowledge of cultural groups of persons of limited English proficiency. Permits bilingual education training institutes to be located outside the United States if the program would be made more effective by being conducted in a country whose inhabitants speak the language being studied. Requires that, in the awarding of fellowships for study in the field of training teachers for bilingual education, favorable consideration be given to individuals intending to study bilingual education in the following specialized areas: vocational education, adult education, gifted and talented education, special education, education technology, literacy, and mathematics and science education. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to and contracts with eligible applicants for special projects. Provides that such special projects may be activities designed to: (1) promote bilingual education programs in the specialized areas listed in the preceding paragraph; or (2) evaluate the progress of children of limited English proficiency in achieving competence in the English language and in progressing effectively through the educational system. Sets forth requirements relating to applications for, and the duration of, such grants and contracts. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1989 for such special projects grants and contracts. Revises provisions for bilingual education research to provide for studies to determine the most effective methods of improving the literacy of (currently, \"teaching reading to\") children and adults who have language proficiencies other than English. Adds to the list of authorized research activities: (1) studies to examine effective programs in special education, gifted and talented education, and math and science education; and (2) a five-year longitudinal study to measure the effect of bilingual education programs on the education of students from Cambodia, Haiti, Laos, and Vietnam."
