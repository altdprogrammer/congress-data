Directs the tribal governing body or designated school board to submit to the Secretary of the Interior alternative standards that consider the specific needs of tribal children if the minimum academic standards are considered inappropriate. Requires each contract school to: (1) comply with prescribed minimum academic standards; or (2) have obtained accreditation or be a candidate for accreditation with specified accrediting agencies. Requires the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to establish uniform fiscal control and fund accounting procedures for all contract schools comparable to procedures used by BIA schools. Identifies conditions under which failure to meet or implement the basic education standards shall not be a basis for taking personnel action against an individual. Prohibits the closing or curtailment (including consolidation) of BIA schools or programs unless it is effected under prescribed guidelines. Directs the Secretary to establish separate geographical attendance areas for each BIA school. Prescribes guidelines for the establishment of such attendance areas. Requires that the tribal governing body or local school board be given a certain time in which to propose school boundaries. States that a public school attendance area shall not be regarded as being exclusive if the Secretary determines a local school district fails to provide: (1) full and equal service; or (2) programs that meet particular student needs. Directs the Secretary to establish nonexclusive major attendance areas regarding multi-tribal boarding schools located off reservations. Requires the Director of the Office of Indian Education Programs (the Office) to report directly and solely to the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs. Requires the Director to supervise and direct all contract functions concerning education. Provides that education personnel working under the Director's supervision shall provide service and support functions in the areas of procurement, budgeting and personnel. Establishes a facilities division within the Office with responsibility for physical maintenance of all facilities related to education programs operated or funded by the BIA. Includes, in the formula for the minimum annual funds per school, cost factors regarding: (1) special transportation; (2) boarding arrangements; and (3) greater lengths of service by educational personnel. States that BIA and contract schools shall receive, under the minimum annual funds formula, a certain amount for the costs of membership in, or support of, organizations engaged in advocacy activities on behalf of Indian education. Authorizes two separate appropriations in order to implement a direct funding method and a forward funding method. Directs the Secretary to publish, at specified times, certain allotments made to each affected school. Sets forth guidelines under which a school supervisor may appeal to the appropriate superintendent for education any action by a local school board regarding a local financial plan. Prescribes the procedure under which certain school personnel appointments may be appealed. Establishes within the Office of Indian Education Programs a computerized management informations system.
