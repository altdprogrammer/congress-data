Limits such rights between countries within opposite or adjacent coasts. Permits marine scientific research to be conducted by scientists from any country on the U.S. continental shelf or in the area within 200 nautical miles of the base line from which the U.S. territorial sea is measured. Directs the Secretary of State to begin negotiations for the purpose of obtaining bilateral and regional agreements to facilitate marine scientific research in those areas."
