Permits such employers, excluding employers in the broadcasting or motion picture industries, to: (1) agree with a labor organization to make membership in such organization a condition of performing arts employment; and (2) make agreements with a labor organization covering performing artists even if the majority status of the organization has not yet been established. Defines \"employer\" to include purchasers of musical performance services. Defines \"employee\" to include independent contractors engaged to perform musical services."
