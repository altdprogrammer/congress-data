    "text": "Amends title IV of Public Law 95-630 to entitle it the \"Statue of Liberty Double-Eagle Bullion Coin Act.\" Amends the Coinage Act of 1965 to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue gold double-eagle coins in such quantities annually as are necessary to meet the needs of the public. Sets forth specifications for and the design of such coins. Makes all such coins legal tender. Permits the sale of such coins at a price equal to the cost of minting and distributing plus a surcharge reflecting the increase in the fair market value of gold bullion held by the United States and used in the minting of the coins over the statutory maximum value of any gold certificates outstanding against the bullion. Requires such surcharges to be deposited in the Treasury and to be used for the sole purpose of reducing the national debt."
