Establishes the silver dollar as the unit of account of the United States. Permits financial records required by law to be maintained in terms of gold coins, silver coins, or the unit of account of the Federal Reserve System. Prohibits the United States or any State from: (1) imposing an excise, transaction, or capital gains tax upon the use of gold or silver; or (2) restricting the convenient transfer of any ownership or equity interest in gold or silver. Provides that gold and silver shall not be prohibited as lawful tender in payment of debts. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a formula for determining on an hourly basis the Official Conversion Rate between gold, silver, and the unit of account of the Federal Reserve System. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to exchange gold bullion, gold coins, silver, or silver coins for their equivalent fine weight in coins minted by the United States. Provides that neither the Secretary of the Treasury nor the Treasurer of the United States may issue, or authorize to be issued, any form of paper currency."
