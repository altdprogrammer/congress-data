    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 98-1038) Child Abuse Amendments of 1984 - Title I: Amendments to Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act - Part A: Program Improvements - Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (the Act, for purposes of this title) to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, to include, in a study and investigation of the national incidence of child abuse and neglect, a determination of what relationship may exist between nonpayment of child support and child abuse and neglect. Requires that the study's findings be submitted, with recommendations for administrative and legislative changes, to the Congress within two years after the effective date of this Act. Directs the Secretary, through the Center and in consultation with the Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect, to annually prepare reports on efforts during the preceding two-year period to coordinate goals and activities of agencies and organizations with responsibilities for programs and activities related to child abuse and neglect. Requires that such report be submitted to the appropriate congressional committees by March 1, 1985, and March 1 of each second year thereafter. Prohibits use of appropriations under the Act for any purpose other than that for which such funds were specifically authorized. Includes employees of a residential facility or any staff person providing out of home care among those persons responsible for a child's welfare, for purposes of the definition of \"child abuse and neglect\" under the Act. Revises the definition of \"sexual abuse,\" for purposes of child abuse prevention and treatment program provisions of the Act. Provides, under specified conditions, for one or two-year waivers of certain requirements for grants to States, but prohibits application of such waivers to specified requirements established under this Act relating to procedures or programs for response to reports of medical neglect. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect, to insure that a proportionate share of funds under the Act is available for activities related to the prevention of child abuse and neglect. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1987 for purposes of the Act and for specified programs or projects related to prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect and sexual abuse. Sets forth requirements relating to the distribution of such funds among such programs. Allows the Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect to be available, at the Secretary's request, to assist the Secretary in coordinating adoption-related activities of the Federal Government. Part B: Services and Treatment for Disabled Infants - Adds a definintion of \"withholding of medically indicated treatment\" for purposes of the Act. Revises provisions of the Act for demonstration or service programs and projects to add another condition in order for a State to qualify for grants for such programs or projects. Requires the State to have in place procedures or programs or both, within the State child protective services system, to respond to the reporting of medical neglect (including instances of withholding medically indicated treatment from disabled infants with life-threatening conditions). Requires that such programs or procedures provide for: (1) coordination and consultation with individuals designated by and within appropriate health-care facilities; (2) prompt notification by such individuals of cases of suspected medical neglect; and (3) authority, under State law, for the State chld protective service system to pursue any legal remedies necessary to prevent the withholding of medically indicated treatment from disabled infants with life-threatening conditions. Authorizes the Secretary to make additional grants to States to develop, establish, and operate or implement: (1) such required programs or procedures; (2) information and education programs or training programs for parents and professional and paraprofessional personnel to improve services to disabled infants with life-threatening conditions; and (3) programs to help in obtaining or coordinating necessary services for families with such infants and for facilitating adoption placement of such infants.

Limits the amount of funds for any fiscal year which may be used for such purposes. Requires the Secretary to have the capability of providing and to begin to provide such training and technical assistance within 210 days after the enactment of this Act. Requires that programs or projects related to child abuse and neglect which are assisted under child welfare services provisions of the Social Security Act comply with specified requirements for grants to States under the Act, including the requirements added by this Act for programs and procedures for response to reporting of medical neglect. Directs the Secretary to publish: (1) within 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, proposed regulations to implement the programs and procedures required under this title; (2) within 180 days after such date and after completion of a process of not less than 60 days for notice and opportunity for public comment, final regulations; (3) within 60 days after such date, interim model guidelines to encourage the establishment within health-care facilities of committees to educate hospital personnel and families of such infants, recommend institutional policies and guidelines concerning the withholding of medically indicated treatment from such infants, and offer counseling and review in cases involving such infants; and (4) within 180 days after such date and after completion of a period of not less than 60 days for notice and opportunity for public comment, model guidelines.

Directs the Secretary to submit, by October 1, 1987, to the appropriate congressional committees a detailed report on the implementation and the effects of the provisions of this part and the amendments made by it. Declares that no provision of this Act or any amendment made by this Act is intended to affect any right or protection under specified provision of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Provides that no provision of this Act or any amendment made by this Act shall be construed to authorize the prescription of standards of medical care by the Secretary, or other governmental entity, except to the extent such standards implement or interpret other laws or regulations. Sets forth separability provisions and effective dates. Permits one-year waivers of requirements under this title if funds for grants to help implement required programs or procedures have not been appropriated by a specified date and if the Secretary finds that a State is making a good faith effort to comply with such requirements. Title II: Amendments to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978 - Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978 to revise the statement of findings and the declaration of purposes. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) coordinate efforts to improve State legislation with national, State, and local child and family services, including organizations representative of minorities and adoptive families; and (2) review all model adoption legislation and procedures developed or promulgated under such Act for the purpose of making appropriate changes to facilitate adoption opportunities for disabled infants with life-threatening conditions. Directs the Secretary to provide for: (1) services to facilitate the adoption of children with special needs and particularly of disabled infants with life-threatening conditions; and (2) services to couples considering adoption of children with special needs.
