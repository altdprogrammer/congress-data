Declares that the district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of actions brought under this Act. Entitles any person who recovers such compensation to recover reasonable costs, including expert witness and attorney fees. Requires domestic air carriers, airframe manufacturers, aircraft engine manufacturers, and air traffic control system suppliers to maintain financial protection as liability insurance for aircraft accidents. Requires the establishment of a Claims Payment Facility after an aircraft incident if: (1) the liability arising out of such incident exceeds the aggregate limit of liability; or (2) such incident is a terrorist aircraft incident. Finances such Facility by imposing a surcharge upon each passenger ticket and waybill for freight services after the occurrence of an incident."
