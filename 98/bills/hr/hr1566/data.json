    "text": "Export Promotion and Control Act of 1983 - Title I - Amendments to Export Administration Act of 1979 - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to require a comprehensive operations license for multiple exports in lieu of a validated license for each export. Declares that no authority or permission to export may be required under national security export controls before goods or services are exported to any country maintaining export controls cooperatively with the United States. Requires the Secretary to remove an export control where all license applications for such export have been approved within any one-year period. Prohibits the imposition of an export control solely because the good involved contains a nonreprogrammable imbedded microprocessor. Allows the imposition of such an export control if the good would make a significant contribution to the military potential of any power which would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. Requires the President to consult with countries maintaining cooperative export controls with the United States and with other appropriate countries before imposing foreign policy export controls. Requires the President to submit a specified report to Congress no later than ten days after the imposition, expansion, or extension of foreign policy export controls. Requires the President to include in such report the extent and results of the consultation with industry and other countries. Prohibits any foreign policy export controls from affecting any existing contracts. Authorizes the President to impose foreign policy controls on any goods, technology, or other U.S. information to the extent necessary to further U.S. foreign policy or to fulfill U.S. international obligations. Sets forth the procedure by which the President may impose export controls on goods or technology not authorized by this Act or without certain limitations of this Act. Sets forth the violations of this Act and the penalties for such violations, including the forfeiture of any property interest in and any proceeds from the goods or technology exported in violation of national security controls. Authorizes the Secretary to designate any officer or employee of the Department of Commerce to perform certain duties in order to enforce this Act. Sets forth the extent of the authority of customs officers with respect to violations of this Act. Requires the Secretary to include detailed information on the removal of certain national security controls in the annual report to Congress. Makes technical amendments. Authorizes appropriations. Title II - Export Promotion Programs - Sets forth provisions requiring prior authorization of funds before carrying out any export promotion program. Defines \"export promotion program\" for the purposes of this title. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Commerce to carry out export promotion programs."
