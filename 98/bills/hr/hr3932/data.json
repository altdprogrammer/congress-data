Makes an amendment to the Charter effective after 35 days following its submission to Congress unless a joint resolution of disapproval has been enacted and presented to the President. (Under current law, a charter amendment becomes effective within 35 days of its submission to Congress only if Congress enacts a concurrent resolution approving it.) Provides that resolutions of the City Council shall be used to approve or disapprove proposed actions of a kind historically or traditionally transmitted by the Mayor or various Boards or Commissions. (Under current law, resolutions are used to express simple determinations or directions of the Council.) Makes an act of the City Council effective after 30 days following transmittal to Congress unless a joint resolution of disapproval has been enacted and presented to the President. (Currently, an act of the Council becomes effective only if both Houses of Congress do not adopt a concurrent resolution of disapproval.) Makes an act of the City Council with respect to criminal law and procedure effective after 60 days (currently 30 days) following transmittal to Congress unless a joint resolution of disapproval has been enacted and presented to the President. Amends the District of Columbia Retirement Reform Act to require both Houses of Congress to adopt a joint resolution before any report submitted by the Retirement Board may be rejected. (Currently, either House of Congress may reject a report by a simple resolution.)"
