    "text": "Coast Guard Management and Efficiency Improvement Act of 1984 - Excludes from computations of length of service for officers in the Coast Guard time spent at any of the service academies. Renders ineligible for promotion, officers whose separation or retirement date has officially passed but are being deferred for physical disability evaluation purposes. Increases from $25,000 to $100,000 the ceiling on settlement of claims by the Secretary of Transportation involving damage to Coast Guard property. Makes it a Federal crime to kill an employee of the Coast Guard assigned to perform investigative, inspection, or law enforcement functions. Entitles certain enlisted members of the Coast Guard to a replacement when rations inkind are not available. Entitles the surviving spouse of a commandant of the Coast Guard who dies a service-connected death to an increased rate of dependency and indemnity compensation. Eliminates the need for the Chief of Engineers' approval of plans for the construction or maintenance of bridges over navigable waters. Amends the General Bridge Act of 1946 to eliminate the need for the Chief of Engineers' approval of plans for the construction and operation of any bridge. Amends the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1982, to authorize the Secretary of Transportation (when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy) to participate in decisions regarding the use of certain former Public Health Service facilities. Amends the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1984, to authorize the Secretary of Transportation (when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy) to participate in decisions involving the use of Public Health Service facilities."
