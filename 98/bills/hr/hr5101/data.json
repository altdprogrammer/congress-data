Authorizes additional appropriations for: (1) the Office of Productivity, Technology, and Innovation; and (2) excess foreign currency expenses incurred by the Bureau. Title II: Authorization for Program Activities, Fiscal Year 1985 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 to carry out the same activities of the Bureau enumerated in Title I. Allocates $750,000 of the FY 1985 authorization to the Office of Productivity, Technology, and Innovation for the purpose of substantially increasing the availability of Japanese science and engineering literature to U.S. scientists and engineers. Metric Evaluation Act of 1985 - Authorizes the President to contract for a study of the extent of conversion to the metric system of weights and measures in the United States. Directs the President to appoint a panel to establish criteria for eligible bidders for such contract. Requires the study to analyze the impact of conversion on: (1) the materials and machinery industries; (2) potential United States export opportunities; and (3) small business. Requires a cost/benefit analysis, including the cost of not converting. Requires the President to report the results of the study to Congress not later than two years after enactment. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Cost Recovery Authority - Requires that sufficient income from the Working Capital Fund remain outside the general fund of the Treasury to ensure the availability of working capital necessary to replace equipment and inventories for the Bureau. Requires that fees for calibration services, standard reference materials, and other comparable services of the Bureau be at least sufficient to recover the Bureau's operating costs. Authorizes additional appropriations for necessary salary adjustments. Limits to ten percent the transfer of funds among line items enumerated in titles I and II of this Act, unless the appropriate congressional committees: (1) have received a written report explaining the transfer and 30 calendar days have passed since the transmittal of such report; or (2) state in writing they have no objection to the transfer of funds. Designates the rate of compensation of the Director of the Bureau to be at level IV of the Executive Schedule. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to charge other Government agencies for services performed by the Bureau at the request of the other agency in compliance with any statute which names the Secretary or the Bureau as a consultant or calls for them to perform any activity for the other agency."
