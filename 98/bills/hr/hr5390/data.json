Requires that such assistance include: (1) an analysis of State plans and of the findings in State evaluations, with suggestions for improvements in planning or program operation; and (2) an information network on specified types of information useful in the improvement of adult education. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Congress and within the first two years after enactment of this Act, to make a determination of the criteria for defining literacy and identify concretely those skills that comprise the basic educational skills needed for literate functioning. Directs the Secretary, once the definition of literacy has been determined, to determine an accurate estimate of the number of illiterate adults in the Nation, in consultation with the Congress and using the appropriate statistical sampling methodology. Directs the Secretary, subsequent to such determination, to report every four years to the President and the Congress on the status of literacy and adult education in the Nation.
