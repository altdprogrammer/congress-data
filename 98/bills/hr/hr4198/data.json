    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Vermont Wilderness Act of 1984 - Title I: New Wilderness Areas - Designates the following lands in the Green Mountain National Forest, Vermont, as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Breadloaf Wilderness; (2) the Lost Pond Wilderness; (3) the Peru Peak Wilderness; (4) the Lye Brook Wilderness; and (5) the George D. Aiken Wilderness. Permits the Appalachian Trail, the Long Trail, and their related structures and associated trails to be maintained. States that the second Roadless Area Review and Evaluation (RARE II) environmental impact statement shall not be subject to judicial review concerning the national forest system lands in Vermont. Deems the RARE II review of national forest system lands in Vermont to be an adequate evaluation of the suitability of such lands for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Eliminates the requirement that the Department of Agriculture review the wilderness option of such lands prior to the revision of initial land management plans. Directs the Department to review the wilderness option when the plans are revised or when the Secretary of Agriculture finds that conditions in a unit have significantly changed. Provides that areas in Vermont which were reviewed in the final environmental statement, but not designated as wilderness, shall be managed for multiple use in accordance with certain land management statutes. Provides that if revised land management plans are implemented, areas not recommended for wilderness designation need not be managed for the purpose of protecting their suitability for such designation. Limits the application of these provisions to national forest system roadless lands in Vermont which are less than 5,000 acres in size. Title II: White Rocks National Recreation Area - Designates certain lands in the Green Mountain National Forest, Vermont, as the White Rocks National Recreation Area. Withdraws federally owned lands within the White Rocks National Recreation Area from all forms of appropriation under mineral leasing laws and geothermal leasing laws. Directs the Secretary to: (1) permit hunting, fishing, and trapping within the boundaries of the White Rocks National Recreation Area in accordance with Federal and State law; (2) submit a comprehensive management plan for the recreation area to specified congressional committees; and (3) provide for public participation in the preparation and review of such comprehensive management plan."
