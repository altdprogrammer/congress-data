    "text": "Water Supply Rehabilitation and Conservation Act of 1983 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, through the Chief of Engineers, to make loans for the rehabilitation, expansion, or improvement of certain water supply systems to: (1) any department, agency, or instrumentality of a State or local government which operates a water supply system for at least 10,000 persons; or (2) any person who operates a water supply system under certain conditions. Prohibits such loans from exceeding 80 percent of the cost of such water supply project. Limits the amount the Secretary may lend under this Act, in any fiscal year: (1) to any water system supply operator; and (2) for water supply projects in any State. Prohibits any loans under this Act: (1) which do not have a purpose related to water supply or water conservation; (2) for water acquisition by one water supplier of another water supplier who services more than 1,000 persons; or (3) for any project solely intended to increase the number of persons served by a water supply system. Sets forth procedures for applying for such loans (including the payment of one percent of the amount of such loan requested). Authorizes the Secretary to make loans under this Act only to technologically and financially feasible systems which constitute a reasonable risk under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans under this Act to an operator of a water supply system only if the Secretary determines that such operator will implement a model water conservation program or its equivalent. Defines \"model water conservation program.\" Requires the Secretary to enter into an agreement with each person to whom a loan is made under this Act. Sets forth some of the terms of such agreement. Directs that amounts submitted with loan applications and loan repayments be deposited in the Treasury. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1987."
