States that the project shall consist of the Fallbrook and DeLuz Dams and Reservoirs, pipelines, regulation facilities, or other facilities required to provide water to the Fallbrook Public Utility District and the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. States that appropriation of construction funds is contingent upon a secretarial determination of economic justification and environmental acceptability based upon studies in progress. Requires that any modifications of the plan for certain purposes be implemented only with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Navy. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to determine certain interest rates related to the project. Requires the Secretary to enter into contracts with certain entities, including the Department of the Navy, for the delivery of project water and for repayment of the reimbursable construction costs. Requires certain proceeds from the sale of surplus project water to be credited to the Department of the Navy. Authorizes appropriations."
