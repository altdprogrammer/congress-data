Requires the agreement to provide that a physician shall be paid only on the basis of an assignment for all services provided to individuals enrolled under part B. Directs the Secretary to: (1) publish a list of all participating physicians; (2) develop a uniform claims form for use by all participating physicians; and (3) establish an advisory committee on physician reimbursement. Prohibits Medicare participation by a hospital unless every physician who is on the medical staff and who furnishes services to inpatients has entered into an assignment agreement with the Secretary."
