    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Government Operations with amendment, H. Rept. 98-815) Federal Telecommunications Privacy Act of 1984 - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to prohibit any Federal officer or employee from permitting the recording of, or listening-in on, any conversation on the Federal telecommunications system or any business conversation between a Federal officer or employee and any other person on any other telecommunications system. Permits, as exceptions to the above prohibition, the recording of, or listening-in on, such a conversation: (1) without the consent of any party to the conversation if authorized under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, or other applicable law; (2) with the consent of one party for law enforcement, counterintelligence, or public safety purposes, for ensuring the accuracy of verbal instructions to operating elements at a military command center and for preserving a record of such instructions to enhance the command and control of such elements, for counterterrorism purposes if the recording or listening-in is performed outside the United States, for service monitoring required to effectively perform the agency mission, or by a handicapped employee if necessary to his or her official duties; or (3) with the consent of all the parties to the conversation. Sets forth restrictions and disclosure requirements for certain authorized recording or listening-in activities. Requires that any request to the General Services Administration for acquisition approval or installation of listening-in or recording devices be accompanied by a determination signed by the agency head specifying the need for such devices, the location and number of telephones and recorders involved, the operating times and a specific expiration date, and the justification for the use of such devices. Directs an agency to reevaluate the need for such a determination authorizing listening-in or recording of telephone conversations at least every two years. Provides that any Federal officer or employee who violates the prohibition against the unauthorized recording of, or listening-in on, any conversation shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for up to one year, or both and shall forfeit employment with the United States. Provides that any recording or transcript of a conversation under, or in violation of, this Act shall constitute a Federal record and may not be disposed of except as authorized under current statute."
