    "text": "Amends the Small Business Act to prohibit the Small Business Administration (SBA) from denying financial assistance to a small business solely because its primary operation is: (1) book, newspaper, magazine, greeting card, or history calendar publication or distribution; (2) radio or television broadcasting; (3) film, record, or video tape production or distribution; (4) instruction or tutoring academic subjects; or (5) a similar operation. Permits such denial if the SBA determines after a hearing that assistance will be adverse to a legitimate public interest or used primarily to promote or criticize political or religious ideas."
