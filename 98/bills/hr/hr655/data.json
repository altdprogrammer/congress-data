(Currently, the payment of disability benfits during appeal may be continued only through the earlier of: (1) the month preceding the month in which a decision is made after a hearing; (2) the month preceding the month in which no request for administrative appeal is pending; or (3) June 1984.) Repeals the provision making the authority for continued payment of disability benefits during appeal applicable only to disability determinations made before October 1, 1983."
