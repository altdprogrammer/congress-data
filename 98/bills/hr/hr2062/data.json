Specifies congressional intent to authorize a program that: (1) establishes a system of marine sanctuaries by identifying marine environments of special significance due to their resource or human use value; (2) provides comprehensive area management complementing existing authorities; (3) supports scientific research and enhances public appreciation of such areas; and (4) facilitates public and private uses of such areas compatible with the primary objective of resource protection. Defines \"marine environment\" to mean: (1) the ocean waters and the continental shelf over which the United States asserts resource jurisdiction; and (2) the great Lakes and their connecting waters. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to designate any discrete area as a national marine sanctuary if such designation fulfills the policies of this title and: (1) such area's resource or human use values give it special national significance; (2) existing State and Federal authorities are inadequate to assure comprehensive area management; and (3) such area's size will facilitate comprehensive areawide management. Lists factors to be considered in making such findings. Requires the Secretary to consult with interested congressional committees, Federal, State, and Regional Fishery Management Council officials, and other persons in determining whether an area meets sanctuary designation standards. Sets forth designation provisions. Requires the Secretary to: (1) publish in the Federal Register notice of such designation and proposed implementing regulations; (2) notify each House of Congress with a prospectus on the proposal; (3) provide the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council with the opportunity to draft implementing regulations for fishing within the United States Fishery Conservation Zone; and (4) consider before making the designation any report from either the House or Senate committee with jurisdiction in the matter that disagrees with anything in the prospectus. States that a designation or designation term shall take effect unless: (1) Congress disapproves within 90 days; (2) the Secretary withdraws the designation; or (3) the Governor or Governors of States having jurisdiction over the area certify within 60 days of the designation date that such designation is unacceptable. States that regulations shall be applied according to recognized principles of international law. Exempts from application any person not a U.S. citizen operating outside U.S. jurisdiction if the regulations are not in accord with such principles or otherwise authorized by an agreement between the United States and the foreign state of which the affected person is a citizen. Requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register the designation and terms of each sanctuary that takes effect under this title. Requires the Secretary to submit an annual report to Congress (on or before November 1) regarding areas being considered for sanctuary designation. Establishes civil penalties of up to $50,000 for violations of this title. Vests jurisdiction in the U.S. district courts. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1986."
