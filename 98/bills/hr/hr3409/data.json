Provides that certain individuals shall not be disqualified from receiving any additional benefits provided under this Act. Amends the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 (title II of P.L. 98-8) to add provisions defining eligible recipient agencies. Revises provisions of such Act relating to the availability of Commodity Credit Corporation commodities. Adds provisions relating to initial processing costs, Federal and State responsibilities, and assurances concerning anticipated use of commodities. Extends through FY 1985 the authorization of appropriations under such Act for payments to States for storage and distribution costs. Requires that at least 20 percent of such funds be paid for actual costs incurred by nonprofit eligible recipient agencies providing nutrition relief to needy persons. Limits such payments to five percent of the value of the commodities distributed by any such agency. Prohibits, with specified exceptions, sale or other disposal in commercial channels of any commodities distributed under such Act. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) minimize regulatory, recordkeeping, and paperwork requirements under such Act; and (2) publish estimates of the types and quantities of commodities likely to be available under such Act. Makes specified determinations of the Secretary under such Act final and unreviewable. Amends the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 to make technical corrections and to revise the formula for determining a cost reimbursement limitation under such Act."
