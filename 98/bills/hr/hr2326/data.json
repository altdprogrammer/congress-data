    "text": "Florida Wilderness Act of 1983 - Designates the following lands in Florida as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Bradwell Bay Wilderness Addition in the Apalachicola National Forest; (2) the Mud Swamp/New River Wilderness in the Apalachicola National Forest; (3) the Big Gum Swamp Wilderness in the Osceola National Forest; (4) the Alexander Springs Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest; (5) the Juniper Prairie Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest; (6) the Little Lake George Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest; and (7) the Billies Bay Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest. Prohibits the Department of the Interior from issuing phosphate leases in the Osceola National Forest until the President recommends to Congress that such leases be permitted in a specified area of the forest, based upon a national need for phosphate. Requires the President to submit the basis for such recommendation, a statement of conditions governing the activity, and the required environmental impact statements. Makes a Presidential recommendation effective only upon enactment of a joint resolution of Congress approving it. Provides that phosphate lease applicants whose lease applications have been denied on the grounds that they have not made discoveries of valuable deposits will be compensated in accordance with this Act if the lease denials are challenged in court and the court finds that valuable deposit discoveries exist. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to determine the present fair market value of any leases denied on such grounds or because of the leasing prohibition under this Act for those applicants for which the court has found that valuable deposit discoveries exist. Requires that monetary credits based upon the fair market value be extended to such lease applicants within one year after any final judicial determination for that portion of bonus payments, rents, or royalties paid to the Government on mineral, oil, or gas leases held by such applicants. Provides that the designation of the Big Gum Swamp Wilderness will not alter phosphate lease rights applicable to lands within the wilderness. Allows waivers of the time deadlines under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
