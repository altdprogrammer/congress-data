    "text": "Telephone Equity Act of 1983 - Provides that a specified decision of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) relating to telephone access charges (C.C. docket numbered 78-72) shall cease to have effect. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require the FCC to establish a system of charges to compensate exchange common carriers (local telephone companies) for exchange access and to change the system of settlements and jurisdictional separation of property and expenses in force on the date of enactment of this Act. Sets forth the purposes of the system of charges, including ensuring the continued universal availability of telephone service. Requires exchange common carriers to file with the FCC a tariff for exchange access for each of its exchange areas. Authorizes a carrier to file, or the FCC or State commission to require a carrier to file, a joint tariff for exchange access for all its exchange areas within a single State until a specified date. Requires carriers to submit a joint tariff for exchange access if more than one exchange common carrier serves an exchange area and to divide revenues in a manner approved by the FCC. Authorizes a State commission to authorize or require exchange common carriers within the State to divide revenues from exchange access charges. Sets forth the information that must be included in each tariff. Requires each tariff to consist of four charges to be recovered from interexchange (long distance) carriers. Requires an exchange common carrier to submit to the FCC a tariff for exchange access available from such carrier for interexchange carriers or others who indirectly interconnect with the exchange carriers. Sets forth the charges to be included in such tariff. Requires an exchange common carrier to submit to the FCC a tariff under which any interexchange carrier or other person who, without connection to such carrier and for commercial purposes, makes available facilities or services comparable to those available from an exchange carrier for exchange access shall pay a charge reflecting the availability of the exchange carrier's facilities for exchange access as an alternative for the facilities of such person. Requires that provision of and payment for exchange access shall be solely in accordance with the applicable tariffs. Requires that owners and operators of interexchange communication facilities which do not need direct interconnection notify the appropriate exchange carriers, the FCC, and the appropriate State commissions. Imposes a fine for failure to provide such notification. Requires the FCC to establish methods to ascertain and fully apportion the cost of services, facilities, and other factors used jointly or in common to provide exchange services and exchange access. Directs the FCC to establish the recordkeeping forms for carriers providing exchange access. Directs the FCC to delegate to each State commission its authority to divide revenues from exchange access charges. Sets the manner of reviewing charges that an interexchange carrier or customer violated a tariff. Requires the initial tariffs for exchange access to take effect July 1, 1985. Sets forth transitional provisions. Directs the FCC to establish the Universal Service Board in order to: (1) ensure equitable and efficient economic treatment of users of common carrier services and exchange services and carriers providing such services; (2) provide an orderly transition to the system of exchange access charges; and (3) achieve cooperation between the Federal Government and the States in carrying out specified purposes. Requires the Universal Service Board to: (1) establish and maintain formulas for determining the payments required by the Universal Service Fund and to oversee the distribution of funds from the Universal Service Fund by the exchange access board; (2) make such changes and modifications necessary for the orderly transition to the system of exchange access charges; and (3) determine at regular intervals the relative assignment by exchange common carriers of the production costs of providing exchange service and access. Sets forth factors to be considered in determining such production costs. Establishes the Universal Service Fund. Requires the Universal Service Board to determine annually the uniform surcharges on the amounts collected by exchange common carriers for exchange access so that the Fund has enough money to make its required payments. Entitles an exchange common carrier to receive payments from the Fund if the carrier certifies to the Board that the carrier's average costs for non- traffic-sensitive facilities per customer access line exceed 115 percent of the national average of such costs. Requires the Fund to include a transitional account for payments to exchange common carriers whose annual total revenues do not reach a specified level. Requires the Universal Service Board to establish and oversee an exchange access board to administer the accounts of the Universal Service Fund. Provides for audits and adjustments to payments from the Universal Service Fund. Requires the FCC to establish depreciation rules as soon as possible. Requires the tariff for interexchange service, if it was in effect on July 1, 1983, to be based on the national average of the cost of providing interexchange service. Authorizes a State commission to require exchange common carriers to lease and maintain on request a single basic one-line telephone instrument to any subscriber within the State on the basis of a tariff that includes all the costs of providing and maintaining the instrument. Requires each exchange carrier, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, to provide lifeline (discounted) telephone service for eligible individuals. Defines eligible individuals to be individuals receiving or eligible to receive aid to families with dependent children, supplemental security income benefits, or benefits under the Food Stamp Act of 1977. Prohibits a carrier or exchange carrier from subsidizing its unregulated commercial activities with revenues from its regulated communications services."
