    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-07-11", 
    "text": "Flat Rate Tax Act of 1983 - Title I - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a 15 percent flat rate tax on the gross income of individuals in excess of $10,000. Repeals all income tax deductions, exclusions, and credits except for the charitable contribution deduction, the deduction for interest payments on a home mortgage, and the business expense deduction. Title II: Taxpayer Protection Standards - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit the imposition of a lien on taxpayer property for the collection of unpaid taxes until the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has made an attempt to enter into an installment agreement with the taxpayer, exhausted all procedural methods for the collection of such tax, and obtained a court order to make such a levy. Permits any Federal or State court judge in the district in which the taxpayer property is located to order a levy on such property for payment of taxes. Sets forth standards for the issuance of a court-ordered levy. Exempts from a tax levy the taxpayer's principal residence, fuel, furniture, and other personal effects, as well as books and tools of a trade, business or profession. Makes binding upon the IRS any written advice given to a taxpayer by an IRS officer or employee acting in an official capacity unless such advice was based on inaccurate information provided by the taxpayer. Requires the IRS to inform the taxpayer that oral advice is not binding unless it has been reduced to writing. Makes binding upon the IRS any installment agreement made with the taxpayer regardless of any change in the taxpayer's financial situation or ability to pay. Allows the taxpayer an award of court costs in any civil action brought by the United States for the determination, collection, or refund of any tax, interest, or penalty. Establishes procedures for the IRS in conducting interviews with the taxpayer in connection with the assessment of a tax deficiency. Allows a taxpayer to request that any such interview be conducted in the home of the taxpayer at a convenient time, that the taxpayer be permitted to make a recording of such interview, and that the taxpayer be accompanied by a witness. Prohibits the IRS from promulgating any regulation or ruling which would be applied with retroactive effect."
