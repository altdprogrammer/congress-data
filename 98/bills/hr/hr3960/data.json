Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in North Carolina shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in North Carolina which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in North Carolina reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness or for wilderness study from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in North Carolina without express congressional authorization. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to review the following lands with respect to their suitability as wilderness areas: (1) the Harper Creek Wilderness Study Area in the Pisgah National Forest; (2) the Lost Cove Wilderness Study Area in the Pisgah National Forest; (3) the Overflow Wilderness Study Area in the Nantahala National Forest; (4) the Snowbird Wilderness Study Area in the Nantahala National Forest; and (5) the Craggy Mountain Wilderness Study Area in the Pisgah National Forest. Requires the Secretary to report on such review to the President, who shall submit recommendations with respect to such wilderness study areas to Congress within three years after enactment of this Act. States that the provisions above shall also apply to national forest system roadless lands in North Carolina which are less than 5,000 acres in size."
