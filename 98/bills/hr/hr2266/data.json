    "text": "Education Consolidation and Improvement Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to revise provisions for determining the allotment of basic grants to States for programs operated by local educational agencies. Provides that the criteria for poverty used by the Bureau of the Census in compiling the most recent available decennial census be used in making specified determinations for purposes of such basic grant allotments to States. Shortens to two years the period of continuation of migrant status and program eligibility for a migratory child of a migratory agricultural worker or migratory fisherman residing in the area served by an agency carrying out a program or project for migratory children. Eliminates the specified minimum amount of program funds which must be reserved for coordination of migrant education activities. Amends the Educational Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 to make a technical amendment to local educational agency grant application requirements which specifies that the low-income children to be provided significant help are educationally deprived. Makes additional technical amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the Omnibus Education Reconciliation Act of 1981, and the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981."
