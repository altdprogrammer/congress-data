    "date": "1983-04-13", 
    "text": "Defense Procurement Reform Act of 1983 - Requires the Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of the military departments, and other specified agency heads to use certain competitive procedures when making defense contracts. Requires such heads to: (1) solicit sealed bids and make the contract by accepting a bid; (2) solicit proposals from more than one source and make the contract in response to the solicitation; or (3) use a combination of procedures. Sets forth the factors to consider when determining which competitive procedure to use, including whether the award of the contract may be made on the basis of price only or whether it is necessary to conduct discussions with the offerors. Permits an agency head to exclude particular sources from the procedures to foster alternative sources and increase or maintain competition. Treats all purchases or contracts made under these procedures as if they were made under sealed-bid procedures for purposes of the Walsh-Healey Act and the Davis-Bacon Act. Authorizes an agency head to use noncompetitive procedures when: (1) property or service is available only from a single source; (2) the requirement is urgent; (3) an essential industrial capability must be maintained; (4) international agreements require directed procurements; or (5) when an unsolicited unique innovation is proposed by a particular contractor. Specifies other circumstances and factors compelling the use of noncompetitive procedures. Directs an agency head to use simplified procedures for small purchases. Directs the Secretary of Defense to submit any proposed changes in the small purchases threshold to the Armed Services Committees for 30 days before they become effective. Sets forth contract award procedures for sealed bids or competitive proposals. Permits an agency head to negotiate any kind of contract in the best interests of the United States, with specified limitations. Permits the Coast Guard and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to enter into multiyear contracts if it is in the national interest to do so. Eliminates existing written finding requirements for contract negotiating decisions. Eliminates certain restrictions on the delegation of contract authority. Requires examination of books and records of contractors to be coordinated to the extent possible. Extends contractor debarment and suspension provisions to contractors of the Coast Guard and NASA."
