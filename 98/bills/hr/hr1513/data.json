Rept. 98-39 (Part I)) Emergency Commodity Distribution Act of 1983 - Amends the National School Lunch Act to require the Secretary of Agriculture to make unobligated Commodity Credit Corporation stocks available within 60 days. Sets forth eligible recipient agencies, including those serving children and schools, the elderly, and the unemployed, low-income people, and disaster victims. Directs the Secretary to make commodities available without charge in forms suitable for home or institutional use. Provides cash assistance to States (five cents per pound) for commodity- related administrative costs. Directs the States to use such funds to defray agency costs in obtaining and distributing donated non-Federal commodities or food items. Requires the States to ensure that the amount of administrative funds provided does not exceed actual commodity and food distribution costs. Prohibits States from charging recipient agencies for related costs. Authorizes the Secretary to distribute commodities directly to recipient agencies, and requires such distribution where State agencies are prohibited from so doing. Directs the Secretary and the States to enter into inventory agreements with private companies to process commodities into food products. Requires the Secretary to periodically publish in the Federal Register a list of available commodities. Terminates the provisions of this Act as of September 30, 1985. Requires the Secretary to continue his scientific nutrition research."
