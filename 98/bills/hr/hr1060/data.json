    "text": "Long-Term Investment in Full Employment Act of 1983 - Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act for FY 1983 through 1987. Directs the Secretary of Labor, from such appropriations for any fiscal year, to make allocations to the States on the basis of relative numbers of unemployed individuals. Directs the Secretary, from the amount allocated to any State, to make grants to the State government and other appropriate agencies and organizations within the State to establish employment programs. Requires that such programs: (1) guarantee employment for adult residents of the program area who have been unemployed for one month or more and who are ready, willing, and able to work; (2) pay a wage not less than the higher of the applicable minimum wage or the comparable prevailing wage, for at least a 40-hour workweek; (3) provide employment for the maintenance, repair, renovation, or reconstruction of decaying public facilities, including highways, roads, parks, water and sewer facilities, schools, hospitals, and intercity and intracity rail systems; (4) provide employment for an initial period of six months; and (5) provide an additional six-months employment for individuals who enroll in and regularly attend vocational training or retraining educational institutions or who obtain an appropriate degree from such institutions. Permits program funds to be used to pay wages and benefits and reasonable tuition and other expenses. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) prescribe regulations for the administration of such programs and to delegate other powers and duties to Federal officers or employees; and (2) conduct research and report on the development potential of the unemployed and an information system concerning such programs. Sets forth nondiscrimination provisions for such programs. Sets forth program labor standards relating to conditions of employment and training, health and safety standards, workers' compensation benefits, and job benefits and working conditions. Prohibits use of funds under this Act for contributions on behalf of any participant to retirement systems or plans. Prohibits displacement of any currently employed worker by participants in programs funded under this Act. Prohibits such programs from impairing existing contracts for services or collective bargaining agreements. Requires the written concurrence of the labor organization and the employer concerned before any such program which would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement may be undertaken. Prohibits program participants from being employed or job openings being filled when: (1) any other individual is on layoff from the same or any substantially equivalent job; or (2) the employer has terminated the employment of any regular employee or otherwise reduced its work force with the intention of filling the vacancy by hiring a participant whose wages are subsidized under this Act. Prohibits creation of jobs in a promotional line that will infringe in any way on the promotional opportunities of currently employed individuals. Requires recipients of funds under this Act to provide the Secretary with assurances that none of such funds will be used to assist, promote, or deter union organizing. Requires that an opportunity for comment be provided for any labor organization representing a substantial number of employees engaged in similar work or training in the same areas as that proposed to be funded under this Act. Applies the wage rate requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act to all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors in works federally assisted under this Act."
