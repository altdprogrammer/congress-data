    "text": "Academic Libraries and Information Technology Enhancement Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise title II of such Act. Retitles title II (College and Research Library Assistance and Library Training and Research) as \"Academic Library and Information Technology Enhancement.\" Replaces title II part D provisions for design of the National Periodical System (funding for the design of such System under such Act will expire at the end of FY 1985) with new part D provisions for College Library Technology and Cooperation Grants. Extends through FY 1989 the authorization of appropriations for the following programs under title II: (1) part A (College Library Resources); (2) part B (Library Training, Research, and Development); and (3) part C (Strengthening Research Library Resources). Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1989 for the new part D programs (College Library Technology and Cooperation Grants). Revises part A provisions for college library resource development grants to provide that such grants shall be made only to eligible institutions of higher education or combinations thereof (or branches of such an institution which are located in other communities). Deletes provisions for making such grants to other public and private nonprofit library institutions which perform certain functions. Removes the $10,000 maximum limit on such a grant. Adds to application requirements for such grants satisfactory assurances that the institution's library: (1) is participating in one or more agreements with other institutions for the sharing of library resources; and (2) will maintain or develop access for students to academically oriented data bases. Permits the latter assurance about maintenance or development of data base access to be waived in very unusual circumstances. Requires that an institution, in order to be eligible for such a grant, must: (1) be dependent, because of its limited financial resources, on the grant for improving the quality of its programs or maintaining accreditation; and (2) provide the Secretary with specified assurances relating to its need for the grant. Directs the Secretary of Education, in making awards of such grants, to take into consideration the relative need of the institution and its library based on specified criteria. Requires that the amount of the grant award reflect both such relative need and the number of students who will benefit. Directs the National Commission on Libraries and Information Sciences to: (1) study the effectiveness of specified criteria for such grants in directing funds to libraries with the greatest need; and (2) report the results of such study to Congress by the end of FY 1988. Revises part B provisions for library training, research, and development to provide that, of appropriations for part B: (1) two-thirds shall be available for library career training programs, including fellowships and traineeships; and (2) one-third for research and demonstration projects. Deletes provisions including improvement of information technology among such research and demonstration projects. Repeals provisions for special purpose grants under part B, but includes similar provisions under the new part D. Sets forth the new part D provisions for College Library Technology and Cooperation Grants. Establishes a program under which the Secretary of Education is authorized to make grants for technological equipment and other special purposes. Provides that such part D grants may be made to specified entities (similar in part to those under part B special purpose grant provisions): (1) institutions of higher education which demonstrate a need for special assistance to acquire, install, maintain, or replace technological equipment (including computer hardware and software) necessary to participate in networks for sharing of library resources; (2) combinations of higher education institutions which demonstrate a need for special assistance in establishing and strengthening joint-use library facilities, resources, or equipment; (3) other public and private nonprofit organizations which provide library and information services to institutions of higher education on a formal cooperative basis to establish, develop, or expand programs or projects that improve their services to institutions of higher education; and (4) institutions of higher education conducting research or demonstration projects to meet special national or regional needs in utilizing technology to enhance library or information sciences. Directs the Secretary, from funds appropriated for the new part D provisions, to make competitive awards to institutions or combinations of institutions in each of such four categories. Sets the minimum award at $15,000. Permits such award to be expended over a three-year period. Requires that an application for such a grant: (1) be approved by the Secretary on the basis of criteria prescribed in regulations; and (2) provide satisfactory assurance that the applicant will match grant funds with expenditures equal to at least one-third of the grant amount, for the same purpose as such grant during the three-year period for which the grant is sought. Revises title II program purposes (under the new title II heading Academic Library and Information Technology Enhancement) to replace references to assistance in establishment of a National Periodical System Corporation with references to new part D assistance to college and university libraries in acquiring technological equipment and conducting research in information technology."
