Declares that the Commission should explore a program that would: (1) serve as the ultimate coordinating body of collaborative programs between Mexico and the United States; (2) contribute to economic development in Mexico; (3) serve as a source of financial and technical assistance; (4) target assistance based on findings of need and take into consideration the findings of the United States-Mexican Science and Technology Mixed Commission; (5) draw extensively on and foster the development of local Mexican businesses, civic and labor organizations, and rely on private sector initiatives; and (6) rely on volunteers with skills not sufficiently available in Mexico. Directs the Commission to study how the program should be administered. Requires the results of the study on the people-to-people program to be included in the Commission's final report to the President and to be transmitted to Congress."
