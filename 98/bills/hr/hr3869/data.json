Requires every national banking association within each Federal Reserve district to obtain a certificate of membership in the Federal Reserve bank of such district. Provides that member banks of every Federal Reserve bank shall be individually responsible to the extent of six percent of the paid-up capital stock and surplus of such member bank for the contracts and debts of the appropriate Federal reserve bank. Declares that Federal Reserve banks shall have no capital stock. Requires the surrender of stocks held in each Federal Reserve bank within five years. Requires each Federal Reserve bank to pay each former stockholder the par value of such surrendered stock within ten years following such five year period."
