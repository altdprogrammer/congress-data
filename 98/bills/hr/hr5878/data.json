    "text": "Copyright Royalty Tribunal and Cable Television Reform Act of 1984 - Title I: Copyright Royalty Tribunal - Amends the copyright law to reduce the membership on the Copyright Royalty Tribunal from five to three commissioners. Requires the Tribunal to appoint a general counsel and chief economist. States that review of Tribunal decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals remains unaffected by the creation of the Tribunal in the legislative branch. Requires the Tribunal in adjusting copyright royalty rates for the carriage of television broadcast signals by cable systems to also consider: (1) the extent to which television broadcast stations compensate copyright owners for the secondary transmission of their signals by cable systems located outside their respective local service areas; (2) the extent to which the value of additional distant signals decreases as such signals are carried by the systems; and (3) the impact of the rates on cable subscribers as to the availability and cost of receiving copyrighted materials. Title II: Cable Televisions - Excludes from a specified adjustment in royalty rates: (1) the first three distant independent television broadcast signals carried by any cable system which does not carry any local independent television broadcast signals; or (2) the first two distant independent television broadcast signals carried by any cable system which carries any local independent television broadcast signals. Revises the royalty computation formula for secondary transmissions by a cable system to redefine gross receipts based upon the type of service offered."
