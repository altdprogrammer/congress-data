    "text": "Amends the Freedom of Information Act to allow either House of Congress or any congressional committee to request certain information, to request the presence of an officer or employee from an executive agency or an independent regulatory agency, or to request the President of the United States to give testimony regarding certain matters. Requires compliance with such request as soon as practical or no later than 30 days after its receipt, unless the information is withheld by the President in a signed statement setting forth the grounds for such denial. Provides for the filing of a civil action where an agency head, the President, or a witness declines to furnish information or testimony. Grants the United States District Court for the District of Columbia exclusive jurisdiction in this matter. Establishes a procedure for the court to follow in resolving such a dispute. Allows for an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia."
