    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require a broadcast licensee to provide any person whose personal qualities are attacked during the presentation of views in a broadcast on a controversial issue of public importance with: (1) notification of the time, date, and identification of the broadcast; (2) a script or tape of the attack; and (3) an offer of a reasonable opportunity to respond over the licensee's facilities. Excludes any attack: (1) on a foreign group or foreign public figure; (2) made by a legally qualified candidate for public office during the use of a broadcast station; (3) made by such a candidate on another such candidate; or (4) made on a bona fide news show. Requires any licensee which endorses or opposes any candidate in an editorial to transmit to the opposing candidates (in the case of an endorsing editorial) or to the candidate (in the case of an opposing editorial): (1) notification of the date and time of the editorial; (2) a script or tape of the editorial; and (3) an offer of a reasonable opportunity to respond over the licensee's facilities. Requires any licensee that permits any person, political committee, or agent thereof to purchase broadcasting time to discuss an issue of public importance outside of an election period to offer supporters of a significant contrasting view an opportunity to present a response during the same period of the day and for the same amount of time at no charge. Prohibits the licensee from censoring such response."
