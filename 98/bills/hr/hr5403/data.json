Directs the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior, after consultation with any other U.S. agencies having responsibilities for research and other scientific studies relating to the Gorda Ridge area, to prepare and submit to Congress, no later than one year after the enactment of this Act, a memorandum of understanding clarifying the respective responsibilities of each U.S. department or agency with respect to such research and studies and with respect to the President's Gorda Ridge report. Directs the President to prepare and submit, no later than September 30, 1987, a Gorda Ridge feasibility report. Requires such report to include specified information and studies and to make recommendations as to the most appropriate leasing procedures and lease values for exploratory and production activities on the Gorda Ridge."
