    "text": "Prohibits the use of Federal lands to: (1) expand the capacity of any reservoir located within the boundaries of the Yosemite National Park in California; or (2) provide access to Federal, State, or local government employees to any reservoir located within the boundaries of such park except as necessary for the operation and maintenance of such reservoir or as may be designated by the superintendant of the park. Provides that the latter prohibition shall not be effective after the adoption of an agreement by the Secretary of the Interior and the city and county of San Francisco providing for the public recreational use of the Hetch-Hetchy Reservoir. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate a portion of the Tuolumne River in California as a component of the national wild and scenic rivers system. Authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to issue licenses for the construction, operation, and maintenance of a diversion dam and an underground powerhouse with a discharge tunnel and related facilities on the main stem of the Tuolumne River. Sets forth conditions and requirements which apply to the issuance of such a license. Requires the Commission to transmit to specified congressional committees all studies, reports, and analyses carried out with respect to a preliminary permit for either such facility as well as the license application and any other motions or documents submitted to the Commission with respect to such facilities. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate a portion of the Merced River in California as a component of the national wild and scenic rivers system."
