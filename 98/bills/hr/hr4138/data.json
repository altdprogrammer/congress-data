Directs the Secretary of the Interior to administer the refuge, subject to valid existing legal rights, and to prepare a comprehensive conservation plan within three years after enactment. Declares that this Act shall not affect: (1) the Secretary's authority to conduct any oil or gas exploration or leasing program in the refuge; or (2) the rights of the State of Alaska or of any Native Alaskan individual or group to select or acquire land. Declares that this Act shall not affect any activity undertaken under any oil or gas leasing program in the refuge unless the Secretary determines that such activity will adversely affect fish or wildlife, their habitat, or the environment in a significant way. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend or terminate such activities under such circumstances, with compensation to the lessee."
