Rept. 98-284(Part II)) Radio Broadcasting to Cuba Act - Amends the Board for International Broadcasting Act of 1973 to authorize the Board to provide for radio broadcasts to Cuba. Makes providing accurate information to Cuba a purpose of such Act. Authorizes any U.S. agency or instrumentality to sell, loan, lease, or grant property and to perform services at the request of the Board. Prohibits making any grant under this Act to any corporation established to provide radio broadcasting to Cuba, unless the board of directors of such corporation consists only of members of the Board for International Broadcasting and the board of such corporation makes all major policy determinations and appoints (and fixes the compensation of) certain managerial officers and employees. Expresses the intent of Congress that the Secretary of State should seek settlement of U.S. claims against the Government of Cuba arising from Cuban interference with broadcasting in the United States. Authorizes the Board for International Broadcasting to make payments to U.S. radio broadcasting station licensees for expenses which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has determined such licensees have incurred or will incur in mitigating the effects of Cuban interference with the transmission or reception of broadcasts by these licensees. Directs the FCC to regulate and establish procedures for providing compensation to U.S. broadcasters. Authorizes appropriations for such compensation. Prohibits assigning a radio broadcasting frequency for broadcasts to Cuba until 30 days after the Comptroller General has reported to Congress on the extent of the economic harm to radio broadcast stations within the United States resulting from broadcasting interference from Cuba and the potential cost to the U.S. Government of compensating broadcasters for mitigating the adverse effects of such interference. Requires the Board for International Broadcasting, for the first two years of broadcasting pursuant to this Act, to transmit to Congress a monthly transcript of all broadcasts to Cuba. Directs the FCC to provide by regulation that no AM or FM radio broadcasting frequency may be assigned or used by any Government radio station for radio broadcasting to Cuba except that such prohibition: (1) does not apply to the frequency used for Voice of America broadcasts; and (2) does not restrict the President's war powers authority over communications. Prohibits authorizing a broadcasting frequency assignment for broadcsting to Cuba unless the FCC has received adequate assurances that the U.S. Government has tried, through direct negotiations with Cuba, to reduce the existing and potential interference to the operations of broadcast stations within the United States resulting from broadcasting from Cuba. Requires the FCC to report annually to Congress on the impact of broadcasting to Cuba on the radio broadcast stations within the United States. Terminates the use of such broadcasting frequency for broadcasts to Cuba after five fiscal years. Requires the operator of any facilities for radio broadcasts to Cuba to provide to the FCC or any appropriate congressional committee, upon request, any information which relate to such broadcasting and which are in the possession of such operator."
