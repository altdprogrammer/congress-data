    "text": "Title I: County Revenue Enhancement Act - Amends Federal law to increase from 25 percent to 35 percent the portion of all moneys received from national forests which the Secretary of the Treasury is required to pay to the States in which such forests are situated. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to pay after the end of each fiscal year 35 percent (currently 25 percent) of the net revenues received from the use of specified lands to the counties in which such lands are located. Repeals the requirement that 10 percent of revenues received from national forests during each fiscal year shall be earmarked for roads and trails within the national forests in States from which such revenues are received. Limits the total expenditures earmarked for fiscal year 1985 for the construction of forest development roads by the Forest Service. Limits the total mileage upon which such construction may begin. Directs the Comptroller General to report to the Congress upon the results of a study regarding the adequacy of forest development roads within the National Forest System in meeting the needs of timber purchasers and the Forest Service. Title II: Federal Oil and Gas Leasing Act of 1984 - Amends the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to lease onshore Federal lands for oil and gas developments. Restricts such leasing to competitive bidding. Requires the Secretary to invite the public to propose onshore Federal lands for oil or gas development leasing purposes at least once each quarter of each fiscal year. Prescribes criteria under which the Secretary must offer lands for leasing. Requires the Secretary to hold oil and gas lease sales in those States in which the public proposed two or more onshore Federal lands for leasing. Limits the amount of acreage the Secretary may lease. Sets each lease at a primary term of five years. Conditions the issuance of such a lease upon specified rental payments. Precludes actions taken by the Secretary regarding leases from being considered major Federal actions for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
