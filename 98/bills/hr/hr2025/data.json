    "text": "Title I: Revisions of the Congressional Budget Process - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require the first concurrent resolution on the budget for each fiscal year to set forth the budgets for each of the next two ensuing fiscal years. Amends the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921, to require that the presidential budget set forth an explanation and summary of the differences between it and the congressional budget contained in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to provide for the annual adoption of one concurrent resolution on the budget. Repeals the requirement of a second concurrent resolution on the budget. Allows the Committees on the Budget of the two Houses of Congress to confer and reach agreement on reestimates to the most recent budget resolution. Requires such Committees to jointly publish a report explaining the nature of the reestimates. Revises the reconciliation process to include reconciliation directions if needed in the first budget resolution. Requires completion of the reconciliation process within 60 days. Makes the budget resolution binding. Reforms the appropriations process. Requires Congress on or before September 30 of each year to complete action on an omnibus appropriation bill. Provides that the appropriation bill shall contain all regular appropriations for the fiscal year and not be subject to deferred enrollment. Provides for automatic continuing appropriations if by the beginning of the fiscal year no sums have been appropriated for that year for programs, projects, or activities for which sums were appropriated for the preceding year. Requires the Joint Economic Committee (Committee) to transmit to each House of Congress periodic reports containing its recommendations for amending laws which provide spending authority. Directs the Committee to establish a timetable for reviewing all programs which provide entitlement authority and for reporting to each House of Congress. Requires the President to include the current services budget in his general budget recommendations to Congress. Title II: Federal Credit Activities - Subtitle A: Reports Regarding Federal Credit Activity - Directs the Council of Economic Advisers, in its annual report to the Congress, to examine the relationship between Federal credit activity during the previous year and: (1) the condition of the economy; (2) the availability and cost of credit in the private sector; and (3) the exercise of monetary and fiscal policy by the Government. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to direct the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in their biannual reports to Congress concerning recent developments affecting economic trends in the Nation, to examine the effects of Federal credit activity on the availability and cost of credit in the private sector and on the exercise of monetary policy by the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee. Amends the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921, to require the President, in the annual budget statement to the Congress, to include all essential facts regarding direct Government loans and loan guarantees. Subtitle B: Changes in Congressional Budget Procedures - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require the concurrent resolution on the budget for each fiscal year to set forth the appropriate level of total gross obligations for the principal amount of direct loans and the appropriate level of total commitments to guarantee loans, and to allocate such totals among the major functional categories of the budget. Directs each standing committee of the House and Senate to submit its estimates of direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments provided for in legislation under its jurisdiction by March 15 of each year for the consideration of the Budget Committee in formulating the budget resolution. Directs the House and Senate Banking Committees to submit recommendations to the Budget Committees for the aggregate levels of direct loans and loan guarantees in each fiscal year. Requires the joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report on the budget resolution to include an estimate allocation of the total levels of direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments among the committees of the House and Senate. Directs the Committees on Appropriations to provide such an allocation among their subcommittees as soon as practicable after a budget resolution has been agreed to. Requires the House Committee on Appropriations, before reporting any regular appropriations bills, to submit a summary report to the House comparing the credit authority contained in such bills to the levels agreed to in the budget resolution. Requires any report accompanying legislation conferring new budget authority or increasing tax expenditures to include information on direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments. Establishes a deadline for the completion of action on legislation providing credit authority. Requires the reconciliation process to take into account Federal obligations and commitments on loans and loan guarantees. Declares out of order any measure brought up for consideration in either House which would increase the level of loan obligations and guarantee commitments agreed to in the budget process without limiting such increase to amounts provided in appropriation Acts. Subtitle C: Budget Execution - Includes all annual limitations on direct loans and loan guarantees within the definition of appropriations. Subtitle D: Amendments to House Rules - Amends rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives to require each standing committee (other than the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on the Budget) to review and make appropriate recommendations with respect to the consistency and uniformity of the different definitions, default provisions, policies, interest rates, and other terms and conditions relating to direct loan, loan insurance, and loan guarantee activities included in any laws of which the subject matter is within the jurisdiction of that committee. Subtitle E: Construction and Effective Dates - Declares that the amendments made by this Act concerning Federal credit activity and the Congressional budget process are enacted by Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and the House.

Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to promulgate regulations providing for the consistent classification of Federal capital investment spending. Title V: Dedicated Revenue Incentives - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to make it out of order for either the House or the Senate to consider any budget legislation including or assuming reconciliation instructions with respect to any budget process enforcement device restricting any legislation in which the spending authority or budget authority is derived from any trust fund where the amount of anticipated receipts, or the budget authority estimated to result, exceeds the estimated amount of total new obligational authority. Title VI: Impoundment Control of Loans and Loan Guarantees - Amends the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to extend impoundment control to direct loans and loan guarantees. Requires authority for such loans and guarantees to be fully committed unless, within 45 days after it receives a rescission proposal from the President, Congress approves the rescission.
