    "text": "Amends the Clayton Act to permit any person liable for damages for price-fixing to claim contribution from co-conspirators for the share of such damages attributable to their sales or purchases of goods and services. Declares that a release or covenant not to sue or enforce a judgment received in settlement by one conspirator shall not discharge any co-conspirators from liability, unless expressly provided. Directs the court to reduce the claim against the co-conspirators subject to liability by the greatest of: (1) the amount stipulated by such release or covenant; (2) the amount paid in settlement; or (3) treble the actual damages attributable to the settling person's sales or purchases of goods or services. Declares that a settlement shall release the recipient from liability from contribution, unless it is not consummated."
