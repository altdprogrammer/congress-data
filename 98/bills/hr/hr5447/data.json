Directs the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with others, to develop and publish a long-term artificial reef plan. Requires the plan to address certain items. Directs the Secretary of the Army in issuing permits for artificial reefs to: (1) consult with and consider the views of appropriate Federal agencies, States, local governments, and other interested parties; (2) ensure consistency with the standards established in this Act; (3) ensure that the maintenance and financial responsibility for and the title to the artificial reef construction material is clear; and (4) notify the Secretary of Commerce of any need to deviate from the plan. Requires each permit to require certain information. Sets forth the liability of the permittee and the owner of artificial reef construction materials. Establishes civil penalties for permit violations. Amends existing Federal law to authorize the use of obsolete ships for use as artificial reefs (currently only Liberty ships are used). Defines \"obsolete ship\" to mean vessels owned by the Department of Transportation which are insufficient for use in the national defense reserve fleet. Transfers the authority of the Secretary of Commerce under such law to the Secretary of Transportation. States that nothing in this Act is intended to diminish or extend the current authorities of the Tennessee Valley Authority or the States to regulate artificial reef development within their respective areas of jurisdiction."
