    "text": "Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from issuing Federal coal leases prior to May 1, 1984, unless the Secretary: (1) has developed an analysis of the economic and geographic variables affecting the value of each Federal coal lease; (2) has prepared and published new internal procedures for conducting coal lease valuations; (3) has developed and published guidelines for additional and experimental bidding systems for regional coal sales; (4) has calculated minimum regulatory selling prices for coal leases in each Federal coal region on a cents per ton basis; (5) has revised the procedures for determining fair market value so as to include specific quantitative tests; (6) has established written internal procedures for safeguarding coal lease pricing, economic valuation, and other proprietary data against unauthorized disclosure; and (7) has submitted to the appropriate congressional committees a report detailing the specific actions taken to implement clauses one through six. Directs the Secretary to actively pursue a land exchange program to exchange Federal lands under the administrative jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management containing coal deposits for non-Federal lands having significant environmental, archaeological, historical, and paleontological values. Authorizes the Secretary on and after May 1, 1984, to proceed with the coal lease sale in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico coal lease sale scheduled for December 1983, if the Secretary has made certain that: (1) a representative of the Navaho Nation, to be nominated by the chairman of the Navaho Nation, has been appointed to the regional coal team; (2) the regional coal team revises its recommendations to take into account any views of such representative; (3) the Bureau of Land Management has prepared a draft environmental impact statement on the proposed processing of all pending preference right lease applications for leases in the San Juan Basin; and (4) certain conditions regarding preference right lease applications are effective."
