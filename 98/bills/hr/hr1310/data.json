Provides that a public secondary school has a limited open forum whenever such school grants an offering to or opportunity for one or more noncurriculum related student groups to meet on school premises during noninstructional time. Provides that a school shall be deemed to offer a fair opportunity to students who wish to conduct a meeting within its limited open forum if such school uniformly provides that: (1) the meeting is voluntary and student-initiated; (2) there is no sponsorship of the meeting by the school, the government, or its agents, or employees; (3) government or school employees or agents are present at religious meetings only in a nonparticipatory capacity; (4) the meeting does not materially and substantially interfere with the orderly conduct of educational activities at the school; and (5) nonschool persons may not direct, conduct, control, or regularly attend activities of student groups. Provides that nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize the United States or any State or local government to: (1) influence the form or content of any prayer or other religious activity; (2) require any person to participate in prayer or other regligious activity; (3) expend public funds beyond the incidental cost of providing space for student-initiated meetings; (4) compel any school agent or employee to attend a school meeting if the content of the speech at the meeting is contrary to the beliefs of the agent or employee; (5) sanction meetings that are otherwise unlawful; (6) limit the rights of groups of students which are not of a specified numerical size; or (7) abridge the constitutional rights of any person. Provides that nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize the United States to deny or withhold Federal assistance to any school."
