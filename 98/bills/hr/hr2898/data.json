Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) acquire available easement and water rights to specified lands; and (2) consult with local governmental entities before permitting the introduction of any point source of contamination under any proposed development of specified land. Authorizes the Secretary to require the installation of a waste water disposal system as part of such proposed development. Transfers to the Paiute Indian Tribe responsibility for all land use rights and authorizations (except mining claims), to specified lands. Declares such Tribe the successor-in-interest to the United States in such lands, and makes it responsible for maintaining the lands under the same conditions as they had been maintained by the United States. States that valid mining claims are not terminated by enactment of this Act. Declares that the holders of valid mining claims (as determined by the Secretary) shall not be entitled to a patent, although such claims shall be maintained in compliance with Federal mining laws. Authorizes the Paiute Indian Tribe to negotiate the accommodation of land use rights. Prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from denying the use or occupation of specified lands, on a nonexclusive basis, for Paiute religious or ceremonial reasons during prescribed time periods. Establishes as a trust fund in the Treasury the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah Economic Development and Tribal Government fund. Designates one half of the principal of the Fund as the Economic Development Fund and the remaining one-half as the Tribal Government Fund. Requires the Secretary to administer each portion of the Fund in accordance with reasonable terms set by the Tribe. Requires the Tribe to submit a specific waiver of Federal liability for losses resulting from any investment not made in accordance with specified law before the Secretary may approve such investments. Prohibits: (1) distribution of the Fund's principal to the Tribe or any tribal member; or (2) per capita payments to tribal members from income accruing to the Fund. Requires the Secretary to make quarterly payments to the Tribe of any income received from the investment of each fund. Declares that the use of income from the Tribal Government Fund shall not be regulated by the Secretary. Requires the income from the Economic Development Fund to be used in a manner consistent with a Tribally developed economic development plan which has met with the Secretary's approval. Authorizes appropriations for the Fund for FY 1985. Limits the amount the Tribe may spend for matters related to the employment of legal counsel. Declares valid and effective specified plans for the use and distribution of judgment funds awarded the Creek Indian Nation, the Sisseston-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe of North Dakota and South Dakota, and the Devil's Lake Sioux Tribe of North Dakota. Exempts these plans from further congressional review."
