    "text": "Title I: Emergency Mathematics and Science Education Assistance - Emergency Mathematics and Science Education Act - Amends the National Defense Education Act of 1958 to add a new program (as title VI of such Act) for emergency mathematics and science education at elementary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Education to provide elementary and secondary education assistance (Part A) under such title VI program for FY 1984 and 1985. Conditions such authorization upon increased appropriations under specified provision of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981. Sets forth provisions for allocation of Part A program funds. Directs the Secretary of Education to reserve part A program appropriations for any fiscal year: (1) one percent for allocation among Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; and (2) one-half of one percent for payment to to the Secretary of the Interior for use in Bureau of Indian Affairs schools. Requires that the remainder be allocated among the States (and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) according to a specified formula. Permits the State educational agency (SEA) to reserve up to 25 percent of such a State allocation for the conduct of State programs, planning, and administration. Requires the remainder of the State allocation to be allocated by the SEA among the local education agencies (LEAs) in proportion to their most recent allocations under chapter I of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981. Requires LEAs to use Part A program funds for: (1) needs assessment; and (2) in-service teacher training. Permits remaining funds to be used for discretionary activities to improve mathematics and science education. Sets forth requirements for LEA applications to the SEA for such funds. Requires SEAs to use Part A program funds for: (1) in-service teacher training; (2) expenses related to teacher attendance at specified summer institutes; and (3) matching grants to LEAS to operate joint programs with other public or private groups (at least 20 percent of the SEA program allocation must be used for such grants). Permits remaining funds to be used for discretionary activities to improve mathematics and science education. Limits to 12 percent that portion of the SEA allocation which may be used for Part A program administrative costs. Requires that Part A program funds be used only to supplement, not supplant, funds from non-Federal sources. Requires SEAs and LEAs to ensure equal educational opportunity and the full participation of traditionally underrepresented groups, including women, racial, and ethnic minorities, in Part A programs. Requires SEAs and LEAs to provide for the participation of private school children and teachers in Part A programs. Requires that Part A program funds and property derived from such funds, must be controlled and administered by a public agency. Requires that Part A program State plans and LEA applications for FY 1985 and thereafter contain an evaluation of programs conducted. Directs the Secretary to use the national diffusion network to disseminate information on particularly successful programs under Part A. Sets forth provisions for postsecondary assistance (Part B) under the title VI emergency mathematics and science education program. Requires that specified funds be used to award national teaching scholarships to up to 5,000 individuals for FY 1984 and 10,000 individuals for FY 1985. Limits such scholarships to an amount equal to the tuition and fee expenses of any recipient for two academic years of undergraudate or graduate education. Authorizes the Secretary to reserve up to 30 percent of the funds for such scholarships to make awards to individuals who are currently teachers for one year of study at an institution of higher education. Sets forth provisions for eligibility and nomination of national teaching scholars. Provides that a committee chaired by the Librarian of Congress shall select national teaching scholars. Obligates each national teaching scholar to: (1) teach elementary or secondary school mathematics, science, foreign languages, or other appropriate subject for two years for each year of the scholarship; or (2) repay the total amount of the scholarship, plus interest at a rate prescribed by the Secretary. Provides that such scholarships shall not be considered in determining eligibility for student assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965, but that the sum of such assistance and such scholarship shall not exceed the cost of attendance. Directs the Secretary to make specified funds for FY 1984 or 1985 available for competitive grants to institutions of higher education for undergraduate mathematics, science, and foreign language curriculum improvement and faculty development programs to improve instruction for students who have or are pursuing teaching certificates. Reserves 25 percent of funds for such programs for institutions which serve a high proportion of low income students and which are thus eligible for assistance under title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Directs the Secretary, from specified funds for FY 1984 or 1985, to make grants to institutions of higher education to support summer institutes and workshops for supervisors and certified teachers in elementary and secondary schools to improve their instructional skills and knowledge in mathematics, science, and foreign language, or other areas determined by Secretary. Permits such institutes to involve the cooperation of advanced technology firms and other private industries. Authorizes the Secretary, upon SEA request, to make grants to other public teacher training agencies established by the SEA before January 1, 1983. Directs the Director of the National Institute of Education, in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies, to investigate effective instructional methods and programs in mathematics, science, and foreign languages. Authorizations appropriations for such purpose to the Department for FY 1984 and 1985, to be made available to the National Institute of Education and the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education. Limits the total amount which may be appropriated pursuant to provisions for Part B postsecondary assistance for FY 1984. Requires that, of such total amount, at least: (1) 40 percent be available for national teaching scholarships; (2) 15 percent be available for postsecondary mathematics, science, and foreign language improvement; and (3) 35 percent be available for summer institutes. Authorizes appropriations to the Department for FY 1985 to carry out a program of teacher initiative grants (Part C). Allocates Part C program appropriations among the States in the same manner as required by Part A program provisions. Requires that States use Part C programs funds to make grants to teachers, who have completed inservice or other training under Parts A or B programs, for teacher-initiated projects to improve mathematics, science, and technology education. Prohibits any State from reserving more than one percent of Part C program funds for state administration and assistance to teachers in formulating Part C programs. Revises specified definitions under the National Defense Education Act of 1958 to conform to those under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and the Higher Education Act of 1965. Amends the General Education Provisions Act to extend through FY 1985 the authorization of appropriations for the Minority Institutions Science Improvement program. Title II: National Engineering and Science Personnel - National Engineering and Science Personnel Act of 1983 - Declares that it shall be the continuing policy of the United States to maintain an adequate supply of technical, engineering, and scientific personnel to insure U.S. technological strength and security. Directs the President to take all necessary actions coordinate Federal departments and agencies in carrying out this policy. Declares that primary responsibility for developing policies of Federal support of research and development and of science, engineering, and technical personnel lies with the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President. Establishes within the National Science Foundation (NSF) a special Engineering and Science Personnel Fund to promote and develop the quality of U.S. technical, engineering, and scientific personnel resources. Directs NSF to administer the Fund and, in directing policy for the Fund, to consider current and predicted supply and demand for trained personnel. Requires that grants from the Fund be matched by other private or public sector funds. Establishes the Fund for only five years after enactment of this title, requiring specific congressional authorization for Fund continuance beyond such period. Directs NSF to report to the Congress at least biennially concerning expenditures under the Fund. Sets forth the following priorities for use of the Fund, with minimum required expenditures for some priorities: (1) recruitment and retention of new engineering faculty, (2) two-year and community college faculty and instructor development in high technology fields (20 percent minimum expenditures); (3) development of programs of instructional instrumentation and systems for postsecondary technical, engineering, and scientific education, with special emphasis on computer accessibility (15 percent minimum expenditures); (4) pre-college science and mathematics education and training, including programs promoting cooperation and exchange of resources and personnel with industry and other elements of the private sector (15 percent minimum expenditures); (5) public understanding of science and mathematics; (6) developing and disseminating instructional materials and resources for improved education in engineering, mathematics, and science, and (7) four-year college faculty and instructor development in high technology fields, including instructional development and instrumentation. Makes the Office of Science and Technology Policy responsible for coordination of the activities of the Department of Education and the NSF under this Act, except for activities under provisions for the \"Part A\" program of elementary and secondary assistance for emergency mathematics and science education. Requires the Department and the NSF to report jointly to the Congress on their activities under this Act, within one year from the date of enactment and biennially thereafter. Authorizes appropriations to the Engineering and Science Personnel Fund for FY 1984 through 1988."
