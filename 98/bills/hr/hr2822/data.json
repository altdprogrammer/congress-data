    "text": "Dairy Production Act of 1983 - Title I: Dairy Compliance Program - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982, to eliminate the 50-cent milk producer assessments. Sets milk support prices for FY 1984 and FY 1985 at $13.10 per hundredweight for those farmers producing at or below their 1981-1982 marketing history levels. Sets forth provisions for farmers with less than full, or no marketing history levels. Establishes a reduced dairy compliance price (of up to $12.00, resulting in a blend price of not less than $12.10 per hundredweight) for over production as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture. States that the difference between the price support received and the reduced dairy compliance price shall be remitted to the Commodity Credit Corporation and credited to the Dairy Stabilization Settlement Fund to provided for a FY 1984 and FY 1985 paid diversion program. Requires farmers to present the Secretary with evidence of their 1981-1982 marketing history in order to participate in such diversion program, which may be adjusted to compensate for abnormally low production as a result of a disaster. Sets forth program provisions, including: (1) a $10 per hundredweight reduced production payment; (2) reductions as determined by the producer of between five and 30 percent of the base; (3) monthly partial payments; (4) limited transferability of a producer's marketing history; (5) penalties for failure to make the agreed reductions and remit the resultant funds, and for a knowing violation of a diversion contract; and (6) limited transferability of dairy cattle to other producers. Title II: Dairy Promotion Program - Requires the Secretary to publish (with notice and opportunity for public hearing) a proposed dairy research and promotion order within 30 days of receiving a request for such proposed order. Permits such proposal to be submitted by an individual or an organization certified under this Act. Makes such order effective 90 days after the public comment period. Authorizes the Secretary to amend such orders. Sets forth required terms of such orders, including the establishment of a National Dairy Promotion and Research Board made up of at least 36 milk producer members appointed by the Secretary. Sets forth organizational and operating provisions, including penalties for disclosure and other related violations of such orders. Funds such dairy promotion, research, and nutrition education program through a 15 cents per hundredweight assessment on commercially marketed milk. Permits a credit of up to ten cents per hundredweight for contributions to qualified State or regional dairy promotion or nutrition education programs. Requires an organization to be certified by the Secretary in order to represent milk producers. Authorizes the Secretary to develop such criteria, and makes the Secretary's eligibility decision final. Requires the Secretary, within the 60-day period preceding September 30, 1985, to conduct a producer referendum on such program's continuation (approval to be by a simple majority of those voting). States that after September 30, 1985, such referenda may be held when the Secretary deems appropriate, or when requested by ten percent of the affected producers. Reimburses the Secretary from assessments collected by the Board for related expenses. Permits cooperative association representation at such referenda, provided that the association notifies its members in advance and provides them an opportunity to vote as individuals. Provides petition and review in U.S. district court for a person subject to an order. Vests enforcement powers in U.S. district courts. Sets forth penalty provisions. Grants the Secretary investigative and related authority. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Effective Date - Makes this Act effective October 1, 1983."
