    "text": "Milk Producers Equity Act of 1983 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982, to eliminate the 50-cent milk producer assessments. Sets milk support levels at $13.10 per hundredweight. Provides that if quarterly Government milk and milk product purchases fall below four percent of commercial marketings the level shall be based on a sliding scale of between 90 percent and 60 percent of parity. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish individual production levels based on previous production. Prohibits transfers of such levels except to family members. Terminates such levels for nonproduction in two consecutive years. Requires the Secretary to establish a production reduction factor equal to the percentage of Government purchases to total commercial marketing. Makes an individual's production goal equal to his production level minus the reduction factor. Provides bonus payments for voluntary underproduction, and assessments for overproduction."
