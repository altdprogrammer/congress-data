    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Finance with amendment, S. Rept. 98-470) Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to authorize appropriations for FY 1985 for the U.S. International Trade Commission, including a specified amount for reception and entertainment expenses. Amends the Customs Procedural Reform and Simplification Act of 1978 to authorize appropriations for FY 1985 for the U.S. Customs Service. Directs the Commissioner of Customs to notify the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee at least 180 days before taking an action which would: (1) result in a significant reduction in force of employees other than by means of attrition; (2) eliminate or relocate any office of the U.S. Customs Service; (3) eliminate any port of entry; or (4) significantly reduce the number of employees assigned to any office of the U.S. Customs Service or any port of entry. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require that a ship's manifest shall include the names of the shippers of merchandise carried on ship. Requires that certain information contained on the manifest shall be available for public disclosure. Prohibits such information from being available for public disclosure if: (1) the Secretary of the Treasury finds that disclosure is likely to pose a threat of personal injury or property damage; or (2) the information is exempt for national defense or foreign policy purposes. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make customs services available and charge a fee for the use of such customs services at: (1) the airport located at Lebanon, New Hampshire; and (2) any other airport designates by the Secretary. Requires the user fee to equal the expenses incurred in providing customs services to the user. Authorizes the Secretary to designate four airports at which customs services will be available. Permits an airport to be designated only if: (1) the Secretary has made a determination that the volume or value of business cleared through the airport is insufficient to justify the availability of customs services at such airport; and (2) the Governor of the State in which the airport is located approves such designation. Imposes penalties for failure to pay the user fee. Requires receipts from such fees from each airport to be deposited in an account in the Treasury that is specially designated for such airport. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize appropriations for FY 1985 for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Earmarks a specified amount for entertainment and representation expenses."
