    "text": "National Employment Priorities Act - Title I: General Provisions - Sets forth the findings and purposes of this Act and definitions. Title II: Federal Adjustment Assistance - Requires the Secretary of Labor to implement a comprehensive assistance program for employees who lose their employment with an establishment which is required under title III of this Act to give advance notice of plant closings and permanent layoffs. Requires that such program include: (1) training programs; (2) job placement services; (3) payments for reasonable expenses incurred by employees in searching for new employment in a geographical area away from such establishment; (4) payments for moving expenses; and (5) education assistance. Requires the Secretary, to the extent practicable, to provide such assistance before employment loss occurs and through existing programs. Provides that the Secretary shall consult with a business establishment and with any affected labor organizations in order to develop a retraining plan which meets the manpower needs of such establishment. Requires the payment of travel and subsistence allowances to employees receiving assistance under this program. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a program to retrain employees of a business undergoing plant closings and laying off employees. Makes a business concern eligible for assistance under this Act if: (1) such business concern intends to undertake a change of operations which will result in a substantial employment loss; (2) all reasonable efforts and the resources of such business concern are inadequate to prevent such employment loss; (3) such assistance will enable such business concern to operate on an improved economic basis within a reasonable time period and without the change of operations; and (4) such business concern has complied with notice requirements under title III of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to provide eligible business concerns with enough financial assistance to substantially contribute to their economic viability if equivalent financial assistance is unavailable from conventional sources and if it is reasonably likely that they will repay the United States. Provides that such financial assistance may include loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, and an assumption of debt. Authorizes the Secretary to provide eligible business concerns with enough technical assistance to substantially contribute to their economic viability. Provides that such assistance may include research and development grants and contracts which will provide new employment opportunities. Requires the Secretary to issue a certificate of procurement credit to a business concern which complies with notice requirements under title III of this Act if such business concern will be able to offer additional employment opportunities upon entering into a procurement contract with the Government. Provides that bids submitted by a business concern with such a certificate shall be treated by Government agencies as if they are equal to 95 percent of the amount stated in the bids. Makes local governments eligible for assistance under this Act if, as a result of a change of operations of a business concern, there will be a substantial decrease in the amount of revenues paid to such governments, a substantial increase in demand for social services provided by them, or a substantial increase in the number of unemployed individuals residing within their jurisdiction. Authorizes the Secretary to provide to eligible local governments grants, loans, and loan guarantees to increase the availability of social services and to implement any plan for a public works project approved by the Secretary. Makes employers other than business concerns required to comply with notice requirements under title III of this Act and cooperative associations of employees eligible for assistance under this Act if such employers and cooperative associations will create or expand employment opportunities and provide continuous employment over a substantial period of time, and substantially equivalent assistance is unavailable from any other source. Authorizes the Secretary to provide to such employers and cooperative associations loans, loan guarantees, and technical assistance for expanding operations in an establishment required to comply with notice requirements under title III of this Act, constructing new establishments, and undertaking research and development projects to identify new markets and employment opportunities. Establishes priority requirements for the provision of assistance under this title. Title III: Advance Notice of Plant Closings and Permanent Layoffs - Requires a business concern to give written notice with respect to any intended change of operations in a State which will result in the number of employees suffering an employment loss in any 18-month period equaling or exceeding the lesser of 100 employees or 15 percent of the employees at such establishment. Requires that the notice be given to the Secretary, the employees, representatives of affected labor organizations at such establishment, and local government units as required by the Secretary. Sets forth time requirements with respect to such notice. Requires the Secretary to inform each employee who receives such notice of the availability of assistance under this Act. Requires the Secretary to conduct an investigation of any intended change of operations at an establishment with respect to which notice is required under this Act if the Secretary receives a written request for such an investigation within 60 days after such notice is given from an authorized representative of an affected labor organization or from at least 10 percent of the employees notified. Provides that the Secretary may conduct such an investigation regardless of whether such notice is given if such investigation would serve the purposes of this Act or if at least 50 percent of the employees of the establishment involved request an investigation. Requires the Secretary to publish a report containing his or her findings resulting from such an investigation and recommendations to prevent or minimize the harmful economic and social effects of the intended change of operations of the business which is investigated. Title IV: Employer Responsibilities - Requires a business concern which is required to give notice under title III of this Act and which reduces the weekly wages of an employee to less than 85 percent of the average weekly wages paid to such employee during the 26 weeks preceding such reduction or which suspends or terminates the employment of such employee to give such employee a written statement of employment status. Provides that such an employee shall be treated as suffering an employment loss if: (1) such statement does not include an assurance that such employee's wages will be increased or that such employee will be reinstated; or (2) the business concern fails to give such statement to such employee. Requires the business concern to give such an employee a lump sum payment, in addition to other payments required by this Act, if the business concern fails to prevent such employee's loss of employment. Requires a business concern which is required to give notice under title III of this Act to: (1) pay to each employee who suffers an employment loss as a result of a change in operations a weekly income maintenance payment for one year; and (2) make payments to any employee benefit plan in effect with respect to each such employee for one year. Provides that no business concern shall be required to make total payments exceeding $25,000 to any employee suffering an employment loss. Provides that no business concern shall be required to make payments to such an employee if: (1) such employee begins employment with any other establishment of such business concern; (2) such employee refuses to accept employment which is within a reasonable commuting distance, which provides wages and benefits equal to or better than those of the employee's previous job, and which is similar to such employee's previous position; (3) such employee refuses to participate or fails to make satisfactory progress without good cause in a training or placement program under this Act; or (4) such employee receives a retirement benefit under a pension plan to which the business concern contributed. Requires a business concern to pay moving expenses for an employee who accepts employment with such business concern within three years after such employee's employment loss occurs. Provides for an extension of the one-year period of payments under this title to an employee if such employee is between 53 and 61 years old at the end of the one year. Requires the Secretary to reimburse the business concern involved for any such payments. Provides that any payment required under this title which a business concern fails to make shall be treated as a debt owed by such business concern to the United States and requires the Secretary, upon request, to make such payment to the employee involved. Provides that a business concern which transfers ownership or control of an establishment in order to avoid liability for any subsequent employment loss shall be liable to the United States for the amount of employee assistance which the business concern owning or controlling the establishment at the time the employment loss occurs fails to provide. Requires a business concern required to give notice under title III of this Act to offer to any employee who suffers an employment loss any employment which becomes available at another establishment of such business concern within three years following such employment loss and which such employee is qualified to perform, to the extent that the provision of such employment does not violate any collective-bargaining agreement in effect. Provides that an employee of a business concern required to give notice under title III of this Act who suffers an employment loss shall be eligible to participate in any employee benefit plan in effect with respect to such employee during any period when such business concern is required to make payments to such plan under this title. Sets forth vesting requirements with respect to such plans. Provides that an individual who knowingly accepts employment with a business concern which has given notice as required under title III of this Act shall not be considered an employee of such business concern for purposes of assistance under this Act. Makes a business concern which is required to give notice under title III of this Act liable to local government units for any loss of revenue which occurs during the three fiscal years preceding the fiscal year in which the business concern implements its change of operations. Provides that any such payment which a business concern fails to make shall be treated as a debt owned by such business concern to the United States and requires the Secretary, upon request, to make such payment to the local government involved. Makes a business concern whose change of operations involves a transfer of operations outside the United States when an economically viable alternative exists liable to the United States for loss of revenue. Title V: Administration - Imposes criminal penalties on anyone who fraudulently obtains assistance under this Act and on anyone who gives the notice required under title III of this Act and makes false statements or fails to disclose material facts required under such title. Imposes civil penalties on any business concern which fails to: (1) give notice as required by title III of this Act; (2) provide assistance to employees pursuant to title IV of this Act; or (3) pay any debt owed to the United States pursuant to this Act within 180 days after such debt is incurred. Makes it unlawful for a business concern required to give notice under title III of this Act to: (1) fail to offer an employee who suffers an employment loss other employment at an alternative establishment; or (2) discriminate against an employee who participates in any investigation under this Act. Requires the suspension or reduction of assistance payments with respect to any person who has fraudulently obtained such assistance. Requires the Secretary to maintain operating reserves with respect to anticipated claims under loan guarantees made under title II of this Act. Requires that mortgages acquired by the Secretary as security for any loans made under such title be recorded by the Secretary according to State law. Specifies time periods within which Congress may disapprove rules promulgated by the Secretary to carry out this Act. Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress: (1) a report evaluating the effectiveness of the assistance programs under this Act; and (2) legislative proposals which provide assistance to local government units adversely affected by changes of operations of business concerns and which require business concerns to provide employment information for inclusion in the job bank and matching program established under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act. Establishes in the Department of Labor the National Employment Priorities Administration which shall carry out the provisions of this Act. Establishes a National Employment Priorities Advisory Council which shall give advice to the Secretary, evaluate the programs under this Act, and conduct various employment studies.
