Allows a deduction for one-half of the self-employment tax imposed on the income of an individual taxpayer. Allows a deduction for the amounts paid by an individual for term life insurance. Limits the deductible amount for the cost of insurance where there is more than $50,000 of term insurance coverage. Extends the deductions for amounts paid for health and life insurance premiums to taxpayers who do not itemize income tax deductions."
