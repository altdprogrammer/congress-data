    "date": "1983-07-19", 
    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow the rollover of certain partial distributions from employee benefit plans into individual retirement plans if: (1) the distribution is equal to at least 50 percent of the employee's balance; (2) the distribution is not one of a series of periodic payments; and (3) the employee elects such treatment. Denies ten year averaging and capital gains treatment for any subsequent distributions if such a rollover is made. Makes eligible for such a rollover any partial distributions paid to a spouse of an employee after the employee's death. Revises related parties rules to require that a payor of expenses and interest be placed on the cash method of accounting for purposes of deducting business expenses and interest owed to a related party cash-basis taxpayer. Extends present rules relating to such payments by Subchapter S corporations to such payments by partnerships. Allows an income tax deduction, as an ordinary loss, of losses incurred on the disposition of preferred stock of a domestic small business corporation. (Present law limits such treatment to losses incurred on the disposition of common stock in such a corporation.) Makes technical corrections to reinstate provisions enacted by the Highway Revenue Act of 1982 concerning tax-exempt interest income of mutual funds."
