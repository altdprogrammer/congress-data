Sets forth those circumstances in which the access codes may be disclosed. Extends the current prohibition against the fraudulent use and transportation of credit cards to cover, additionally, credit card numbers, debit cards, electronic banking cards, or other access devices to a customer's account. Makes possession, with unlawful or fraudulent intent, of ten or more illegally obtained credit cards, codes, or other means of accessing an account a Federal crime. Confers Federal jurisdiction over any offense where multiple credit cards, access numbers, and so forth, are used so long as the fraudulent charges amount to $1,000 or more."
