    "text": "Wetlands Reform Act of 1983 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act) to require that guidelines developed by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters shall prohibit specification of a disposal site unless specified demonstrations are made. Requires a demonstration that: (1) discharge of dredged or fill material at such site does not contain any toxic pollutant included on a specified list published under such Act (except a toxic pollutant which is only a trace contaminant in such discharge); (2) such discharge at such site will not have an unacceptable individual or cumulative adverse impact on the aquatic environment; and (3) there is no practicable alternative to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse effect on the environment. Revises provisions for denial or restriction of use of defined areas as disposal sites. Requires the Administrator to review permit applications and to deny or restrict such use upon determination of specified factors. Allows any person to petition the Administrator to deny or restrict dredged or fill activities in any defined area based on specified criteria. Directs the Administrator, within 30 days after receipt, to make a finding as to whether the petition presents substantial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. Directs the Administrator to promptly notify the Secretary of the Army of each finding made and promptly make such finding public. Directs the Administrator, within 90 days after receiving a petition found to present substantial information that the petitioned action may be warranted, after notice and opportunity for a public hearing, to determine whether or not to implement the petitioned action or some modification of the petitioned action, based on determinations as to whether or not the discharge of such materials into such area will have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas), wildlife, or recreation areas. Prohibits any individual or general permit for a dredged or fill material discharge activity from being issued before such a determination is made, if such activity would be precluded or restricted by implementation of the petitioned action that the Administrator has found may be warranted. Subjects such findings and determinations to judicial review. Provides for citizen lawsuits under such Act: (1) against the Secretary of the Army; and (2) with respect to any limitation or requirement of any guideline developed for permits for dredged or fill material."
