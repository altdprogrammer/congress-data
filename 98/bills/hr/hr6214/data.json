    "text": "Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to prohibit the issuance of a lease pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCS Lands Act) unless an affected coastal State's Governor (the Governor) certifies that the Governor and the Secretary of the Interior have reached an agreement which meets the requirements of leasing lands which are within three miles of the seaward boundaries of such affected coastal State. Amends the OCS Lands Act to require that the State and the Government share equally any revenues generated from Federal leases taking oil or gas from common pools or fields underlying both the Outer Continental Shelf (under Federal jurisdiction) and submerged lands subject to State jurisdiction. Provides that if the Governor or the Secretary cannot agree if an area has such a common pool or field, then the Secretary shall not proceed with leasing such area. Requires the Secretary to deposit, for annual distribution to the affected coastal State, 50 percent of all bonuses, royalties, and revenues derived from leases of such common pools or fields. Requires all funds already deposited in a separate Treasury account under a specified section of the OCS Lands Act (dealing with distribution of funds from leases of common pools or fields) to be divided equally between the Government and the affected coastal State."
