    "text": "Pension Plan Reversion Moratorium Act of 1984 - Imposes a 270 day (nine-month) moratorium period during which: (1) the Secretary of the Treasury shall not issue determinations regarding a pension plan termination if, upon such termination, the aggregate amount of reversions to the employer would exceed $1,000,000; and (2) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation shall not issue a notice of sufficiency of assets (a prerequisite to pension plan termination) if upon termination the aggregate amount of reversions to the employer would exceed $1,000,000. States that the Secretary's compliance with the moratorium shall not have the effect of triggering a declaratory judgment remedy under the Internal Revenue Code. Provides a 270 day extension of time after expiration of the moratorium for petitioners to exhaust their administrative remedies regarding pension plan qualifications under specified law. Specifies exceptions. Provides a 90 day extension of time after expiration of the moratorium for filing pension plan termination notices. Specifies exceptions. Exempts multiemployer pension plans from the moratorium imposed by this Act. Directs the Secretary to waive the moratorium if it will: (1) result in substantial business hardship to the employer; and (2) be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate. Requires a hearing at which plan participants and beneficiaries may submit comments before a moratorium waiver may be granted. Sets forth standards under which a substantial business hardship shall be determined."
