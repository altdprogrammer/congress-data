Specifies particular categories of individuals that the District of Columbia may not bill for services provided to such persons. Phases in the cost-reimbursement system that the District of Columbia must follow over a period of seven years with the District of Columbia's reimbursement payment increasing each year until it reaches 100 percent in FY 1991. Provides that the United States shall be financially responsible for certain categories of patients who receive services at Saint Elizabeths Hospital. Requires that hiring preference be given certain employees of Saint Elizabeths Hospital for career positions in the District of Columbia mental health system. Directs the Secretary to make available any unneeded property to the District of Columbia to provide health or mental health services."
