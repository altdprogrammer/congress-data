Authorizes the Secretary to select, through a competitive process, up to 100 organizations to participate in the program in the first year, 200 in the second, and 300 in the third. Directs the Secretary to establish a neighborhood development advisory council to evaluate the applicants and recommend selections. Requires the Secretary to: (1) assign each participating organization a program year during which time voluntary private contributions shall be eligible for matching; and (2) establish a ratio of between three and ten Federal dollars for each dollar contributed which the Secretary shall pay to each organization at the end of each three-month period of the organization's program year. Limits the maximum amount the Secretary may pay to any organization for a year to $50,000. Directs the Secretary to ensure that: (1) assistance is provided to organizations only if their applications include certification by the local government of the area involved that such assistance is consistent with the housing and community development, conservation, and revitalization objectives of such governments; and (2) the neighborhood development activities conducted comply with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the activities carried out under this Act and any findings or recommendations concerning the demonstration program. Authorizes appropriations."
