Establishes the Columbia River Gorge Commission, which shall: (1) establish and implement a unified management plan for the Gorge; (2) identify and establish a protection program for critical and sensitive lands in the Gorge; (3) review Federal, State, and local implementation plans for land management and development in the Gorge for compliance with the management plan; and (4) report biennially to the President, to Congress, and to the Governors and State legislatures of Washington and Oregon on the status of the management plan for the Gorge. Sets forth a timetable for the appointment of the Commission, the adoption of the management plan for the Gorge, and the submission of implementation plans to the Commission. Authorizes the Commission, during the interim period between the appointment of members and the review of implementation plans, to review proposed Federal, State, or local government land management or development activities to determine their consistency with this Act, with Commission guidelines, and with the management plan when adopted. Provides that activities which the Commission determines are inconsistent with this Act, with Commission guidelines, and with the management plan shall not proceed unless the proposals are approved upon resubmission to the Commission. Authorizes the Commission to provide information to agencies and local governments with respect to: (1) the application of this Act to land management or development undertaken, regulated, or approved by them; (2) interim review requirements and procedures; and (3) Commission rules and regulations. Requires that the management plan for the Gorge: (1) designate and provide a protection program for lands which are essential to the Gorge's protection, development, and interpretive value; (2) establish objectives for the treatment of Gorge resources; (3) establish review and amendment procedures for implementation plans; and (4) promote the economic viability of the communities within the Gorge Area. Sets forth procedural requirements with respect to the submission by agencies and local governments of implementation plans for land management and development within the Gorge. Makes such plans effective upon review and approval by the Commission. Provides that upon certification by the Commission of an implementation plan, such plan shall become the basis for all subsequent decisions by the agency or local government concerning land management and development. Permits amendments to implementation plans by the Commission, by the agencies, or by the local governments. Sets forth acquisition procedures for lands within the Gorge. Exempts from this Act: (1) the ongoing development of new locks at the Bonneville Dam; (2) emergency land management or development by an agency or local government which is essential to the public health or safety or for national security or defense; (3) land management or development commenced before the enactment of this Act; and (4) agricultural activity on lands used principally for agricultural purposes and commercial forest activities on forest lands defined in the respective Forest Practice Acts of Oregon and Washington. Sets forth the Commission's authority to enforce this Act and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Gives the Federal courts exclusive jurisdiction of actions arising under this Act. Provides for administrative and judicial review of Commission decisions pursuant to this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 and thereafter to carry out this Act and for land acquisition. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 for the operation of the Commission and the initial implementation of this Act. Establishes a land acquisition fund."
