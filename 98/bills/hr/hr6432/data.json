Limits the use of such funds for the above purposes to the lesser of 50 percent of such funds or $250,000,000. Increases the variable housing allowance for military personnel by lowering the trigger point for determining such allowance from 80 to 75 percent of the median monthly cost of housing in the United States for members of the uniformed services. Removes restrictions on dental care coverage for spouses and children of military personnel. Establishes in the Department of Defense an Office of Military Family Services to provide counseling and information services."
