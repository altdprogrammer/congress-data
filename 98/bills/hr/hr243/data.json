Conditions such adjustment on the adoption of a concurrent resolution by each House of Congress. Requires a recorded vote on such resolution. Prohibits any congressional employee from being paid at a rate exceeding the rate payable for Senators and Members of the House of Representatives. Requires the President to transmit to the Congress, within a specified time period, recommendations for rates of pay of Members of Congress, legislative, and judicial employees. Prohibits the House of Representatives and the Senate from considering any bill or joint resolution carrying an appropriation for compensation of Members of Congress for any fiscal year if such bill or joint resolution carries an appropriation, or a limitation on appropriations, for any other purpose."
