    "text": "Utah Federal and State Land Management Improvement Act of 1984 - Conveys specified Federal land to the State of Utah. Specifies conditions of such conveyance. Exempts such conveyance from title II of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Includes in each conveyance under this Act the entire surface and subsurface estate. Prohibits the conveyance of oil or gas interests which are subject to lease during the calendar year 1984. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, within five years, to seek a unitization agreement for specified areas with the State of Utah regarding oil and gas resource management. Requires such agreement to distribute revenues from oil and gas lease production to the State and the United States, respectively. Maintains the rights and privileges of permits and leases for domestic livestock grazing on lands affected by the exchanges under this Act. Requires the State and the United States to assume each other's rights and duties under grazing leases and permits as existed prior to the land exchanges under this Act. Prescribes guidelines to protect valid existing claims for metalliferous minerals on exchanged lands. Extinguishes any claim which is converted under State law to a preferential, noncompetitive mineral lease, sale permit or other disposition. Authorizes the State to select Federal lands of approximately equal value elsewhere in the State if the State's title to exchanged lands is encumbered for more than 20 years after enactment of this Act. Requires the Secretary to place into a separate account in the Treasury all royalties and revenues derived from metalliferous mineral leases on lands acquired from the State. Restricts the use of such account to claim administration under Federal mining laws on lands acquired by the State under this Act. Directs the State to assume all Federal rights and responsibilities concerning Federal mineral leases on lands conveyed to it. Makes all payments formerly due to the United States payable to the State. Requires the State and Federal government, respectively, to assume all of each other's rights and responsibilities regarding nonmetalliferous leases and contracts on exchanged lands. Conveys existing water rights and special use agreements with the conveyed lands. Provides for payments by the United States in lieu of taxes on State lands acquired under this Act. Amends the Utah Enabling Act to provide that lands granted for the support of common schools may be used by the State at less than fair market value for public purposes by State and local agencies. Authorizes appropriations."
