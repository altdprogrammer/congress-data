Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 and each fiscal year thereafter for certain interest payments. Raises the ceiling placed on Indian business development grants which the Secretary may make to: (1) individual Indians (from $50,000 to $100,000); or (2) Indian tribes (from $50,000 to $250,000). Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 and each fiscal year thereafter. Authorizes the Secretary to require security other than bonds when contracting for construction or repairs with an Indian-owned business. Requires the Secretary to insure that loan and grant applicants will be provided with technical assistance for the preparation of loan applications and the administration of funds granted under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to use up to a specified percentage of appropriations for entering into contracts in FY 1985. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 and each fiscal year thereafter."
