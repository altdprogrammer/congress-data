    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-02-09", 
    "text": "Land Remote-Sensing Commercialization Act of 1984 - Title I: Declarations of Findings, Purposes and Policies - Sets forth the findings, purposes, and policies of Congress concerning civil land remote-sensing. Declares it to be U.S. policy to: (1) preserve the right to acquire and disseminate digital remote-sensing data; (2) make available such data on a nondiscriminatory basis; (3) commercialize space remote-sensing functions relating to private sector operations; and (4) retain in the Government remote-sensing functions essentially of a public service nature. Title II: Contract for Existing Land Remote-Sensing Satellite System - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to contract with a United States private sector party to market digital remote-sensing data generated by the Landsat system. Authorizes the Secretary to conditionally accept competitive proposals from private sector parties. Provides that if no proposals are acceptable, the Secretary shall certify such funding to the Congress. Requires the Secretary to continue to operate and market data from the Landsat system if no acceptable proposal is received. Declares that the United States Government shall retain title to all data generated by the Landsat system. Entitles the contractor to the revenues from the sale of data copies after the contract commencement date. Sets forth conditions of competition for the contract. Requires the contractor to supply digital remote-sensing data to foreign ground stations in accordance with existing agreements between the United States and such foreign ground stations. Makes such digital data available to foreign ground stations on a nondiscriminatory basis upon the expiration of an agreement or, if no agreement exists, on the contract commencement date. Title III: Provision of Data Continuity During Transition Period - Provides for a transition period between Government operation and private, commercial operation of civil land remote-sensing space systems. Directs the Secretary to contract, after competition, with a United States private sector party to: (1) generate digital remote-sensing data of a quality equivalent to that of Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) data; and (2) sell such data for the Government. Sets forth specific requirements of the contract. Sets forth the basis upon which the contract will be awarded. Directs the Secretary, if he finds no contract proposal acceptable under the conditions of this Act, to certify such funding to the Congress. Authorizes the Secretary, after the certification process has been completed, to assure MSS data continuity by procurement and operation by the Federal Government of the necessary systems. Directs the selected contractor to sell data in accordance with provisions of this title. Sets forth certain requirements on the sale of digital remote-sensing data. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress and the President on the progress of the transition to fully private financing ownership, and operation of remote-sensing space systems. Title IV: Licensing of Private Remote-Sensing Space Systems - Authorizes the Secretary, after consultation with other appropriate Federal agencies, to grant, suspend, modify or revoke licenses of private remote-sensing space systems. Sets forth conditions for operation of a remote-sensing space system. Authorizes the Secretary to license qualified private sector parties and others, to limit the license period, and to adjudicate licensee cases regarding denial of issuance. Grants the Secretary regulatory and enforcement authority to carry out the provisions of this title. Sets forth a conditional termination date for this title. Title V: Research and Developments - Directs the Administrators of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the heads of other appropriate Federal agencies to conduct remote-sensing research and development and develop remote-sensing technologies in support of their authorized missions. Directs the Administrators, within one year after the date of enactment of this Act and biennially thereafter, to report to Congress, regarding their research and development. Declares the authorized uses for the data gathered in Federal experimental space remote-sensing programs, and how it may be sold. Title VI: General Provisions - Requires that any digital remote-sensing data be made available on a nondiscriminatory basis in accordance with the requirements of this Act. Requires system operators to make public the terms of sale of such data. Directs the Secretary to archive the land remote-sensing satellite data collected. Prohibits the reproduction and dissemination of such data by a purchaser. Authorizes the Federal Communications Commission and the Secretary to allocate radio frequencies appropriate for space remote-sensing systems to any license holders under title IV of this Act. Directs the Secretary to consult with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State on matters affecting national security and international obligations, respectively. Authorizes appropriations. Title VII: Prohibition of Commercialization of Weather Satellites - Prohibits the President or any other official of the Government from commercializing the weather satellite systems operated by the Department of Commerce or any successor agency."
