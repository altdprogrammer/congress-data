    "text": "Overseas Teachers Act of 1984 - Amends the Defense Department Overseas Teachers Pay and Personnel Practices Act to entitle an individual who is recruited outside the United States as a teacher in a Department of Defense overseas dependents school to the same benefits as an individual recruited in the United States. Denies such entitlement to any individual who is the spouse of a member of a uniformed service, unless: (1) the individual is legally separated from the member; (2) the member dies or has retired from Government service; (3) the individual no longer resides with the member because the member has been reassigned to another geographic area for more than 90 days; or (4) the member's benefits comparable to a teacher's quarters allowance and cost of living benefits have been terminated for any other reason. Provides that such a teaching position shall include a position for which teaching duties and responsibilities are performed: (1) in a substitute capacity; (2) as a summer teacher; (3) as an instructor for the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps; (4) as a paraprofessional or teacher aide; (5) for a definite term not to exceed one school year in the excepted service; or (6) for an indefinite term in the excepted service. Entitles an overseas teacher to 12 (currently ten) days of cumulative leave with pay if the school year exceeds eight months. Eliminates the limitation on the amount of leave a teacher may accumulate. Permits the use of leave for paternity purposes. Entitles a teacher to an additional three days of leave to use for any purpose during the school year if the teacher provides appropriate advance notice. Entitles a teacher who is separated from such leave system to elect to: (1) receive a lump sum payment for such leave if the separation exceeds 31 days; or (2) receive credit for such leave as unused sick leave for purposes of determining the amount of a civil service retirement annuity. Entitles a Federal or District of Columbia employee who is transferred, promoted, or reappointed to a teaching position to: (1) receive a lump sum pay for the annual leave credited to such employee before he or she became a teacher; or (2) be recredited with such leave upon returning to a Federal or District of Columbia position without a break in service. Requires the Director of Dependents' Education, upon appropriate application, to grant any full-time teacher who has completed at least seven years of service a sabbatical with full pay for up to one year to enable the teacher to engage in study or uncompensated work experience which will contribute to the development of the teacher's skills, provided: (1) the teacher has not been granted a sabbatical during the preceding seven years; and (2) the teacher agrees to serve in a teaching position for three consecutive years. Requires the Secretary of Defense to prescribe a five-level pay system for overseas teachers. Requires determinations concerning appropriate pay levels to be based on the length of service of an individual as a teacher, counselor, psychologist, or social worker within the defense education system. Requires rates of basic pay within level I to be equal to the average of the range of rates of basic pay for comparable positions in school jurisdictions in the United States having an average daily attendance of 100,000 or more students. Directs the Secretary to modify regulations concerning teacher compensation to require a teacher to be compensated for the appropriate fraction of his or her pay for each day of service during a school year exceeding the number of days comprising a school year in such a jurisdiction. Requires determinations concerning housing, transportation, services, or use of Government facilities for teachers at certain pay levels to correspond to such determinations for commissioned officers in the Armed Forces in equivalent grade levels, except that pay level I determinations shall correspond to grade level two determinations. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations to carry out specified overseas teacher requirements concerning: (1) the effect of administrative delays on starting dates; (2) a per diem allowance for travel to and from a duty station; (3) Government reimbursement for emergency transportation costs; (4) school assignments based on staffing requirements; (5) medical and dental benefits; (6) Government payments for the transportation of household goods; (7) service creditable for purposes of determining civil service annuities; (8) eligibility for military-controlled housing; (9) hours of duty; (10) leaves of absence; (11) qualifications and eligibility for vacancies within the system; (12) administrative leave during periods of inclement weather; and (13) class size limitations. Provides that any teacher who has served for at least three school years shall be eligible for appointment as a Federal employee in the competitive service on a non-competitive basis."
