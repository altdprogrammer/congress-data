Requires such plan to: (1) name a State administering agency; (2) estimate expenditures; (3) assess rural food needs; (4) provide for program reports; and (5) authorize the use of assistance for hunting and fishing equipment. Permits the Secretary to: (1) deny or withhold assistance for plan noncompliance; and (2) provide technical assistance. Requires biennial State program audits. Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide for program review; (2) report to the appropriate congressional committees by March 1 of 1988 and 1989, respectively; and (3) issue final implementing regulations for adjustments to the rural Alaskan thrifty food plan within ten days. Sets forth penalties for misuse of program funds, assets, or property."
