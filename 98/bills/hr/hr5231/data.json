    "text": "Academic Equity and Excellence Through Bilingual Education Act of 1984 - Amends the Bilingual Education Act (the Act, which is also title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965) to revise and reauthorize programs under the Act. Includes under the statement of policy for the Act the recognition that: (1) there are growing numbers of children of limited English proficiency; (2) the Federal Government has a special and continuing obligation to assist in providing equal educational opportunity to limited English proficient children; (3) the segregation of many groups of limited English proficient children remains a serious problem; (4) both limited English proficient children and children whose primary language is English can benefit from bilingual education programs, and that such programs can help develop our national linguistic resources; (5) data collection capabilities need to be strengthened to better identify and promote effective programs and instructional practices; (6) parent and community participation in bilingual education programs contributes to program effectiveness; and (7) because of limited English proficiency, many adults are not able to participate fully in national life, and limited English proficient parents are often not able to participate effectively in their children's education. Provides that assistance under the Act shall be given to local educational agencies (LEAs), and, for certain related purposes, to State educational agencies (SEAs), institutions of higher education, and community organizations. Includes adult programs (in addition to related preschool, elementary, and secondary school programs) among those bilingual education programs to be assisted under the Act. Requires programs under the Act to be designed to enable students to achieve full competence in English. Permits such programs to also provide for the development of student competency in a second language. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Act for FY 1985 through 1991. Authorizes separate appropriations for such period for grants to State programs under the new part B (Data Collection, Evaluation, and Research). Directs the Secretary to reserve, from the appropriations to carry out the Act: (1) at least 60 percent for programs under part A (Financial Assistance for Bilingual Education Programs), and of such reserved amount at least 75 percent shall be reserved for transitional bilingual education programs; (2) at least 25 percent for training activities under a redesignated part C (Training and Technical Assistance); and (3) not more than one percent for the National Advisory and Coordinating Council on Bilingual Education. Revises definitions under the Act to include under the definition of \"limited English proficiency\" difficulties with the English language which deny to specified categories of individuals the opportunity to participate fully in our society. Sets forth a definition of \"program of transitional bilingual education\" which is similar to the current definition of \"program of bilingual education\" under the Act. Deletes a requirement that the principal purpose of any participation of children whose language is English in a bilingual education program must be to contribute to the objective of assisting children of limited English proficiency to improve their English language skills. Deletes certain requirements relating to applications for assistance for bilingual education programs. Sets forth a new definition, defining \"program of developmental bilingual education\" as a full-time program of instruction in elementary and secondary schools which provides, with respect to the applicable years of study, structured English-language instruction and instruction in a second language. Requires that such programs: (1) be designed to help children achieve competence in English and a second language while mastering subject matter skills; and (2) to the extent necessary, be in all courses or subjects of study which will allow a child to meet grade-promotion and graduation standards; and (3) where possible, have classes comprised of approximately equal numbers of students whose native language is English and limited English proficient students whose native language is the second language of instruction and study in the program. Sets forth a new definition, defining a \"family English literacy program\" as a program of instruction designed to help limited English proficient students and out-of-school youth achieve competence in the English language. Permits such programs to: (1) be conducted exclusively in English or in English and the student's native language; and (2) where appropriate, include instruction on how parents and family members can facilitate the educational achievement of limited English proficient children.

Redefines \"Office,\" \"Director,\" and \"Council\" to refer, respectively, to: (1) the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs; (2) the Director of the Office; and (3) the National Advisory and Coordinating Council on Bilingual Education. Includes specified Adult Education Act programs as examples under the definition of \"other programs for persons of limited English proficiency.\" Provides that the Secretary's consultation with various entities in prescribing regulations under the Act shall be done through the Council. Requires that part A funds shall be used for programs of: (1) transitional bilingual education; (2) developmental bilingual education; (3) academic excellence; (4) family English literacy; (5) bilingual preschool, special education, and gifted and talented education preparatory or supplementary to programs such as those assisted under the Act; and (6) to develop instructional materials in languages for which such materials are commercially unavailable. Provides that grants for programs described under (1) and (2) shall be for 3 years with an additional 2 years upon reapplication, those described under (3) and (4) shall be for three years, and those described under (5) and (6) shall be for one to three years.

Sets forth a new part B \"Data Collection, Evaluation, and Research.\" (Redesignates the current part B \"Administration\" as part D.) Provides that funds available under part B shall be used for: (1) collecting data on the number of limited English proficient persons and the educational services available to such persons; (2) evaluating the operation and effectiveness of programs assisted under the Act; (3) conducting research to improve the effectiveness of bilingual education programs; and (4) collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data and information on bilingual education. (These new part B provisions also replace and revise some research and evaluation provisions under the current part C \"Supportive Services and Activities.\") Sets forth provisions for part B grants to State programs for collecting, aggregating, analyzing, and publishing data and information on the State's population of limited English proficient persons and the educational services provided or available to them. Sets forth application and reporting requirements for such programs. Sets forth additional activities which such programs may provide for. Sets minimum and maximum limits on the amount of such grants. Directs the Secretary to issue within six months after the date of enactment of this Act, regulations which set forth a comprehensive design for evaluating the programs assisted under part A.

Directs the Secretary to establish, through competitive three-year grants to institutions of higher education, at least two evaluation assistance centers which shall provide, upon the request of SEAs or LEAs, technical assistance regarding methods and techniques for identifying the educational needs and competencies of limited English proficient persons and assessing the educational progress achieved through programs such as those assisted under the Act. Revises provisions for research contracts under the Act. Provides for continuing longitudinal studies on specified aspects of bilingual education. Provides for studies to determine when students' English language proficiency is sufficiently well developed to permit them to derive optional benefits from an all-English instructional program.

Requires the Director of the National Institute of Education to consult with the Director and the Council to insure that research activities under the General Education Act complement and do not duplicate activities under part B of the Act. Directs the National Center for Education Statistics to collect and publish as part of its annual report on the condition of education specified data relating to numbers of limited English proficient persons, programs available for their education, and teachers and staff participating in or training for such programs. Sets forth a new part C \"Training and Technical Assistance.\" (Current law has some similar training provisions under part A. The current part C is entitled \"Supportive Services and Activities.\") Requires that funds available under the new part C be used to: (1) establish, operate, and improve training programs for educational personnel preparing to participate in, or personnel participating in, the conduct of programs of bilingual education (requires that such training programs emphasize opportunities for career development, advancement, and lateral mobility, and permits training of teachers, administrators, counselors, teacher aides, and parents); (2) train persons to teach and counsel such bilingual education personnel; (3) encourage reform, innovation, and improvement in applicable education curricula in graduate education, in the structure of the academic profession, and in recruitment and retention of higher education and graduate school faculties, as related to bilingual education; (4) operate short-term training institutes designed to improve the skills of participants in programs of bilingual education, which may include summer programs designed to include the instructional competency of educational personnel in the languages used in the program; and (5) provide inservice training and technical assistance to parents and educational personnel participating in, or preparing to participate in, bilingual education programs.
