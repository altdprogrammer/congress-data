Requires the Commission to study and report to Congress on: (1) the sufficiency of the statutory directive which permits the Commission to distinguish between conventional sources of electric power and newer sources in establishing electric power rates; and (2) the general standards which apply to the determination of electric power rates under electric power pooling arrangements."
