    "text": "Requires the Comptroller General to review each employee performance appraisal system of each Federal agency, with certain exceptions, at least once every five years and to report his or her findings and recommendations to specified congressional committees. Requires that such a review specifically consider: (1) the adequacy of training provided to persons evaluating performance; (2) the objectivity of evaluation criteria; (3) the effectiveness of the appraisal system in contributing to adequate, or better, performance; (4) the accuracy and fairness of the system as perceived by employees; (5) the compliance of the system with applicable laws and regulations, particularly with regard to employee notice and participation; (6) the relation between the design and operation of the system; and (7) indications of employee morale. Requires any agency or the Office of Personnel Management to submit any proposed change in a performance appraisal system to the Comptroller General. Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) review such proposal to determine its impact on the employees and areas of public service involved; and (2) report his or her findings to specified congressional committees within a specified period. Prohibits such a proposal from taking effect until 60 days after such report is submitted. Prohibits the Comptroller General from reviewing any proposal that is the subject of ongoing labor-management negotiations. Requires an agency's performance appraisal system to ensure that each officer or employee responsible for appraising performance is adequately trained in such duty. Directs the Comptroller General to review Senior Executive Service performance appraisal systems in the same manner as provided for other systems under this Act. Requires each agency to establish a program under which any organization representing a substantial number of supervisory or managerial personnel shall be entitled to present its views on proposed changes in a performance appraisal system affecting its members. Establishes the negotiability of the establishment of performance standards, at the election of the labor organization involved."
