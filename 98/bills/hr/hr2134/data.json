    "text": "Milk Stabilization Act of 1983 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to reduce FY 1984 and 1985 minimum milk price supports from 75 to 70 percent of parity. States that for FY 1984 and 1985 the parity price of milk shall be determined as of October 1 of each such marketing year. Limits annual milk purchases to 3,500,000,000 pounds for each marketing year during FY 1984 and 1985. Sets forth: (1) various individual marketing bases; and (2) base assignment priorities. Allows an applicant to appeal a State committee's marketing base decision only to the Secretary of Agriculture. Requires the Secretary to determine a production percentage reduction if estimated milk production exceeds market requirements and Government purchases. Establishes two assessment rates (50% and 75%) for excess production. Makes any person producing milk commercially in the United States liable for such assessments. Sets forth collection and enforcement provisions. Establishes in the Treasury a Dairy Product Stabilization Fund. Terminates such Fund on February 1, 1986, (remaining funds to be transferred to the Commodity Credit Corporation). Authorizes domestic and foreign surplus dairy donations for five years."
