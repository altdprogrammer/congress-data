    "text": "Personal Safety Firearms Act of 1983 - Amends the Federal criminal code to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to determine which States or local governments have adopted adequate permit systems for the possession of handguns. Authorizes the Secretary to issue licenses to possess and receive handguns to individuals in States not having such systems. Prohibits any individual who is not licensed from possessing or receiving a handgun. Makes this prohibition inapplicable for 15 days after a person receives a handgun by operation of law. Authorizes the Secretary to issue registration certificates for handguns to individuals who are licensed or permitted to possess or receive handguns. Prohibits any individual from possessing, transferring, or receiving an unregistered handgun. Makes this prohibition inapplicable for 30 days after a person receives a handgun by operation of law. Exempts licensed importers, manufacturers, and dealers. Requires the transferor of a handgun to obtain a completed registration application from the transferee and to mail the application to the Secretary. Makes it unlawful for a possessor of a handgun to refuse to display the registration certificate upon demand of a Federal, State, or local governmental officer with arrest authority. Prohibits a licensed dealer from selling handgun ammunition without requiring the purchaser to exhibit a registration certificate. Directs the Secretary not to approve for sale or delivery by a licensed dealer, importer, manufacturer, or collector any handgun model unless samples of such model are evaluated and found to meet certain standards. Specifies standards for pistols and revolvers, including dimensions, frame construction, weight, caliber, and safety features. Directs the Secretary to compile and publish annually in the Federal Register a list of approved handgun models and to furnish such list to approved licensees. Sets forth procedures governing handgun models which are found not to comply with the relevant standards. Makes it unlawful for any person to reduce the length of a previously approved handgun if, as a result of such change, the handgun no longer meets the approved standard. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Defines such offense as using a firearm to commit a felony over which the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction or carrying a firearm during such a felony involving violence. Deletes the requirement that the firearm be carried \"illegally.\" Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to five to ten years' imprisonment for a first offender (currently, one to ten years) and to ten years to life imprisonment for a second or subsequent offender (currently, two to 25 years). Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose concurrent sentences."
