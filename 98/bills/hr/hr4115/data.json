    "text": "Fair Practices in Automotive Products Act - Sets forth for all motor vehicle manufacturers which produce over 100,000 motor vehicles for ultimate retail sale in the United States \"minimum domestic content ratios\" (the domestic value, including labor and parts, of the manufacturer's production costs of all automotive products sold in the United States). Requires all vehicle manufacturers producing more than 100,000 motor vehicles for sale in the United States to provide information to the Secretary of Transportation for the purpose of administering this requirement. Establishes penalties for a vehicle manufacturer who fails to meet the minimum domestic content ratio. Directs the Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and prepare a written report regarding policies and practices vehicle manufacturers use to persuade U.S. motor vehicle dealers to favor foreign-made parts rather than domestically produced parts."
