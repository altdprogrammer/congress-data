States that the first title shall contain: (1) the level of total budget outlays and total new budget authority; (2) the amount of any surplus or deficit; (3) the recommended level of Federal revenues; and (4) the appropriate level of the public debt. Requires the second title to contain the levels of new budget authority and estimates of budget outlays for each of the major functional categories. Prescribes a two-step process for the consideration of amendments to such budget resolution by which amendments to the first title must be considered and disposed of prior to the consideration of amendments to the second title. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - States that such amendments are enacted as an exercise of Congressional rulemaking power."
