    "text": "Indian Tribal Governmental Tax Status Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to treat an Indian tribal government as a State for purposes of: (1) credit for contributions to candidates for public office; (2) excluding from gross income amounts received from a sickness and disability fund; (3) exclusion of scholarship and fellowship grants; (4) the business expenses deduction relating to appearances with respect to legislation; (5) taxation of contributions of certain employers for employee annuities; (6) discount obligations issued by tribal governments; (7) credits and deductions for tribal death taxes for purposes of determining Federal estate tax liability; and (8) arrangements for Federal collection of tribal income taxes. Authorizes Indian tribal governments to issue tax-exempt industrial development bonds if substantially all the proceeds of the issue are used with respect to facilities located on a reservation. Authorizes Indian tribal governments to issue mortgage subsidy bonds. Permits the issuance of tax-exempt bonds the proceeds of which are to be used for utility-type activities. Limits the amount of an industrial development bond or mortgage bond issue to $7,500,000 per tribe. Extends permanently the provisions of the Indian Tribal Governmental Tax Status Act of 1982."
