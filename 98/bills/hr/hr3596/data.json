States that the instrument of conveyance to the District of Columbia shall revert back to the United States if such conditions have not been complied with and such noncompliance has not been corrected within 90 days after written notice has been received by the Mayor. Prohibits the bringing of an action for use violation before 90 days after notice to the Mayor of the alleged violation and the intent to bring such action. Includes certain parking sections as part of the schematic design of the Map to Designate Transfer of Stadium and Parking Lots to The District."
