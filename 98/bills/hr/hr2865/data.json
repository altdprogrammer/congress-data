    "text": "Public Works Investment Act of 1983 - Title I: Payments for Local Public Works - Directs that Federal payments made under this title be used for construction, renovation, repair, and improvement of local public works owned or operated by a State government, a unit of local government, or an agency or instrumentality of one or more States or units of local government. Prohibits using such payments for the acquisition of any interest in real property or for the construction, renovation, repair, and improvement of any recreational or cultural facility. Sets forth the amount of such payments for each unit of general local government and State, subject to the availability of appropriations. Requires local governments receiving such payments to make certain assurances in order to qualify for the payments. Requires States and local governments to agree to certain conditions, with respect to the use of any Federal payment under this title, in order to qualify for such payments. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title. Title II: Existing Programs - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to increase the amount of authorized appropriations for FY 1984 for grants for municipal wastewater treatment. Prohibits the total of all obligations for airport development, airport planning, and airport noise compatibility planning and programs from exceeding certain amounts for FY 1983 and 1984. Prohibits the total of all obligations for certain Federal assistance to urban mass transportation (including grants and loans) from exceeding a specified amount for FY 1984. Amends the Highway Improvement Act of 1982 to increase the maximum amount of the total of all obligations for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction for FY 1984. Modifies the total amount which may be obligated to each State for qualifying highway improvements for FY 1983 and 1984. Requires the repayment of such increases in the Federal share to be repaid by such States by FY 1985. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to deduct any unpaid repayments from certain funds apportioned to such States in FY 1985 and 1986, according to a specified formula."
