Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental impact statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Monroe and Polk Counties in Tennessee shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in such counties which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in such counties reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. States that the provisions of this paragraph shall also apply to National Forest System roadless lands in Monroe and Polk Counties, Tennessee of less than 5,000 acres. Requires the Secretary to review the Little Frog Wilderness Study Area and the Big Frog Study Area, both located in the Cherokee National Forest, to determine their suitability for preservation as wilderness."
