Directs the Secretary to establish fee schedules for services and prescription drugs which will set the maximum \"Medicard\" payment amounts. Provides for reimbursement to a fee-for-service provider: (1) in the case of a charge which is less than the fee schedule charge, of the lesser of the amount charged or 80 percent of the fee schedule charge; or (2) in the case of a charge which is more than the fee schedule charge, of 80 percent of the fee schedule charge by any amount exceeding the fee schedule. Provides that in the case of inpatient hospital services furnished to Medicare (title XVIII of the Social Security Act) eligible individuals, the payment amounts shall be 100 percent instead of 80 percent, reduced by coinsurance amounts of: (1) ten percent for the first ten days of inpatient hospital services in a year; and (2) five percent for the next 50 days, with no such reductions thereafter. Reduces the amount otherwise payable annually to an eligible individual by $250, but provides that the reduction for a family of four or more shall not exceed $1,000.

Provides that in the case of an individual enrolled in a health insurance plan or with a prepaid provider, the plan or provider is entitled to a capitation payment equal to: (1) 95 percent, or 100 percent for Medicaid (title XIX of the Social Security Act) eligible individuals, of the estimated cost to the Government of payments of services made on the fee-for-service basis; and (2) 100 percent of the amount by which the per capita annual fee-for-service administrative costs to the Government exceeds such costs under the paragraph. Sets forth the requirements for a qualified plan or provider. Sets forth covered services. Provides for catastrophic coverage for expenses incurred during that part of a calendar year after covered members incur, in the 15 month period ending with December of the year, covered medical expenses equal to the stop loss amount.

Creates a board of trustees for the Fund and sets forth its duties (which include reports to Congress).

Title II: Revenue Provisions - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax on an eligible individual based upon the health care benefits imputed to such individual.

Requires providers providing imputed benefit income to send to each eligible individual to whom services were provided a statement of the amount of income imputed. Taxes employer contributions to accident and health plans. Repeals the medical expenses deduction. Title III: Conforming Amendments to Medicare, Medicaid, and Other Programs - Repeals part A (Hospital Insurance) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act.
