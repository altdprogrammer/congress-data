Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to promote a reserve general officer who is in an inactive status for less than a year solely because such officer's tenure in a selected position has ended. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to retain up to ten officers in the reserve grade of brigadier general who would otherwise be removed from active duty because of years in service or grade.

Repeals the four-year limitation on the assignment of individual officers to the headquarters branches of the Army and Air Force. Part C: Amendments to Provisions of Law Enacted by the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act - Amends the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act to permit certain former commissioned officers who are originally appointed as Army or Air Force Reserve officers to be appointed at the former grade and credited with such previous time. Increases the authorized total strengths for commissioned officers on active duty for the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. Entitles officers appointed to the grade of general, admiral, lieutenant general, or vice admiral for service in a position of importance and responsibility designated to carry that grade to continue to hold that grade for 90 days while waiting for retirement. Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to prescribe procedures for review of the substandard performance of an officer. (Currently, such Secretary may convene a board of officers for such purpose.) Excludes from eligibility for promotion to the next higher grade certain officers who are within 90 days of separation or retirement or who have been considered and failed selection for promotion to that grade, including reserve officers for captain, naval officers for lieutenant, and regular armed forces officers for captain after the second failure. States that the lack of completion of required service does not prevent the discharge or transfer of a commissioned reserve officer, other than a warrant officer, who is not qualified for promotion to the grade of first lieutenant (or lieutenant, junior grade, in the Navy). Requires the discharge of such officers within 18 months of a determination of nonqualification unless such officers have completed 18 but not yet 20 years of service. Revises the retirement provisions for certain regular Naval and Marine Corps officers designated for limited duty to permit such officers to remain on active duty for an extended time when retirement is deferred. Amends the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act to permit certain Naval and Marine Corps Officers designated for limited duty who are serving in a temporary grade to be reappointed at the permanent grade held while on the active duty list. Permits the Secretary of the military department concerned to determine eligibility for and amount of severance or readjustment pay for certain officers discharged or released after the date of this Act.

Part E: Miscellaneous - Directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide recruitment quotas for women for FY 1987 through 1988. Directs the Secretary of Defense to study and report to Congress on the propensity of young women to serve in the military.

Requires such system to be the same for active and reserve units. Requires the Secretary to report to the Armed Services Committees by March 31, 1985, on the existing and newly implemented systems. Directs the Secretary to conduct a test program which would evaluate the feasibility of assigning equipment to reserve units based on their effectiveness. Requires such program to be integrated with the unit evaluation program. Directs the Secretary to report to the Armed Services Committees on the design and implementation of such program as part of the evaluation report. Expresses the sense of Congress that the number of members of the Army Reserve and National Guard assigned to full-time manning duty should be increased to 14 percent of the total membership by FY 1989. Directs the Secretary to study and implement a test program examining the benefits of a longer training program for certain reserve units.

Grants the Purple Heart award uniform display precedence over all but military decorations or awards for valor. Directs the Secretary of Defense to form a study group on the dress and appearance standards for members in the armed services, particularly those members wishing to abide by religious tenets which involve religious garb. Requires a report to be made to the Secretary by February 1, 1985, and then to Congress. Requires any changes in military dress regulations resulting from such study to be implemented within a specified period. Title VI: Compensation and Other Personnel Benefits - Part A: Basic Pay and Allowances - Increases by 4.0 percent, effective January 1, 1985, the rates of basic pay for all military personnel not serving in grade E-1. Increases the basic allowance for quarters to 65 percent of the national median housing costs for each pay grade. Extends through January 1, 1985, limitations on payments of the variable housing allowance set forth in the Department of Defense Appropriation Act, 1984 and the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1984. Requires that the variable housing allowances be paid where the local median cost of housing for a pay grade exceeds 80 percent of the national median cost of housing for such grade. Requires future adjustments of such rates to coincide with military pay increases but be based upon changes in certain weighted elements of the housing component of the Consumer Price Index. Excludes from eligibility for such allowance a member living in government housing who receives a basic allowance for quarters at the \"with dependents\" rate solely because such member pays child support or is in travel status between permanent duty stations. Includes service members stationed in Alaska and Hawaii in the variable (rather than the overseas) housing allowance program. Extends for one year, through FY 1985, the authority to provide reimbursement in place of quarters to crew members assigned to a naval vessel rendered temporarily uninhabitable. Authorizes the Secretary of a military department to deny a service member the option of living away from the base when to do so would adversely affect a training mission. Authorizes the Secretary of the military department concerned to commute the ration (pay a cash allowance in lieu of providing a meal) for enlisted members of the guard and reserves entitled to a mid-day meal. Requires the forfeiture of leave for service members who are discharged for failing to serve satisfactorily before completing six months of active duty. Denies credit for time spent in a delayed enlistment program for purposes of computing basic pay. Part B: Travel and Transportation - Authorizes the use of commercial transportation at government expense for dependents who accompany service members on their tours of duty in Alaska and Hawaii and who require medical care not locally available. Expands Government-funded emergency leave travel to include transportation for military members and their dependents from the continental United States to overseas areas. Entitles certain reserve component instructors teaching at a location other than the one assigned to travel and transportation expenses. Authorizes the use of Department motor vehicles for transportation between domicile and place of employment for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and the Air Forces, the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and the Under Secretaries of Defense. Part C: Special Pay and Incentive Plans - Extends for three years, through FY 1987, the authority to pay enlistment and reenlistment bonuses for the active forces. Extends the special pay provisions for certain Navy aviation career officers from FY 1984 to FY 1985. Directs the Secretary of Defense to report to the Armed Services Committees by February 1, 1985, on the adequacy of aviation career officer incentive pay and the effect, if any, of the special pay for Navy pilots on the recruiting and retention needs of the armed forces. Extends from 12 to 18 the maximum number of years an enlisted member of the uniformed services assigned to sea duty is entitled to receive career sea pay. Increases the amount of proficiency pay for members of the uniformed services performing extremely difficult or unusually responsible duties.
