    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 98-1025) Civil Aeronautics Board Sunset Act of 1984 - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to terminate certain functions of the Civil Aeronautics Board and transfer others to the Department of Transportation. Transfers to the Department the authority of the Board concerning: (1) consolidation, merger, and acquisition of control; (2) interlocking relationships; (3) pooling and other agreements; and (4) antitrust exemptions. (Currently, such authority is scheduled for transfer to the Department of Justice effective January 1, 1985). Terminates such authority of the Department of Transportation on January 1, 1989. Terminates the authority of the Board with respect to the air carriage of mail, tariffs of air carriers, and rates of service on January 1, 1985. Terminates the authority of the Board with respect to stock ownership disclosures, loans and financial aid approvals, special operating authorizations, and certain rate-making provisions on January 1, 1985. Transfers to the U.S. Postal Service the Board's authority to set rates for domestic mail, except with respect to the carriage of mail within Alaska. Transfers such authority with respect to Alaska to the Department of Transportation. Deems all authority of the Board not otherwise terminated or transferred on or before January 1, 1985, to be transferred to the Department of Transportation. Transfers the authority of the Department of Transportation to set rates for the carriage of mail within Alaska to the Postal Service on January 1, 1989. Directs the Postal Service to exercise such authority through negotiations or competitive bidding. Transfers to the Secretary of Transportation all functions, powers, and duties of the Board under specified provisions of law. Requires the Secretary to collect and disseminate certain information on passengers traveling in interstate and overseas air transportation. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring air carriers to submit such information on a flight-by-flight basis. Requires the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees by July 1, 1987, with respect to consolidation transactions, interlocking relationships, and agreements that have been exempted under the antitrust laws and recommend whether such authority should be retained or repealed. Requires both the Secretary and the Postmaster General to submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees by July 1, 1987, on their respective authorities to establish rates for the air transportation of mail, including recommendations with respect to such authority in Alaska. Authorizes air carriers to incorporate by reference in any ticket or other written instrument any of the terms of the contract of carriage in air transportation. Makes miscellaneous amendments to conform to provisions of this Act. Transfers to the appropriate agencies the personnel, assets, liabilities, and records connected with any function transferred by this Act. Requires the Board or the Secretary (as the case may be) to consult with the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board prior to issuing or amending any order, rule, regulation, or procedure that will have a significant impact on the accessibility of commercial airports or air transportation for handicapped persons. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to study the feasibility of constructing a rail rapid transit line between the West Falls Church, Virginia, station of the Washington, D. C., metrorail system and Dulles International Airport in Virginia. Declares that until January 1, 1987, essential air service at specified cities in Alaska shall be operated with the size aircraft provided for in a certain Board order, unless otherwise specified under an agreement between the Department of Transportation and Alaska. Limits the amount of compensation which may be paid for such essential air transportation for FY 1985 and 1986, and for the period beginning October 1, 1986, and ending December 31, 1986. Directs the Secretary to study the feasibility of providing such transportation with smaller capacity aircraft, the level of compensation required for such transportation, and the impact of such aircraft on the air transportation system in Alaska. Requires a report to Congress on such study by January 1, 1986. Prohibits a specified Board order from taking effect before December 31, 1984."
