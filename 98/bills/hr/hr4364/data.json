    "text": "Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to prohibit the dumping of municipal sludge, except as provided in the Act. (Current law prohibits dumping sludge, except as provided in the Act.) Defines \"municipal sludge\" as solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated by a wastewater treatment plant. Authorizes issuance of a dumping permit for any hazardous waste identified and listed under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1979 only if the waste will be incinerated at sea or rapidly neutralized in the marine environment. Authorizes the issuance of a dumping permit for municipal sludge only if: (1) the plant generating the sludge is in compliance with requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act; and (2) a suitable land-based alternative to ocean disposal is not available. Requires, rather than permits, the imposition of processing fees for permits. Sets forth provisions regarding the dumping of municipal sludge in the New York Bight Apex. Prohibits dumping in the Apex after the earlier of December 31, 1986, or the day the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determines that municipal sludge can reasonably be dumped elsewhere. Permits dumping, however, after December 1, 1986: (1) if dumping in the Apex will result in less harm than dumping elsewhere; and (2) until a more suitable location is found. Imposes fees for municipal sludge dumped in the Apex of: (1) $25 for each dry ton dumped during 1984; (2) $40 for each dry ton dumped during 1985; and (3) $55 for each dry ton dumped after 1985. Requires the fees, whether used by the Administrator or local authorities, to be utilized as specified for the improvement of the Apex. Provides for trust accounts for local authorities for any fee amounts not paid to the Administrator. Requires the Administrator to: (1) prepare a comprehensive assessment of disposal options for municipal sludge generated by local authorities; (2) prepare a New York Bight Apex Restoration Plan; and (3) carry out base-line monitoring of alternative sites. Requires the assessment and plan to be submitted to Congress. Requires the assessment to be prepared in consultation with State and local officials from New York and New Jersey. Requires the Administrator to submit a report to Congress on the technological and economic feasibility of establishing and implementing quality standards for the disposal of municipal sludge through ocean or land-based methods. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 to the Environmental Protection Agency for purposes of preparing the New York Bight Apex Restoration Plan."
