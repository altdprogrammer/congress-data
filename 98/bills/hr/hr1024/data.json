Requires a showing of: (1) good management; (2) temporary inability to pay due to circumstances beyond one's control; and (3) reasonable chance of repayment. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to provide notification of such programs to Farmers Home Administration borrowers. Provides for loan consolidation and rescheduling (at interest rates not in excess of the original loan rates) at the end of such deferral period."
