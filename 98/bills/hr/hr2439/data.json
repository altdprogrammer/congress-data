Decreases the maximum amount of grant money allotted for a fiscal year to States for low-income home energy assistance which a State may request to be held available for the next fiscal year. Specifies additional home energy and home energy assistance data which the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to collect on a State-by-State basis. Specifies the dates by which the Secretary's annual reports on such data must be submitted to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate, and specified House and Senate Committee Chairmen. Requires that States applying for grants under such Act agree to cooperate with the Secretary with respect to data collecting and reporting requirements. Requires that State applications for grants include provisions describing eligibility requirements for each type of assistance under such Act. Provides that a State's request that grant money allotted to a State for the next fiscal year for low-income home energy assistance be held available for the next fiscal year shall include a statement of the reasons why the amount to be held available was not used during the fiscal year for which it was allotted."
