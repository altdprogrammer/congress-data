    "text": "Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1983 - Establishes the Arctic Science Policy Council to: (1) facilitate cooperation between the Federal Government and State and local governments with respect to Arctic research; (2) promote cooperative Arctic research programs with other nations; (3) develop and supervise an integrated national Arctic science policy; and (4) cooperate with the Governor and agencies of Alaska in formulating Arctic science policy. Requires the Council to: (1) appoint the members of an Arctic Research Commission; (2) publish, annually, a statement of goals and objectives of Arctic research to guide such Commission; and (3) submit an annual report on its activities to Congress. Requires Federal agencies to cooperate with the Council and furnish any nonproprietary information relating to Arctic research that the Council may request. Establishes the Arctic Research Commission. Directs the Commission to: (1) survey Arctic research conducted by Federal, State, and local agencies and public and private institutions to determine priorities and make recommendations for future research; (2) establish a data collection and retrieval center for Arctic research; (3) promulgate guidelines for the use and dissemination of Arctic research information; (4) consult with the Council and make grants for Arctic research; (5) transmit, annually, a report on its activities, with recommendations on future Arctic research policy to the Council; (6) submit to Congress and the State legislature of Alaska a report making recommendations on the continued operation of Government-operated laboratory facilities conducting Arctic research; and (7) cooperate with the Governor and agencies of Alaska with respect to Arctic research and management of Arctic scientific and technological data. Authorizes the State of Alaska to elect whether or not it will participate in Council and Commission activities. Provides that the failure of Alaska, in any fiscal year, to contribute to the Arctic Research Fund an amount equal to one quarter of the U.S. appropriation to such Fund for the preceding fiscal year shall constitute an election not to participate. Modifies Council and Commission membership requirements if Alaska elects not to participate. Creates the Arctic Research Fund to support the activities of the Council and the Commission. Requires such Fund to consist of amounts appropriated by the United States and contributed by Alaska and private sources. Authorizes appropriations for such Fund for FY 1985-1989."
