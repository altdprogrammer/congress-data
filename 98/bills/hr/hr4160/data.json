    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-10-19", 
    "text": "Fair Practices and Procedures in Automotive Products Act of 1983 - Requires the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a study for the purpose of formulating a strategy to increase the domestic production of automotive products for sale and distribution in interstate commerce. Prohibits such strategy from including either deregulation or macroeconomic measures designed to stimulate general economic growth. Establishes within the Department of Transportation the United States Automobile Industry Advisory Council. Requires the council to assist in formulating a strategy to increase the domestic production of automotive products for sale and distribution in interstate commerce. Sets forth for all motor vehicle manufacturers which produce over 100,000 motor vehicles for ultimate retail sale in the United States \"minimum domestic content ratios\" (the domestic value, including labor and parts, of the manufacturer's production costs of all automotive products sold in the United States). Requires all vehicle manufacturers producing more than 100,000 motor vehicles for sale in the United States to provide information to the Secretary of Transportation for the purpose of administering this requirement. Establishes penalties for a vehicle manufacturer who fails to meet the minimum domestic content ratio beginning with the first model year following January 1, 1984. Provides that the Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Trade Commission conduct a continuing study of the effectiveness and impact of this legislation. Directs the Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and prepare a written report regarding policies and practices of vehicle manufacturers used to persuade U.S. motor vehicle dealers to favor foreign made parts rather than domestically produced parts. Requires the Secretary to make a continuing study of the impact of this Act on employment at retail motor vehicle dealerships in the United States, especially franchises that deal partly or exclusively in imports."
