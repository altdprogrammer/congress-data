    "text": "Joint Research Act of 1983 - Authorizes the Attorney General to issue certificates of review to two or more persons to promote joint research and development programs. Directs the Attorney General to issue such a certificate for an applicant whose application: (1) specifies conduct which is limited to a research and development program and which does not violate Federal antitrust laws; and (2) contains any other information the Attorney General requires. Requires that such a certificate specify: (1) the conduct to which it applies; (2) the participating business entities; and (3) any conditions applicable to such conduct. Directs certificate recipients to notify the Attorney General of any change in conduct or business entities. Permits such recipient to apply to amend such certificate. Directs the Attorney General to modify or revoke a certificate, after providing 30 days notice, upon determining that conduct allowed under the certificate violates antitrust laws. Authorizes the certificate holders to bring an action in the appropriate U.S. district court to set aside such determination. Precludes any other judicial review of any determination by the Attorney General concerning the issuance, amendment, or revocation of a certificate. Declares that any such determination is inadmissible as evidence in any proceeding in support of any claim under the antitrust laws. Exempts any certificate holder from criminal action, liability for threatened loss or damage, or liability exceeding actual damages, lost interest, and the cost of suit for a violation of Federal antitrust laws or similar State laws if: (1) the violation arises from conduct specified in the certificate; and (2) the certificate is in effect at the time the conduct occurs. Awards a certificate holder the cost of defending against a claim for damages resulting from a violation of antitrust laws if the court finds that: (1) the conduct alleged to violate such laws does not; and (2) the conduct is specified in the certificate. Declares that a certificate shall have no legal effect on the authority of a court to grant equitable relief in an action for an antitrust violation against a certificate holder. Exempts information submitted by a person in connection with the issuance, amendment, or revocation of a certificate from the Freedom of Information Act. Specifies conditions for the disclosure of such information. Allows the Attorney General to issue guidelines describing the types of conduct that would and would not qualify for a certificate."
