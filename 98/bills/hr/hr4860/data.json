Requires the Secretary to continue Federal enforcement of the part of a tribal regulatory program that is not being enforced by a tribe. Sets forth procedures for issuance of mining permits under tribal and Federal regulatory programs. Directs the Secretary to implement a program to compensate tribes for the fair market value of coal that is precluded from being mined under specified law. Applies specified environmental protection performance standards to Indian lands.
