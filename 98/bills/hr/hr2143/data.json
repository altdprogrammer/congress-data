    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-03-16", 
    "text": "Secondary Education Assistance Act of 1982 - Amends the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 to authorize the Secretary of Education to make payments to local educational agencies in amounts of up to $300 for each eligible student in qualified secondary schools in the area served by that agency. Defines \"eligible students\" as secondary students counted for purposes of determining the amounts of basic grants to educational agencies under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Defines a \"qualified secondary school\" as a public or nonprofit private secondary school not less than 30 percent of whose students are eligible students. Directs each local educational agency to allocate funds it receives among schools, on the basis of the number of eligible students in each school, for programs designed to serve educationally deprived youths. Permits an agency to use funds only for programs and projects included in an approved application for assistance. Sets forth application requirements, including requirements for agency assurances to make a good faith effort to improve the quality of instruction and to provide necessary records and information for audits and program evaluation. Prohibits the use of any funds provided under this Act or any facility or equipment obtained with such funds for any sectarian activity. Requires an agency to arrange special educational services in which eligible students of private schools may participate and which involve expenditures equal to expenditures under this Act for eligible students of public schools. Directs the Secretary to: (1) arrange for provision of such services if a local educational agency is prohibited by law from providing such services or if such agency has failed to provide such services; and (2) pay the provider of such services from such agency's allocation of funds. Requires the Secretary to afford an agency 45 days to show cause why the Secretary should not take such action. Provides for the appeal and judicial review of such an action. Provides for the reduction of an agency's allocation of funds under this Act based on the levels of State and agency funding for free public education during the preceding two years. Prohibits an agency from using funds under this Act to replace funds that would otherwise be made available from non-Federal sources. Allows an agency to receive funds under this Act only if: (1) State and local funds will be used to provide areas of the agency's district with services comparable to services provided in other district areas which are not receiving funds under this Act; or (2) all school attendance areas in the agency's district are designated as project areas and State and local funds are used to provide comparable services to each area."
