Exempts from the automatic stay of bankruptcy proceedings the commencement of an action to foreclose a mortgage on a vessel by the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce under the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920 and the Merchant Marine Act, 1936. Terminates the authority of the Federal Maritime Commission to initiate investigations necessary to carry out the provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936. Reserves such investigations to the Secretary of Transportation. Extends the authority of the Secretary to provide war risk insurance and reinsurance until September 30, 1989. (Currently such authority expires on September 30, 1984.)"
