Authorizes a State, under title XIX, to establish a program under which individuals are furnished home care services if they: (1) are eligible for Medicaid, or would be eligible if institutionalized; or (2) would require institutional care but for the furnishing of home care services. Provides that such program need not be in effect statewide. Makes participation in the program by any individual voluntary. Requires that such a program: (1) assess the needs of each applicant; (2) develop a plan of care for each eligible individual; and (3) provide a case-management system for each individual. Provides that Federal funding to a State for the program shall be equal to the Federal medical assistance percentage, increased by ten percentage points of the total spent by the State for the program. Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require hospitals and skilled nursing facilities participating in Medicare to have in effect a procedure for the discharge planning of each patient who may be eligible for home care services under a State's medicaid program."
