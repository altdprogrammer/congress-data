Title II: Poultry Products Inspection Act Amendments - Amends the Poultry Products Inspection Act to set forth similar inspection factors as established in title I of this Act. Title III: Egg Products Inspection Act Amendments - Amends the Egg Products Inspection Act to set forth similar inspection factors as established in title I of this Act. Reduces the required number of annual egg shell surveillance visits from four to one. Title IV: Inspection Requirements - States that nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorizing the Secretary to require any establishment to participate in a total plant quality-control program as a prerequisite to inspection under the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Egg Products Inspection Act. Title V: Effective Date - States that the provisions of this Act shall become effective on enactment."
