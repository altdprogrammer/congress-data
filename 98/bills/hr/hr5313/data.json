Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) study issues relating to the transportation of methanol through the interstate liquid pipeline system and make recommendations for the safe and efficient transportation of methanol through such pipeline, and report the results of the study to Congress; and (2) study the feasibility of and costs connected with requiring various methods of testing and inspecting hazardous liquid pipeline facilities subject to provisions of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 and to report the results to Congress. Directs the Secretary to: (1) make recommendations, based on the study undertaken under clause (2) of the previous sentence and on consultation between the Secretary and the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee, as to the frequency and type of testing and inspection of pipeline facilities which should be required; and (2) report the recommendations to Congress. Requires, under provisions of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, any person owning or operating interstate transmission facilities, within 120 days of the enactment of this Act, to submit a report to the Secretary which: (1) identifies the location and condition of all pipeline facilities whose construction was completed before January 1, 1938; (2) identifies any leaks in such pipeline facilities; and (3) includes the most recent leak survey information compiled by such owner or operator with respect to such pipelines. Directs the Secretary, within 90 days of receiving any such report, to: (1) inspect such pipeline facilities, except when the Secretary determines that a pipeline facility is in safe condition; and (2) identify any pipeline facilities which might pose a danger to the public health and safety. Authorizes amounts to be appropriated to carry out this paragraph for FY 1985."
