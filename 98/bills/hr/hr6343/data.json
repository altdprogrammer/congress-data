    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-10-01", 
    "text": "Electronic Surveillance Act of 1984 - Amends the Federal criminal code to extend the definition of \"intercept\" for purposes of the interception of communications to allow non-aural acquisition of the contents of such communications. Extends the prohibition against the use of certain evidence secured by intercepted wire or oral communications to cover the contents of communications intercepted in violation of the minimization rule and as part of a pattern of intentional illegality. Authorizes interceptions for the investigation of offenses involving tampering with or retaliating against a witness, victim, or informant. Requires that applications for authorizations for interceptions include a statement of the investigative objectives, the specific targets of the interceptions, and specific reasons why other investigative procedures are not adequate. Permits an ex parte court order to authorize interceptions outside the court's jurisdiction by a motile interception device, if such device is installed within the jurisdiction. Requires, when a court issues an order allowing interception, that: (1) at least one of the parties to such communication be identified in the order; and (2) the court has found probable cause that virtually all the users of the designated facility or telephone are doing so for the object of the investigation, or for monitoring voices as part of such investigation. Allows the order to authorize physical entry to install an electronic, mechanical, or other device in situations where there is no other less intrusive means of effecting interception. Requires reports every two weeks to the judge who issued the order showing progress made toward achievement of the authorized objective. Prohibits any person acting under the authority of the United States from installing or using a pen register or engaging in video surveillance except as authorized by the criminal code with regard to interceptions of oral communications."
