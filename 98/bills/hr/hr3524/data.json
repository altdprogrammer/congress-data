    "text": "Disability Determinations Reform Act of 1983 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to immediately stop implementation of periodic reviews of disability cases to determine continuing eligibility for those individuals receiving benefits under titles II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) and XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act whose disability is based on mental impairment. Requires the Secretary, as soon as practicable after the enactment of this Act, to: (1) fully examine the disability determination process with respect to cases of mental impairment and make any necessary revisions in such process; and (2) report to Congress the results of such examination. Requires the Secretary to resume the reviews upon approval by Congress of such examination and any revisions by the Secretary. Exempts from such suspension of review any case where a termination of benefits is based upon a finding: (1) that the beneficiary is engaging in substantial gainful activity; (2) of fraud; or (3) which is based on a scheduled review of which the beneficiary was notified upon initial entitlement. Requires the Secretary to notify individuals with respect to whom a periodic review is in progress that such review shall be suspended pursuant to this Act. Sets forth requirements for redeterminations of disability evaluations made: (1) on or after the enactment of this Act and before the date on which Congress approves the examination and revisions of the disability evaluation process made by the Secretary; and (2) between February 28, 1981, and the date of enactment of this Act."
