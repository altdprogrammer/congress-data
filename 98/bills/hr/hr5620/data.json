    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Education and Labor with amendment, H.Rept. 98-747 (Part I)) Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 to increase the authorization of appropriations for low-income home energy assistance for FY 1984 and to extend such authorization through FY 1988. Revises the term \"poverty level\" for purposes of such Act to mean, with respect to any household in a State, the income poverty line as prescribed and revised pursuant to the Community Services Block Grant Act. Provides that the State median income promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall be adjusted to prevent any change in income calculation procedures which would result in the reduction in or exclusion from participation of households in programs under such Act. Prohibits the allotment of funds to a State for low-income home energy assistance unless the Secretary determines that the State's application for funds satisfies the requirements of such Act and is complete. Requires that at least five percent of a State's allotment be reserved until May 15 of each year for energy crisis intervention. Requires that a State's annual application for funds for low-income home energy assistance indicate: (1) the number and type of households in the State eligible for such assistance; (2) the level of and method for determining household benefits under the assistance program; and (3) the method of program administration to be used. Requires as part of such application that a State agree to: (1) designate local community-based public or nonprofit entities to administer energy crisis intervention programs; and (2) indicate the amount which the State will reserve for energy crisis intervention and the administrative procedures for designating an energy crisis, for determining the amount of assistance to be provided during such a crisis, and for determining the use of funds reserved for energy crisis intervention but not so used. Requires that the State plan which is part of the annual application contain funding estimates for the State's low-income home energy assistance programs and describe the eligibility requirements to be used under such programs. Provides that a State shall expend funds in accordance with an approved State plan. Requires that the periodic evaluation by the Comptroller General of State expenditures of grants received under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 occur at least every three years. Increases the maximum amount of funds received under such Act which a State may use for low-cost residential weatherization or other energy-related home repair for low-income households. Decreases the maximum amount of grant money allotted for a fiscal year to a State for low-income home energy assistance which a State may request to be held available for the next fiscal year. Specifies additional home energy and home energy assistance data which the Secretary is required to collect on a State-by-State basis. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on such data by June 30 of each year."
