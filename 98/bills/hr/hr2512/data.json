    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-04-12", 
    "text": "Nuclear Power Plant Licensing Reform Act of 1983 - Title I: Siting and Licensing - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require that construction permits for the construction or modification of production or utilization facilities for nuclear material be initially granted after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has provided an opportunity for a public hearing and if the permit application is otherwise acceptable. Requires the NRC to issue an operating license to an applicant upon completion of the construction or modification (after the application has been updated, if appropriate) and upon a finding that the facility authorized will operate according to the application and NRC regulations. Directs the NRC to issue a combined construction permit and operating license for a thermal neutron power generation facility after an opportunity for a hearing has been provided and if there is no danger to the common defense and security and to public health and safety. Requires the NRC, prior to the start of operation of such facility, to publish notice of intended operation and to determine that the facility has been constructed and will operate according to the combined construction permit and operating license terms, the provisions of this Act, and NRC regulations. Requires a supplemental review of any issues not considered in the initial review of the facility before operation of the facility may begin. Provides that in determining whether to issue a permit or license, the NRC shall rely upon a certification of need for the facility and of the alternative sources of generating capacity if the certifying authority verifies that: (1) the certification is made by an organization authorized by law to do so; (2) the certifying authority has followed the proper procedures in making its determinations; (3) the certifying authority has considered alternative energy sources; and (4) there is an opportunity for judicial review by a State of the organization's compliance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Provides that the validity of such certification and verification shall be conclusive with respect to the issuance of any license or permit under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and shall not be subject to administrative or judicial review. Prohibits the NRC from modifying a final determination on an issue made in a permit or license proceeding unless the proponent of the request for such modification makes a substantial evidentiary showing that such modification is required in order to comply with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, other Federal law, or NRC regulations. Requires the NRC to grant a hearing upon the request of any affected person with respect to the granting, suspending, revoking, renewing, or amending of a site permit, a facility design approval, or a combined construction permit and operating license. Requires that notice be published in the Federal Register within 30 days after the docketing of any application for: (1) a construction permit or operating license for a utilization or production facility for industrial or medical therapy purposes; (2) a site permit or renewal of a site permit; (3) a facility design approval or renewal thereof; (4) a combined construction permit and operating license; or (5) an amendment to any of the above permits or licenses. Provides that the NRC shall publish notice twice in major newspapers having national circulation within 30 days after the docketing of any application for the approval of a facility design. Requires public notice when the NRC is considering granting such application. Requires that notice of operation be published in the Federal Register at least one year before the start of operation of any facility for which a combined construction permit and operating license has been issued as well as notice that the NRC will grant a hearing upon the request of any affected person. Limits the issues which may be considered at such a hearing to those not previously considered by the NRC at a proceeding on the facility involved, unless there is new information with respect to the facility's compliance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, other Federal law, or NRC regulations. Authorizes the NRC, if there are no significant hazards considerations, to issue and make immediately effective before a hearing is held and completed any amendment to: a combined construction permit and operating license, a construction permit, a design approval, or a site permit. Requires that notice of any such amendments issued or proposed to be issued be published periodically. Sets forth procedural requirements for NRC hybrid hearings on license or permit applications. Authorizes the NRC to issue, for a ten year term, a site permit for approval of a site for one or more production or utilization facilities prior to the filing of an application for a construction permit or a combined construction permit and operating license for such facilities. Permits a renewal of a site permit upon application by the holder. Directs the NRC to establish procedures permitting the approval of standardized facility designs for thermal neutron power generation facilities prior to the filing of an application for a construction permit or a combined construction permit and operating license for such facilities. Provides that no application filing or issuance fees shall be required for a design approval or an amendment or renewal of a design approval. Requires the NRC to issue a design approval if it is not inimical to the common defense and security or to the public health and safety. Allows a renewal of an approval upon application by the holder. Requires the NRC to approve amendments to a design approval if they comply with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and NRC regulations. Permits the inclusion of a request for a variance from one or more elements of a design approval in any application for a construction permit, an operating license, or a combined construction permit and operating license. Requires the NRC to grant such a variance if it complies with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and NRC regulations. Prohibits the NRC from modifying a final determination on an issue already considered and decided in a site permit or design approval proceeding unless the proponent of the request for such modification makes a substantial evidentiary showing that such modification is required to comply with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, other Federal law, or NRC regulations. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Defines the terms \"substantial evidentiary showing\", \"thermal neutron power generation facility\", and \"standardized design\" for purposes of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Requires the NRC to establish procedures and criteria to be used in determining whether to approve permit or license amendments or to modify final determinations on an issue already considered in a permit or license or in a design approval proceeding. Requires the NRC to prepare an environmental impact statement prior to the issuance of a full site permit. Provides that the issuance of a design approval shall not require any review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Title III: Conforming Amendments - Sets forth conforming amendments. Title IV: Effective Date - Makes this Act effective upon the date of enactment."
