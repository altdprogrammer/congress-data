Makes the same provision for review of decisions by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico regarding possible conflicts between Puerto Rican laws and the constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States. Amends various provisions of Federal law (including the Federal Election Campaign Act, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, and the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973) to provide that certain cases will now be heard by the Supreme Court under its discretionary certiorari authority instead of by direct appeal."
