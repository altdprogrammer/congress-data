Applies provisions of Federal law governing step increases, pay comparability adjustments, and hazardous duty differentials for civil service positions to Federal firefighter positions. Awards a firefighter who earns a bachelor or associate degree in fire sciences a step increase in addition to any increase to which the employee is otherwise entitled. Sets forth formulas for computing overtime pay for firefighters for hours of work scheduled or officially ordered and approved in excess of the maximum hour standard prescribed under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Exempts firefighters from certain provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act requiring payment of a minimum wage and payment of overtime for hours of work exceeding 40 hours a week. Includes the premium pay received by firefighters as basic pay for purposes of computing their civil service retirement benefits."
