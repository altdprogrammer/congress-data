Prohibits the use of motorized equipment, surface explosives, and shot holes in the wilderness areas designated by this Act for purposes of oil, gas, or mineral exploration. Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Arkansas and Oklahoma shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands within the Ozark and Ouachita National Forests in Arkansas and Oklahoma which have not been designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas and from further review as to their suitability for designation as wilderness areas."
