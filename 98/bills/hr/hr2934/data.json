    "text": "Health Planning Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to reduce required Health Systems Agency (HSA) staff from five overall and one per 100,000 residents to three overall and one per 300,000 residents. Provides that HSAs shall review services upon State request (presently HSA mandatory review). Removes the 24-month limit on HSA conditional designation. Eliminates: (1) the 90-day notice of termination requirement for conditional HSA designation; and (2) the 12-month probationary limit during which a fully designated HSA may be conditionally designated. Authorizes HSA redesignation of any entity (presently a terminated HSA can not be redesignated). Eliminates the Secretary's authority to reduce HSA planning grants. Eliminates the requirement that a conditionally designated State health planning and development agency (\"agency\")) increase its functions in order to receive full designation. Eliminates: (1) the Secretary's authority to terminate an agency's conditional designation upon 90-day notice; and (2) the 12-month probationary limit during which a fully designated agency may be conditionally designated. Extends agency conditional designation authority until October 1, 1986. Repeals the fund loss penalty for States without a fully designated agency. Makes agency review of institutional health services discretionary. Increases the dollar amounts of capital expenditures, annual institutional operating costs, and major medical equipment for purposes of State certificate-of-need program review. Authorizes FY 1983 through FY 1985 appropriations for: (1) HSA planning grants; (2) State health planning and development agencies; and (3) health planning centers. Repeals title XV (National Health Planning and Development) of such Act effective October 1, 1986."
