Redesignates such projects as the \"Belle Fourche Unit\" of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin program. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to negotiate and execute an amendatory repayment contract with the Belle Fourche Irrigation District covering all lands of the existing Belle Fourche project. Limits the period for repayment of the construction and rehabilitation and betterment costs by irrigation water users to not more than 40 years. Permits costs incurred under the provisions of this Act to be covered by appropriations for the Water and Power Resources Service. Authorizes the Secretary to amend existing contracts and enter into additional contracts in order to implement and facilitate future agreements between the Belle Fourche Irrigation District and non-Federal entities involving the sale of project water by non-Federal interests for non-irrigation purposes. States conditions for such sales of project water. Authorizes appropriations."
