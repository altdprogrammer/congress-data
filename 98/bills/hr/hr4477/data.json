    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1984-08-08", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to establish a Carl D. Perkins Scholarship program and a national talented teachers fellowship program under title V (Teacher Corps and Teacher Training Programs) of HEA. Establishes the Carl D. Perkins Scholarship program to make grants to States for postsecondary education scholarships to a maximum of 10,000 individuals who are outstanding high school graduates to enable them to pursue teaching careers in elementary or secondary education. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1990 for such purpose. Provides for allocation of such funds among the States on the basis of population. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make such grants to States which submit applications which include specified procedures and agreements. Requires the scholarship recipient, within the ten-year period after completing the postsecondary education for which the scholarship was awarded, to teach: (1) in a public elementary or secondary school in any State; (2) in a public education program in any State; (3) in a private nonprofit school located and serving students in a district eligible for assistance pursuant to chapter 1 (Financial Assistance to Meet the Special Educational Needs of Disadvantaged Children) of the Educational Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981; or (4) on a full-time basis, handicapped children or children with limited English proficiency in a private nonprofit school. Requires that such teaching be for a period for two years for every year for which such scholarship assistance was received, but reduces such requirement by one-half in the case of individuals who teach: (1) in a school serving large numbers or high concentrations of economically disadvantaged students; or (2) children with limited English capacity or handicapped children. Requires scholarship recipients who do not comply with such teaching requirements to repay, all or part of the scholarship plus interest and reasonable collection fees, with specified exceptions. Requires the State education agency (SEA) to assure that efforts will be made to attract students to such scholarship program who: (1) are from low-income backgrounds; or (2) express a willingness or desire to teach in schools having less than average results or serving large numbers of economically disadvantaged students. Requires that the selection criteria and procedures to be used by the State reflect the present and projected teacher needs of the State. Requires the State, in developing such selection criteria and procedures, to solicit the views of State and local educational agencies, private educational institutions, and other interested parties. Sets forth required and authorized means of solicitation of such views. Provides that each Carl D. Perkins Scholar shall receive a $5,000 scholarship for each academic year of postsecondary education for study in preparation to become an elementary or secondary education teacher. Limits such individual scholarship assistance to four years of postsecondary education, as determined by the State agency. Requires that such scholarship funds be taken into consideration in determining eligibility for other student assistance under HEA. Limits the amount of an individual scholarship to an amount which when added to other student assistance under HEA does not exceed the cost of attendance. Requires that Carl D. Perkins Scholars be selected by: (1) a seven-member statewide panel appointed by the chief State elected official, acting in consultation with the SEA; or (2) by an existing panel designated by the chief State elected official and approved by the Secretary. Requires that such selections be made from students who have graduated or are graduating from high school and rank in the top ten percent of their graduating class. Requires the SEA to make applications available to high schools and in other convenient locations. Requires the statewide panel to develop criteria and procedures for selection. Permits such criteria to include grade point average, extracurricular activities, financial need, interest in teaching as expressed in an essay, and letters of recommendation. Sets forth scholarship conditions, including full-time enrollment and satisfactory progress in a course of study leading to teacher certification. Sets forth scholarship repayment provisions for recipients found by the SEA to be in noncompliance with agreements. Sets forth exceptions to such repayment provisions. Sets forth provisions relating to: (1) Federal administration of State programs under specified circumstances; and (2) judicial review of the Secretary's actions toward State programs. Establishes the national talented teachers fellowship program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990 such fellowships for outstanding teachers. Limits to two and one-half percent that portion of such funds which may be used for administration. Requires that such funds be used to award: (1) two national teacher fellowships to public school teachers teaching in each congressional district of each State, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; and (2) one such fellowship in Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Limits fellowship awards to the average national salary of public school teachers. Prohibits receipt of an award by any individual for two consecutive years. Requires talented teacher fellows to return to a teaching position in their current school district for at least two years following the award. Permits such fellows to use such awards for such projects improving public education as the Secretary may approve, including: (1) sabbaticals for study, research, travel, or academic improvement; (2) curriculum development; (3) consultation with or assistance to other school districts; (4) development of special innovative programs; (5) community relations; or (6) model teacher programs and staff development. Establishes a National Selection Board for Talented Teaching Fellows. Sets forth provisions for membership and procedures. Requires fellowship applicants to submit proposals for projects, and indicate the extent to which they wish to continue current teaching duties, to the local education agency (LEA) for comment prior to submission to the Committee. Directs the Committee, in evaluating proposals, to: (1) consult with the LEA; (2) request recommendations from two teaching peers, the principal, and the superintendent; and (3) consider other appropriate criteria. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations for such selections. Requires that announcement of such awards be: (1) made in a public ceremony; and (2) done in consultation with the Member of Congress and Senators representing the school district in which the fellows teach. Requires repayment of the fellowship award to the Federal Government in the case of fraud or gross noncompliance. Authorizes the Secretary to appoint, for up to three-year terms, up to five technical employees to administer title V (Teacher Corps and Teacher Training of HEA) who may be appointed and paid without regard to specified provisions of Federal law governing appointments to the competitive service and relating to classification and pay rates."
