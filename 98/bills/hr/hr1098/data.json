Authorizes a judicial officer to consider the safety of any person or the community when making a pretrial release determination. Establishes as a mandatory release condition that the person not commit a Federal, State, or local crime during release. Authorizes pretrial release upon execution of an unsecured appearance bond. Expands the discretionary release conditions to require that the defendant: (1) maintain employment or an educational program; (2) avoid contact with an alleged victim or potential witness; (3) report to a law enforcement or pretrial service agency; (4) comply with a curfew; (5) refrain from possessing a firearm or using alcohol or narcotic drugs; (6) undergo medical treatment; (7) forfeit designated property upon failure to appear; and (8) return to custody at specified hours. Authorizes a judicial officer to order the detention for up to ten days of a person who is presently on pretrial release for a felony under Federal, State, or local law or on probation or parole or release pending sentencing or appeal for any offense, if no conditions will assure his appearance and the safety of the community and any other person. Provides for the detention of an alien whose presence in the United States is not under color of law. Authorizes a judicial officer to order the pretrial detention of a person upon finding that: (1) no condition will reasonably assure such person's appearance and the safety of any other person and the community; and (2) there is a substantial probability that the person committed the offense. Requires that a detention hearing be held in any case involving: (1) a crime of violence; (2) any offense punishable by life imprisonment or death; (3) a narcotics offense punishable by at least ten years imprisonment; or (4) any offense committed after the person has been convicted of two or more offenses for which a hearing is mandated. Permits the government or the court to move for a detention hearing in any other case involving a serious risk of flight or obstruction of justice. Enumerates additional factors to be considered by the judicial officer in making a release determination, including the defendant's past conduct, history of drug or alcohol abuse, criminal history, and the nature and seriousness of the danger to the community or any person. Requires the detention of a person who has appealed his conviction unless the judicial officer finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) such person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to another person or property; and (2) the appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact. Requires the detention of a person awaiting sentencing unless the officer finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to any other person or the community. Authorizes a U.S. attorney to appeal a release order. Provides additional penalties for failing to appear before the court or surrender for service of sentence as required. Establishes mandatory additional penalties for commission of an offense while on pretrial release. Subjects a person who has been conditionally released and violates a condition of release to revocation of release and prosecution for contempt of court. Grants new authority to law enforcement officers to arrest a person who violates certain pretrial release conditions."
