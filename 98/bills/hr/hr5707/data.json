Defines \"eligible area,\" for purposes of such job project grants, as a local government that has an unemployment rate in excess of the average national rate for the most recent six-month period. Requires each eligible area that desires to receive such a grant to establish a 13-member local governing board, two of whom shall be appointed by the State Governor and the remainder of whom shall be appointed by the highest ranking local official and shall include representatives from labor organizations, the business community, and nonprofit organizations. Provides that such projects shall: (1) be determined by the local governing board, subject to the approval for the Secretary of Labor; and (2) provide employment to eligible individuals, i.e. any individual who has been unemployed for at least 30 days. Requires that employees in such job projects receive wages equal to the higher of the Federal minimum wage or any other applicable minimum wage. Limits to ten percent the number of individual employed as supervisors on such job project. Establishes a National Employment Corps in the Department of the Interior, to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior. Provides that amounts in the National Job Bank fund shall be available for the Corps. Provides that the Corps shall carry out projects, including: (1) recreational area development, maintenance, and improvement; (2) road and trail maintenance and improvement in national parks; (3) erosion and flood damage assistance and control; (4) drought and storm damage assistance and control; (5) urban renewal (in consultation wth the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development); (6) railroad bed and track improvement on Federal land; (7) recovery of biomass energy from Federal lands; (8) harbor and port improvement; (9) reclamation and improvement of strip-mined lands; (10) stream and lake cleaning and pollution control; (11) wildlife habitat preservation and improvement; (12) nursery maintenance and improvement; and (13) historical and cultural site preservation and improvement. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to recruit and select members of the Corps from among individuals who are unemployed and who are not less than 16 years of age nor more than 25 years of age, giving preference in selection to individuals residing in areas of high unemployment. Limits the period of an individual's Corps membership to no more than 24 months. Provides that Corps members shall receive the Federal minimum wage, in addition to quarters board, and other benefits. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish and administer residential centers to carry out the purposes of the Corps. Requires that any center located in an urban area be approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to provide necessary quarters, board, medical care, transportation, and other services, facilties, and equipment. Provides that Corps members not be deemed Federal employees, except for specified purposes including those of the Internal Revenue Code, title II of the Social Security Act, Federal workers' compensation, tort claims, and allowances for quarters. Establishes a National Job Training Office in the Department of Labor. Directs the Office to award grants, from amounts available in the National Job Bank Fund, to educational institutions, private business firms, and local governments for job training programs. Directs the Office to assist grant applicants in the recruitment of individuals for job training programs by maintaining a list, by region and by State, of individuals who are eligible for such programs. Provides that such list shall be compiled from lists maintained by each State and submitted to the Office. Requires each State employment service agency to maintain a list of each individual who meets specified criteria and submit such list at least once every three months to the Office. Provides that such job training program assistance may be given to any educational institution for a training program for youths who: (1) are over 15 and under 20 years of age; (2) have dropped out of high school or obtained a high school equivalency degree; and (3) have been unemployed for five weeks or more. Provides that such job training program assistance may also be given to any private business firm or local government for a training program for adults who: (1) are over 19 years of age; (2) have been unemployed for five weeks or more as a result of plant shutdowns, technology that has replaced workers, or consolidation or closing down of firms that experienced severe import competition in the markets they served; and (3) lack appropriate skills for a trade or occupation the demand for which is unfilled or is likely to expand within the region in which such training program will be located. Sets forth application requirements for such job training program assistance. Directs the Secretary of Labor, within six months after enactment of this Act, to develop reliable methods to obtain statistically accurate data on employment demand, by trade and occupation, which are sufficient to determine the occupations and skills the demand for which is currently expanding. Directs the Secretary, within such six-month period and every three months thereafter, to prepare and issue a report, using those methods, which lists specified in formation relating to regional demand for such expanding trades and occupations, the number of individuals qualified to work in such trades or occupations, the number of trained individuals needed to meet the projected demand during the next ten years, and the number of individuals who will be receiving such training during such period. Establishes the National Job Bank Fund in the Treasury. Requires that two percent of the amount appropriated to the Secretary of Defense for each fiscal year after September 30, 1984, be deposited in the Fund. Provides that any amount deposited in the Fund shall be apportioned equally as follows: (1) one-third to the Secretary of Labor for job project grants; (2) one-third to the Secretary of the Interior for the National Employment Corps; and (3) one-third to the Secretary of Labor for job training programs assistance. Directs the Secretaries of Labor and the Interior to report to the President and Congress at the end of such fiscal year on the amounts made available to each program through the Fund and how such amounts have been used in each program. Establishes the Conversion Planning Office in the Executive Office of the President. Directs the Conversion Planning Office to administer the National Job Bank Fund to carry out the purposes described in this Act. Directs the Conversion Planning Office to report to Congress and the President within one year after enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, on legislative and administrative actions needed to: (1) equalize and balance economic and employment opportunities in every region and locality, both rural and urban, across the Nation; (2) promote orderly economic adjustment to minimize dislocation of workers, communities, and industries resulting from current or future shifts in production from the defense to the civilian sector; (3) establish mechanisms to anticipate and ease dislocations of industries and industrial sectors; (4) plan for a shift in Federal resources from defense to civilian industrial and commerce activities, so that the economic adjustments necessary for workers, communities, and industries in the defense field are minimized and provided for; and (5) implement a national economy of full employment by means of governmental programs as well as private sector activities. Authorizes appropriations for such Conversion Planning Office activities."
