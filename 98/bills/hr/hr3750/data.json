    "as": "Reported to House amended, Part II", 
    "date": "1984-08-15", 
    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Science and Technology with amendment, H. Rept. 98-752 (Part II)) Computer Literacy Act of 1983 - Title I: Acquisition of Computer Hardware - Directs the Secretary of Education to allocate funds to local educational agencies (LEAs) for the acquisition of computer hardware for use in school classrooms. Directs the Secretary to allocate a specified amount to each State educational agency (SEA) for monitoring and enforcement. Sets forth requirements for LEA applications for such funds, to be approved by SEAs. Sets forth State responsibilities under this title. Sets forth provisions for participation of children from private schools. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 to carry out this title. Title II: Teacher Training Institutes - Directs the National Science Foundation (NSF) to arrange for short-term or regular session institutes for advanced study to improve the qualifications of individuals who are engaged in, or preparing to engage in: (1) teaching the operation and use of new technologies; or (2) supervising or training such teachers. Requires that such arrangements be made with the cooperation of those Federal agencies involved in similar activities, such as the Departments of Defense and Education. Directs the NSF to make grants or contracts for the development and operation of such institutes by nonprofit professional scientific or engineering organizations, science museums, regional science education centers, SEAs, LEAs, and institutions of higher education (including community colleges). Requires that special consideration for such grants and contracts be given to institutes training teachers, or supervisors or trainers of teachers, serving or preparing to serve in elementary and secondary schools enrolling substantial numbers of culturally, economically, socially, and educationally handicapped youth, or in programs for children of limited English language proficiency. Provides for stipends for individuals who attend such institutes. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1994 to carry out this title. Title III: Evaluations Dissemination, and Instructional Models - Directs the National Institute of Education (NIE) and the NSF to provide advice and technical assistance to SEAs and LEAs on the expenditure of funds under title I and on acquisition of suitable computer software by: (1) evaluating available computer hardware and software's classroom usefulness; and (2) disseminating the results of such evaluation. Requires that, where appropriate, such evaluation include an evaluation of: (1) the usefulness of hardware and software to serve the special needs of groups described under specified provisions of title II; and (2) the extent to which software promotes use by students of both sexes. Directs NIE and NSF to carry out such evaluation and dissemination under grants to or contracts with non-Federal agencies and private nonprofit institutions or organizations. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose for FY 1985 through 1994. Directs the NSF to conduct, assist, and foster research and experimentation on, and dissemination of, models of instruction in the operation and use of computers, educational computer software, and curriculum materials. Directs the NSF to do so through grants to or contracts with professional educational, scientific, or engineering organizations, science museums, regional science education centers, public television, SEAs, LEAs, and institutions of higher education (including community colleges.) Directs the NSF, in selecting such entities for such grants or contracts, to give priority to proposals: (1) prepared with active and broad community involvement; (2) for establishing model training programs for adults; (3) taking advantage of state-of-the-art development in computer and software design; (4) for identifying and developing model computer educational software and curriculum materials for instruction in computer use, and making such software and materials available to computer software producers, distributors, teachers, and school administrators, to the extent that such activities supplement specified technical assistance activities funded under this Act; (5) for developing teacher training materials which provide instruction about computers, computer programming, and educational software development, assistance in making financial and personnel resource allocation determinations for education involving computers, and special preparation to serve all segments of the population, including minorities, handicapped, limited English proficient, economically disadvantaged individuals, and women; (6) for demonstration programs, including model programs using as many as one computer for every four students in a classroom, laboratories using computers to simulate live experiments, libraries permitting students to borrow personal computers for use outside the classroom, and laboratories to exhibit examples of personal computer systems and educational software materials; (7) for monitoring developments in computer technology, including microcomputers, video disc systems, and intercommunication among users of personal computers, and for disseminating information on such developments and their application in education; (8) for establishing a mechanism for exchange of information between the educational system and the computer industry; (9) for undertaking studies requested by Congress or Federal agencies relating to the educational uses of computer technology, and for assisting in identifying areas in which Federal funding might accelerate the educational impact of emerging computer technologies; (10) for assisting interested local libraries in establishing programs to provide personal computers and video disc systems to the public; or (11) for using existing Federal computer communications and education networks (such as NIE regional laboratories). Directs the NSF to also give priority in such selection to proposals which would: (1) identify and develop model computer educational software and curriculum materials designed to increase access, participation, and achievement of historically underserved students, including minorities, women, handicapped, limited English proficient, and economically disadvantaged individuals in the use of computers; and (2) make such software and materials available to computer software producers and distributors, teachers, and school administrators. Permits funds available under such grants or contracts for computer instruction models to be used for the acquisition of computer hardware and software. Requires the Director of NSF to: (1) report to Congress annually on the results of such research and experimentation; and (2) in conjunction with NIE, disseminate information on such results to LEAs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1994 for such research, experimentation, and dissemination of computer instruction models."
