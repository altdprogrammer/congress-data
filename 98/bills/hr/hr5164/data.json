Limits such exemption to: (1) files of the Directorate of Operations which document foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, security liaison arrangements, or information exchanges with foreign governments; (2) files of the Directorate of Science and Technology which document the means by which foreign intelligence or counterintelligence is collected through scientific and technical systems; or (3) files of the Office of Security which document investigations of potential intelligence or counterintelligence sources. Establishes certain exceptions which allow for disclosure. Provides a procedure for judicial review by the district court of an alleged improper withholding of records pursuant to the statutory exemption. Requires the Director of Central Intelligence not less than once every ten years to review the exemptions provided for in this Act and determine whether the operational files so exempted shall remain exempt. Amends the Privacy Act of 1974 to prohibit any agency from relying on any exemption in the Privacy Act to withhold from an individual any record which is accessible to the individual under the Freedom of Information Act. Requires the Director of Central Intelligence to report to the intelligence committees of the Congress on the feasibility of conducting systematic review for declassification and release of Central Intelligence Agency information of historical value and to prepare and submit unclassified reports on Freedom of Information processing of requests."
