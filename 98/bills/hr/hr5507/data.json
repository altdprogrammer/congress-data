Declares that existing regulations of the Civil Aeronautics Board shall, after January 1, 1985, be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission as if they were regulations promulgated by the Commission. Declares that each such regulation to be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission during the period ending December 31, 1985, shall continue in effect without change unless set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction. Grants the Federal Trade Commission, after the expiration of such period, the same authority to amend or repeal any such regulation and to issue new regulations as the Civil Aeronautics Board was authorized to exercise as of January 1, 1984."
