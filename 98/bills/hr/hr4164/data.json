Directs the Secretary, from the remainder of such funds and subject to specified provisions, to allot to each State for each fiscal year an amount based on formulas using State allotment ratios and relative State populations of certain age groups. Allots the following percentages of such funds on the basis of population aged: (1) 15 through 19, 50 percent; (2) 20 through 24, 20 percent; and (3) 25 through 65, 15 percent. Allots the remaining 15 percent on the basis of the relative sums of such age group allotments. Sets forth a minimum State allotment amount, with specified exceptions, and minimum allotments for specified territories and possessions of the United States. Provides for reallotment among other States of any amount which the Secretary determines will not be required for carrying out a State's program for any fiscal year. Sets forth a formula for determining State allotment minimum limits on such ratios and sets ratios for specified territories and possessions of the United States. Sets forth provisions for within-State allocation of the State allotment. Directs each State to allocate from its allotment in each fiscal year under title II basic grants for vocational education: (1) 57 percent for activities described in part A of title II (vocational education opportunities); and (2) 43 percent for activities described in part B of title II (vocational education program improvement, innovation, and expansion). Directs each State, from the portion of its allotment available for statewide activities under specified provisions of title I relating to State plans, to allocate up to seven percent of the allotment of the State for administrative expenses (with provision for certain excess costs of compliance with requirements relating to programs for the handicapped and for the disadvantaged, distribution of assistance, and participation of specified types of individuals with special needs).

Subjects such contracts to specified terms and conditions under the Indian Self-Determination Act and other specified Federal laws. Authorizes the Secretary, from any remaining funds from such reserved funds, to enter into an agreement with the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs for the operation of vocational education programs authorized by this Act in institutions serving Indians eligible to receive educational benefits from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to receive such funds for such purposes. Directs the BIA to expend a matching amount to pay a part of the costs of such programs. Requires the BIA to expend during each fiscal year no less than the amount expended during the prior fiscal year on vocational education programs, services, and activities. Directs the Secretary and the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs to prepare a joint plan for the expenditure of funds and the evaluation of such programs. Directs the Secretary to assume responsibility for the administration of the program, with the assistance and consultation of the BIA. Provides that such programs shall be in addition to such other programs, services, and activities as are made available to eligible Indians under basic State grants and other provisions of this Act. Makes provisions of this Act applicable to the BIA as if it were a State board. Directs the Secretary, upon the request of any eligible recipient or any nonprofit private organization which is engaged in furnishing educational services or activities to Hawaiian natives, to contract with such recipient or organization to plan, conduct, and administer vocational education programs for the benefit of Hawaiian natives with specified funds reserved for such purpose. Part B: State Organizational and Planning Responsibilities - Requires any State desiring to participate in the program under this Act to establish or designate a State board of vocational education to be the sole State agency responsible for the administration or supervision of the State vocational education program. Includes among State board responsibilities: (1) coordination of State plan development, submission, and implementation, and the evaluation of the program, services, and activities assisted under this Act; (2) State plan development, in consultation with the State council on vocational education, and submission of such State plan to the Secretary; (3) consultation with the State council on vocational education and other appropriate State agencies, councils, and individuals involved in planning, administration, evaluation, and coordination of programs funded under this Act; (4) meeting at least four times annually; and (5) adoption of such procedures as the State board considers necessary to implement State level coordination with the State job training coordination council to encourage cooperation in the conduct of their respective programs. Allows the State board to delegate any of its responsibilities, other than those listed, to other State agencies. Requires States to assign at least one individual to work full time to assist the State board to fulfill the purposes of this Act with respect to sex equity in vocational education programs. Requires each State to expend a specified minimum amount for such purposes. Requires the State board to make available to each private industry council established under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) within the State a listing of all programs assisted under this Act. Requires each State board, in consultation with the State council, to establish a limited number of technical committees to advise the council and the board on the development of model curricula to address State labor market needs. Requires such committees to develop an inventory of the type and level of knowledge and skills needed for entry, retention, and advancement in occupational areas taught in the State. Requires that the membership of such committees be representatives of: (1) employers from any relevant industry or occupation for which the committee is established; (2) trade or professional organizations representing any relevant occupations; and (3) organized labor, where appropriate. Requires States desiring to participate in programs under this Act to establish a State council on vocational education. Sets forth requirements relating to council membership. Requires that a majority (seven) be representative of the private sector as follows: (1) five representing business, industry, and agriculture, including one representative of small business concerns and one who is a private sector member of the State job training coordinating council; and (2) two representatives of labor organizations. Requires that the other six council members be representative of secondary and postsecondary vocational institutions, career guidance and counseling organizations, individuals who have special knowledge and qualifications with respect to the special educational and career development needs of special populations (including women, the disadvantaged, the handicapped, those with limited English proficiency, and minorities), and of whom one member is representative of special education. Includes among State council duties biennial evaluation of the vocational education program delivery systems assisted under this Act and under JTPA. Sets forth requirements relating to allotment of grants to State councils on vocational education. Sets forth requirements for State plans under this Act. Requires that State plans be submitted to the Secretary and cover a three-year period in the case of the initial plan and a two-year period thereafter, with such annual provisions as the State board determines to be necessary. Requires that such planning periods be coterminous with those under JTPA. Sets forth requirements relating to State plan development. Includes among required provisions of State plans: (1) compliance with criteria for programs for the handicapped and for the disadvantaged; (2) relevant training for men and women desiring to enter occupations not traditionally associated with their sex; (3) program evaluation using measurements such as labor market needs; and (4) assessment and addressing of the vocational education needs of those identifiable segments of the State population that have the highest unemployment rates. Requires State plans to provide specified assurances relating to the use of funds: (1) for the disadvantaged and handicapped; (2) for single parents and homemakers (with special emphasis on those with the greatest financial need and on displaced homemakers); and (3) for economically depressed or high unemployment areas. Sets forth procedures and other requirements for State plan approval. Directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance and guidance to assist States to fulfill specified requirements for State plans. Sets forth requirements for local plans by eligible recipients to be submitted to the State board. Provides for exemptions from such requirements under specified circumstances. Title II: Basic State Grants for Vocational Education - Part A: Vocational Education Opportunities - Requires each State, from the portion of its allotment available for this part, to provide vocational education services and activities to meet the special needs, and enhance the participation, of: (1) handicapped individuals; (2) disadvantaged individuals; (3) adults who need training or retraining; (4) single working parents or homemakers; (5) participants in programs to eliminate sex bias and stereotyping in vocational education; and (6) criminal offenders who are serving in a correctional institution. Limits the use of funds under this part for handicapped individuals to supplemental or additional staff, equipment, materials, and services not provided to other individuals in vocational education that are essential for handicapped individuals to participate in vocational education, but allows each State to use such funds for separate vocational programs for handicapped individuals if the handicapping conditions of the students require a separate program.
