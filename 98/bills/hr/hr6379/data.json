    "text": "Graduate Assistance Program Act of 1984 - Amends title IV the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to establish under HEA title IV (Student Assistance) a new program of graduate study grants for first- and second-year graduate and professional students who demonstrate financial need. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1991 to enable the Secretary of Education to make payments to institutions of higher education which have made agreements for purposes of such grants program. Provides that such funds shall be available on an academic year basis in accordance with specified provisions of the General Education Provisions Act. Sets such grants at the amount needed by the student to pursue a course of graduate or professional study at the institution, but limits such amount to between $1,000 and $5,000. Prohibits regulations for such grants program from including any parental contributions as part of an expected family contribution to the cost of attendance. Provides that such grants may be made only to first- and second-year enrollees in graduate or professional programs who will be carrying the normal full-time academic workload and who meet specified eligibility requirements for student assistance. Provides that the institution, in accordance with the program agreement and from the amount allocated to the institution, shall select from among the eligible those who are to be awarded such grants and determine the amounts to be paid to them. Requires that at least 20 percent of the amount paid to each recipient shall be made available by the institution from non-Federal sources. Directs the Secretary to allocate program funds among institutions on the basis of the relative need for assistance of the their eligible students. Directs the Secretary to set deadlines for applications by institutions for allocation of such funds for any fiscal year. Authorizes institutions to use their allocations for grants to eligible students in such manner as the institution determines will best achieve the purposes of this Act. Redesignates provisions for fellowships for graduate and profesional study and provisions for the national graduate fellows program under HEA title IX (Graduate Programs) as provisions under HEA title IV (Student Assistance). Repeals provisons setting forth specified groups of individuals to whom grants are to be made under provisions for fellowships for graduate and professional study. Extends through FY 1989 the authorization of appropriations for fellowships for graduate and professional study. Extends through FY 1989 the period during which the Secretary is authorized to award fellowships (in the arts, humanities, and social sciences) under the national graduate fellows program."
