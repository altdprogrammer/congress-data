    "date": "1984-04-02", 
    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Redefines such offense as using a firearm to commit a felony over which the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction or carrying a firearm during such a felony involving violence. Deletes the requirement that the firearm be carried \"unlawfully.\" Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to not less than ten years imprisonment for a first offense (currently, one to ten years) and 20 years for a second or subsequent offense (currently, two to 25 years). Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose concurrent sentences. Makes a first offender ineligible for parole for eight years and a second or subsequent offender ineligible for 15 years. Expresses the sense of Congress that the executive prosecute vigorously such offenses."
