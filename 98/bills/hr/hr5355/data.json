    "text": "Requires each head of an executive agency to provide for the timely deposit of money by such agency and for the collection and timely deposit of sums owed to such agency. Permits the Secretary of the Treasury to collect from any agency not complying with such requirements an amount determined to be the cost to the general fund caused by such noncompliance. Establishes in the Treasury the Cash Management Improvements Fund into which payments of charges imposed for noncompliance with this Act shall be deposited. Makes such funds available for the payment of expenses incurred in developing the methods of collection and deposit and in carrying out collections and deposits using such methods. Requires a person having custody or possession of public money, including a disbursing official, to deposit such money not later than the third day after the custodian receives the money (previously 30 days). Authorizes the Secretary to vary such time period by regulation. Makes such limitation effective January 1, 1985."
