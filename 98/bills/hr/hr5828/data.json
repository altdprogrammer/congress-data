    "text": "National Congressional Industrial Policy Advisory Act of 1984 - Establishes the National Commission on Industrial Policy. Directs the Commission to: (1) develop a comprehensive national policy for industrial recovery and growth; (2) identify industries essential to the economic well-being of the United States; (3) identify the major problems facing such industries; (4) attempt to reach an accord between labor, management and the Government on solutions to such problems; and (5) develop a strategy for anticipating and averting future economic threats to the nation's industrial base. Requires the Commission to: (1) receive requests from standing congressional committees to study specific industrial problems; and (2) respond by issuing policy recommendations within six months, unless the Commission determines that a request does not require immediate attention. Authorizes the President to veto such determination. Grants the Commission subpoena power. Requires the Commission: (1) within two years after enactment of this Act, to transmit to the President and Congress a final report setting forth the major industrial policy priorities of the United States, specifying the steps needed to attain such goals, and containing the Commission's findings and recommendations for legislative or administrative action; (2) to consult with the congressional committees to which the report is referred before such committees report to their respective Houses; and (3) publish such report seven days after transmitting it to Congress. Terminates the Commission two years after enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
