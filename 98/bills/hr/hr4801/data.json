  "summary": {
    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-02-08", 
    "text": "Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the Secretary of Labor to certify certain groups of workers as eligible for trade adjustment assistance upon a determination that: (1) increased imports \"contributed importantly to\" (currently, substantially caused) worker separations and sales or production reductions; or (2) a significant number of workers of a firm have been or are in danger of total or partial separation due to the relocation of such firm to a foreign country or instrumentality. Changes the qualifying requirements for adjustment assistance for workers: (1) by requiring that weeks during which the worker is laid off shall be counted as qualifying weeks of employment if the worker later received back pay for the weeks of layoff; and (2) by limiting the number of weeks of employer-authorized leave and/or weeks of service as a full-time labor representative which can be counted as qualifying weeks of employment. Authorizes, in order to assist adversely affected workers to complete training, that payments be made as trade readjustment allowances for up to 26 additional weeks in the 26-week period that: (1) follows the last week of entitlement to allowances otherwise payable under the provisions for adjustment assistance; or (2) begins with the first week of training for adversely affected workers if such training is approved after the last week of entitlement. Directs the Secretary of Labor to approve job training assistance for workers adversely affected by imports. (Currently the Secretary is authorized to approve such training.) Requires that the costs of such training be paid from the next appropriation of funds if the funds have not been appropriated at the time the training is entered. Directs the Secretary to pay a daily supplemental assistance benefit to any worker who begins approved job training after enactment of this Act and who is not eligible for trade adjustment allowances. Authorizes a worker eligible for job training to elect to obtain training under a voucher system. Authorizes the worker to apply to the Secretary for a voucher to cover the costs of training, including on the job training, which the worker considers appropriate. Directs the Secretary to issue a voucher to pay the provider of the training if the Secretary approves the training and finds that: (1) suitable employment for the worker is not available; (2) the worker is not already qualified for the job for which training is sought; and (3) there is reasonable expectation of employment after completion of the training. Lists specified conditions which the worker and the provider of the training must meet in order for the vouchers to be paid. Increases the maximum job search and relocation allowances to $800. Establishes the Special Account for Adjustment Assistance in the Treasury. Makes appropriation for the Special Account for FY 1984 and 1985. Provides that amounts in the Special Account shall be available only for making expenditures to carry out adjustment assistance for workers and for firms. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to the Congress on the operation and status of the Special Account. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance for the establishment of industrywide programs for new development to associations, unions, or other nonprofit industry organizations in which a substantial number of firms or workers have been certified as eligible to apply for adjustment assistance. Authorizes expenditures of up to $10,000,000 annually per industry. Requires that all repayments of loans, payments of interest, and other receipts from loans made by the Secretary as adjustment assistance for firms be paid into a separate account to be administered by the International Trade Administration in the Department of Commerce. Requires that the Funds in the account be used for adjustment assistance for firms. Extends adjustment assistance for workers and firms until September 30, 1985. Sets forth the effective dates for the provisions of this Act."
