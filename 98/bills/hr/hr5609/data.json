    "as": "Reported to House amended",

    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Education and Labor with amendment, H. Rept. 98-754) American Defense Education Act - Authorizes a national program to provide incentives to local educational agencies to improve: (1) instruction in mathematics, science, communication skills, foreign languages, and technology; and (2) guidance and counseling. Title I: Elementary and Secondary Education Programs - Requires local education agencies which desire to participate in such national program to develop and carry out a program of improvement of instruction and student achievement. Sets forth requirements for such programs. Entitles participating local educational agencies (LEAs) to receive basic payments for each fiscal year equal to: (1) two and one-quarter percent of an established payment rate multiplied by the number of children, aged five through 17, in the school district of the LEA who are eligible to be counted under LEA basic grant provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965; and (2) two percent of the established payment rate multiplied by the number of such children who are not eligible to be so counted. Entitles agencies which show substantial evidence of meeting program goals to an incentive payment equal to an additional two percent of the established payment rate multiplied by the average daily attendance. Sets forth a formula for determining such payment rate on the basis of average per pupil expenditure in the State, with a minimum payment rate no less than the average per pupil expenditure in the United States. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for such basic payments to LEAs. Sets forth requirements for applications for payments. Directs the Secretary of Education (\"the Secretary\") to approve applications which meet such requirements, including compliance with fiscal control and fund accounting procedures. Sets forth provisions for participation in such program by children enrolled in private schools. Title II: Teacher Training and Postsecondary Programs - Authorizes the Secretary to establish a program of grants to institutions of higher education for coordination between such institutions and local education agencies in improving science and mathematics education, through precollege teacher training, development, and recruitment programs. Sets forth requirements for grant proposals and priorities in grant selection. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for such grants, but provides that no funds are authorized to be appropriated for such purpose for any fiscal year for which funds are appropriated to carry out the Emergency Mathematics and Science Education and Jobs Act (including any amendment made by such Act). Title III: General Provisions - Directs the Secretary to administer the program and to pay each local educational agency with an approved application the amount to which it is entitled for each fiscal year. Provides for a joint survey and report to Congress by the Secretaries of Defense and Education, for each year from 1983 through 1987, on the academic achievement levels of U.S. 18-year-olds and the personnel training and educational needs of the armed forces. Sets limitations on the authorization of appropriations. Provides that no funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act for any fiscal year if the amount appropriated to carry out any of the following chapters or Acts for such fiscal year does not equal or exceed the amount appropriated to carry out such chapter or Act for the preceding fiscal year: (1) chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA); (2) chapter 2 of ECIA; (3) the Education of the Handicapped Act; (4) the Vocational Education Act of 1963; (5) the Bilingual Education Act; or (6) the Emergency Immigrant Education Act of 1984."
