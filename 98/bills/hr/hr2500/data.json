    "text": "Amends the declaration of policy and the congressional findings of the Export Administration Act of 1979. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to require export licenses for multiple exports. Requires the Secretary to establish and maintain a control list indicating license requirements for exports to countries subject to export controls. Prohibits the President from imposing export controls on goods or services which are available in sufficient quantities from foreign sources so as to render such controls ineffective. Authorizes the President to prohibit or control the transfer of goods or technologies within the United States to embassies and affiliates of countries subject to national security export controls. Requires the Secretary to identify on the control list which goods and data are subject to which types of export controls. Emphasizes keystone materials in developing a list of militarily critical technologies. Terminates the use of qualified general export licenses for national security controls. Requires reductions in the export controls over products of militarily critical technology and keystone equipment after adequate controls are established for such technology and equipment. Requires the Secretary to determine whether goods or technology are available from sources outside the United States in sufficient quantity and of comparable quality so as to render export controls ineffective. (Current law refers to goods or technology in sufficient quantity and of sufficient quality.) Directs the President to actively pursue negotiations over the foreign availability of such goods or technology. Authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations for periodically removing controls which are based on the anticipated needs of the military of countries to which exports are controlled for national security purposes. Modifies the objectives of the United States in negotiations with the governments of the Coordinating Committee for multilateral export controls. Requires that the Secretary of State be responsible for conducting negotiations with other countries including those countries not participating in the Coordinating Committee. Prohibits export controls on donations of articles intended for the relief of human suffering unless such donations are coerced. Prohibits the President from prohibiting or curtailing exports for foreign policy purposes if such goods or technology are to be exported subject to a sales contract which was entered into before such controls were imposed and which requires delivery within a specified period, unless the President determines that permitting such exports would prove detrimental to overriding national interests. Deletes the short supply controls relating to refined petroleum products, domestically produced crude oil, horses, red cedar, recyclable metals, and articles, which are subject to barter agreements. Grants the Commerce Department 14 rather than ten days to complete the initial screening of an export license application. Requires the processing of an application to be completed in 60 rather than 90 days if the application does not require interagency review. Requires the Secretary to inform applicants who are denied licenses what modifications, if any, would make the export license permissible. Imposes penalties for conspiracies to violate the Export Administration Act of 1979 and for attempts to violate the Act. Prohibits possession of goods or technology with intent to export them contrary to the Act. States that whoever violates any national security controls may be subject to controls on importing goods or technology into the United States or its possessions. Provides for the forfeiture of property interests and any proceeds obtained as a result of violations of national security controls. States that no person convicted of espionage shall be eligible, at the Secretary's discretion, to apply for or use any export license for up to ten years from the date of conviction. Makes technical amendments to the enforcement and the annual reporting provisions of the Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1987. Provides that the authority granted by such Act shall terminate on September 30, 1987."
