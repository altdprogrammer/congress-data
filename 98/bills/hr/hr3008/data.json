Stipulates that such prices shall not be less than 1983 levels. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to authorize the overseas donation of Commodity Credit Corporation agricultural stocks (currently limited to dairy stock donations). States that such donations shall be administered through title II of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (P.L. 480), and shall be in addition to existing assistance under such Act."
