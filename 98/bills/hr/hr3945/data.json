    "text": "Public Assistance Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 1983 - Establishes as a condition of eligibility for Federal payments under public assistance programs the requirements that each State: (1) match its public assistance rolls against all relevant Federal, State, and local wage and benefit records at least once each calendar quarter to verify the income and status of program participants in determining their eligibility for assistance; (2) remove ineligible individuals and otherwise eliminate fraud and abuse under such programs; (3) require each official or agency with jurisdiction over relevant records to provide such records upon request for matching purposes; and (4) establish an advisory committee to assist State agencies and officials in determining the feasibility and cost effectiveness of matching activities and in implementing and monitoring such activities. Directs each State to compile reports on such matching process for each or several programs and to make such reports available to the agencies with program jurisdiction. Directs Federal agencies and officials to provide relevant records to States upon request. Requires matching activities to be conducted in accordance with guidelines to be prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and designed to protect the privacy of the individuals involved. Restricts the availability and disclosure of information provided for or derived from, matching activities. Requires that all applicants for, and current recipients of, assistance under a federally-assisted public assistance program be notified of the matching procedures required under this Act, including a specific reference to the matching of both names and social security numbers to relevant wage and benefit records to discover and eliminate fraud and abuse. Requires that any assistance recipient be notified and provided at least 20 days to rebut information obtained which indicates that his or her assistance should be terminated or reduced. Incorporates the provisions of this Act into any State or Federal law concerned with the administration of a federally-assisted public assistance program. Authorizes the Secretary to waive the matching requirements of this Act with respect to certain States, certain records, or certain time periods upon determining that applying such requirements would not be feasible or cost effective. Directs the Secretary to establish an advisory committee to assist in the monitoring and implementation of matching activities at the Federal level. Allows States to enter arrangements to check their public assistance rolls against the records of other States."
