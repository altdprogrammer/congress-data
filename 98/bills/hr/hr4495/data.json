    "text": "Sports Violence Arbitration Act of 1983 - Requires each professional sports league to establish an arbitration system for the arbitration of grievances resulting from the use of excessively violent conduct. Requires each system to establish an arbitration board. Authorizes any player or professional sports club sustaining injury as the result of excessively violent conduct, or any player or professional sports team which is the object of excessively violent conduct, to bring a grievance before the arbitration board against the player (and the player's employer) allegedly involved in such conduct. Authorizes any league game official to bring a grievance before the arbitration board against any player (and the player's employer) who allegedly engaged in excessively violent conduct. Requires the arbitration board to: (1) conduct an investigation and hold proceedings in accordance with the rules of the Federal Mediation Conciliation Service upon the bringing of any grievance; and (2) issue a decision and order upon the completion of the proceedings. Permits appeals of an order of an arbitration board to the appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals. Permits the filing of a civil suit, in addition to the remedies provided by this Act. Directs the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to establish policies, rules, and procedures applicable to arbitration proceedings under this Act. Directs the Secretary of Labor to bring an action in a U.S. district court to enforce the requirements of this Act."
