Revises provisions for citizens civil actions under TSCA to establish a Federal cause of action for toxic substances damages. Permits any person to bring an action in an appropriate U.S. district court against manufacturers or processors of a chemical substance or mixture to recover specified compensable damages. Provides that U.S. district court jurisdiction over such actions shall be concurrent with State court jurisdiction.
