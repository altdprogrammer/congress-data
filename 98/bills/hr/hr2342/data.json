Allows the Board to promulgate up to 25 percent of its rules and regulations without first submitting them to the Secretary of the Interior for approval. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) effect such a transfer of functions; and (2) to determine a schedule by which to phase out occupation of the Institute's campus by any entity other than the Institute. Directs the Board to submit an annual report to the Secretary of the Interior and the Congress concerning the activities, accreditation status and enrollment of the Institute."
