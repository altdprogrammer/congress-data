Requires the Secretary to determine that: (1) such a conveyance outweighs all public interest in the Federal retention of such lands; and (2) no other law affords an appropriate relief. Authorizes the Secretary to sell public land directly to specified purported title holders. Prescribes guidelines to determine the selling price of such lands. Authorizes the Secretary to convey such lands to a trustee if an individual tract of land does not conform to a certain system of survey. Reserves to the United States all mineral deposits in the land, and the right to mine and remove such minerals."
