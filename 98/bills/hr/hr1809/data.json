Revises the fraud provisions of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 and titles XVI (Supplementary Security Income) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to establish as the minimum penalty the value of the benefit unlawfully received and as the maximum penalty the greater of such value or the fines currently provided. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to condition the approval of State unemployment compensation laws on a requirement that a State prohibit knowing and willful misrepresentation with respect to such compensation and establish as a minimum penalty the value of the compensation unlawfully secured."
