    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Extends until September 30, 1987, the authority of the President or an Inspector General or other designated official of a Federal agency to pay cash awards to employees whose disclosures of fraud, waste, or mismanagement result in cost savings to the Government. Requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress before March 16, 1987, on the effectiveness of such awards program since January 1, 1984, and on the continuation and, if appropriate, modification of the program. Repeals provision providing for the periodic review of agency cash awards by the Comptroller General. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, to make cash awards to members of the armed forces for disclosures contributing to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of operations or programs of the armed forces. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct and report to Congress concerning a cost-benefit analysis of options for a Government program of providing dependent care benefits to Federal employees. Authorizes the Special Counsel of the Merit Systems Protection Board to obtain judicial review of a final order or decision rendered by the Board on corrective actions concerning a prohibited personnel practices or on disciplinary actions toward employees. Reestablishes the authority of the Office of Personnel Management to authorize exceptions to the dual-pay restrictions for retired members of the uniformed services employed in civilian medical officer positions when necessary to meet special employment needs. Renames the New York International and Bulk Mail Center in New Jersey City, New Jersey, as the New Jersey International and Bulk Mail Center. Requires the United States Postal Service to erect a sign designating the street leading to the employee parking lot of such center as Michael McDermott Place."
