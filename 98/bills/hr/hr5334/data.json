    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Small Business Development Center Improvement Act of 1984 - Amends the Small Business Act to require the term for grants under the Small Business Development Center program be based upon a calendar year or coincide with the Federal fiscal year. Provides that, with respect to the requirement that indirect costs or in-kind contributions paid for by a Federal program shall not be included in any matching non-Federal additional amount, salaries paid by a grant applicant shall not be treated as other than in-kind contributions unless paid to full-time employees or to other than full-time employees if such amount does not exceed the aggregate amount paid to full-time employees. Provides for the continuation of financial assistance to establish small business development centers under the Small Business Development Center program. Repeals the requirement that an applicant to assist small businesses obtain approval of an area plan by the Small Business Administration (SBA) when applying for assistance under the program. Provides that such applicants must consult with the SBA when providing assistance to small businesses. Requires that each small business development intake center and intake subcenter: (1) have a full-time staff; and (2) to the extent practicable be located in an easily accessible facility in order to provide maximum benefits to small businesses. Requires the SBA to develop a program for a biannual onsite evaluation measuring the effectiveness of each small business development center (Currently such evaluations are conducted annually.) Requires the SBA's program proposal to be submitted to the Committee on Small Business of both Houses by January 31, 1985. Provides that, in lieu of the current contract, the SBA may study the development of an in-house computer system to provide a management information system for the Small Business Development Center program. Requires that any such change shall not occur prior to October 1, 1986, nor until such time as the SBA evaluates the cost effectiveness and need of such change and reports to the appropriate congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations for: (1) the Small Business Development Center program, but not to exceed specified annual levels; (2) expenses of the National Small Business Development Center Advisory Board; (3) the data base for the Small Business Development Center program; and (4) cost reimbursement to small business development centers for participation in program evaluations. Extends the Small Business Development Center program through October 1, 1988. Provides effective dates for this Act."
