    "text": "Science and Mathematics Teacher Development Act of 1983 - Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act for FY 1984 through 1987. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to reserve up to one percent of such funds for grants to insular areas, apportioned according to need. Directs the Secretary, from the remainder of such funds, to make allotments to States based on relative numbers of residents aged 14 through 17. Sets forth provisions for reallotments, from States which do not submit proposed use reports or do not need their full allotment, to States with a current need for additional funds. Directs the Secretary to allot to each Indian tribe which submits a proposed use report that meets specified requirements an amount based on the number of members of the tribe aged 14 through 17, and to subtract such Indian allotment from the State allotment of the State or States in which such tribal members reside. Requires States desiring to receive grants under this Act to submit to the Secretary an annual proposed use report for such funds. Sets forth requirements for such reports including publication to facilitate comment from interested agencies, groups, and individuals prior to submission. Provides that only specified provisions of the General Education Provisions Act shall apply to programs and activities under this Act. Sets forth audit provisions. Requires each State to use its grant, either directly or through local educational agencies, to increase the number of teachers who are qualified to teach science or mathematics at the secondary level in public or private schools by awarding scholarships for necessary instruction at institutions of higher education. Authorizes a State to use such funds to pay a portion of the total amount of the scholarship (including tuition and stipend) to enable the recipient to acquire the necessary qualifications to teach science or mathematics at the secondary level. Limits such portion of scholarship aid to a recipient to one period of twelve consecutive months or $5,000 toward the total amount of the scholarship. Authorizes a State to select as a scholarship recipient only a person who: (1) has at least a bachelor's degree; and (2) lacks the qualifications to teach science or mathematics at the secondary level in public or private schools in that State, but can become qualified within one year. Requires that selection as a scholarship recipient be conditioned upon the recipient's agreement to teach science or mathematics at the secondary level for a reasonable period in a public or private school determined by the State or the local educational agency to have a need for such a teacher. Permits waiver or modification of such agreements under prescribed circumstances. Authorizes a State to require a local educational agency or private school at which a scholarship recipient will teach to contribute a portion of the total amount of the scholarship. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to require a scholarship recipient to become certified under State law. Requires each State to provide to secondary level students attending private schools opportunities to benefit from its program under this Act that are equitable compared to the opportunities offered to secondary level students attending public schools, taking into account the relative numbers and needs of those student populations. Prohibits use of funds under this Act for any religious worship, instruction, or proselytization, or any activity of a school or department of divinity."
