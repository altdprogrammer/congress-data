Authorizes additional appropriations for: (1) the Office of Productivity, Technology, and Innovation; (2) the National Technical Information Service to make Japanese science and technology literature available in the United States; and (3) necessary salary adjustments. Permits the transfer of funds among line items within ten percent of the amount authorized.
