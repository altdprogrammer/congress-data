I)) County Revenue Enhancement Act of 1984 - Amends specified Federal laws to provide that the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay an additional 25 percent of revenues received from each national forest to the State in which it is located. Authorizes the appropriate State legislature to expend such funds for any public purpose, including the public schools and roads of the counties in which such national forest is located. Repeals a requirement of Federal law that ten percent of all moneys received from the national forests shall be made available for road and trail maintenance within the national forests in States in which such proceeds were derived. Amends Federal law to replace the use of the calendar year with the use of a fiscal year. Increases from 25 percent to 50 percent the payments which the Secretary of Agriculture must make to counties out of net revenues received from the use of the land."
