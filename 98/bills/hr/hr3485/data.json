    "text": "Community Renewal Employment Act - Title I: General Purpose and Authority - Declares the purpose of this Act to be the provision of employment opportunities to long-term unemployed individuals in high unemployment areas through payments for labor and related costs associated with the repair, maintenance, or rehabilitation of essential community and educational facilities and for public safety, health, social service, and other activities related to the public welfare. Authorizes appropriations to provide opportunities for unemployed individuals under this Act. Authorizes such appropriations in a specified amount for FY 1983. Limits the authorization of such appropriations in each succeeding fiscal year to an amount equal to the product of $10,000 multiplied by 20 percent of the number of \"long-term unemployed individuals\" (i.e. the average number of individuals in the civilian labor force who, in the first three months of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is to be made, had been unemployed for 15 or more weeks as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on a seasonally adjusted basis). Provides that, for any fiscal year, 80 percent of such appropriations shall be available for purposes of title II (Community Renewal Employment Programs) and 20 percent shall be available for title III (Educational Facility Repair and Renovation Employment Activities). Makes individuals aged 16 or older eligible to participate in such program only if they are unemployed at the time of eligibility determination and for at least 15 of the 20 weeks prior to such determination, with specified exceptions. Limits wages for eligible individuals to 52 weeks in a two-year period.
