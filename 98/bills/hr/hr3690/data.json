    "text": "Diversity Jurisdiction Reform and Multiparty Injury Jurisdiction Act of 1983 - Amends the judicial code to eliminate diversity of State citizenship as a basis for Federal district court jurisdiction. Increases the amount in controversy required as a basis for Federal district court jurisdiction from $10,000 to $25,000. Revises venue requirements to permit the bringing of a civil action in the judicial district in which either: (1) a substantial part of the events occurred which prompted the action; or (2) a substantial part of the property involved is located. Confers upon the district courts original jurisdiction over civil actions involving personal injury to or injury to the property of 25 or more people in sums exceeding $10,000 per person, where the adverse parties are citizens of different States. Outlines criteria for: (1) intervention as a plaintiff; and (2) removal of actions from State to district court. Provides for venue, service of process, and transfer of actions pending in several judicial districts."
