Places the burden of proof of insanity on the defendant. Requires that any person found not guilty only by reason of insanity be committed to a facility until eligible for release. Requires the court to commit such person to the custody of the Attorney General upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the person is currently suffering from a mental disease or defect and his release would create a substantial danger to himself or herself or another person or serious damage to the property of another. Directs the Attorney General to release such person to a mental hospital or other suitable facility. Requires the court to hold a hearing upon the certification by the director of the facility that such person's release will no longer create a substantial danger. Directs the court to order the discharge of a person who is found to have recovered. Provides for a special verdict of \"guilty but mentally ill.\" Directs the Attorney General to take action to assure that a person found guilty but mentally ill receives appropriate treatment for any mental illness occurring during the term of such sentence."
