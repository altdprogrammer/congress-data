Releases national forest system lands in Wisconsin which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Wisconsin reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Wisconsin without express congressional authorization. States that the provisions above shall also apply to national forest system roadless lands in Wisconsin which are less than 5,000 acres in size."
