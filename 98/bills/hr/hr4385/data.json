    "text": "Amends the benefit accrual requirements of defined benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code to include: (1) the use of the individual level premium cost method to establish the annual actuarial cost of plan benefits and expenses; and (2) the requirement that accrued benefits upon separation from service be not less than the actuarial accumulated value of the normal costs of such benefits for all periods before the separation. Declares that certain actuarial methods of computing a participant's current or future benefit accruals under a defined benefit plan shall not be deemed unreasonable solely because such methods account only for anticipated compensation in computing such accruals. Specifies the plans to which such methods are applicable."
