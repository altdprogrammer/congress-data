Prohibits any Federal agency or department or federally owned entity from purchasing any of the loans made, guaranteed, or committed to be guaranteed under this Act. Permits the Corporation to request the Secretary of the Treasury to guarantee its obligations with the full faith and credit of the United States. Exempts the Corporation, its franchise, capital, reserves, surplus, income, tangible and intangible property, and obligations from all taxation, with specified exceptions. Permits the Corporation to provide financial assistance to an eligible business enterprise for: (1) financial distress; (2) modernization or expansion that would have a significant beneficial impact on employment opportunities and productivity; (3) domestic industries competing with certain foreign industries; or (4) domestic firms which have substantial problems meeting government imposed costs.
