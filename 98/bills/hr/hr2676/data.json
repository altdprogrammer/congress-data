Requires the Secretary of the Interior to report to Congress by February 1, 1985, on exotic species introduced into United States waters as a result of aquaculture activities. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to make a continuing study, and report annually to Congress, on the possible adverse effects on existing capture fisheries by competition from products produced by commercial aquacultural enterprises. Requires that any proprietary information collected by the Secretaries not be released except in aggregate summary form so as not to disclose the identity, business transactions, or trade secrets of any person who submits such information. Establishes the National Aquaculture Board to review periodically the National Aquaculture Development Plan and related plans and studies and make appropriate recommendations to the Secretary. Outlines the composition, compensation, procedures for transacting business, staff and administration, and the various functions of the Board.
