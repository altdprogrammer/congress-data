Directs the court to award a reasonable attorney's fee to the defendant in an antitrust action based on such conduct if the claimaint fails to prevail. Amends the Clayton Act with respect to liability for such conduct to direct a court to award only simple interest on actual damages for the period beginning on the date of service of the pleading setting forth the claim and ending on the date of judgment."
