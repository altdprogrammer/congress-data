    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendments to certain Senate amendment with an amendment,R.C.#374 (67-30)) Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1984 - Title I: Amends the Department of Housing and Urban Development-Independent Agencies Appropriation Act, 1984, to limit the interest rate on loans made under the Housing for the Elderly or Handicapped Fund. Makes supplemental appropriations for FY 1984 to: (1) the Council on Environmental Quality and Office of Environmental Quality to conduct studies to consider and define a National Center for Water Resources Research and a National Clearinghouse for Water Resources Information; (2) the Federal Emergency Management Agency for salaries and expenses, State and local assistance, and a program of grants to private voluntary organizations for emergency shelter and food distribution; and (3) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for the construction of certain facilities. Makes supplemental appropriations to the Veterans Administration for: (1) medical and prosthetic research through FY 1985; (2) veterans job training through FY 1986. Sets aside authorized funds for general operating expenses through FY 1984 for an evaluation of the emergency veterans' job training program. (The following Titles I through XI constitute the Domestic Housing and International Recovery and Financial Stability Act. Titles I through V also constitute the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983. (Following Title XI - and a good portion yet of the original Title I - is Title II. This is not an error. H.R. 3959 as enacted has two Titles I and two Titles II because of an amendment to the conference report, comprising the second Title I through XI, first introduced and passed on the Senate floor on November 17, 1983. The discrepancies among the title numerals were not reconciled.) Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 - Title I: Community and Neighborhood Development and Conservation Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to require that a majority of the funds received from community development block grants (CDBG) or as a result of Government guarantees of obligations issued by local governments to finance the acquisition or rehabilitation of real property be used for activities that benefit persons of low and moderate income. Provides that any area classified as a metropolitan city for 1983 for purposes of assistance eligibility under the CDBG program shall not lose such classification for FY 1984 and 1985 as a result of the population data in the 1980 decennial census. Allows a local government that becomes eligible to be classified as a metropolitan city to defer such classification for purposes of the CDBG program through FY 1986 if it continues to have its population included in an urban county. Provides that an area classified as an urban county under such program for FY 1983 shall not lose such classification under such program through FY 1985 (or later as provided in a cooperation agreement entered into in FY 1984) by reason of a decrease in population. Allows the population of a local government that loses its designation as a metropolitan city to be included in the population of an urban county in the second or third program year. Defines, for purposes of such Act: (1) \"low- and moderate-income persons\" as persons whose incomes do not exceed 80 percent of the area median income; and (2) \"very low-income persons\" as persons whose incomes do not exceed 50 percent of median area income. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1986 for the CDBG program, the urban development action grants (UDAG) program, and the special discretionary fund of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Requires each CDBG recipient to include in its statement of community development objectives and projected use of funds a description of its use of CDBG assistance since FY 1981 or since the last such description was prepared together with an assessment of the relationship of such use to community development objectives. Requires each recipient to certify that it: (1) will affirmatively further fair housing; (2) has developed a community development plan that identifies community development and housing needs and short- and long-term community development objectives; and (3) will recover capital costs of assisted public improvements by assessing amounts against low- and moderate-income persons only under specified conditions. Requires that each recipient's annual performance report: (1) be made available for public comment prior to submission; and (2) include an evaluation of the extent to which CDBG funds were used to benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Directs the Secretary to encourage the development of, and to establish, uniform reporting requirements. Permits a local government to retain any program income realized from any CDBG funds if such government agrees to use such income for eligible community development activities while participating in a community development program. Directs each UDBG recipient to provide benefits to any person displaced as a result of the use of UDBG assistance to acquire or rehabilitate property. Revises activities eligible for CDBG funding to include the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or installation of all public facilities, except buildings for the general conduct of government. Increases the percentage of CDBG assistance provided to a local government that may be used for public services activities to 15 percent or the percentage used in FY 1983, whichever is higher. Repeals the Secretary's authority to waive such percentage limitation in FY 1984. Prescribes standards for determining whether eligible activities principally benefit persons of low and moderate income. Sets forth provisions governing the allocation of CDBG funds to a metropolitan city formed by the consolidation of one or more such cities with an urban county. Provides for the distribution of CDBG funds to nonentitlement areas of a State by the Secretary only if a State has not elected to distribute such amounts. Repeals the requirement that a State must certify that it will match ten percent of the CDBG funds provided for nonentitlement areas in order to receive such funds. Adds a requirement that the State certify that each local government to receive funds will be required to identify its community development and housing needs and planned activities. Revises the amount a State may deduct from the amount to be distributed to nonentitlement areas to cover its distribution costs. Provides that funds not received by a State because of its failure to comply with performance report or other CDBG program requirements shall be added to amounts to be allocated to all States in the succeeding fiscal year. Sets forth certification requirements for nonentitlement areas for the receipt of CDBG funds. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants from the special discretionary fund to State and local governments that received insufficient CDBG funds as a result of a miscalculation. Allows the Secretary to guarantee a loan to a local government for the acquisition or rehabilitation of real property only if such government cannot otherwise receive the needed financing. Specifies the loan guarantee authority of the Secretary for FY 1984. Authorizes a local government to retain program income realized from a CDBG applied toward payment of an urban renewal loan if the local government agrees to use such income for eligible community development activities. Authorizes appropriations for UDAGs for FY 1984 through 1986. Provides that any city of less than 50,000 persons that is not a central city of a metropolitan area and that was eligible for a UDAG in FY 1983 shall continue to be eligible until the Secretary revises eligibility standards to include standards for the extent of unemployment, job lag, or labor surplus. Directs the Secretary to select criteria for a national competition for UDABGs. Authorizes corsortia of geographically proximate cities of less than 50,000 persons to apply for UDAGs. Authorizes UDAG eligibility for certain unincorporated portions of urban counties that are approved by the Secretary as identifiable communities. Earmarks a specified amount of UDAG appropriations for technical assistance grants to States, municipal technical advisory services, and State associations of counties or municipalities to assist cities with populations of less than 50,000 that are not central cities of metropolitan areas in developing and implementing programs eligible for UDAGs and in applying for such grants. Authorizes consortia of such cities to apply. Prohibits the Secretary from discriminating among UDAG programs on the basis of the particular activity involved. Authorizes appropriations for the urban homesteading program for FY 1984 and 1985. Revises provisions governing eligible programs to require that the person to whom property is conveyed under a program agree to: (1) occupy the property as a principal residence for five years (currently, three years); (2) repair property defects that pose a substantial danger to health and safety within one year after conveyance; and (3) make repairs necessary to meet local housing standards within three years after conveyance (currently, 18 months after initial occupancy). Requires an eligible program to: (1) provide a priority for property applicants whose current housing fails to meet health and safety standards, who currently pay more than 30 percent of their income for shelter, and who have little prospect of obtaining improved housing through means other than homesteading; (2) exclude applicants who are currently homeowners; and (3) consider the capacity of the applicant to contribute labor to the rehabilitation process or to obtain assistance from private sources. Requires the Secretary, the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, and the Secretary of Agriculture to provide a State or local government, upon request, a listing of all unoccupied residential properties to which such official holds title within that government's jurisdiction. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a demonstration project during FY 1984 and 1985 under which he or she will convey property to a local government for a multifamily homesteading program if: (1) the primary use of such property after rehabilitation will be residential; and (2) at least 75 percent of the occupants will be lower-income individuals. Directs the Secretary to conduct a program to demonstrate the feasibility of providing assistance to State and local governments for the purchase of unoccupied real property that is improved by a one- to four-family dwelling and designated for use in a single-family homestead program. Requires the property to be conveyed under such program to lower-income families who agree to: (1) repair all dangerous defects within one year; (2) make repairs or improvements necessary to meet applicable local buildings standards; and (3) occupy such property as a principal residence for at least five years. Directs the Secretary to submit an evaluation and recommendations concerning such demonstration projects to Congress by December 31, 1985. Directs the Secretary to conduct a demonstration program to determine the feasibility of supporting neighborhood development activities by providing Federal matching funds to certain nonprofit neighborhood development organizations on the basis of monetary support from the private sector. Limits the amount of grants that may be multiyear awards. Directs the Secretary to use a competitive process in selecting program participants. Requires that a selected participant: (1) demonstrate measurable achievements in certain neighborhood development activities; (2) specify a plan for accomplishing one or more of such activities; and (3) specify a strategy for achieving long term private sector support. Directs the Secretary to award matching grants on the basis of: (1) the degree of economic distress of the neighborhood involved; (2) the extent activities will benefit persons of low and moderate income; (3) the extent of neighborhood participation in proposed activities; and (4) the extent of voluntary contributions. Requires the Secretary to: (1) assign each participating organization a program year during which voluntary private contributions shall be eligible for matching funds; and (2) establish a ratio for matching Federal dollars to each dollar privately contributed, which the Secretary shall pay to each organization at the end of each three-month period of the organization's program year. Limits the maximum amount the Secretary may pay to any organization for a year to $50,000. Requires the Secretary to insure that: (1) assistance may be provided only if the local government of the neighborhood to be assisted certifies that such assistance is consistent with such government's plans; and (2) eligible neighborhood development activities comply with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the activities carried out under the demonstration program, an evaluation of the program, and any findings or recommendations concerning the program. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Housing Act of 1964 to extend the Secretary's authority to make rehabilitation loans. Prohibits the Secretary from establishing: (1) any requirement that a certain portion of such loan be used for any particular type of dwelling unit; or (2) any priority for receipt of such loan that is based on an applicant's receipt of other Federal assistance under any program other than the urban homesteading program. Amends the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act to authorize appropriations for the Corporation for FY 1984 and 1985. Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969 to repeal provisions authorizing the General Services Administration to transfer Federal surplus real property to the Secretary or the Secretary of Agriculture for sale or lease at fair value for use for low and moderate-income housing. Permits the transfer of property requested before enactment of this Act. Amends the Housing Act of 1949 to repeal provisions that prohibit an urban renewal plan from providing for the construction of transient housing unless the community involved has obtained a transient housing study indicating a need for such housing. Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 and the Housing Act of 1961 to repeal provisions requiring the Secretary's approval of the conversion of neighborhood facilities or open space land to uses not originally approved by the Secretary when awarding a grant for acquisition of such facilities or land. Title II: Housing Assistance Programs - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to require the Secretary to allocate certain Federal housing assistance on the basis of a formula accounting for the relative needs of different States, areas, and communities. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to authorize the Secretary to approve the conversion of public housing development authority for use for comprehensive improvement assistance for existing public housing projects or for the acquisition and rehabilitation of property to be used in public housing under certain conditions. Authorizes a specified amount of budget authority and designates the use of such authority for housing assistance programs, including public housing, housing for the elderly and handicapped, comprehensive improvement assistance for public housing projects, and the rental rehabilitation and development program. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a contract involving public housing new construction only if the cost of such new construction is less than the cost of acquisition and rehabilitation. Directs the Secretary to give a priority in the development of public housing to projects for the construction of housing suitable for large families. Authorizes the Secretary to increase the percentage of public housing units that may be occupied by single persons who are not 62 years old, disabled, handicapped, displaced, or a remaining member of a tenant family, if a unit is not, and is not likely to be, occupied by a person in one of such categories with one year because of the unit's location or condition. Establishes a priority for receiving public housing assistance for families paying more than 50 percent of their income for rent. Directs the Secretary to require public housing agencies to: (1) implement an administrative grievance procedure for tenants and applicants; and (2) use leases that do not contain unreasonable terms and conditions, that obligate the agency to maintain the projects in a decent, safe, and sanitary condition, that require the agency to provide specified written notice of termination of the lease, and that prohibit the agency from terminating the lease except for serious or repeated violations or other good cause. Prohibits the Secretary from imposing any unnecessarily duplicative or burdensome reporting requirements on public housing agencies or tenants. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to allow the Secretary to establish an income ceiling higher or lower than 50 percent of the area median income when defining \"very low-income families\" for purposes of the housing assistance programs if such a variation is necessary because of unusually high or low family incomes. Excludes from a family's income for purposes of such programs: (1) $480 for each dependent minor or each full-time student or handicapped person over the age of 18; (2) $400 for each elderly family; (3) medical expenses over three percent of gross income for an elderly family; and (4) child-care expenses necessary to permit a second person in the household to work or further his or her education. Prohibits the rent or contribution of a public housing tenant from increasing by more than ten percent in any 12-month period as a result of a change in the definition of income or the conversion of assistance from one housing assistance program to another. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a demonstration program for providing rental assistance based on the amount by which a payment standard for an area exceeds 30 percent of a family's monthly adjusted income. Defines eligible families as families with incomes under 50 percent of area median income or families previously assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937, with preference given to those living in substandard housing, involuntarily displaced, or paying more than 50 percent of their income in rent. Requires the Secretary to provide such assistance primarily to families dislocated under the rental rehabilitation and development program and families residing in housing rehabilitated under such program. Limits the duration of contracts for such assistance to 60 months. Provides that a public housing assistance contributions contract may be attached to a structure in certain cases where the owner of the structure agrees to rehabilitate the structure using other assistance. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to repeal provisions concerning assistance payments to owners for the construction or substantial rehabilitation of lower income housing projects, except with respect to projects for the elderly and handicapped. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into annual contribution contracts for dwelling units without bathrooms and kitchens if the local government in which such unit is located and the local public housing agency certify that the unit complies with local health and safety standards. Authorizes the use of assistance under housing assistance and moderate rehabilitation programs by elderly and handicapped families living in shared housing arrangements. Authorizes appropriations for operating assistance for public housing projects for FY 1984 and 1985. Increases from ten to 25 percent the proportion of public housing units that were available for leasing before October 1, 1981, which may be leased to families with incomes of between 50 and 80 percent of the median area income. Permits the Secretary to approve the demolition of a public housing project or a portion thereof if the project is unusable and cannot be restored feasibly. Allows the Secretary to approve the disposition of such a project or portion if: (1) the property's retention is not in the best interest of the tenants or the public housing agency due to health and safety factors or because disposition allows the acquisition, development, or rehabilitation of more effective or efficient lower-income housing projects; or (2) the portion involved is nonresidential property the disposition of which will not interfere with continued operation of the project; and (3) the proceeds will be used to pay off development and modernization costs of the project and to provide other types of lower income housing assistance. Conditions the approval of such demolition or disposition on requirements that: (1) affected tenants be consulted; and (2) displaced tenants be provided assistance by the agency to relocate to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing of their choice to the maximum extent practicable. Prohibits the Secretary from entering into contracts for: (1) annual contributions regarding obligations financing public housing projects, unless such obligations are exempt from taxation; or (2) periodic payments to the Federal Financing Bank to offset its costs in purchasing obligations issued by public housing agencies. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 for the Secretary to make grants to States, local governments, Indian tribes, and nonprofit organizations for the provision of shelter and essential services for individuals who are subject to life-threatening situations because of their lack of housing. Directs the Secretary to consider the special needs of families and single women. Amends the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 to provide that operating assistance shall be available to troubled multifamily housing projects: (1) without regard to whether such projects are insured under the National Housing Act; and (2) that are converted from assistance under the rent supplement and rental assistance payments programs to the rental subsidy program under the United States Housing Act of 1937. Amends the National Housing Act to extend through FY 1984 the period during which the Rental Housing Assistance Fund may be utilized for such assistance. Amends the National Housing Act and the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 to require the Secretary to offer, annually, to amend rental assistance payment contracts and rent supplement payment contracts to provide sufficient payments to cover up to 90 percent of necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of tenants, regardless of whether project mortgages are federally insured. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the status of the program established by the Secretary to provide housing assistance to local governments in areas of concentrated housing and community development activities under the CDBG program. Declares that utility payments (up to the utility allowance) made by persons living in certain federally-assisted low-income housing projects shall be considered to be rental payments for purposes of determining eligibility or the amount of benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a demonstration program to determine: (1) the feasibility of using public housing facilities to provide child care services for lower-income families residing in public housing; and (2) the extent to which the availability of such services facilitates the employability of the heads of such families and their spouses.
