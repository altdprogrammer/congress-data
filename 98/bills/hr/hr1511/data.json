Declares that this Act does not: (1) require such common carriers to reveal any information with regard to inland transportation, except where such transportation costs comprise an undifferentiated portion of any tariff required to be filed; or (2) extend to the Federal Maritime Commission any jurisdiction over or authority to regulate rail or motor carriers when they are engaged in activities subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Directs the Commission to report to Congress within 18 months of the effective date of this Act, an assessment of its impact on the shipping industry."
