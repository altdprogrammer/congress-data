    "text": "Amends the Clean Air Act to provide for exemptions from specified provisions or regulations relating to: (1) emission standards for new motor vehicles or engines; (2) the removal or rendering inoperative of automobile emission control devices or design elements; and (3) the control or prohibition of fuels, classes of fuels, or fuel additives. Requires, as a basis for such exemptions, that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determine that the use in question will occur predominantly in an area in which the reduction of motor vehicle emissions is not necessary to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards. Establishes a civil penalty for the removal or rendering inoperative of motor vehicle pollution control devices or design elements by any person, after sale and delivery to the ultimate purchaser, in circumstances where such exemptions do not apply. Requires, as a qualification for area-of- use fuel exemptions, that such fuels or additives will not impair emission control devices or system performance."
