Requires the Secretary, under specified conditions, to permit a borrower to use the proceeds of a sale of property used to secure an operating loan to make prospective loan payments. States that disaster emergency loan assistance based on production loss is to be based solely on criteria under such Act, and not on emergency county designation, except that the applicant must establish to the Secretary's satisfaction that the disaster caused such loss. Makes the Secretary's decision final unless judicially overturned. Authorizes four and three-year subsequent loan extensions for specified categories of borrowers. Subjects such subsequent loans to specified current limitations. Increases from $25,000 to $50,000 the level of claims which may be delegated to administrative levels below the Administrator of the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA).

Requires a borrower, at the Secretary's request, to periodically review his or her farm or financial situation with the Secretary, and to resume original payments if appropriate. Makes the Secretary's decisions final unless judicially overturned. Provides for loan consolidation and rescheduling at the end of such deferral period. States that interest accrued during the deferral period shall become part of the total loan to be repaid. Requires interest rates to be at the lower of either original or current rates. Requires the Secretary to provide notification about such programs to FmHA borrowers. Revises county committee structure and selection provisions. Permits a FmHA borrower to make loan payments with the proceeds of oil, gas, or other mineral sales or royalties. Requires the Secretary to notify FmHA borrowers who receive a foreclosure notice or who are denied additional credit of the circumstances under which the Secretary may make advances to protect the Government's interest in property securing the loan.

Requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register specified loan regulations for immigrant aliens within 60 days. Requires the Secretary to establish a Guaranteed Farm Loan Program Unit in each State office of the FmHA to administer the various guaranteed farm loans. Amends the Emergency Agricultural Credit Adjustment Act of 1978 to: (1) require (presently only authorizes) the Secretary to carry out such program; (2) extend program authority through FY 1984; (3) reduce FY 1983 program authorization from $600,000,000 to $300,000,000 (with at least $150,000,000 earmarked for insured loans); and (4) require at least $300,000,000 for FY 1984 insured loans."
