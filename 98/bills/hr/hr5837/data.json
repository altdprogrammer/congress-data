Limits subsidies to interest payable during 1985. Directs the Secretary to lease farmland that lenders have acquired through foreclosure or abandonment if such leasing is necessary to protect farmland values, reduce surplus production, and promote conservation. Prohibits the Secretary from selling farmland it holds in States where farmland values have decreased. Permits the Secretary to lease back such farmland on a crop share basis to the original owner with an option to buy when values stabilize. Directs the Secretary, upon request by a qualified lender, to guarantee 90 percent of the unpaid balance of qualified loans in agricultural communities that are experiencing severe economic stress."
