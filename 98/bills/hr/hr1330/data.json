    "date": "1983-02-08", 
    "text": "Emergency Housing Assistance Act of 1983 - Amends the Emergency Housing Act of 1975 to direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to make emergency mortgage relief payments to mortgagees on behalf of certain delinquent mortgagors in a district when, for three consecutive months, the amount of delinquent mortgage loans exceeds a specified percentage of the amount of all loans accounted for in the mortgage delinquency series maintained by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board for such district or the nation. Provides for the discontinuation and reinstitution of such assistance program depending on such delinquency rate condition. Lists the conditions for assistance eligibility, which include requirements that: (1) the mortgage is not federally insured under the National Housing Act or the Housing Act of 1949; (2) the mortgagor has suffered a substantial reduction in income as a result of circumstances beyond the mortgagor's control which renders the mortgagor unable to make full mortgage payments; and (3) the Secretary has determined that assistance is necessary to avoid foreclosure and that it is likely that the mortgagor will be able to resume full mortgage payments within 36 months and pay the mortgage in full by its maturity date. Establishes a rebuttable presumption that a mortgagor will be able to resume making full payments and pay the mortgage in full if the mortgagor suffered a reduction in income because of a loss of, or reduction in, employment. Requires each financial institution or mortgagee, at least 30 days before instituting any foreclosure proceeding, to notify the mortgagor involved of the availability of assistance under this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide homeownership counseling to persons assisted under this Act; and (2) approve or disapprove an application for assistance within 45 days. Sets forth the authority of the Secretary to recapture assistance provided under this Act. Creates the Homeowners Emergency Relief Fund to be available to carry out this Act. Authorizes appropriations and limits expenditures for assistance under this Act. Requires the Secretary and certain Federal agencies which supervise financial institutions to waive or relax limitations pertaining to the operations of certain mortgagees and financial institutions with respect to mortgage delinquencies in order to encourage forebearance in residential mortgage loan foreclosure. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress every 60 days on: (1) the rate of delinquencies and foreclosures in various housing markets; (2) the prospects of voluntary forebearance by mortgagees in such areas; (3) Government actions to encourage such forebearance and to provide assistance under this title; and (4) the default status of mortgagees on multifamily properties with recommendations on curing and avoiding such defaults. Directs the Secretary to study and report on the use of alternative mortgage delinquency series under this title. Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to authorize appropriations for grants by the Secretary to local governments, Indian tribes, and nonprofit organizations for the provision of shelter and essential services for individuals who are subject to life-threatening situations because of their lack of housing. Amends the Housing Act of 1949 to require the Secretary of Agriculture, prior to taking any action that would result in a borrower losing housing financed by a rural housing loan, to grant a moratorium on loan payments if the borrower shows that he or she is unable to continue making payments because of circumstances beyond his or her control. Requires the Secretary to: (1) ensure that delinquent borrowers are informed of the availability of such assistance; and (2) provide technical assistance to borrowers applying for such assistance. Authorizes the Secretary to reamortize the accrued debt of a borrower if reamortization is likely to result in the resumption of payments by the borrower."
