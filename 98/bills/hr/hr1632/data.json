    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit the disposal of any liquid hazardous waste (or hazardous waste containing free liquids) by any land disposal method, effective five years after the date of enactment of this Act. Prohibits such disposal, effective upon the enactment of this Act, unless the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency finds that: (1) no technologically feasible means of treatment, recovery, or disposal other than land disposal is available for such hazardous waste exists within 500 miles of the location where such waste is generated; or (2) any such means is less protective of human health and the environment than the means of land disposal. Directs the Administrator, within two years after the date of enactment of this Act, to submit a report to the Congress listing those liquid hazardous wastes (or hazardous wastes containing free liquids) for which there does not exist one or more technologically feasible means of treatment, recovery, or disposal other than land disposal which will protect human health and the environment. Directs the General Services Administration and other Federal agencies to dispose of liquid hazardous waste (and hazardous waste containing free liquids) by means other than land disposal where such other means are more protective of human health and the environment."
