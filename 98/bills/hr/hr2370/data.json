    "text": "Broadcasting Public Responsibility and Deregulation Act of 1983 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Federal Communications Commission to grant any application for renewal of a broadcast station license if the licensee has operated the station without seriously violating such Act or any Commission regulation and has met the public responsibility standards during the most recent license period. Directs the Commission: (1) to issue an order denying the application of a licensee who does not meet such requirements; and (2) after issuing such order, to accept and consider applications for a construction permit for the station operated by such licensee. Directs the Commission to establish a licensee rating schedule to measure the amount of information programing and programing originated within the service areas of a licensee that the licensee carries each year. Requires the Commission to establish a public responsibility standard, which may vary for different categories of licensees, and procedures under which the Commission shall issue, on request, a declaratory judgment regarding whether a licensee is in compliance with such standard. Restricts the authority of the Commission to regulate a licensee's programing in administering such standard. Requires each licensee to maintain records of its compliance with such standard and to certify its compliance to the Commission annually. Directs the Commission to take necessary action to ascertain licensee compliance. Subjects licensees to a civil penalty imposed by the Commission for failing to comply with such standard. Requires the Commission to revoke the license of a licensee who has received such a penalty twice and violated such standard a third time within a five-year period. Establishes penalties for making false records or documents relating to such standard. Prohibits the Commission from requiring station license applicants or holders to: (1) determine the problems, needs, or interest of residents of the station's service area; (2) limit the number or length of commercials; or (3) establish any specific format for programming logs or other records. Increases the maximum terms of radio and television broadcast station licenses and license renewals to ten years. Permits joint applications for broadcast station licenses and construction permits. Repeals provisions that require licenses to be issued to holders of permits upon completion of station construction. Prohibits the Commission from granting an application for a station instrument of authorization earlier than 30 days after it publishes notice of the receipt of such application. Repeals provisions authorizing interested parties to file with the Commission petitions to deny applications for station licenses. Provides that equal broadcast time requirements shall not apply to appearances by political candidates on news discussions, debates, or documentations. (Currently, such requirements do not apply to incidental appearances on news documentaries.)"
