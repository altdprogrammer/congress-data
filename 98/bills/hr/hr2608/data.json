    "text": "Export-Import Bank Small Business Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to declare that it is U.S. policy that loans made by the Export-Import Bank in all its programs, including those for small business, shall bear interest at rates consistent with the Bank's mandate to support U.S. exports on terms which are fully competitive with exports of other countries. Requires the Bank to consider the average cost of money as one factor in determining interest rates. Increases the number of members on the Bank's Advisory Committee from nine to 12. Requires that at least three of the members must be small business exporters. Requires that at least 20 percent of the Bank's loans, guarantees, and insurance shall be to small business exporters. Provides that such small business exporters need not demonstrate denial from other Federal export financing institutions. Declares that it is congressional policy that the Bank facilitate the development of small business exports. Directs the Bank's Board of Directors to exercise all powers necessary to use the export expansion facility. Declares that the Bank should give high priority to aiding small businesses. Directs the Bank to encourage the creation, development, and expansion of new export finance institutions and programs directed at small businesses. Requires the Bank to give Congress by January first of each year a report of its operations for the preceding fiscal year. Requires the report to list the amount of each loan or loan guarantee, the company which received the loan or loan guarantee, and whether the company is a small business. Requires the Bank to report annually to the Small Business Committees of Congress on its export expansion activities. Sets a deadline for such report. Requires the Bank to survey small business exporters and some regional and local banks to determine their experience in meeting foreign financial competition."
