    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Technical Amendments to the Federal Court Improvements Act of 1982 - Makes technical amendments to the Federal Court Improvements Act of 1982 to: (1) provide that the circuit court with jurisdiction of an appeal has jurisdiction of a certification of a controlling question of law (interlocutory appeal); (2) repeal the requirement that appellants from Patent and Trademark Office determinations set forth \"reasons of appeal\" when an appeal is filed (thus eliminating the restriction on the appellate court to confine its decision to such \"reasons of appeal\"); and (3) require the Commissioner of the Patent and Trademark Office to certify to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit only a list of documents comprising the record in a case, instead of certifying copies of such documents, as currently required. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require appellants from final determinations of the International Trade Commission to file an appeal within 60 days after the date of determination. Permits persons who were serving as marshals for the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia when the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 was enacted to continue serving in that capacity. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to award urban development action grants for FY 1985 in addition to those announced on October 1, 1984. Sets eligibility criteria for such grants. Requires the Secretary to select such grant applications from eligible cities and urban countries which on October 1, 1984: (1) were rated as fundable; and (2) did not receive a grant award for FY 1985."
