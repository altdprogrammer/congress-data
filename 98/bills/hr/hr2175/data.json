    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Justice Assistance, Missing Children and Juvenile Justice Act of 1984 - Title I: Amendments to Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 - Amends title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Justice System Improvement) to eliminate the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, including the Office of Community Anti-Crime Programs and the Office of Justice Assistance, Research, and Statistics. Retains the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Institute of Justice. Establishes a new Office of Justice Assistance (OJA), to be headed by an Assistant Attorney General. Maintains the National Institute of Justice and the Bureau of Justice Statistics as independent of the Office of Justice Assistance. Establishes a Justice Assistance Board to: (1) advise and make recommendations to the Assistant Attorney General on research, statistics and program priorities; (2) review and evaluate demonstration programs; and (3) undertake additional tasks the board deems necessary. Establishes a Bureau of Justice Programs to develop and set priorities for technical assistance and training programs for State and local criminal justice agencies. Directs the Bureau to make grants to such agencies for programs that address critical problems of violent and serious crime and for programs which have been certified successful. Enumerates 18 purposes for the awarding of these grants. Limits the Federal share of the grant programs to a period of four years and includes a cash match requirement. Eliminates the current national priority grant programs. Retains the discretionary grant program. Limits the purposes of discretionary grants to: (1) educational and training programs for criminal justice personnel; (2) technical assistance; (3) national demonstration programs which are likely to be successful but unlikely to be funded; and (4) national programs to improve the performance of criminal justice agencies. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to pay the Federal share (ten percent) of the cost of construction of correctional facilities to relieve the emergency overcrowding conditions at State and local facilities. Increases the Federal share to not more than 12 percent for projects that are prototypes of economical new methods and designs. Requires the Director of the Bureau of Justice Programs to establish and operate an information clearinghouse on the construction and modernization of correctional facilities. Authorizes the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to develop and conduct programs for training State and local criminal justice personnel at the FBI National Academy at Quantico, Virginia. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to establish and conduct similar training programs at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center at Glynco, Georgia. Authorizes the Attorney General to determine, upon application, that a State or local jurisdiction is a law enforcement emergency jurisdiction. Authorizes all Federal law enforcement agencies to provide emergency assistance to such a jurisdiction for the duration of the emergency. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 and subsequent fiscal years. Increases from seven to 20 the number of prison industry projects designated by the Office of Justice Assistance. Adds local labor union consultation and non-displacement of employed workers requirements to such projects. Amends the Federal criminal code relating to fraud in connection with identification documents to require that common descriptive terms and formats be designed to reduce redundancy found in various identification systems and to facilitate positive identification of bona fide holders of such documents. Requires the President, after consultation with Federal, State, local and international authorities, to make recommendations to Congress within three years on comprehensive Federal identification systems. Amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to require the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to establish and maintain a national toll-free telephone line for reporting information regarding the location of missing children. Directs the Administrator to establish a national resource center and clearinghouse to: (1) provide technical assistance to State and local governments and agencies in locating missing children; (2) coordinate public and private efforts to recover missing children; (3) disseminate information on innovative missing childrens' programs, services, and legislation; and (4) provide technical assistance to law enforcement agencies, State and local governments, and public and private nonprofit agencies. Requires the Administrator to publish an annual summary of research on missing children and prepare a comprehensive plan for coordinating activities of all agencies and organizations responsible for missing children. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants for research, demonstration, or service programs designed to: (1) educate parents and community agencies on ways to prevent the abduction or sexual exploitation of children; (2) assist in the recovery or tracking of missing children; (3) aid communities in collecting material to assist parents in the identification of their children; (4) demonstrate the psychological consequences of a child's abduction; and (5) collect data on investigative practices utilized by law enforcement agencies. Requires the Administrator to appoint an Advisory Board on Missing Children to assist the Administrator in coordinating programs and activities relating to missing children. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1988. Provides for family involvement in delinquency and runaway problems. Allows for State plans that facilitate coordination of services between juvenile justice and criminal justice systems. Authorizes programs targeted at gangs whose membership is substantially composed of juveniles. Allows the National Institute of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to prepare an examination of the treatment of juveniles processed in the criminal justice system and to prepare recommendations for effective means to deter involvement in gangs whose membership is substantially composed of juveniles. Allows for State plans that provide for the detention in a juvenile facility, for a maximum of five days, of juveniles who are charged with or who have committed offenses that would not be criminal if committed by an adult, if the safety of the juvenile is in danger and no less restrictive alternative is available. Requires the State advisory group to evaluate the juvenile residential facilities in the State every six months. Extends for one year a State's deadline date for complying with the mandate to remove all juveniles from jails. Reauthorizes appropriations through 1988. Amends the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act to make private entities (whether nonprofit private agencies or otherwise) eligible for grants under such Act."
