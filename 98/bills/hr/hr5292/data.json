    "text": "Amends title IX (Graduate Programs) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (the Act) to create a new part D program of graduate assistance in areas of national need. Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants to institutions of higher education for graduate fellowships in selected areas of study for graduate students who demonstrate financial need and ability. Directs the Secretary, to the maximum extent feasible, to ensure an equitable distribution of such awards among geographic areas and among eligible public and private institutions. Sets the minimum grant to any institution at $100,000 per fiscal year for a three-year period, from sums appropriated under such program for any fiscal year. Provides for reallotment of grant funds. Provides for new awards under the program only to the extent that each previous award has received the required continued funding. Provides for ratable reductions of amounts required to be awarded to the extent that appropriations are insufficient. Sets forth institutional eligibility provisions. Permits grant applications by any institution of higher education which offers a program of post-baccalaureate study leading to a graduate degree in mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry, engineering, computer science, or foreign languages or linguistics. Requires that such program of study have been in existence for at least four years, in order to be eligible for such a grant. Sets forth criteria for grant applications, including a requirement of at least 25 percent non-Federal matching funds. Requires that the institution make such fellowship awards to individuals having financial need who: (1) plan teaching or research careers; (2) plan to pursue the highest possible degree available in their course of study; (3) are from traditionally underrepresented groups undertaking graduate study, as determined by the Secretary; and (4) have compiled outstanding academic records during their baccalaureate course of study. Sets forth requirements relating to awards to graduate students. Provides that 60 percent of the grant to the institution shall be used for such awards. Limits the period and the amount of each individual award. Sets forth other conditions for receipt of such award. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for limited extensions of individual awards under special circumstances. Sets forth provisions for assistance to the graduate program. Provides that 40 percent of the grant to the institution may be used to: (1) pay such amounts as would otherwise be charged to fellowship recipients as tuition and mandatory fees; and (2) conduct activities to improve the quality of the academic program offered at the department, including library resources, laboratory and instructional equipment, and support for research projects and academic papers. Prohibits such funds from being used for the general operational overhead of the institution. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990 to carry out this Act."
