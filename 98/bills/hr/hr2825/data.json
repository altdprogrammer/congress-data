    "text": "Amends the Judicial Code to provide that where multiple proceedings involving the same Federal agency action have begun in two or more Courts of Appeals, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall select by a specified system the court in which the record shall be filed. Prescribes guidelines under which Courts of Appeals may transfer agency actions to another appellate forum. Provides that petitions for review of agency rules may be filed in the judicial circuit in which the party seeking such review has its principal place of business. States that with respect to certain parties, venue will not lie in specified judicial districts unless the residents of such districts are substantially affected by the Federal agency action. Requires that a copy of the complaint be forwarded to the Attorney General of each state involved when actions of a local environmental nature are brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Authorizes the district court to transfer specified civil actions to the forum in which the action would have substantially greater impact. Specifies exceptions."
