    "text": "Health Care Financing Amendments of 1983 - Title I: Medicare - Subtitle A: Changes in Eligibility, Benefits, and Cost Sharing - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to increase the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI), (part B of title XVIII) deductible by the percentage increase in the Medicare Physicians' services economic index. Amends titles II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) and XVIII of the Act to provide that Medicare eligibility shall not begin until the first full month in which an individual becomes age 65. Revises provisions relating to SMI premiums. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services during September 1983 and annually thereafter to determine the monthly actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over which shall be applicable for the succeeding year. Provides that the actuarial rate shall be the amount the Secretary estimates to be necessary so that the aggregate amount for that succeeding year with respect to those enrollees age 65 and over will equal one-half of the total benefits and administrative costs estimated to be payable from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for services performed and related administrative costs incurred in that year. Directs the Secretary during September 1983 and annually thereafter to determine a monthly premium amount applicable for the succeeding year. Provides that amount (except in certain instances) shall be equal to: (1) for 1984, 50 percent of the 1984 monthly actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over; (2) for 1985, 55 percent of the 1985 monthly actuarial rate; (3) for 1986, 60 percent of the 1986 monthly actuarial rate; (4) for 1987, 65 percent of the 1987 monthly actuarial rate; and (5) for 1988 and each succeeding year, 70 percent of the monthly actuarial rate for that year. Provides that payments to home health agencies for durable medical equipment shall be the lesser of: (1) the reasonable cost of the equipment and the customary charges for such equipment less an amount equal to 20 percent of the reasonable charge, but in no case may the payment for the equipment exceed 80 percent of the reasonable cost; or (2) if the equipment is furnished by a public home health agency free of charge or at a nominal charge, an amount which provides fair compensation to the agency. Eliminates the SMI deductible for diagnostic tests performed in a laboratory which has entered into a negotiated rate agreement with the Secretary. Provides for a 30 day period of coverage for services furnished by a home health agency following the termination of the agency's agreement. Subtitle B: Changes in Reimbursement - Reduces the \"applicable percentage increase\" used in computing hospital \"target amounts.\" Provides that in determining SMI reasonable charges for physicians' services, the prevailing and customary charge levels that apply to services furnished after June 1982 but before July 1983 shall also apply to services furnished after June 1983 but before July 1984. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into an agreement with a public or private entity under which the entity accepts specified amounts as full payment for certain SMI items and services. Subtitle C: Administrative Changes - Revises provisions relating to Medicare claims processing. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with intermediaries providing for their determination of the amount of the payments required under part A (Hospital Insurance) of title XVIII to be made to providers of services assigned by the Secretary to specific intermediaries, and for the making of such payments by intermediaries to those providers. Defines \"intermediary\" as: (1) a voluntary association, corporation, partnership, or other nongovernmental organization which is lawfully engaged in providing, paying for, or reimbursing the cost of, health services under group health insurance policies or contracts, medical or hospital service agreements, membership or subscription contracts, or similar group arrangements, in consideration of premiums or other periodic charges payable to the intermediary; or (2) an agency or organization with which an agreement was in effect on the date of enactment of the Health Care Financing Amendments of 1982. Requires all items and services furnished by a hospital to inpatients to be furnished by or through the hospital, except for physicians' services. Prohibits payment for inpatient hospital services furnished to an individual as an inpatient of a particular hospital during a spell of illness after such services have been furnished to the individual for 150 days as an inpatient of that hospital or of another hospital that has previously filed a request for payment for such services during such spell minus one day for each day of inpatient hospital services in excess of 90 received during any preceding spell of illness. Requires the first hospital filing after Medicare payment for inpatient hospital services to be responsible for collecting the deductible. Repeals specified requirements relating to coverage of tuberculosis treatments. Eliminates utilization review requirements. Eliminates the requirement for a separate Railroad Retirement Board carrier contract. Authorizes the United States to bring an action directly against a third party payer (workmen's compensation, automobile, or other insurance plan) for Medicare payments. Prohibits a provider from receiving payment for custodial services or for services not reasonable and necessary. Permits SMI payments to be made to an entity: (1) which provides coverage of the service under a health benefits plan; (2) which has paid the person who provided the service the amount which that person has accepted as payment in full for the service; and (3) to which the individual has agreed in writing that payment may be made.

Prohibits Medicare payment to any physician convicted of Medicare or Medicaid (title XIX of the Act) related crimes. Authorizes the Secretary to deny participation in the Medicare program to any provider: (1) convicted of Medicare or Medicaid related crimes; (2) against whom a Medicare or Medical related civil penalty has been assessed; or (3) to whom Medicare payments have been denied due to knowingly and willfully making a false statement or representation related to Medicare participation. Authorizes the Secretary to terminate an agreement with a provider if any individual who directly or indirectly owns or controls five percent or more of the provider's business has been convicted of certain Medicare or Medicaid related offenses. Authorizes the Secretary to use accrediting organizations to determine whether rural health clinics, laboratories, clinics, rehabilitation agencies, and public health agencies meet Medicare requirements.

Requires a State to obtain from each Medicaid applicant or recipient his or her taxpayer identification number. Repeals the requirement that Medicaid management information systems provide written notice to each Medicaid recipient of the services furnished. Requires instead, that each State provide for an effective method of verifying whether services billed by all participating providers were furnished as claimed. Authorizes the Secretary to waive or modify any Medicaid requirement with respect to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, or the Northern Mariana Islands (currently, the Secretary has this authority only with respect to American Samoa), other than a waiver of the Federal medical assistance percentage, the ceiling on total federal payments, or services for which medical assistance may be provided.
