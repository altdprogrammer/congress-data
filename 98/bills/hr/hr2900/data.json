    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-05-04", 
    "text": "Atmospheric, Climatic, and Ocean Pollution Act of 1983 - Title I: Declaration of Findings and Purposes - Sets forth the findings and purposes of Congress concerning the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Title II: General Program Authorizations and Reporting Requirements - Authorizes appropriations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department of Commerce for FY 1984 and 1985 in the following categories: (1) ocean research; (2) atmospheric programs; (3) satellite and environmental data and information services; and (4) the National Climate Program Office. Prohibits the transfer of funds among categories in excess of ten percent of the funds authorized unless Congress is given 30 days written notice or each committee having jurisdiction transmits a notice of no objection to the Administrator. Directs the Administrator to keep all appropriate committees informed of the activities of NOAA. Requires the Administrator to include a report in the annual budget request. Directs the Administrator to submit to Congress and the President with the FY 1985 budget request a report on the importance of meteorological satellites to weather forecasting, including lifetimes and replacement times for NOAA weather satellites. Prohibits the Secretary of Commerce from transferring ownership or management of any civil land, meteorological, or ocean remote sensing space satellite system and associated ground equipment until such Secretary presents to Congress a comprehensive plan and Congress then enacts a law containing necessary procedures and limitations. Earmarks funds for the continuation of a civil land remote sensing satellite system if no alternative is implemented. Directs the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National Research Council of the Academies of Science and Engineering to conduct a study of the National Weather Service and related activities. Requires the Administrator to report to Congress within six months on the NOAA's efforts to negotiate such study. Requires that a final report be made to Congress within two years. Authorizes appropriations for such study for FY 1984 and 1985. Title III: National Climate Program - National Climate Program Amendments of 1983 - Amends the National Climate Program Act to direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish and maintain an interagency Climate Program Policy Board (Board) to coordinate planning, review all executive branch budget requests relating to climate, and establish other groups as necessary. Establishes the position of Director to head the National Climate Program Office, represent the Board, and be the spokesperson for the program. Requires the Office to analyze agency budget requests, coordinate interagency participation in international climate-related activities, and work with the National Academy of Sciences and other groups in preparing and implementing the five-year climate plan. Permits the Office to provide financial assistance for activities needed to meet the goals of the program set forth in such plan. Expands the mechanisms for intergovernmental climate-related studies and services under the program. Requires that the plan be revised and extended not more than biennially but not less than quadrennially. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 and 1985. Requires that at least 25 percent of such authorizations be made available each fiscal year for intergovernmental climate-related activities and at least 20 percent for experimental climate forecast centers. Title IV: Ocean Pollution Research - Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to consolidate various reporting requirements into an annual report to Congress due each March. Includes within National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) long-term research activities: (1) techniques to define and quantify marine environment degradation; (2) assessment of marine adaptability; (3) continuation of ongoing monitoring programs; and (4) dumping improvements. Requires the Environmental Protection Agency: (1) in cooperation with Federal, State, and local agencies to study comprehensive regional waste management plans; and (2) in cooperation with NOAA, to report to Congress within one year on sewage sludge disposal options in the New York region. Authorizes FY 1984 and 1985 appropriations, including amounts for such New York study. Title V: Miscellaneous - Amends the National Ocean Pollution Planning Act of 1978 to authorize appropriations for FY 1984 and 1985 to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to carry out out such Act. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to provide at least 60 days notice to affected persons of any weather service office closure or consolidation. Sets forth the criteria the Secretary must use in making a determination, including the effect on the community served and the employees of the office. Requires the Secretary to keep written records of all aspects of such a determination. Requires any decision to close or consolidate to be in writing. Prohibits the Secretary from acting until 60 days have elapsed from the time the written decision is made available. Permits an affected State to sue for review of any such determination. Deems any determination or decision by the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to close or consolidate a Weather Service Office to have been made by the Secretary."
