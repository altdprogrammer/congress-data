Transfers to the Foundation; (1) the Patent and Trademark Office; (2) the National Bureau of Standards; (3) the National Technical Information Service; (4) the Office of Small Business Research and Development of the National Science Foundation; (5) the directorate for Engineering of the National Science Foundation; (6) any authorities of the Secretary of Commerce and the National Science Foundation under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980; and (7) other specified agency sections. Establishes specified offices within the Foundation to perform the functions of such organizations and other functions of the Foundation. Requires the Foundation to: (1) collect and analyze information on the availability of, and the current and projected need for, engineering, technical, and technology managerial resources in the United States; (2) support engineering, technical, and technological managerial training through grants, loans, or other assistance; (3) assist the establishment of Centers for Industrial Technology through specified means; (4) conduct technology assessments; (5) determine the relationships of technological developments and international technology transfers to the productivity, employment, and world trade performance of the United States and foreign industrial sectors; (6) develop improved indicators of the state of technology; (7) determine the influence of economic conditions and government policies on industrial innovation and the development of technology; (8) promote technology transfer from the Federal Government and private enterprise to State and local governments; (9) support applied research in engineering and other disciplines as necessary in the national interest; (10) promote United States interests in international voluntary standardization activities; and (11) promote technology transfer from the Federal Government to private enterprise. Establishes within the Foundation a National Technology Board to supervise and control the policy of the Foundation.

Sets forth the powers of the Director, including the exercise of authority over the transferred Federal divisions, the establishment and alteration of regional or field offices, and the transfer of funds within the Foundation. Eliminates the National Industrial Technology Board established by the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1986."
