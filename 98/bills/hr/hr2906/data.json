Establishes a program for visiting arms control and disarmament scholars to give specialists in the physical sciences and other disciplines relevant to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency's activities an opportunity to participate in the Agency's activities and to gain for the Agency the perspective and expertise such persons can offer. Earmarks a specified amount of the FY 1984 and 1985 authorized appropriations for such program. Requires the Agency's Director to attend all meetings of the National Security Council involving weapons procurement, arms sales, consideration of the defense budget, and all arms control and disarmament matters. Authorizes the Agency's Director to create up to eight new personnel positions for specialists in the Soviet foreign and military policies, arms control, or strategic affairs who are also fluent in Russian. Directs the President to report to Congress on the record of Soviet compliance or noncompliance with existing arms control agreements to which the Soviet Union is a party. Increases the number of Special Representatives for Arms Control and Disarmament Negotiations from one to two."
