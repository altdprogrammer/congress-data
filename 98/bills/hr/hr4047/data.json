    "text": "Robotics and Automated Manufacturing Systems Research and Education Act of 1983 - Establishes Centers for Industrial Technology, as described in the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, devoted to robotics and automated manufacturing. Requires each center to investigate a discrete segment of robotics and automated manufacturing systems. Sets forth areas of emphasis, including: (1) manufacturing process; (2) control system; (3) software development; and (4) human and economic factors associated with the introduction of robots and automated manufacturing systems into society. Requires at least one center to research products and processes which can be commercially developed within five years. Requires all centers to promote domestic technology transfer to private industry and the public sector through reports, meetings, and visiting scientists. Directs each center to coordinate its research activities with other centers. Requires the directors of the centers to meet at least annually. Establishes a Federal Research Center on Robotics and Automated Manufacturing at the National Bureau of Standards. Requires such Center to focus on measurements and standards required in robotics and automated manufacturing systems and on systems integration. Requires such Center to coordinate research with the Centers for Industrial Technology, including an annual meeting of all directors. Directs the National Science Foundation to provide grants for relevant research. Directs the Department of Commerce to promote limited research and development partnerships. Authorizes the National Science Foundation to support the education of professionals needed in robotics and automated manufacturing systems through graduate fellowships, traineeships, equipment, and other resources. Directs the National Research Council to establish a National Robotics and Automated Manufacturing Systems Program Review Board. Requires such Board to review all aspects of Federal involvement with robotics and automated manufacturing systems, including: (1) activities under this Act; (2) applicable tax laws; (3) the National Robot and Automated Manufacturing Systems Leasing Corporation; and (4) relevant activities of the Department of Defense and other agencies. Authorizes appropriations to the National Science Foundation and the Department of Commerce for FY 1984 through 1990 for the centers, board, limited partnerships, and education and training support established, authorized, and provided by this Act."
