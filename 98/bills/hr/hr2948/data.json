Sets limits on the amount of assistance which may be advanced. Requires the veteran to repay the advance with interest at the rate specified by the Administrator for veterans' guaranteed loans within 48 months. Makes the Administrator's decisions regarding advances final and nonreviewable. Terminates the advance program after two years. Authorizes the Administrator to make guaranteed loans to eligible veterans for manufactured homes permanently affixed to a lot. Permits the Administrator to exclude from the computation of a veteran's aggregate guaranty or insurance entitlement any amount taken over by any veteran-transferee, not just an immediate veteran-transferee, who consents to use his own entitlement. Extends by five years, through FY 1989, the Administrator's grants to States to assist in the establishment or improvement of State veterans' cemeteries. Authorizes the Administrator to make contributions to local authorities for the construction of traffic controls or other improvements or devices necessary for safe ingress to or egress from a national cemetery."
