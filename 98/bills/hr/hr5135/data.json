Limits the amount of the deductible home care expenses to $10,000 for one individual requiring care, and $15,000 for two or more such individuals. Limits the amount of the deductible dependent care center expenses to $5,000 for one individual, and $7,500 for two or more individuals. Sets forth rules relating to the deduction of employment expenses for dependent care in joint-employment agreement and shared-expense agreement situations. Provides that if a taxpayer elects the employment expense deduction for certain amounts, such amounts are not allowable for the dependent care credit or the medical expense deduction."
