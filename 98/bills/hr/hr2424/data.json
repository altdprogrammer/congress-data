Prohibits any dealer from selling, delivering or transferring any body armor to any person not licensed under the Act unless such transferee appears in person and submits a sworn statement prescribed by the Attorney General. Mandates a 21-day waiting period before the sale of body armor during which an investigation of the transferee shows that the transfer of body armor to that prospective buyer would not violate any Federal, State or local law."
