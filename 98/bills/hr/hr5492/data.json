    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act - Requires the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to: (1) decide in 1985 whether each coastal State has adopted all regulatory measures necessary to implement the Interstate Fisheries Management Plan for Striped Bass (Plan) and to notify the Secretaries of Commerce and of the Interior (the Secretaries) of any negative decision; and (2) biannually monitor, beginning in 1985, and report to the Secretary on the enforcement of the Plan by such States. Requires the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) upon notification of a negative decision by the Commission: (1) to determine, within 30 days, whether a coastal State is in compliance with the Plan; and (2) if such coastal State is not in compliance, to declare a moratorium on fishing for Atlantic striped bass within the coastal waters of the offending State. Requires the Secretary, in making a determination that a coastal State is not in compliance with the Plan, to consider the comments of the Commission, such coastal State, and the Secretary of the Interior. Lists activities which are prohibited during such moratorium (including the failure to return Atlantic striped bass caught incidental to commercial or recreational harvesting). Sets forth civil penalties for noncompliance with the provisions of this Act. Declares that any vessel connected with a violation shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States. Grants jurisdiction to the United States district courts over civil forfeitures. Directs the Secretaries to jointly conduct a comprehensive annual survey of the Atlantic striped bass fisheries. Requires the Secretaries, within a specified time, to review the existing Plan and to report to the Commission and to certain congressional committee chairmen on the adequacy of the Plan. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 for this Act (including specified appropriations to the Secretary for FY 1986 and 1987 to be divided between the States of Maryland and Virginia, under certain conditions, for the propagation of stripped bass in existing hatcheries). Defines certain terms used in this Act (including \"Atlantic striped bass\", \"coastal waters\", \"fishing\", and \"Plan\"). Provides beginning and ending effective dates for the above provisions. Amends the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act to extend the authorization of appropriations for the stripped bass population study through 1986. Amends Federal law to increase the amount available to the Secretary of the Army for the Falls of Ohio National Wildlife Conservation Area in Kentucky."
