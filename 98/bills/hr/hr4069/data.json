Requires farmers, in order to qualify for 1984 price support assistance, to reduce their planted acreage by 15 percent under a combined acreage reduction (ten percent) and diversion (five percent) program. Requires the diverted land to be used for conservation purposes. Sets the program signup date at not earlier than March 30, 1984. Provides, with regard to the 1984 diversion program, payments of not less than $2.00 per bushel, except that the Secretary may reduce such payments by up to ten percent if appropriate to meet program objectives. Requires advance payments of at least 50 percent. Provides for 1984 feed gain advance deficiency payments."
