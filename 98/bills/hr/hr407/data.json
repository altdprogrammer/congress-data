Directs the Small Business Administration to help grantees with rapid implementation of such programs in periods of high unemployment. Requires grantees to use small business concerns and contractors whenever feasible. Establishes formulae for payment to the Treasury of proceeds from the sale of trees and forestry products under this program.
