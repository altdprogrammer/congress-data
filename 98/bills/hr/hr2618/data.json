Sets limits on the amount of assistance which may be advanced. Requires the veteran to repay the advance with interest at the rate specified by the Administrator for veterans' guaranteed loans within 54 months. States that if the veteran defaults on the mortgage despite the advances made, the advances do not reduce the obligation of the Administrator under the guaranty on the primary mortgage. Specifies that advances be made from the Direct Loan Revolving Fund established for veterans' loans. Makes the Administrator's decisions regarding advances final and nonreviewable. Terminates the advance program after two years."
