    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-04-25", 
    "text": "Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act) to revise provisions relating to research on harmful effects on the health and welfare of persons caused by pollutants in water. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct such research in conjunction with other Federal, State, and interstate agencies carrying on such research. Requires that such research include, and place special emphasis on, the effect that bioaccumulation of these pollutants has upon reducing the value of aquatic commercial and sport industries. Requires that such research further study methods to reduce and remove these pollutants from the relevant affected aquatic species so as to restore and enhance valuable resources. Authorizes additional appropriations for such research for FY 1985 through 1988. Revises provisions relating to limitations and conditions on grants for the construction of publicly owned water treatment works. Directs the Administrator, before approving grants for proposed treatment works, to determine that: (1) an approved areawide waste treatment management plan is being fully implemented for such area and the proposed treatment works are included in such plan; and (2) the State in which the project is to be located is fully implementing an approved plan under specified provisions for water quality standards, the proposed treatment works are in conformity with such plan, and such State is in compliance with specified provisions for State reports on water quality. Revises provisions for permits under the national pollutant discharge elimination system. Increases from five years to ten years the maximum period such permits may cover, but requires review of each permit after five years to determine whether: (1) the receiving waters of discharges to which such permit applies are in compliance with applicable water quality standards and with any applicable effluent limitation controlling the thermal component of discharges; and (2) the permit is in conformity with applicable plans for areawide waste treatment management and for State implementation of water quality standards. Requires revision of such permit as necessary to: (1) ensure reasonable progress, not inconsistent with a timetable for achievement of water quality objectives, toward compliance of such waters with such standards and of such permit with such plans; and (2) achieve compliance with such limitation within a reasonable period of time by modifying requirements applicable to the thermal component of discharges from the point source in a manner proportionate to the contribution of the point source to the receiving waters (as determined by the Administrator, or if appropriate the State, based upon the findings under specified provisions for identification of areas with insufficient controls and estimation of total maximum daily thermal load). Revises the definition of \"point source\" to include any leachate collection system. Defines the terms \"balanced, indigenous community,\" \"balanced, indigenous population,\" and \"balanced population\" to mean an ecological community which: (1) is typically characterized by diversity; (2) retains the capacity to sustain itself through cyclic seasonal changes; (3) contains the presence of necessary food chain species; (4) is not dominated by pollution-tolerant species; (5) exhibits characteristics similar to those of nearby, healthy communities existing under comparable but unpolluted environmental conditions; and (6) may reasonably be expected to become reestablished in the polluted water body segment from adjacent waters if sources of pollution are removed. Provides that such definition shall not affect any permit in effect on the date of enactment of this Act or the issuance of any permit for which an application was received by the Administrator before January 1, 1984."
