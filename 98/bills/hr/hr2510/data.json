    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Energy and Commerce with amendment, H. Rept. 98-103(Part II)) Authorizes appropriations for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for FY 1984 and 1985. Allocates funds for: (1) nuclear reactor regulations, including gas-cooled thermal reactor preapplication review; (2) inspection and enforcement; (3) nuclear material safety and safeguards; (4) nuclear regulatory research, including gas-cooled thermal reactor safety research; (5) program technical support; and (6) program direction and administration. Provides that in the event of a termination of the Clinch River Breeder Reactor project: (1) unused funds appropriated for licensing review work for such project may be used only for safety technology activities; and (2) unused funds appropriated for fast breeder reactor safety research may be used generally for nuclear regulatory research. Prohibits the use of funds authorized to be appropriated under this Act for the development of a long-term nuclear powerplant safety systems plan. Limits the NRC's authority to enter into grants and cooperative agreements with universities to not more than one percent of the amount authorized to be appropriated for nuclear regulatory research. Prohibits the NRC from reprogramming the funds authorized to be appropriated for any activity under this Act so that an increase or decrease in excess of $500,000 in the funds of any program results, unless: (1) a period of 30 calendar days passes after notice of such reprogramming has been sent to specified congressional committees; or (2) such committees transmit within such 30-day period a written notice that they have no objection to such reprogramming. Authorizes the NRC to use funds received for the cooperative nuclear research program and for the material access authorization program to pay salaries and expenses under such programs. Authorizes the NRC to transfer sums from the amounts appropriated under this Act to other Government agencies which perform the work for which such appropriations were made. Requires the NRC to use funds authorized to be appropriated under this Act to prepare for Congress a report containing: (1) NRC findings under phase I and II of the systematic evaluation program plus a statement of regulatory action taken; (2) a statement of the cost of the program; and (3) an explanation of NRC policy regarding the need to carry out phase III of the program. Prohibits the use of funds authorized to be appropriated under this Act to carry out phase III of the systematic evaluation program until 60 days after the submission of such report to Congress. Authorizes the NRC to use funds authorized to be appropriated under this Act, in the absence of a State or local emergency preparedness plan, to issue an operating license for a nuclear reactor if there is no danger from the operation of the facility to the public health and safety. Makes funds available for the interim consolidation of NRC headquarters staff offices. Prohibits the use of funds under this Act in connection with the interim consolidation of the NRC outside the District of Columbia. Prohibits the use of funds authorized to be appropriated under this Act to carry out any policy or program for the decentralization or regionalization of NRC authorities regarding nuclear reactor licensing until 60 days after the NRC submits to Congress an evaluation of the effect of such policy or program on nuclear reactor safety. Permits the NRC to use funds authorized to be appropriated under this Act to issue temporary operating licenses for nuclear facilities required to be licensed under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Permits the NRC to use funds authorized to be appropriated under this Act to issue temporary operating licenses for nuclear facilities required to be licensed under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954."
