Revises venue requirements to permit the bringing of a civil action in the judicial district in which either: (1) a substantial part of the events occurred which prompted the action; or (2) a substantial part of the property involved is located. Directs the Judicial Conference of the United States to report to the Congress on the effects of this Act."
