    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Foster Care and SSI Amendments of 1984 - Title I: Foster Care Assistance and Regional Child Welfare Resource Centers - Amends the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 and part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act to extend for one year: (1) Federal payments for dependent children voluntarily placed in foster care; and (2) provisions permitting a State to use part E funds for services under part B (Child Welfare Services) of title IV. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for the establishment or continuation of a network of Child Welfare Resource Centers to help in the implementation of programs relating to child welfare under part B and programs relating to foster care and adoption assistance under part E. Directs the Secretary to provide the necessary funding for the Centers from: (1) certain funds which remain unclaimed by States under part E; and (2) such sums as may be appropriated for the Centers. Title II: SSI Amendments - Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act to exclude from income: (1) unearned income received in-kind in the form of real or personal property, if such property qualifies for an evaluation from resources; (2) interest and dividend income, to the extent that such income is derived from resources not exceeding countable resource limits; (3) certain non-recurring income received by applicants; and (4) reparations received by holocaust survivors. Permits the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in order to avoid undue hardship, to suspend the penalty imposed for transferring assets at less than fair market value. Removes limitations on the exclusion of an automobile from resources. Exempts from the one-third benefit reduction applicable to applicants receiving in-kind assistance an individual: (1) who states that, upon receipt of SSI benefits, he or she will pay his or her pro rata share of the household expenses; and (2) whose pro rata share of expenses does not exceed two-thirds of the SSI benefit amount. Increases from $300 to $420 annually for an individual and from $600 to $840 annually for a couple the SSI benefit standard for institutionalized recipients. Provides for the payment of retroactive benefits due deceased recipients to: (1) any surviving spouse; or (2) the parent or parents of a disabled or blind child. Exempts, under title XVI, individuals between the ages of 60 and 65 from filing for title II benefits (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Act, if the receipt of such benefits would render the SSI applicant or recipient ineligible for SSI benefits. Reduces from three months to six months the time that an SSI individual and an eligible spouse must be separated before being treated as individuals for purpose of SSI benefits and eligibility. Extends the interim assistance payment program to provide reimbursement to a State which has assisted an SSI recipient whose benefits have been terminated or suspended, but has appealed such termination or suspension, won the appeal, and qualified for retroactive benefits. Directs the Secretary and the Comptroller General to each study, analyze, and report to Congress concerning the effective enforcement of standards for institutions, foster homes, and group living arrangements in which a significant number of SSI recipients reside. Increases the emergency advance payments for presumptively eligible individuals from $100 to the amount of the monthly benefit to which an individual is presumptively entitled. Sets forth specific instructions which require the Secretary, when sending a notice of overpayment to an SSI recipient, to write such notice in clear and understandable language. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a full and complete study of the feasibility of extending SSI to Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa; and (2) report to Congress the results of such study together with any recommendations. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish and conduct an ongoing program designed to provide information about SSI benefits to individuals who are not currently receiving such benefits; and (2) submit to Congress reports concerning the program. Requires the Secretary to take certain steps to assure that all forms, notices, pamphlets, and other documents issued for use by SSI applicants or recipients are readily understandable and contain all necessary information. Provides blind SSI applicants or recipients with the opportunity to receive SSI notices by telephone or certified letter. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on extending such notification opportunities to other individuals who may lack the ability to read and comprehend regular written notices."
