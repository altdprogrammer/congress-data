    "text": "Uniform Marine Recreational Fishing Licensing Act of 1983 - Prohibits persons between the ages of 16 and 62 from engaging in fishing for recreation in tidal waters without a marine recreational fishing license, except persons fishing from a licensed vessel or licensed fishing pier. Prohibits any vessel from transporting marine recreational fishermen for a fee without a marine recreational fishing vessel license. Prohibits the charging of a fee for the privilege of fishing from a pier without obtaining a marine recreational fishing pier license. Declares that, except as provided in this Act, no State or political subdivision may establish, continue in effect, or enforce any law or regulation which establishes a marine recreational fishing license or marine recreational fishing vessel license. Sets forth provisions to be incorporated in State marine recreational licensing programs before such programs can be approved by the Secretary of the department in which the National Marine Fisheries Service is operating. Requires the Secretary to make Federal marine recreational fishing licenses available only in States which do not have such programs. Sets forth penalties for violations of this Act and enforcement provisions. Requires all funds derived from the sale of Federal marine recreational fishing licenses be used for scientific research and habitat enforcement programs having direct benefits to marine recreational fishing. Authorizes appropriations."
