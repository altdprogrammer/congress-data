    "as": "House agreed to Senate amendment with amendment", 
    "date": "1983-09-26", 
    "text": "(House agreed to Senate amendment with an amendment) Fur Seal Act Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Fur Seal Act of 1966 to define specified terms for purposes of such Act, including \"Natives of the Pribilof Islands\" and \"Pribilof Islands.\" Defines \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Commerce. (Current law divides the duties under such Act between the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Treasury.) Permits Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos living on the North Pacific coasts to take and dispose of fur seals provided that the seals are taken for subsistence uses only and that the seals are taken in the traditional way. Permits Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos living on the Pribilof Islands to take fur seals for subsistence purposes under such conditions as recommended by the North Pacific Fur Seal Commission and accepted by the Secretary of State. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to prescribe regulations with respect to the taking of fur seals on the Pribilof Islands and on lands subject to U.S. jurisdiction and to dispose of any fur seals seized or forfeited pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with any agency or person in order to carry out the Interim Convention on the Conservation of North Pacific Fur Seals and the Fur Seal Act of 1966. Directs the Secretary to give preference to the village corporations of Saint Paul and Saint George Islands for the taking and processing of fur seals on the village corporations' respective islands. Requires that the proceeds from the fur seal harvest shall be deposited with the Secretary. Requires all seal harvests to be financed from proceeds collected in preceding years or unsold assets retained from harvests conducted in preceding years. Authorizes appropriations in the event such assets and proceeds are insufficient. Requires excess amounts to be transferred to the Treasury. Authorizes any person who is authorized to enforce the Fur Seal Act to board and search vessels outfitted for the harvesting of live marine resources and subject to the jurisdiction of any of the parties to the Convention if the enforcement official has reasonable cause to believe the vessel is violating provisions of article III of the Convention, unless the vessel is within areas in which another State exercises fisheries jurisdiction. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce or the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to administer the enforcement provisions. Authorizes the President to appoint one native from each of the two inhabited Pribilof Islands to serve as advisers and liaisons for the Commissioner of the North Pacific Fur Seal Commission. Authorizes the President to appoint other advisers to the Commissioner. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to administer the fur seal rookeries and other Federal property on the Pribilof Islands except for land purchased by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under a specified section of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act or acquired by any other authority after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, to ensure that activities on the islands are consistent with the purposes of conserving, managing, and protecting the North Pacific fur seals and other wildlife. Deletes the provision which gives the Secretary the right to enter into leases, contracts, agreements, or permits for the use of Government-owned property. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) operate, maintain, and repair such Government-owned property; and (2) provide Federal employees, at reasonable rates, with necessary facilities, services, and equipment, including food, fuel, shelter, and transportation. Declares that Alaska shall be responsible for meeting the educational needs of the citizens of the Pribilof Islands. Authorizes the Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, to convey all Federal property interest held by the Secretary on the Pribilof Islands if such property is specified in a document entitled \"Transfer of Property on the Pribilof Islands: Descriptions, Terms, and Conditions\" which is submitted to Congress by September 30, 1983. Lists information to be included in such document. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees within 60 days of the transfer of real or personal property listed in such document. Requires the Secretary, a representative of the local governmental authority on each island, the trustee or trustees, and the appropriate officer of the State of Alaska to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding setting forth the respective responsibilities of the Federal Government, the Pribilof Islands Trust, and the State regarding administration of the Islands. Requires the Memorandum to be submitted to Congress on or before October 31, 1983. Exempts from taxation transfers of property pursuant to the Secretary's authorization to transfer Federal property on the Pribilof Islands. Authorizes the Secretary, in carrying out the purposes of the Act, to enter into agreements, including land exchange agreements, with other Federal and State agencies and with third parties. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the status of negotiations for concluding the Transfer Document and the Memorandum of Understanding. Directs the Secretary to establish a Pribilof Islands Trust in order to promote the development of a stable, self-sufficient enduring and diversified economy not dependent on sealing. Prohibits the trustees from making any distributions, except limited interim distributions, from the Trust until 30 days after submission to the Congress of the Transfer Document and the Memorandum of Understanding. Permits such distributions only after the Secretary has determined that the Trust has been established and will be operated in accordance with an approved trust instrument. Lists matters which the Trust must address. Requires the Trust instrument to be submitted to Congress by October 14, 1983. Requires the Trust to be divided into two portions, one for the community of St. Paul and the other for the community of St. George. Authorizes appropriations for funding the Trust. Requires such appropriations to be invested by the trustee during the period during which no distributions shall be made. Requires the trustee or trustees to report annually to Congress on the activities of the Trust. Exempts from taxation the funds appropriated to the Trust and the earnings and distributions from the Trust, except that the exemption shall not apply to income from the investment of the distributions. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements or contracts or leases with, or to issue permits to agencies or persons to carry out the provisions of the Convention or the Fur Seal Act. Provides that one year of service shall be credited for civil service retirement purposes for each year in which a Pribilof Island native performs services in connection with the administration of the Pribilof Islands. Grants credit for civil service retirement purposes for time during which Aleuts who were U.S. citizens were interned during World War II. Amends the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to treat the communities of St. Paul and St. George the same as tribal organizations for purposes of continuity of civil service retirement benefits. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations to carry out the administration of the Pribilof Islands. Deletes the provisions of the Fur Seal Act dealing with the protection of sea otters on the high seas. Declares that enforcement of the Fur Seal Act is the joint responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. Sets forth penalties for violations of such Act. Authorizes appropriations to the operations, research and facilities account of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: (1) to pay for upgrading Federal property to be transferred pursuant to this Act; (2) to pay for scientific research on fur seal resources in the North Pacific; and (3) to reimburse the civil service retirement and disability fund for payments made by such fund to certain natives of the Pribilof Islands."
