    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-04-09", 
    "text": "Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1984 - Title I: Agricultural Programs - Incorporates by reference the conference report on H.R. 4072, the Wheat Improvement Act of 1983 (H. Report 98-646) dealing with: (1) price supports for wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice; (2) export assistance; and (3) agricultural credit. Title II: Civil Service and Military Retirement Programs - Limits the cost of living increase in the annuity or retired or retainer pay of a Government retiree for FY 1986 and 1987 to one-half of the increase that would otherwise be effective if: (1) the retiree is under 62 years of age as of the effective date of the increase; and (2) the annuity or retired or retainer pay is based on the retiree's Government service (but is not computed on the basis of a disability). Requires any survivor annuity which is based on the service of any such retiree to be computed as if this title had not been enacted. Title III: Health Programs - Medicare and Medicaid Budget Reconciliation Amendments of 1984 - Part A: Medicare Reconciliation Amendments - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a national fee schedule for diagnostic laboratory tests for which payment is made under part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act. Directs the Secretary to set the fee schedule at 60 percent of the prevailing charges paid under part B for similar diagnostic laboratory tests during the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1984. Directs the Secretary, in addition to the amounts provided under the fee schedule, to provide for and establish a nominal fee payable to cover the costs of collecting the sample in a diagnostic laboratory test. Provides for Medicare payment of the lesser of 80 percent (or 100 percent in the case of tests for which payment is made on the basis of an assignment or in the situation of the death of a beneficiary) of the amount determined by the Secretary or the amount of billed charges. Eliminates the part B deductible for laboratory tests paid on the basis of an assignment and in the case of payment on behalf of a deceased beneficiary. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) to provide for Medicaid coverage of laboratory tests to the extent such coverage is provided under Medicare. Provides for Medicare coverage of hepatitis B vaccine and its administration in a hospital or renal dialysis facility. Revises provisions under part B of title XVIII relating to payment for the services of a teaching physician to limit, for the purposes of determining the customary charge, the consideration of charges made by a physician outside of teaching to charges made by nonteaching physicians. Provides that if all the teaching physicians in the hospital agree to have payment made for all physicians' services under part B furnished patients in the hospital on the basis of an assignment, the carrier shall take into account the amounts otherwise payable under part B with respect to similar services in the same locality. Directs the Secretary to compile annually a list of physicians serving individuals enrolled under part B indicating the share of claims which each physician has accepted on an assignment basis in the preceding year. Directs the Secretary to: (1) publish annually a list of all physicians who have agreed to accept payment on the basis of an assignment; and (2) annually provide enrollees with a list of physicians in their area who accept assignments. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on methods by which payment amounts and other program policies under part B may be modified to: (1) eliminate inequities in the relative amounts paid to physicians by type of service, locality, and specialty; (2) increase incentives for physicians and other suppliers to accept assignments; and (3) provide incentives for physicians and other providers not to provide increased or otherwise excessive amounts of hospital, physician, and other health care services. Directs the Secretary, in order to carry out the study and facilitate congressional review, to compile a centralized Medicare part B charge data base utilizing information gathered by Medicare carriers and used by the carriers in making the 1984 reasonable charge updates. Directs the Secretary to issue revisions to the current guidelines for payment under part B for physicians' services for the transtelephonic monitoring of cardiac pacemakers. Requires such guidelines to include provisions regarding the specifications for and frequency of transtelephonic monitoring procedures which will be found reasonable and necessary. Directs the Secretary to: (1) review, and report to the appropriate congressional committees, regarding the appropriateness of the current rate of part B reimbursement for physicians' services associated with the implantation or replacement of pacemaker devices and pacemaker leads; and (2) consider reducing the recognized rates for such services by 20 percent. Directs the Secretary, through the Administrator of the Food and Drug Administration, to provide for a registry of all cardiac pacemaker devices and pacemaker leads for which payment was made under title XVIII. Directs the Secretary, in any case where the Secretary has reason to believe that replacement of a cardiac pacemaker device or lead for which Medicare payment is or may be requested is related to the malfunction of a device or lead, to require the testing of the device. Directs the Secretary to provide that payment will not be made under part B for a physician's debridement of mycotic toenails to the extent such debridement is performed more than once every 60 days, unless the medical necessity for more frequent treatment is documented by the physician. Allows payments to hospitals under part A (Hospital Insurance) of Medicare for the operation of mobile intensive care units if certain conditions are met. Provides for a freeze on the economic index used to limit prevailing charges for physician services provided to hospital inpatients. Requires physicians to accept Medicare assignment for all services provided to Medicare hospital inpatients for a specified period of time. Requires the Secretary, during such time, to report to the Congress on the advisability and feasibility of including payments for inpatient physician services in the DRG prospective payment legislation. Revises rules relating to Medicare provider agreements to require hospitals to obtain signed agreements from each doctor on its medical staff where the physician agrees to accept assignment for any Medicare beneficiary that he or she treats as an inpatient of that hospital. Provides for the appointment by the President (rather than by the Secretary of Health and Human Services) of the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration. Sets forth the pay level for the Administrator. Permits limited provider representation on peer review organizations (PRO's). Permits a physician who has a financial interest in an agency which is a sole community home health agency to carry out the certification and plan-of-care functions for patients who will receive services from the agency. Repeals certain special tuberculosis treatment requirements. Allows part B payments to be made to a health benefits plan, if the beneficiary agrees, and if the physician or supplier accepts the plan's payment as payment in full. Includes podiatrists in the definition of \"physician\" for outpatient physical therapy services. Includes podiatrists and dentists in the definition of \"physician\" for outpatient ambulatory surgery. Allows physical therapists to establish medicare qualified plans for physical therapy. Increases from $10,000 to $50,000 the minimum amount of any agreement between a medicare provider and a subcontractor before the Secretary or Comptroller General must have access to the subcontractor's records. Establishes the statutory right of Medicare to recover directly from a liable third party, if the beneficiary himself does not do so, and to pay a beneficiary, or on the beneficiary's behalf, pending recovery where such third party is not expected to pay promptly. Extends the Secretary's authority to rely on accrediting organizations in determining whether rural health clinics, laboratories, clinics, rehabilitation agencies, including outpatient rehabilitation facilities, and public health agencies meet Medicare requirements. Sets forth rules for the confidentiality of accreditation surveys. Limits coverage to 30 days for services furnished by a home health agency whose agreement has been terminated. Extends the Secretary's authority to exclude from Medicare participation (and to direct State agencies to exclude from Medicaid participation) any entity in which ownership or controlling interest is held by a person convicted of program-related criminal offenses, or in which an officer, director, agent, or managing employee was convicted of such criminal offense. Eliminates the Health Insurance Benefits Advisory Council. Requires the Secretary to designate one 30-day period in which all health maintenance organizations (HMO's) and competitive medical plans (CMP's) in an area participating in Medicare must have an open enrollment period. Specifies a deadline of July 1, 1985, for a report to Congress on including payment for physicians' services to hospital inpatients in DRG payment amounts. Authorizes the Secretary, if patient health and safety is not jeopardized, to apply less severe sanctions than are presently available for dealing with an end-stage renal disease facility which is not in compliance with applicable regulations. Makes the national end-stage renal disease medical information system discretionary with the Secretary. Removes the costs of nurse anesthetists from DRG-based payments. Sets forth rules for the determination of hospital area wage indexes. Revises the definition of bona fide emergency services for purposes of the limitations on payment for hospital outpatient services. Delays from October 1, 1983, to April 1, 1984, the effective date for single-rate for skilled nursing facilities. Part B: Medicaid Reconciliation Amendments - Provides that the Federal medical assistance percentage, under title XIX of the Social Security Act, shall be 100 percent with respect to amounts expended as medical assistance for services furnished to a \"qualified pregnant woman or child.\" Defines a qualified pregnant woman or child as an individual who was not eligible for categorically needy coverage under Medicaid as of June 30, 1983, and who is: (1) under five years of age and who meets Aid to Families with Dependent Children (part A of title IV of the Social Security Act) requirements but does not receive cash payments and is a categorically needy individual; or (2) a pregnant woman who, at the State's option, may be deemed an AFDC recipient for Medicaid purposes or who is a member of a family which would be eligible for AFDC if the State's AFDC plan required payment of aid with respect to dependent children deprived of parental support by reason of the unemployment of a parent who is the principal earner. Authorizes a State's Medicaid plan to not take into account the financial responsibility of any individual for an applicant or recipient who is a pregnant woman under 21 who does not have legal custody over other children, unless the applicant or recipient is the individual's spouse, except that a State may limit the applicability of this provision to applicants and recipients living in such an individual's household or in a custodial institution for pregnant women. Provides that a child born to a woman eligible for and receiving Medicaid as of the child's birth shall be deemed to have applied for medical assistance and been found eligible for assistance on the child's birth date and shall remain eligible for assistance for one year so long as the child is a member of the women's household and the woman remains eligible for assistance. Revises Medicaid provisions relating to medically needy income levels. Provides that in the case of a family consisting of only two individuals both of whom are adults and at least one of whom is aged, blind, or disabled, the term \"highest amount which would ordinarily be paid to a family of the same size\" under the State's plan approved under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act shall, at the State's option, be the amount determined by the State to be the amount of aid which would ordinarily be payable under such plan to a family which consists of one adult and two children and which is without any income or resources. Revises Medicaid provisions relating to the recertification of need for stays in skilled nursing and intermediate care facilities. Requires recertifications for intermediate care facility patients to occur on or before 60 days of admission, six, 12, 18, and 24 months afterwards, and annually thereafter. Requires recertifications for skilled nursing facility patients to occur on or before 30, 60, and 90 days of admission, and every 60 days thereafter. Revises the penalty formula for noncompliance with the recertification requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to modify or waive the requirement which limits the total combined Medicare and Medicaid membership to 75 percent for a health maintenance organization if the organization: (1) is a nonprofit organization with at least 25,000 members; (2) is and has been a qualified health maintenance organization for at least four years; (3) provides basic health services through members of the staff of the organization; (4) is located in a medically underserved area; and (5) previously received a membership requirement waiver. Prohibits Medicaid copayments for prescribed drugs. Increases the maximum amount of Medicaid payments available to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.
