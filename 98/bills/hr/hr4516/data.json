Designates the following lands in Utah as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Mount Naomi Wilderness in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest; (2) the Wellsville Mountain Wilderness in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest; (3) the Mount Olympus Wilderness in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest; (4) the Twin Peaks Wilderness in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest; (5) the High Uintas Wilderness in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest; (6) the Mount Timpanogos Wilderness in the Uinta National Forest; (7) the Mount Nebo Wilderness in the Uinta National Forest; (8) the Dark-Woodenshoe Canyon Wilderness in the Manti-LaSal National Forest; (9) the Ashdown Gorge Wilderness in the Dixie National Forest; (10) the Box-Death Hollow Wilderness in the Dixie National Forest; and (11) the Pine Valley Wilderness in the Dixie National forest. Abolishes the previous classifications of the Mount Timpanogos Scenic Area and the High Uintas Primitive Area. Title II: Release of Lands for Multiple Use Management - Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental impact statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Utah shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands not designated as wilderness by this Act by a prior Act of Congress from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from conducting any further roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Utah without express congressional authorization. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to review the Department of Agriculture's policies and regulations regarding livestock grazing in national forest wilderness areas in Utah in order to ensure compliance with the Wilderness Act and this Act. Requires that valid grazing rights be maintained in such wilderness areas. Permits the limited use of motorized equipment for the maintenance of livestock and emergency facilities related to grazing activities in such wilderness areas. Sets forth requirements with respect to water rights and buffer zones. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to continue to make assessments of the mineral potential of the wilderness areas in Utah. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to allow limited motorized access to wilderness areas in Utah by Federal, State, and local governmental agencies and educational institutions for the purposes of conducting essential surveys and tests in such areas."
