Defines \"soil conservation acres\" as land owned by the taxpayer which is used in farming in which only conservation tillage practices are used (procedures which reduce soil erosion by minimizing the amount of plowing). Reduces the credit by the amount of government grants received for the purpose of carrying out conservation tillage practices."
