Prohibits any State or local government from prohibiting or regulating the discharge of sewage in waters of such State from any such vessel, with the following exception. Permits a State to prohibit the discharge of sewage which has not been treated with a marine sanitation device meeting specified Federal standards and regulations from such a vessel which is equipped with installed toilet facilities, but makes any such State prohibition inapplicable to a vessel registered in another State while such vessel is engaged in interstate travel."
