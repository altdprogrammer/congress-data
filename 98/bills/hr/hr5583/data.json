    "text": "Automobile Fuel Efficiency Amendments of 1984 - Title I: Amendments to Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act - Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to consult with the Secretary of Energy before establishing testing and calculation procedures for measuring automobile fuel economy. Authorizes (currently, directs) the Administrator to require fuel economy tests in conjunction with emissions tests conducted under the Clean Air Act. Directs the Administrator to measure a sampling of production passenger automobiles for each model type and year during the first month of manufacture for sale. Requires the adjustment of average fuel economy standards when necessary. Requires manufacturers to reflect any changes in such standards on automobile labels not more than 90 days after such changes are available. Requires that Federal testing and calculation procedures be repeated over a period of years to monitor automobile performance in use to determine the extent of decline in fuel economy. Directs the Administrator to periodically review procedures for testing fuel economy. Increases fuel economy standards for model years 1988 through 1995 and thereafter. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation, by rule, to amend such standards to a level determined feasible. Establishes the average fuel economy standard for automobiles which are not passenger automobiles (light trucks) for model years 1988 through 1995 and thereafter. Exempts manufacuturers of less than 10,000 light trucks per year from such standards. Conditions such exemption upon the Secretary's establishing alternative standards. Directs the President to promulgate rules requiring light trucks used by the Federal government to meet average fuel economy standards. Directs the Administrator to update the booklet containing fuel economy data at least twice a year. Directs the Secretary of Energy to distribute at least 100 booklets each year to each dealer and additional amounts if requested. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to award fuel efficiency incentive grants to States which have in effect qualified revenue- raising measures designed to encourage automobile fuel efficiency. Vests jurisdiction in the U.S. district courts for injunctive enforcement of labeling and mileage guide requirements. Directs the Secretary, within two years of enactment of this Act, to submit suggestions to Congress for additional legislation to carry out its purposes and the purposes of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act. Requires the Director of the Office of Technology Assessment to determine whether manufacturers are likely to comply with the revised average fuel economy standards without new incentives. Requires the Director to suggest cost-effective incentives if necessary to assure compliance. Requires the Secretary to promulgate test procedures for determining the relative fuel economy of automobile tires. Directs the Secretary to prescribe labeling rules applicable to all tires for which test procedures are established and requires manufacturers to comply with such rules. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of such labeling requirements and vests jurisdiction in the U.S. district courts to restrain such violations. Title II: Amendments to Internal Revenue Code of 1954 Relating to Compliance With Average Fuel Economy Standards by Automobile Manufacturers - Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to impose a low average fuel economy excise tax on automobile manufacturers for model years 1988, 1991, and 1995. Allows a credit against such fuel economy tax for manufacturers who exceed the average fuel economy standard. Sets forth conforming amendments for provisions of this title."
