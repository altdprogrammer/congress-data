Limits such exemption to: (1) files of the Directorate of Operations which document foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, security liaison arrangements, or information exchanges with foreign governments; (2) files of the Directorate of Science and Technology which document the means by which foreign intelligence or counterintelligence is collected through scientific and technical systems; or (3) files of the Office of Security which document investigations of potential intelligence or counterintelligence sources. Requires the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency to promulgate regulations to implement this Act. Provides a procedure for judicial review by the district court of an alleged improper withholding of record pursuant to the statutory exemption."
