    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Government Operations with amendment, H. Rept. 98-1157) Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 - Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to modify Federal contracting procedures set forth in the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 contained in the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-369). Requires each executive agency to allow and encourage the maximum number of sources to submit sealed bids or competitive proposals before entering into any contract for the procurement of property or services. Differentiates requirements for use of limited competition and noncompetitive practices in procurement. (Currently such requirements apply to \"other than competitive\" procurement procedures.) Requires an agency to receive approval by the head of the procurement activity or the senior procurement executive of the contracting officer's certified justification for a procurement before awarding a contract using limited competition or noncompetitive practices, respectively, for any procurement costing more than $500,000. Authorizes an agency to conduct a procurement using noncompetitive practices when the agency's need results from an emergency in which the public health or safety would be seriously injured by soliciting bids or proposals from more than one responsible source. Requires an agency to determine that only one source exists before that agency may use noncompetitive practices. Requires an agency, except when using noncompetitive practices, to ensure that it receives a sufficient number of bids or proposals to assure that its requirements are filled at the lowest possible cost. Specifies conditions under which an agency may use a \"qualified product\" list in procurement. Requires an agency to take steps to maximize competition and to insure that small and socially and economically disadvantaged businesses are not precluded from performing as prime contractors and subcontractors on contracts for the production or assembly of spare parts. Requires publication of a procurement notice concerning the award of a contract at a price exceeding $10,000 (currently $25,000). Provides for suspension of performance of a contract (including a contract for procurement of automatic data processing equipment for which a protest has been filed within 30 (currently 10) days after the contract has been awarded. Declares that the failure of any party to make a filing concerning a protest within the specified period may be taken as an admission of the contentions made by an opposing party. Requires an agency's advocate for competition to provide an anlysis of each proposal for a noncompetitive procurement costing more than $500,000 to the agency's senior procurement executive before such executive approves such proposal. Requires an agency's computerized procurement records to identify the agency officer or employee who approved the use of noncompetitive or limited competition procedures in an agency procurement."
