Requires that 50 percent of such vessels' cargo be non-security related. Requires that at least 10 percent of all cargo subject to this Act be routed to each of the four coasts (Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf, and Great Lakes). Makes certain exceptions when no U.S.-flag vessel is available at competitive rates, and when a declared emergency exists. Sets forth directives for agency compliance with this Act and repeals specified laws to conform to its provisions."
