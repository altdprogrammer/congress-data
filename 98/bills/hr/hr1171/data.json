    "text": "United States Export Market Expansion Act of 1983 - Amends the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to formulate and carry out a program under which agricultural commodities and products acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation (the Corporation) are made available, for export without charge, to U.S. exporters and users and foreign purchasers in order to promote export markets for such commodities and products. Requires the Secretary to: (1) ensure that equal treatment is provided to domestic and foreign purchasers and users in cases where the importation of a manufactured product made from agricultural commodities, made available for export under this Act, would place domestic users of such commodity at a competitive disadvantage; (2) consider all interested foreign purchasers for participation, giving priority to those who have purchased U.S. agricultural commodities in the past and who continue to do so in increased quantities; (3) ensure that agricultural commodities, made available for export under this Act, be used to encourage increased use of such commodities and to avoid unnecessary market displacement of domestic agricultural commodities; and (4) take reasonable precautions to prevent resale, transshipment or any use of such commodities other than domestic use in the importing country. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to include other agricultural commodities and products (currently only dairy products), acquired by the Corporation, as donations for distributions to needy persons outside the United States. Requires such donations to be coordinated with other U.S. foreign assistance through a specified mechanism. Encourages the Secretary to donate abroad or sell for export at least 50,000 metric tons of Corporation-owned dairy products during each of FY 1983-85. Requires the Secretary to report semiannually, through FY 1985, to Congress on the status of such sales or donations. Authorizes the sale of extra long staple cotton, held by the Corporation, at such prices determined appropriate by the Secretary in order to maintain and expand export and domestic markets for such cotton. Requires the Secretary to encourage the consumption of commodities made available at no cost through agreements with private companies under which the commodity is processed into end products for use by eligible recipients. Requires such recipients to bear the expense of processing."
