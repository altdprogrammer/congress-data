    "text": "Title I: Alcohol and Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services - Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for alcohol and drug abuse and mental health services block grants. Sets aside at least ten percent of such fiscal year appropriations for alcohol and drug abuse services for women and for mental health services for severely disturbed children and adolescents. Limits Federal assistance to 80 percent of a project's costs. Bases State allotments on population and per capita income. Sets minimum State allotments at 1984 levels. Permits direct grant payments to Indian tribes or tribal organizations. Sets aside at least ten percent of mental health appropriations for establishing new community mental health centers or providing services through existing centers. Requires participating States to: (1) make funds available for local mental health centers through FY 1987; (2) collect data on alcohol and drug abuse and mental illness; (3) establish a State mental health services planning council to serve as an advocate for the mentally ill and monitor the State comprehensive mental health plan; and (4) develop a comprehensive mental health plan. Establishes the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Strategy Council to periodically assess and advise regarding the national needs for alcohol and drug abuse services and mental health services and the extent to which such needs are being met by existing programs. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants for demonstration projects, data collection, and technical assistance. Requires the Secretary to make grants to medical, nursing, and other graduate schools for training in the identification and treatment of alcohol and drug abuse. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for alcohol and drug abuse research. Requires the Secretary to present to Congress by April 15, 1985, a comprehensive national plan to combat alcoholism and alcohol abuse. Repeals title III of the Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act. Amends the definition of \"detoxification treatment\" under the Controlled Substances Act to increase the maximum number of treatment days from 21 to 180. Requires the Secretary to promulgate related implementing regulations within 90 days. Title II: Developmental Disabilities Assistance - Amends the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act to increase authorizations of appropriations for FY 1984, and authorize appropriations for FY 1985 through 1988 for: (1) the protection and advocacy of individual rights, including related reports; (2) university affiliated demonstration and training grants; (3) State allotments; and (4) other demonstration projects which have national significance or are conducted in more than one State or involve more than one Federal agency or department. Includes: (1) prevention activities within the definition of \"services for persons with developmental disabilities\"; and (2) certain entities providing training or disseminating information within the definition of \"satellite center.\" Requires the: (1) Secretary to report annually to Congress regarding State activities funded under such Act, and to make such report public; and (2) States to report annually to the Secretary. Requires States to provide assurances to the Secretary that the implementing agency will not be redesignated unless there is good cause for such action and unless notice has been given to affected developmentally-disabled persons or their representatives. Increases minimum university affiliated facility grants from $150,000 to $200,000. Makes the existing $75,000 minimum satellite center grant effective for all such centers. Revises State and territorial allotment provisions. Requires State application plans to provide for manpower assessment activities. Limits funds for such purposes to not more than ten percent of priority service funds."
