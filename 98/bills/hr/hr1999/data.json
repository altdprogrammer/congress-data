Authorizes appropriations for the purposes of such Act for FY 1984 and 1985. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to give priority consideration to redevelopment areas that have been classified as labor surplus areas by the Secretary of Labor. Reduces the time period during which the Secretary of Commerce may terminate a designation of area eligibility to one year (currently three years). Repeals provisions concerning: (1) Indian economic development; (2) economic recovery assistance for disaster areas; and (3) the job opportunities program. Redefines \"eligible recipient\" to exclude Indian tribes. Amends the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 to authorize appropriations for the purposes of the Appalachian Regional Commission through FY 1984. Extends the provisions of such Act through FY 1984."
