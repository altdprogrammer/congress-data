    "text": "Consumer Product Safety Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1984-1988. Requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission) to employ no fewer than the full-time equivalent of 650 officers and employees and maintain at least 10 field offices. Requires the Commission to take reasonable steps to assure the accuracy of information when it initiates public disclosure of information which reflects adversely on the safety of a consumer product. Specifies under what conditions the Commission may disclose information in a case involving substantial product hazard. Exempts written opinions by a member of the Commission respecting his or her vote on any Commission decision from the provisions regarding public disclosure of information. Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Federal Hazardous Substance Act and the Flammable Fabrics Act to revise the procedures applicable to rules regarding labeling, or the revision or revocation of existing standards and regulations. Repeals the Interim Cellulose Insulation Safety Standard. Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to repeal the provision which limits the time period for a preliminary injunction. Authorizes the Commission to assess civil penalties in an administrative action. Provides that all products regulated by the Commission are subject to the reporting, notice and recall provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act. Repeals the termination date of the Toxicological Advisory Board, thus making it permanent. Amends the Flammable Fabrics Act to eliminate the requirement that a continuing guaranty be filed with the agency that reasonable and representative tests were conducted to show that the fabric or related material conforms with the applicable flammable standards."
