    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Federal Deposit Insurance Improvements Act of 1984 - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to allow the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to define any terms used in such Act which are not specifically defined by it, and to interpret the definitions of any terms that are so specifically defined. Allows any appointive director of the Corporation to serve in office after the expiration of his or her term until a successor has been appointed and qualified. Permits the Corporation to set the assessment credit for any insured bank on the basis of the risks that the bank may present to the Permanent Insurance Fund. Grants the Corporation enforcement powers over national and State member banks. Authorizes the Board of Directors of the Corporation to charge reasonable fees for the examinations of banks. Broadens the definition of \"affiliate\" to include subsidiaries of insured banks. Requires the Corporation to serve as a receiver for all closed insured banks. Sets priorities for payment of claims against the estate of a failed bank. States that the Corporation as receiver of a closed insured bank shall not be required to furnish bond and shall have the right to appoint agents to assist it in its duties as such receiver. Eliminates the requirement that banking agencies must seek reports from the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Requires the agencies to request such reports from the Attorney General. Drops the requirement that the Corporation must approve domestic bank branches in advance."
