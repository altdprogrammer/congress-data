Requires that the analysis contain conclusions regarding the impact of the proposed defense system on the public sector and other defense programs. Directs the Secretary to give preference to private contractors: (1) who are not (or whose employees do not include significant numbers of) retired military or retired civilian employees of the Department of Defense; and (2) who are not involved in research and development or production of weapons systems. Provides for a seven-member panel to review each proposed contract and determine the suitability of the proposed contractor. Prohibits the Secretary from awarding a contract to other than a contractor approved by the panel."
