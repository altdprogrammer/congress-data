    "text": "Chitimacha Claims Settlement Act - States that tribal lands transferred by the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana before passage of this Act shall be deemed to have been transferred in accordance with the Constitution and all Federal laws relating to Indian land transfers. Deems such transfers to have been made with congressional consent and approval. Extinguishes any tribal aboriginal title transferred with such congressional consent. Extinguishes, as of the date of transfer, any tribal claim for damages or possession of land and natural resources based upon: (1) such transfers; or (2) aboriginal titles transferred with congressional consent. Limits the time period within which the constitutionality of this Act may be challenged. Vests exclusive original jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana over any actions questioning the constitutionality of this Act. Establishes the Chitimacha Claims Settlement Fund in the Treasury. Prohibits any distribution of the principal of such Fund to individual tribal members. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to administer the Fund in trust for the tribe and to pay any income derived from it to the tribe semiannually. Provides that tribal purchase of lands with funds from such payment shall, upon request, be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the tribe. Sets maximum amounts which the Secretary may spend out of the Fund's principal to acquire land selected by the tribe and to acquire options to purchase. Provides that such lands shall be part of the Chitimacha Reservation. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the tribe to establish a tribal court and a tribal police force. Vests exclusive jurisdiction in the Chitimacha tribal court system for specified criminal offenses and civil actions. Vests exclusive jurisdiction in the State of Louisiana over specified offenses and civil laws of general application to private persons and property. Authorizes the tribe to assume exclusive jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings in accordance with the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978. Precludes payments made under this Act which benefit the tribe or its members from consideration when eligibility for Federal financial aid programs is determined."
