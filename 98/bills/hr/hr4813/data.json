  "summary": {
    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-02-09", 
    "text": "Comprehensive Hazardous Substances Cleanup and Emergency Relief Act of 1984 - Sets forth the finding that in order to adequately protect human health and the environment from hazardous waste it is necessary to: (1) establish a program for the cleanup of hazardous waste sites; (2) establish standards for the cleanup of such sites which will insure the same degree of protection for human health and the environment as are applicable in the case of facilities regulated under hazardous waste management provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act and other applicable Federal and State law; (3) establish enforcement standards which require parties responsible for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants to assume financial responsibility for injuries of those exposed and for either conducting cleanup or reimbursing government costs of cleanup; (4) establish a full and cooperative Federal-State partnership in the cleanup program; and (5) afford citizens emergency assistance, reimbursement of medical and reimbursement expenses, and an opportunity to participate in the cleanup process. Title I: Cleanup of Hazardous Substances, Pollutants, and Contaminants - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act (\"the Act\") (also known as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976) to add provisions for cleanup of, and liability for, certain hazardous substances, pollutants and contaminants. Defines \"hazardous substance\" as: (1) any substance designated under specified provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act; (2) any element, compound, mixture, solution, or substance designated under specified provisions for additional designations under this Act; (3) any hazardous waste having the characteristics identified or listed under specified hazardous waste management provisions of the Act (but not including any other waste the regulation of which under specified hazardous waste management provisions has been suspended by Act of Congress); (4) any toxic pollutant listed under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act; (5) any hazardous air pollutant listed under the Clean Air Act; and (6) any imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture with respect to which the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (\"the Administrator\") has taken action under the Toxic Substances Control Act. Provides for designation of additional hazardous substances and reportable quantities under this Act. Directs the Administrator to promulgate and revise: (1) regulations designating as hazardous substances, in addition to those referred to in the definition under this Act, such elements, compounds, mixtures, solutions, and substances which, when released into the environment, may present substantial danger to the public health or welfare or the environment; and (2) regulations establishing that quantity of any hazardous substance the release of which shall be reported under this Act. Allows the Administrator to determine that one single quantity shall be the reportable quantity for any hazardous substance, regardless of the medium into which it is released. Provides that, unless and until superceded by such regulations, the substances designated as additional hazardous substances and the reportable quantities of such substances established under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (Superfund) (CERCLA) shall be deemed designated and established under this Act. Sets forth a notice requirement relating to releases of hazardous substances from any facility. Defines \"facility\" as: (1) any building, structure, installation, equipment, pipe or pipeline well, pit, pond, lagoon, impoundment, ditch, landfill, storage container, motor vehicle, rolling stock, or aircraft; or (2) any site or area where a hazardous substance, or pollutant or contaminant, has been deposited, stored, dispensed of, or placed, or otherwise located (but does not include any consumer product in consumer use or any vessel). Requires any person in charge of a facility, as soon as such person has knowledge of any release (other than a federally permitted release) of a hazardous substance from such facility in quantities equal to or greater than those determined as reportable under this Act to immediately notify the National Response Center. Directs the Center to convey the notification expeditiously to all appropriate Government agencies, including the Governor of any affected State. Provides that such notification, or information obtained by exploitation of it, shall not be used against any such person in any criminal case, except a prosecution for perjury or for giving a false statement. Provides that such notice requirement shall not apply to the normal application of a pesticide product under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act or to the handling and storage of such a pesticide product by an agricultural producer. Exempts from such notice requirement any hazardous substance release which: (1) is required to be reported (or specifically exempted from a reporting requirement) under specified hazardous waste management provisions and regulations under the Act and has been reported to the Center; or (2) is a continuous release, stable in quantity and rate, and either is from a facility for which notification has been given under specified provisions of CERCLA or is a release for which notification has been given under the notice requirement of this Act for a period sufficient to establish the continuity, quantity, and regularity of the release. Requires, in the case of such exemptions, that notification be given for releases annually or at such time as there is any statistically significant increase in the quantity of any hazardous substance or constituent thereof released, above that previously reported or occurring. Sets forth response authorities. Authorizes the Administrator, whenever there is a release or substantial threat of release into the environment of any hazardous substance or of any pollutant or contaminant which may present an imminent or substantial danger to human health or the environment, to: (1) remove or arrange for the removal of, and provide for remedial action relating to such hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant at any time (including its removal from any contaminated natural resource); or (2) take any other response measure necessary to protect human health and the environment. Requires that removal actions be consistent with the National Contingency Plan and long-term remedial actions. Allows the Administrator to authorize facility owners or operators or other responsible parties to undertake such response actions. Provides, for purposes of such response authorities, that the term \"pollutant or contaminant\" shall include, but not be limited to, any element, substance, compound, or mixture, including disease-causing agents, which after release into the environment and upon exposure, ingestion, inhalation, or assimilation into any organism either directly from the environment or indirectly by ingestion through food chains, will or may reasonably be anticipated to cause death, disease, behavorial abnormalities, cancer, genetic mutation, physiological malfunctions (including malfunctions in reproduction) or physical deformations in such organisms or their offspring. Sets forth investigation and planning authorities. Authorizes the Administrator to undertake investigations, monitoring, surveys testing, and other information gathering to identify the existence or extent of a release or threat thereof, the source and nature of the hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants involved and the extent of danger to human health and the environment, whenever the Administrator: (1) is authorized to act under response authorities for imminent and substantial danger; or (2) has reason to believe that a release has occurred or is about to occur, or that illness, disease, or complaints thereof may be attributable to exposure to a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant and that a release may have occurred or be occurring. Authorizes the Administrator, in addition, to undertake planning, legal, fiscal, economic, engineering, architectural, and other studies or investigations to plan and direct response actions, recover costs, and enforce cleanup, liability, and funding provisions of this Act. Directs the Administrator, in such information gathering or planning, to assess the risk to human health associated with the release or threatened release. Provides for a six-months limitation on response action. Discontinues obligations, other than those authorized for investigation and planning, from the Hazardous Substances Trust Fund (\"the Fund\") established under this Act after $1,000,000 has been obligated for response actions or six months after the initial response to a release or threatened release of hazardous substances, unless the Administrator: (1) finds that continued response actions are immediately required to prevent, limit, or mitigate an emergency, there is an immediate risk to human health or the environment, and such assistance will not otherwise be provided on a timely basis; or (2) has determined the appropriate remedial actions and the States in which the source of release is located have complied with provisions for State payment of certain costs. Sets forth provisions for State payment of certain costs. Prohibits the Administrator from providing any remedial actions under response provisions of this Act unless the State in which the release or threatened release occurs first provides certain assurances. Requires the State to assure the availability of a hazardous waste disposal facility for any necessary offsite storage, destruction, treatment, or secure disposition of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants.
