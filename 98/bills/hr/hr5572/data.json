    "text": "Amends the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to revise financial reporting requirements for officials of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Requires the President (by executive order), the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct of the House of Representatives, the Select Committee on Ethics of the Senate, and the Judicial Ethics Committee (by regulation) to consult and establish by March 31 of each odd-numbered year the minimum values of income, aggregate and individual gifts, and reimbursements subject to such reporting requirements based on current amounts that equal the values originally designated in 1978 dollars. Amends House and Senate rules to require the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate, by April 15 of each year, to transmit to each individual subject to such financial reporting requirements a financial disclosure form, the text of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, a copy of applicable rules, and any other useful materials. Directs the congressional committees having legislative jurisdiction for the provisions of such Act, as soon as practicable in the 100th Congress, to conduct oversight hearings and report to their respective Houses on: (1) the amendments made by this Act; and (2) the categories of valuation specified for reporting financial information under such Act. Requires the committees to conduct similar reviews of such categories of valuation at least once every ten years thereafter."
