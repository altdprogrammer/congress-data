    "text": "National Training Incentives Act of 1984 - Title I: Withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts and Annuities for Job Training for Displaced Workers - Sets forth provisions for certification of an unemployed individual as a displaced worker by application of such individual to the Secretary of Labor, through the appropriate employment office. Defines \"displaced worker\" for purposes of this title as any individual who: (1) has, as of the date of application for certification, at least 20 quarters of coverage under title II of the Social Security Act; and (2) has, within the one-year period ending on such date, received counseling relating to seeking employment from any public employment office of any State or such other agency as the Secretary has approved under specified provisions of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA). Defines \"displaced workers\" also as individuals who: (1) on the date of application for certification, are receiving (or are eligible to receive) regular unemployment compensation in such State; (2) on or before such date, have exhausted all right to receive regular unemployment compensation in such State in the individual's most recent benefit year; (3) on or before such date, have become unemployed (or have received notice from their employer that their employment will be terminated within six months of such notice) as a result of the permanent closure of the plant or facility of such employer where such individuals are or were employed; or (4) as of such date, have been unemployed for six months or more and have limited opportunity for employment (for any reason, including age) within a reasonable commuting distance from their principal residence in the same or any similar trade or occupation. Permits any displaced worker to withdraw, in a specified manner, an amount not to exceed the qualified amount from any individual retirement account or any individual retirement annuity established for the benefit of such worker to pay any expenses for training in a new trade or occupation. Sets forth formulas for determination of a \"qualified amount.\" Sets forth provisions relating to the manner of such withdrawal, including provisions for issuance of training vouchers. Prohibits depositary institutions from assessing penalties for early withdrawals for purposes of such training, but provides for adjusted rates of return on investments under certain conditions. Requires that such training in an eligible training program at a qualified institution be treated as training with the approval of the State agency for purposes of specified FUTA requirements relating to approval of State unemployment laws. Prohibits denial of any unemployment compensation payment under any Federal law solely because a displaced worker is in such training at an eligible training program at a qualified institution. Sets forth definitions of eligible training programs and training expenses. Directs the Secretary to: (1) prescribe by regulation the application procedure and the criteria to be used in determining whether a training program is eligible; and (2) in making such determination, take into account determinations made by specified other officials and entities.
