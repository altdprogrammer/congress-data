    "text": "Civilian Travel Expense Amendments Act of 1983 - Provides that the maximum per diem allowance for travel inside the continental United States by Government employees, experts, or consultants shall be established by the Administrator of General Services at a rate not exceeding $75 per day. Allows such rate to be established by locality. Authorizes the Administrator to prescribe conditions under which such an individual is entitled to a per diem allowance and travel expenses to his or her duty post, home, or regular place of business if such person, while traveling on official business: (1) becomes incapacitated by illness or injury not due to misconduct; or (2) returns prior to completing his or her assignment, with the approval of the agency concerned, because of a personal emergency such as an injury or death of a family member or an emergency situation such as fire, flood, or other act of God. Limits to $75 per travel day the amount an employee may be reimbursed under any conditions for actual and necessary expenses for travel within the continental United States when the per diem allowance otherwise authorized is either inadequate or inappropriate. Authorizes the Administrator to provide for the payment of a special per diem allowance within current limitations when the per diem allowance otherwise allowable is inadequate to cover the actual and necessary expenses of travel outside the continental United States. Authorizes the Administrator to prescribe conditions under which an employee who serves in a law enforcement, investigative, or protective capacity and members of the employee's family may be provided a per diem allowance as well as transportation expenses when necessarily occupying temporary living accommodations away from the employee's duty post. Directs the Administrator, at least every two years, to collect information on the travel and transportation payments of agencies spending more than $5,000,000 annually on such payments, in order to analyze estimated total agency payments, average costs and duration of trips, purposes of official travel, and other related data."
