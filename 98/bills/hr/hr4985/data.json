    "text": "Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (Superfund) (CERCLA) to include (by removing an exclusion) under the definition of \"hazardous substance\" for purposes of CERCLA response and liability provisions: petroleum (including crude oil) and natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas, or synthetic gas usable for fuel (or mixtures of natural gas and such synthetic gas). Includes (by removing an exclusion) under the definition of \"pollutant or contaminant\" for purposes of CERCLA response authorities: petroleum (including crude oil) and natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or synthetic gas of pipeline quality (or mixtures of natural gas and such synthetic gas). Sets forth a regulatory program with standards for underground storage tanks. Directs the Administrator, within 12 months after the enactment of this Act, to promulgate regulations establishing performance standards applicable to owners and operators of underground storage tanks used for the storage of hazardous substances, including gasoline or other liquid hydrocarbons, in order to prevent releases into the environment for the operational life of the tank. Provides that such regulations shall apply only to underground storage tanks located on property used primarily for commercial or governmental purposes. Directs the Administrator to distinguish in such standards between requirements for new tanks and those for tanks already in existence. Sets forth requirements which must be included in such standards. Authorizes the Administrator to implement such standards through: (1) the promulgation of regulations made effective in accordance with specified hazardous waste management provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act; or (2) the establishment of a permit program, if necessary. Provides that such permits may be required for any person or category of persons who stores any hazardous substance, including gasoline or any other liquid hydrocarbon, in an underground storage tank located on property primarily used for commercial or governmental purposes. Provides that specified provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act shall apply to the program and requirements established under this Act in the same manner as such provisions apply to the hazardous waste regulatory program under such Act. Provides that the failure or refusal of an owner or operator of any underground storage tank to provide to a supplier of any hazardous substance, including gasoline or any other liquid hydrocarbon, appropriate evidence of compliance with standards established under this Act shall constitute a defense to any enforcement action brought under any other authority of law to require such supplier to deliver any such substance to such tank. Sets forth criminal penalties for persons who knowingly commit material violations or omissions with respect to requirements established by the Administrator under the regulatory program established by this Act, if such violation or omission results in a release or threatened release of any hazardous substance, including gasoline or other liquid hydrocarbon, from an underground storage tank. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 to carry out this regulatory program. Provides that up to 50 percent of such appropriations in any such fiscal year may be used to make grants to States for development and implementation of State programs to carry out this regulatory program. Directs the Administrator, within one year after the enactment of this Act, to conduct a study regarding underground storage tanks which are located on residential property and used for the storage of hazardous substances, including gasoline or other liquid hydrocarbons. Requires that such study include estimates of the number and location of such tanks and an analysis of the extent to which there may be releases or threatened releases from such tanks into the environment. Directs the Administrator to report to Congress on the results of such study, with recommendations on whether such tanks on residential property should be subject to requirements under this regulatory program."
