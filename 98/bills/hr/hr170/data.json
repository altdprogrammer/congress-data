Redefines \"adjusted gross income\" to eliminate the deductions from gross income for the following: (1) long-term capital gains; (2) moving expenses; (3) retirement savings; and (4) two-earner married couples. Defines \"allowable itemized deductions\" as any deduction attributable to: (1) expenses for the production of income; (2) contributions to a church; or (3) alimony or separate maintenance payments. Repeals the deductions for: (1) medical and dental expenses; (2) interest, taxes, and depreciation of cooperative housing; (3) moving expenses; (4) retirement savings; (5) adoption expenses; (6) two-earner married couples; and (7) capital gains.
