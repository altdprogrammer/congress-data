Prohibits the use of funds authorized by this Act for programs which have not been presented to, or requested of, Congress, unless 30 calendar days have elapsed since the Secretary of Energy has presented to all the appropriate congressional committees a full and complete statement of the action proposed.

Authorizes the Secretary to start any general plant project only if the maximum estimated cost of such project does not exceed $1,200,000. Sets forth procedures for approval of projects that exceed the 25 percent estimated cost provision, and exempts from such procedures any project which has an estimated cost of less than $5,000,000. Allows the transfer of funds from specified projects to other Government agencies for the performance of work for which the appropriation is made.
