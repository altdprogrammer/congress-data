Prohibits the Small Business Administration (SBA) from declining to issue payment guarantees for small business pollution control facilities or property, subject only to the existence of qualified guarantee applications from eligible small businesses. (Currently, payment guarantees for pollution control facilities or property may be issued when such property is acquired with the proceeds from tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds.) Amends the Small Business Act to specify the minimum amount of payment guarantees for pollution control facilities into which the SBA must enter for each of FY 1982, 1983, and 1984."
