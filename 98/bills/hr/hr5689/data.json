    "text": "Act for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Hostage-Taking - Provides for the implementation of the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages. Amends the kidnapping provisions of the Federal criminal code to include within the prohibition threatening to kill, injure, or continue to detain the kidnap victim in order to compel a third party to do or abstain from doing any act as a condition for the release of the victim. Imposes a penalty of 20 years imprisonment for such hostage-taking. Authorizes the United States, if the kidnap victim is an internationally protected person or if the kidnapping is a hostage-taking, to exercise jurisdiction if: (1) the offense was committed within the United States; (2) the alleged offender is a U.S. national; (3) the victim was a U.S. national; or (4) the offender is present within the United States. Authorizes the Attorney General to request aid from any Federal, State, or local agency in the course of enforcing the prohibition against hostage-taking."
