    "text": "Manufacturing Sciences and Technology Research and Development Act of 1983 - Permits the Secretary of Commerce, through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Productivity, Technology, and Innovation, to award grants and enter into cooperative agreements to provide for research on ways of producing more efficient manufacturing processes and methods, including: (1) computer-assisted design; (2) automated materials handling; (3) automated testing; and (4) integrated manufacturing systems. Requires grants to be made on a competitive basis. Permits the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements to establish and support Centers for Manufacturing Research and Technology Utilization. Permits such Centers to conduct applied research on a matching funds basis. Authorizes appropriations for both the grants and cooperative agreements for FY 1984-1988. Directs the Secretary to establish a program of experimental activities to identify the most feasible means of utilizing advanced manufacturing methods by retraining displaced workers. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress within one year on such program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 and 1985. Directs the Secretary to select specific domestic technology-sensitive industrial sectors to analyze their long-term capability for remaining competitive. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose for FY 1984-1988. Directs the Secretary to establish a Manufacturing Sciences and Technology Enhancement Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary concerning the activities to be conducted under this Act. Requires such Committee to submit to Congress an annual report."
