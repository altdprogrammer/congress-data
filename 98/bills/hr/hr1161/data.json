Bases such rate on the present rate imposed on married individuals filing joint returns. Repeals the tax tables for taxpayers who are: (1) heads of households; (2) unmarried individuals; and (3) married individuals filing seperate returns. Limits the earned income that must be reported by a married person filing a seperate return to the amount actually earned by that individual."
