    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Agriculture with amendment, H. Rept. 98-237) Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 - Title I: Dairy Compliance Program - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982, to set the milk support price at $13.10 per hundredweight through FY 1983. (Eliminates the 50-cent milk producer assessments.) Sets such price at $12.60 per hundredweight for FY 1984 and FY 1985, except that: (1) on January 1, 1985, if the Secretary estimates that Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) milk purchases for the next 12 months will exceed 6,000,000,000 pounds, then the support price shall be reduced by 50 cents per hundredweight; and (2) on July 1, 1985, if 12-month purchase estimates exceed 5,000,000,000 pounds, the support price shall be further reduced by 50 cents per hundredweight, and if such estimates are 5,000,000,000 or less, the support price shall be increased by at least 50 cents per hundredweight. States that the price of milk shall be supported through milk and milk product purchases. Requires a 50-cent per hundredweight milk price reduction through the end of 1984 in order to encourage marketing reductions. Remits such funds to the CCC to be credited to the Dairy Stabilization Settlement Fund to fund a paid diversion program. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to implement the diversion program (beginning by October 1, 1983 and terminating December 30, 1984) as follows: (1) a $10 per hundredweight reduced production payment; (2) reductions as determined by the producer of between five and 30 percent of the base; (3) quarterly partial payments; (4) limited transferability of a producer's marketing history; (5) penalties for failure to make the agreed reductions and remit the resultant funds, and for a knowing violation of a diversion contract; (6) limited transferability of dairy cattle to other producers; (7) suspension of diversion payments if the Secretary is prohibited by court order from implementing the 50-cent producer assessments; (8) determination of a participant's commercial marketing history, which may be adjusted by the Secretary to compensate for abnormally low production; (9) recordkeeping requirements; and (10) judicial enforcement in U.S. district courts. Requires the Secretary to submit a report on milk parity formula changes to the appropriate congressional committees by December 31, 1984. Title II: Dairy Promotion Program - Requires the Secretary to publish (with due notice and opportunity for public hearing) a proposed dairy research and promotion order within 30 days of receiving a request for such proposed order. Permits such proposal to be submitted by an individual or an organization certified under this Act. Makes such order effective 90 days after the public comment period. Authorizes the Secretary to amend such orders. Sets forth required terms of such orders, including the establishment of a National Dairy Promotion and Research Board made up of at least 36 milk producer members appointed by the Secretary. Sets forth organizational and operating provisions, including penalties for disclosure and other related violations of such orders. Funds such dairy promotion, research, and nutrition education program through a 15 cents per hundredweight assessment on commercially marketed milk. Permits a credit of up to ten cents per hundredweight for contributions to qualified State or regional dairy promotion or nutrition education programs. Requires an organization to be certified by the Secretary in order to represent milk producers. Authorizes the Secretary to develop such criteria, and makes the Secretary's eligibility decision final. Requires the Secretary, within the 60-day period preceding September 30, 1985, to conduct a producer referendum on such program's continuation (approval to be by a simple majority of those voting). States that after September 30, 1985, such referendums may be held when the Secretary deems appropriate, or when requested by ten percent of the affected producers. Reimburses the Secretary from assessments collected by the Board for related expenses. Permits cooperative association representation at such referendums, provided that the association notifies its members 30 days in advance and provides them an opportunity to vote as individuals. Provides petition and review in U.S. district court for a person subject to an order. Vests enforcement powers in U.S. district courts. Sets forth penalty provisions. Grants the Secretary investigative and related authority. Sets forth congressional reporting provisions. Authorizes appropriations."
