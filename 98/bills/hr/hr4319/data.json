    "text": "Child Support Equity Study Act of 1983 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study to determine and evaluate: (1) various guidelines, formulas, and approaches for the establishment of child support amounts, with particular emphasis on methods to ensure that the standard of living of the child is at least comparable to that of the absent parent; and (2) methods to ensure that child support amounts are adjusted on a periodic basis to reflect changes in the cost of living, to the extent that the absent parent's income has kept pace with such changes, while making certain that the necessity of initiating such adjustments will not impose an undue burden on the custodial parent. Directs the Secretary to appoint an advisory commission to advise and assist in the conduct of the study and the formulation of recommendations. Requires that such commission include representatives of custodial and absent parents, persons with professional expertise on child support issues in such fields as law and economics, members of the judiciary, and persons with expertise in court administration and the administration of child support programs. Directs the Secretary to submit to the Congress, within two years after enactment of this Act, a report on such study, with findings and recommendations for standards or guidelines for equitable child support amounts and adjustments."
