    "text": "Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 1984 - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to include within the meaning of \"broker\" and \"dealer\" any person in the business of engaging in transactions in deposits for the account of others (broker) or for his or her own account (dealer). Excludes an insured institution from such definition. Defines the term \"deposits\" for the purposes of such Act as deposits of a bank or of an insured institution which are, or are eligible to become, insured deposits or accounts within the meaning of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or of the National Housing Act, respectively. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the National Housing Act to prohibit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation from denying or limiting insurance coverage for any transaction involving an insured deposit effected by a broker or dealer, except in the case of a newly insured bank or a bank which is eligible for assistance under such Acts. Requires the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, and the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to transmit annual reports to each House of Congress with respect to their implementation of the amendments made by this Act."
