Revises provisions relating to the dumping of sewage sludge into ocean waters or other specified waters. Provides that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may not issue or renew any permit for such dumping: (1) after December 31, 1988; or (2) to any person other than a municipality that was authorized to dump sewage sludge into such waters under such Act, or under court order, as of January 1, 1983. Provides that sewage sludge shall be considered harmful, for purposes of such regulation of dumping, if it fails to meet the environmental impact criteria of EPA regulations issued under the Act, except that, for constituents under specified provisions of the London Dumping Convention, applicable trace contaminant limits that are binding on the United States must be defined numerically without regard to the rate of sludge discharge into the ocean. Sets a civil penalty for each act of unlawful dumping of sewage sludge at: (1) $10,000 for each act that occurs during 1989; and (2) $50,000 for each act that occurs after 1989."
