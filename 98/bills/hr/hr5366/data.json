    "text": "Victims of Crime Act of 1984 - Title I: Crime Victim Compensation - Directs the Attorney General to make grants to qualified State programs for the compensation of victims of crimes. Provides that such grants shall total: (1) 50 percent of allowable compensation paid to victims of State crimes designated by the State to be appropriate for compensation; and (2) 100 percent of allowable compensation to victims of crimes which would constitute designated crimes but are subject to exclusive Federal jurisdiction. Specifies criteria to be met by a State plan in order to qualify for grants, including that the program: (1) offer compensation for medical expenses and loss of wages; (2) condition compensation on cooperation with law enforcement officials; and (3) deny or reduce recovery where the claimant contributed to the injury. Title II: Crime Victim Assistance - Allows the Attorney General to make grants to the chief executive of each State for the financial support of crime assistance programs. States that such program must provide crisis intervention and mental health counseling services to victims and their families. Title III: Crime Victims Fund - Establishes within the Treasury the Crime Victims Fund. Provides that the Fund shall consist of: (1) fines collected in Federal criminal cases; and (2) proceeds of all forfeitures in Federal criminal cases. Title IV: Changes in Criminal Fine Levels and Related Matters - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish alternative, increased fines for any person convicted of a Federal offense. Requires the Federal courts to impose a penalty assessment on all persons convicted of Federal offenses. Title V: Effective Dates - Establishes effective dates."
