    "text": "Ethanol Energy Policy Act of 1984 - Title I: Ethanol Demonstration Program for Federal Vehicles - Requires the Secretary of Energy to acquire at least 1,000 ethanol-powered passenger automobiles during FY 1985 and conduct studies with respect to the performance and maintenance of such vehicles. Requires that methanol be offered for sale to the public for use in other vehicles through September 30, 1989. Authorizes the Secretary to provide Federal agencies with such ethanol-powered vehicles at their request. Requires the agencies to cooperate with the Secretary in studies related to such vehicles. Sets forth reporting requirements which apply to the Secretary. Title II: Demonstration Program for Ethanol-Powered Buses - Amends the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to permit State and local entities which are eligible for grants under any other provision of such Act to apply to the Secretary of Transportation for grants for the acquisition of ethanol-powered buses. Requires grant recipients to participate in a demonstration program under which the Secretary shall conduct studies and tests with respect to the performance and maintenance of such buses. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 for supplemental grants. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1989 for the demonstration program. Sets forth reporting requirements which apply to the Secretary. Title III: Interagency Commission on Ethanol - Establishes the Interagency Commission on Ethanol to develop and coordinate implementation of a national ethanol energy policy. Requires the Commission to: (1) perform various studies with respect to the production, use, and promotion of ethanol as a fuel; (2) develop a plan for the commercialization of ethanol; (3) develop a public-awareness program on ethanol as a transportation fuel; (4) coordinate Federal efforts with respect to ethanol research and commercialization; and (5) ensure communication between Federal agencies involved in ethanol demonstration projects and establish an information clearinghouse for parties working with or interested in ethanol and related projects. Requires the Chairman of the Commission to establish a private sector advisory panel to inform the Commission about ethanol-related matters. Sets forth reporting requirements which apply to the Commission. Terminates the Commission upon the submission of its last report. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1989 to carry out this title. Title IV: Allocation of Highway Revenues - Provides that for purposes of the minimum allocation of highway revenues to States, the amount of estimated tax payments attributable to highway users in any State shall be increased by the estimated amount of tax such users would have paid if there were no special tax rate or tax exemption under the Internal Revenue Code for any liquid which is at least 85 percent methanol, ethanol, or other alcohol. Title V: Tax Incentives for the Use of Ethanol As A Fuel - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit of $1,000 for each passenger automobile purchased by the taxpayer the primary fuel for which is ethanol which is domestically manufactured and the original use of which commences with the taxpayer."
