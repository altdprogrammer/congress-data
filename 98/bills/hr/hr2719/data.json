    "text": "Legal Services Corporation Act Amendments of 1983 - Directs the Legal Services Corporation (the Corporation) to insure that recipients do not use Corporation funds to: (1) pay for any type of personal service, advertisement or communication designed to influence Federal, State or local agency decisions, except for legal assistance provided on claims directly concerning a client's legal rights or responsibilities; and (2) influence any elected official regarding legislation or legislative procedure. Allows the use of Corporation funds where the recipient's project director has: (1) approved their use for communications made in response to the formal request of an elected official; (2) expressly determined that a legislative body is considering an authorization, appropriation or oversight measure directly affecting the recipient or the Corporation; and (3) expressly approved legislative representation of a client after concluding that such client is directly affected by the legislation, can secure relief from the legislative body, and has provided specified documents. Prohibits class action suits against any government entity unless: (1) the recipient's project director has expressly given approval; (2) the class relief is for the primary benefit of eligible clients; and (3) the project director has concluded that the government practice or policy will continue to impact adversely upon clients and that out-of-court settlement would be adverse to the clients' interests. Requires notice to the government entity of the impending class action. Directs the Corporation to: (1) encourage recipients to negotiate settlements before filing suit; (2) develop criteria and regulations under which funds may be available for legal assistance to eligible clients by private attorneys. Prohibits the use of Corporation funds for legal assistance to: (1) aliens in violation of specified laws; (2) any proceeding or litigation relating to abortion unless such abortion is necessary to save the mother's life. Allows legal advice regarding a client's legal rights and responsibilities with respect to an abortion. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1986. Specifies amounts available in such fiscal years for grants or contracts."
