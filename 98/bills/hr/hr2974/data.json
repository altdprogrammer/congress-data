Title II: Congressional Review - Requires the Federal Trade Commission to submit a final rule promulgated by the Commission to the Congress for review. States that such final rule shall become effective: (1) unless vetoed within 90 days after submission by congressional adoption of a concurrent resolution of disapproval; or (2) if no such resolution is introduced within 35 days after submission. Establishes procedures applicable to the House of Representatives and to the Senate for consideration of a final rule submitted for review. Permits the Commission to repromulgate a final rule relating to the same acts or practices as a rule which has been disapproved. Requires resubmission of the revised final rule for congressional review. States that congressional inaction on a concurrent resolution disapproving a final rule shall not be construed to create any presumption of validity of such final rule."
