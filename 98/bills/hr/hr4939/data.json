Makes such an order effective upon issuance. Requires the Administrator to promptly notify an affected person of any such order. Grants such person five days (from the order's publication in the Federal Register) to request a public hearing. Requires: (1) such hearing to begin within five days of such request; and (2) such order to be affirmed or revised within ten days of the hearings's competition. States that the effective date of any such order shall not be delayed during administrative or judicial review. Prohibits judicial review until completion of a hearing. Requires the Administrator to revoke the exemption of ethylene dibromide and establish a raw agricultural commodity tolerance level for it within ten days."
