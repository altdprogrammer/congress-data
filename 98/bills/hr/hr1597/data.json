    "text": "Renewable Energy National Security Act of 1983 - Requires the Secretary of a military department, when procuring energy systems, to procure systems that include energy-conserving equipment. Includes biofuels as a renewable form of energy for purposes of energy systems procurement by a military department. Requires the Secretary of Defense to provide for the use of biofuels in meeting Department of Defense energy needs to the extent feasible and consistent with overall defense needs. Requires the Secretary of Defense to encourage the use of energy-conserving devices and equipment in military construction projects, including family housing projects, where practical and economically feasible. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to include spoiled and contaminated grains among the accumulated stocks of agricultural commodities which the Commodity Credit Corporation may process into liquid fuels. Authorizes the Corporation to provide for the storage of liquid fuels so processed for use by the agricultural sector during periods of fuel shortages. Requires the Corporation to provide for the processing of spoiled and contaminated commodities into liquid fuels before the processing of stocks of usable feedstock. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to require the Secretary of Energy to maintain a data base on the location of all stockpiles of renewable energy supplies and biofuels and of all renewable energy production facilities in the United States. Requires that such data be made available to Government departments and agencies upon request. Requires the Secretary of Defense to assess and report to the Armed Services Committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the feasibility of using mobile energy systems that use renewable energy as emergency backup energy systems at military installations."
