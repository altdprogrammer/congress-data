    "text": "Amends the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to require any person making a tender offer, or request or invitation for tenders, to hold such offer, request, or invitation open for a period of at least 60 days. Exempts from this requirement any such offer, invitation, or request by the issuer for the class of securities being sought if the offer, invitation, or request is not made in anticipation of or response to another person's offer, request, or invitation. Prohibits any issuer of registered securities from engaging in any transaction in contemplation of effecting, or of defending against, a change in control of such issuer that is not prudent for the issuer and fair to the issuer's security holders. Permits the Securities and Exchange Commission or any security holder of such issuer to bring a suit in the proper district court to enjoin any such transaction and for such other equitable relief as may be appropriate. Applies the provisions of this Act to transactions taken by an issuer or by any officer or director on or after June 1, 1984."
