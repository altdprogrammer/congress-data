Provides for the detention of an alien whose presence in the United States is not under color of law. Authorizes a judicial officer to order the pretrial detention of a person upon finding that: (1) no condition will reasonably assure such person's appearance and the safety of any other person and the community; and (2) there is a substantial probability that the person committed the offense. Requires that a detention hearing be held in any case involving: (1) a crime of violence; (2) any offense punishable by life imprisonment or death; (3) a narcotics offense punishable by at least ten years imprisonment; or (4) any offense committed after the person has been convicted of two or more offenses for which a hearing is mandated. Permits the government or the court to move for a detention hearing in any other case involving a serious risk of flight or obstruction of justice. Enumerates additional factors to be considered by the judicial officer in making a release determination, including the defendant's past conduct, history of drug or alcohol abuse, criminal history, and the nature and seriousness of the danger to the community or any person. Requires the detention of a person who has appealed his conviction unless the judicial officer finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) such person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to another person or property; and (2) the appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact.

Places the burden of proving the existence of this defense by the preponderance of the evidence on the defendant. States that \"mental disease or defect\" does not include voluntary intoxication. Authorizes a verdict of \"not responsible only by reason of insanity,\" if the defendant would be guilty but for the defense provided. Amends the Federal Rules of Evidence to prohibit expert witnesses from offering opinions on the ultimate issue regarding mental incompetence. Provides for an initial screening examination to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant lacks competence.

Directs the court to impose a sentence that accords with the applicable sentencing guidelines unless a departure from the guidelines is warranted. Requires a presentence hearing (except when the only sentence imposed is a fine of less than $250) to resolve issues of fact which are essential to the sentencing decision. Authorizes the court to permit the parties to subpoena and cross-examine witnesses. Permits the court to commit a defendant to the Attorney General's custody for a special study to aid in sentencing. Prohibits the court from considering the defendant's need for education, vocational training, or correctional treatment as a justification for imposing any term of imprisonment. Allows the court to designate a defendant as a youthful offender if such defendant is under 21 years of age and would benefit from placement in a residential community treatment center. Sets forth a fine schedule for the categories of offenses generally at higher levels than current law. Includes higher maximums for organizational defendants.

Retains the provisions allowing the government to make appeals in criminal cases. Permits an appeal by either the United States or the defendant if the sentence: (1) resulted from incorrect application of a sentencing guideline; (2) was not imposed in accordance with the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; or (3) otherwise violates the Constitution or laws of the United States. Establishes a Sentencing Guidelines Commission within the Judicial Conference of the United States. Directs the Commission to recommend sentencing guidelines to the Judicial Conference. Directs the Judicial Conference to prescribe sentencing guidelines for Federal courts to use in determining appropriate sentences. States that the purpose of such guidelines is to: (1) promote fairness and certainty in sentencing; (2) eliminate unwarranted disparity in sentencing; and (3) improve the administration of justice. Provides that guidelines shall take into account the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant. Eliminates the parole system. Provides a program of supervised release for prisoners sentenced to a term of imprisonment of more than one year.

Sets the maximum reward for information at $250,000. Amends the Controlled Substances Act and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to increase the maximum authorized fines for certain drug offenses. Permits imposition of an alternative fine up to twice the gross gain derived from the offense. Provides judicial procedures for seizure of property subject to criminal forfeiture. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to provide for the seizure of vessels, aircraft, merchandise, or baggage valued at $100,000 or less except in the case of conveyances used to import, export or transport controlled substances, for which there is no limit to the value of items that may be seized. Requires written notice of such seizure to all interested parties. Increases the surety bond for any person claiming interest in the seized property to $2,500, or ten percent of the value of the claimed property, whichever is less (but not less than $250.) Allows the Customs Service to destroy or otherwise dispose of forfeited property valued at less than $1,000 if the expense of keeping such property is disproportionate to its value.

Establishes a Bureau of Justice Assistance to develop and set priorities for technical assistance and training programs for State and local criminal justice agencies and organizations. Directs the Bureau to make grants to such agencies for programs that address critical problems of violent and serious crime and programs that offer a high probability of improving the functioning of the criminal justice system. Enumerates 18 purposes for the awarding of these grants. Limits the Federal share of the grant programs to a period of four years and includes a cash match requirement. Eliminates the current national priority grant programs. Retains the discretionary grant program. Limits the purposes of discretionary grants to: (1) educational and training programs for criminal justice personnel; (2) provide technical assistance to State and local governments; (3) undertake national or multi- State projects to address violent crime and serious offenders; and (4) fund national demonstration programs which are likely to be successful but unlikely to be funded. Authorizes the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to make grants to State and local governments for the construction of correctional facilities to relieve the overcrowding and substandard conditions at State and local correctional facilities. Requires the Director to establish and operate an information clearinghouse on the construction and modernization of correctional facilities.

Authorizes a State or local government to apply for emergency Federal law enforcement assistance. Requires the Attorney General, in approving or disapproving such application, to consider: (1) the nature and extent of the crime problem; (2) the emergency or extraordinary circumstances; (3) the availability of State and local resources; (4) the cost of increased Federal presence; and (5) the need to avoid unnecessary Federal involvement in local concerns. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose. Title VI: Money Laundering - Money Laundering Penalties Act of 1984 - Amends the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act to increase the civil penalty for willful violations of the Act by financial institutions from $1,000 to $10,000. Increases the criminal fine from $1,000 to $250,000 and imprisonment from one year to up to five years.

Title VIII: Witness Protection - Witness Security Reform Act of 1984 - Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the Attorney General to relocate and protect witnesses and their families involved in Federal or State trials of violent offenses. Authorizes the Attorney General to take action to protect the person from bodily injury or otherwise to assure the health, safety, and welfare of that person. States that the Attorney General shall not protect any person where the risk of danger to the public in the proposed community of relocation outweighs the need for that person's testimony. Requires the Attorney General to establish guidelines defining the types of cases which constitute \"violent offenses.\" Requires any person protected under this Act to enter into a memorandum with the Attorney General. Requires the memorandum to set forth such person's responsibilities, including agreement: (1) if an actual or potential witness, to provide information to all appropriate law enforcement officials and to testify in all proceedings; (2) to refrain from committing any act punishable by a prison term; (3) to take all necessary steps to avoid detection by others of the facts concerning the protection provided; (4) to cooperate with all reasonable requests of Government employees; (5) to comply with civil judgments; (6) to designate another person to act as an agent for the service of process; (7) to make a sworn statement of all outstanding legal obligations imposed by court order; and (8) to disclose any probation or parole responsibilities.
