    "text": "Trade Procedures Simplification Act - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to permit election of expedited procedures in countervailing duty and antidumping duty investigations. Requires the final determination of the administering authority to be made: (1) within 100 days of the filing of the petition or the date on which the investigation commenced in countervailing duty cases; and (2) within 175 days of the filing of the petition or the date on which the investigation began in antidumping duty cases. Provides for extensions of such time limits in certain extraordinary cases. Requires the final determination of the International Trade Commission (ITC) to be made within 30 days of the administering authority's determination in countervailing duty and antidumping duty cases. Deletes the provision which permits the suspension of countervailing duty investigations on the basis of subsidy offset agreements. Requires that the holding of a hearing by the ITC during an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation shall be treated as compliance with the hearing requirement for both investigations if the investigations deal with the same merchandise from the same country and are initiated within six months of each other, unless the ITC considers that extraordinary circumstances require a hearing in the course of each investigation. Directs the administering authority to reimburse a petitioner for reasonable costs and expenses in an investigation that results in issuance of a countervailing duty order, antidumping duty order, or suspension agreement. Authorizes appeals of antidumping and countervailing duty cases to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Establishes in the ITC a Trade Remedy Assistance Office which shall provide full information to the public, upon request, concerning: (1) remedies and benefits under the trade laws; and (2) petition and application procedures and filing dates. Requires each agency responsible for administering a trade law to provide technical assistance to eligible small businesses with respect to that law. Requires the ITC to include in its findings on the existence of injury or market disruption with respect to a domestic industry a discussion of all issues relating to the domestic industry's condition and the factors responsible for that condition. Authorizes supplemental appropriations for the ITC for additional personnel."
