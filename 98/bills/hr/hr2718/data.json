    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Paperwork Reduction Act Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 to require the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to appoint a Chief Statistician of the United States to be responsible for certain statistical policy and coordination functions currently assigned to the Director. Includes among such functions the integration of statistical functions with other information resources management functions. Revises the procedures for the Director's review of new information collection requests. Directs each agency to forward to the Director a copy of each request proposed to be initiated by a proposed rule or regulation. Prohibits the publication in the Federal Register of any final rule or regulation initiating a request for which a control number has not been obtained. Requires that an explanation of any modification of a request be published with the final rule or regulation. Permits agencies to submit approved requests to the Director for renewal of approval not later than 90 days before the existing approval expires. Requires an agency to publish any change in a request or the rule initiating the request no later than the date that approval of the request expires. Voids any request for which procedures under this Act are not followed. Requires that any written communication to or from OMB concerning a request be included in the public record of the rule initiating such request. Requires the Director to update, annually, the five-year plan for meeting the Government's automatic data processing and telecommunications needs. Requires the Director to: (1) set a goal to reduce the Government paperwork burden by ten percent by October 1, 1984, and by an additional five percent in the following year; (2) issue a comprehensive set of information resources management policies; (3) delegate to the Administrator of General Services the authority to issue information resources management principles, standards, and guidelines and the duty of reviewing each agency's information management activities every three years; and (4) report the results of such reviews to Congress within 30 days after receipt thereof. Requires each senior official designated to carry out agency information management activities to review existing regulations and to compile and submit to the Director a list of all information collection requests that have not been assigned control numbers and that the agency proposes to continue. Requires the Director to notify the agency involved of the approval or disappproval of the requests by a specified date, or else one year's approval may be inferred. Requires the Director to include the following information in his or her annual report to Congress: (1) a summary of accomplishments and planned initiatives to improve information resources management within agencies; (2) a statement on each agency's initiatives to acquire information technology to improve such management; (3) an analysis of the extent to which the newly issued information management policies, principles, standards, and guidelines deter or promote such initiatives; (4) a description of the actions taken on, or planned for, statistical policy and coordination functions; and (5) a description of the status of each major statistical program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1986 to carry out such Act. Prohibits the use of appropriated funds for activities not specifically authorized or required under such Act or for reviewing any rule or regulation, other than a collection of information requirement. Limits the amount of appropriations available for the Federal Information Locator System. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to combine the existing Federal telecommunications and automatic data processing funds into an Information Technology Fund. Directs the Administrator: (1) to determine the cost and capital requirements for the Fund for each fiscal year and submit plans for such requirements to the Director; and (2) if such plans are approved by the Director, to establish rates to be charged to users of information technology resources provided through the Fund. Permits the Administrator to make multiyear contracts for such resources if: (1) adequate funds are available to pay contract costs for the first fiscal year any any costs of cancellation or termination; (2) such a contract is awarded on a fully competitive basis; (3) the Government's need for such resources will continue over the contract period; and (4) use of a multiyear contract will cost less than other acquisition methods and will not exclude small business participation. Requires the Administrator to report to the Director on the operation of the Fund."
