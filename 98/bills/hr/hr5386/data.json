Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, with respect to hospice care and services furnished on or after October 1, 1985, to: (1) at least annually, review and make appropriate adjustments to the payment rate for routine home care; and (2) report to Congress annually concerning such review and adjustments. Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Act to decrease the reduction in OASDI benefits payable because an individual receives a public pension from the full amount of the pension to two-thirds of the amount of such pension. (Current law excludes certain individuals from such treatment because of the date they became eligible for a pension.) Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Act to extend for one year: (1) the conditional ceiling on Federal financial participation in foster care; (2) the provision which permits a State to use, under part B (Child Welfare Services) of title IV, funds made available to it under the conditional ceiling that are not needed under part E; and (3) the provision permitting Federal financial participation for foster care for certain children voluntarily placed in foster care."
