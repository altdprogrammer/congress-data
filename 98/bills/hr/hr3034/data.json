Rept. 98-201) Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to authorize the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives to furnish, by contract or otherwise, educational services for congressional pages. (Currently such services are provided by the Board of Education of the District of Columbia.) Eliminates provisions of such services for Supreme Court pages. Revises the conditions of appointment for congressional pages. Requires that a House page be in the eleventh grade, serve for a full academic year, and not have served as a summer page. Requires that a Senate page be in the eleventh grade and serve for one or two full semesters. Sets forth requirements for summer pages of the House. Amends the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act, 1947, to repeal provisions which allow other minors who are congressional employees to attend the educational facilities for pages. Makes technical and conforming amendments. Establishes the Congressional Page Board to ensure that the page program is consistent with the functioning of the Congress and the welfare of congressional pages. Terminates the House of Representatives Page Board."
