Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to enter into a tentative agreement for impact assistance with a State or Indian tribe at any time following the approval of a candidate site for such a repository in the State or on the tribe's reservation. Requires that such an agreement indicate the amount of assistance to be provided if a construction authorization for a repository is granted. Makes such an agreement binding upon the Secretary upon the granting of the construction authorization."
