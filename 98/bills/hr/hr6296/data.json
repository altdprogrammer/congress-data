    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) San Juan Basin Wilderness Protection Act of 1984 - Title I: San Juan Basin - Designates the following lands in the Albuquerque District of the Bureau of Land Management in New Mexico as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Bisti Wilderness; and (2) the De-na-zin Wilderness. Withdraws the area in the Albuquerque District of the Bureau of Land Management known as the Fossil Forest from appropriation under the mining laws and from disposition under the mineral leasing and geothermal leasing laws. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to administer the area so as to protect its natural, educational, and scientific research values. Directs the Bureau of Land Management to conduct a long-range study of the Fossil Forest to determine how best to manage the area's resource values. Directs the Secretary to forward the study results and management plan for the area to Congress. Sets forth requirements for an exchange of Federal lands selected by New Mexico for State lands located within the wilderness areas designated by this Act. Requires the Secretary to exchange lands upon the request of an Indian whose lands are located within the De-na-zin Wilderness area. Requires the Navajo Tribe to select lands in New Mexico administered by the Bureau of Land Management of equal acreage in lieu of lands previously selected by the Tribe within the boundaries of the Fossil Forest. Transfers all rights, title, and interests in certain lands in New Mexico to the Navajo tribe, subject to pending coal lease applications and certain payments to New Mexico. Transfers, at a cost of $2.50 per acre, all rights, title, and interests in certain lands in New Mexico to the New Mexico State University, for the purpose of conducting educational, demonstrative, and experimental development with livestock, grazing methods, and range forage plants. Provides for the relief of the Elephant Butte Irrigation District from certain obligations to reimburse the Bureau of Reclamation. Adds approximately 20 acres to the Sandia Mountain Wilderness in New Mexico. Authorizes the Secretary to convey certain lands in Lake Sumner State Park in New Mexico to the Sumner Lake Corporation."
