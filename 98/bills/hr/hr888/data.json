    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow domestic corporations an income tax deduction for dividends paid by such corporations during the taxable year in lieu of the deduction for dividends received from other corporations. Disqualifies the following types of corporations: (1) S corporations; (2) regulated investment companies; (3) real estate investment trusts; (4) personal holding companies; and (5) domestic international sales corporations (DISC). Limits the amount of the deduction for dividends received from certain foreign corporations to 85 percent of a corporation's taxable income computed without regard to other deductions and the capital loss carryback. Provides that such limitation shall not apply to any corporation which has a net operating loss for the taxable year. Disallows any deduction for dividends on any share of stock which is sold by a taxpayer who has held such stock for less than 15 days (90 days for preferred stock) or stock for which the taxpayer is under an obligation to make corresponding payments with respect to substantially identical stock or securities. Repeals provisions allowing deductions for dividends received on certain preferred stock."
