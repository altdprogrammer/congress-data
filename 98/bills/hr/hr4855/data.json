Title IV: Pipeline Study - Requires the Secretary of Transportation to study and report to Congress on the transportation of methanol through the interstate liquid pipeline system in the United States. Title V: Allocation of Highway Revenues - Provides that for purposes of the minimum allocation of highway revenues to States, the amount of estimated tax payments attributable to highway users in any State shall be increased by the estimated amount of tax such users would have paid if there were no special tax rate or tax exemption under the Internal Revenue Code for any liquid which is at least 85 percent methanol, ethanol, or other alcohol. Title VI: Tax Incentives for the Use of Methanol As A Fuel - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit of $1,000 for each passenger automobile purchased by the taxpayer the primary fuel for which is methanol, which is domestically manufactured, and the original use of which commences with the taxpayer. Imposes a tax of four and a half cents a gallon in the case of methanol or ethanol fuel: (1) sold by a person to an operator of a motor vehicle or motorboat as fuel; or (2) used by any person as a fuel in a motor vehicle or motorboat unless there was already a taxable sale of such liquid.
