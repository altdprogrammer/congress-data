    "text": "Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to provide an annuity for any person who was a former spouse of a participant or former participant in the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System on February 15, 1981, and for whom no election is made by the participant or former participant. Declares that a former spouse shall not be qualified for an annuity if, before the annuity commences, the former spouse remarries before becoming 60 years old. Sets forth the method of determining when the annuity shall commence and when it shall terminate. Prohibits a former spouse who has been paid a lump-sum payment from receiving an annuity unless the former spouse returns the payment to the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund. Prohibits payment of an annuity until after the appropriate application has been provided to the Secretary of State. Directs the Secretary to: (1) prescribe the regulations for such application within 120 days of enactment of this Act; and (2) inform each person who was a former spouse on February 15, 1981, of any rights such person might have. Requires that limitations on health care payments to an eligible person shall be waived if the Secretary determines that the person's illness was clearly caused or materially aggravated because the person is or has been located abroad. (Current law authorizes waiver of such limitations.) Authorizes a former spouse of a member or former member of the Foreign Service to enroll in the health benefits plan which covered the former spouse before the divorce or separation if within 31 days of the date the divorce or separation becomes final the former spouse: (1) files an election for such enrollment; and (2) arranges to pay currently into the Employees Health Benefits Fund an amount equal to the sum of the employee and agency contributions payable by an employee in the same health benefits plan. Authorizes waiver of the 31 day time limit for enrollment by a former spouse. Permits any individual who becomes a former spouse on or before the date of enactment of this Act to enroll in a health benefits plan if, within six months of enactment of this Act, such individual files an election for such enrollment and arranges to make the appropriate payments. Requires the Secretary to take all practicable steps to: (1) determine the identity and address of each former spouse; and (2) notify such former spouse of that individual's rights to enrollment in a health benefits plan. Requires waiver of the six month time limit for enrollment by a former spouse if the Secretary determines the waiver is necessary. Declares that any former spouse who remarries before age 60 is not eligible to elect coverage by such a health benefit plan."
