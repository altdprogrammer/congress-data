Directs the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a demonstration project for a period of 12 months on Interstate Highway 66, in Virginia, which restricts the use of such highway to high occupancy vehicles (three or more occupants, not four or more, as now) during the morning and evening rush hours. Exempts vehicles which enter the highway at specified points from such restriction. Directs the Secretary to carry out an environmental assessment of such restrictions and report to Congress on the results of the assessment and demonstration project."
