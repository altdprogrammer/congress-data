    "text": "Major League Sports Community Protection Act of 1983 - Declares that it shall not be unlawful under any antitrust law for a professional sports league and its member clubs to enforce rules or agreements: (1) authorizing the league membership to decide that a member club shall not be relocated from its league-franchised home area; or (2) providing for the division of league or member club revenues to promote comparable economic opportunity for member clubs. Prohibits any person or league from changing the territory assigned to any professional football, basketball, hockey, or soccer team under any territorial agreement, unless: (1) a party to the stadium lease fails to comply with a materially significant provision thereof and such failure cannot be remedied within a reasonable period; (2) the stadium from which a team wishes to move is inadequate and the stadium authority shows no intent to correct the inadequacies; or (3) the team has lost money for three years. Requires that any civil action under the antitrust laws to challenge a league decision granting permission to a member club to relocate be commenced in a U.S. district court other than the court for the district from which or to which the club is relocating. Allows such a court to grant or deny relief exclusively through declaratory or injunctive orders. Specifies the applicability of this Act to pending actions involving the relocation of a professional sports club."
