Requires the district court in a diversity case to order the plaintiff to bring the action in a State court of proper jurisdiction in the State where the district court is located. Requires dismissal of the case if the plaintiff fails to do so. Allows the district court, in the interests of justice, to continue the original action, upon the motion of any party, if the State court does not dispose of the action within two years."
