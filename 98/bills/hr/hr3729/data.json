Rept. 98-564) Refugee Assistance Extension Act of 1984 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize appropriations as necessary for refugee assistance through 1986. Requires any agency receiving an initial resettlement grant (in addition to existing provisions) to: (1) provide quarterly performance and finance reports; (2) notify, upon request, local welfare offices of any cash assistance provided directly by such agency to a refugee; and (3) insure that refugees with medical conditions affecting the public health report to the appropriate health authorities in their resettlement areas. Terminates refugee cash assistance for three months for refusal to accept employment (six months for subsequent refusals). Prohibits: (1) such cash or medical assistance grants from being given as block or consolidated grants; and (2) the Director from delegating grant review or approval authority to the States or their political subdivisions. Directs the Attorney General to compensate States and counties for the incarceration of certain Cuban entrants."
