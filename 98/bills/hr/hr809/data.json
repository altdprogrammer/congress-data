    "text": "Title I: National Development Investment - National Development Investment Act - Amends the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to cite such Act as the National Development Investment Act and to revise the emphasis of such Act from primary Federal initiative to coordination of investments between the public and the private sectors. Sets forth the findings of Congress. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, upon the application of an eligible State, economic development district, distressed unit of local government (with a population under 50,000 and located outside an economic development district), Indian tribe, or nonprofit economic development organization, to make a grant for a portion of the cost of projects submitted in a development investment strategy. Sets forth eligible activities for such development investment assistance, including repairs, rehabilitation, and small business establishment. Sets forth specific eligibility criteria for applicants for such assistance. Requires an application for a grant under this Act to include: (1) a certification that the area concerned meets certain distress requirements; (2) a certification of any responsibilities which the Secretary has agreed to perform; and (3) a development investment strategy prepared in accordance with this Act. Requires the Secretary to consider specified purposes of this Act in approving applications. Lists as criteria any one of which an area must meet in order to be eligible for a grant under this Act: (1) a per capita income of 80 percent or less of the national average; (2) an unemployment rate above the national average for the most recent 24 month period; and (3) a sudden economic dislocation resulting in job loss. Sets forth the information to be contained in a grant applicant's development investment strategy. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to establish a revolving loan fund for making or guaranteeing loans to small businesses for initial or working capital, or the purchase of facilities or equipment. Limits to $1,000,000 the amount of any such grant. Limits the amount of any grant under this Act to a maximum 50 percent of the cost of completing the project as determined at the time of the grant application. Permits the Secretary to reduce or waive the non-Federal share of a project in the case of an Indian tribe. Limits expenditures in any one State to a maximum 15 percent of the appropriations made pursuant to this Act, except for expenditures to Indian tribes. Requires the Secretary, each fiscal year, to obligate minimum amounts of funds for such grants. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through FY 1986. Authorizes the Secretary to make economic development planning grants to States, economic development districts, Indian tribes, distressed counties, and distressed units of local government with population of over 50,000 if located outside an economic development district. Earmarks such grants for coordination of investment for community facilities, economic development, manpower training, and transportation services. Authorizes the Secretary to evaluate Federal, State, and local development investment efforts. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct any demonstration program to test the feasibility of new ways to increase productivity, foster innovative technology, match labor force with labor markets, or encourage economic diversity and regional balance. Limits the amount of any such grant to not more than 75 percent of the cost of economic development planning or of investment strategy preparation. Requires the Secretary, each fiscal year, to obligate minimum amounts of funds for such grants. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through FY 1986. Declares that the Secretary of Commerce shall administer this Act with the assistance of a specified Assistant Secretary of Commerce. Authorizes the Secretary to consult with other persons and agencies. Prohibits the approval of any grant unless the Secretary is satisfied that the project concerned will be properly and efficiently administered, operated, and maintained. Sets forth the powers of the Secretary under this Act. Permits the Secretary to discharge any of his responsibilities relative to a project by accepting a certification of the grant applicant's performance of such responsibilities. Requires the Secretary to make comprehensive annual reports to Congress detailing operations under this Act. Requires all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on projects assisted under this Act to be paid the prevailing rate of wage in the locality. Requires the Secretary to maintain a permanent record of all applications approved for financial assistance. Requires each recipient of assistance to keep records, to review the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness of the project, and to file an annual audit and biannual reports. Grants the Secretary and the Comptroller General access to any books, documents, papers, and records of any recipient, subrecipient, contractor, or subcontractor that are pertinent to assistance received under this Act. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1986. Declares that any contract entered into pursuant to this Act shall be effective only to such extent and in such amounts as may be provided in advance in an appropriation Act. Title II: Appalachian Regional Development - Appalachian Regional Development Act Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 to declare that investments under such Act shall also be made in severely distressed and underdeveloped counties lacking resources for basic services. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1988 for the administrative expenses of the Appalachian Regional Commission. Authorizes the Commission to lease office space through FY 1988. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1991 for the Appalachian development highway system. Increases from 70 to 80 percent the subsequent Federal share of an Appalachian development highway segment when a participating State proceeds to construct a segment of such a highway without the aid of Federal funds. Applies such increase to projects approved after March 31, 1979. Authorizes the Commission to make grants to States and public and nonprofit entities for projects which will: (1) assist in the creation or retention of permanent private sector jobs, the upgrading of the region's manpower, or the attraction of private investment; (2) provide special assistance to severely distressed and underdeveloped counties which lack financial resources for improving basic services; (3) assist in achieving the goal of making primary health care accessible in the region; or (4) otherwise serve the purposes of this Act. Prohibits the authorization of any financial assistance to enable plant subcontractors to undertake work previously performed in another area by other subcontractors or contractors. Prohibits grants with funds authorized after October 1, 1983, from exceeding 50 percent of the costs of any approved project. Permits such grants to increase the Federal contribution to any project to such percentage as the Commission determines within specified limitations. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1988. Extends the termination date of such Act from 1982 to October 1, 1988."
