    "text": "Professional Sports Team Relocation Act of 1983 - Prohibits an owner or operator of a professional sports team which has played for six consecutive years in a locality from relocating unless: (1) a party (other than the owner or operator) to any contract providing that games be played in such locality breaches the contract and does not remedy the breach within a reasonable time of receiving notice; (2) the team's playing facility is manifestly inadequate and the owner or operator of the facility does not demonstrate an intent to make the facility adequate; (3) the owner or operator of the team has incurred a net loss in each year of the three-year period ending on the proposed date of relocation or has incurred a net loss in any part of such period which threatens the financial viability of the team; or (4) proper notice is given to the local government, as required by this Act, and such government consents to the relocation. Requires the owner or operator of a professional sports team intending to relocate the team to give, not later than one year before the date of the proposed relocation, written notice of the proposed relocation to the local government having jurisdiction over the area from which the team is moving. Authorizes such local government to bring a civil action in the appropriate U.S. district court if a team relocates in violation of the requirements of this Act."
