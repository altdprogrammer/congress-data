Terminates the authority of the President to carry out such actions: (1) five years after the effective date of this Act; or (2) at the close of the first, second, third, or fourth anniversary of such date unless the President submits a specified affirmative annual determination before each such anniversary to the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. Defines an affirmative annual determination as a determination by the President that during the past year the steel industry has: (1) committed substantially all of its net cash flow from carbon and alloy steel product operations for purposes of reinvestment in, and modernization of, that industry; and (2) taken sufficient action to maintain its international competitiveness. Prohibits the President from finding compliance with the reinvestment and modernization requirement unless: (1) each major company with significant reinvestment or modernization needs has committed all of its net cash flow (except that required for retraining) from carbon and alloy steel product operations during the applicable 12-month period to meet those needs; and (2) each major company that has or reasonably anticipates significant unemployment in such operations has committed for the applicable 12 - month period not less than one percent of such net cash flow to the retraining of workers, including those laid off at any time since January 1, 1982. Directs the President in making such determination to take into account such information as may be available from the U.S. International Trade Commission and other appropriate sources. Directs the Secretary of Labor to report to Congress, within six months of the effective date of this Act, a plan for assisting workers in communities that are adversely affected by imports of carbon and alloy steel products. Title IX: Wine Trade - Wine Equity and Export Expansion Act of 1984 - Directs the U.S. Trade Representative to designate as a major wine trading country each foreign country or group of foreign countries represented as an economic union that: (1) is a potential significant market for U.S. wine; and (2) maintains tariff barriers or nontariff barriers to (or other distortions of) trade in U.S. wine. Sets forth factors to be considered in determining whether to designate a country as a major wine trading country. Requires the President to direct the U.S. Trade Representative to enter into consultations with each major wine trading country to seek a reduction or elimination of that country's tariff barriers and nontariff barriers to (or other distortions of) trade in U.S. wine. Directs the President to notify the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee on specified efforts to expand opportunities in each major wine trading country for exports of U.S. wine. Requires each such notification (consisting of separate reports for each major wine trading country) to include: (1) a description of each act, policy, and practice in that country that constitutes a tariff or nontariff barrier to (or other distortion of) trade in U.S. wine; (2) an assessment of whether such act, policy, or practice is subject to international agreements; (3) information with respect to any action taken or proposed to eliminate or reduce each such act, policy, or practice; (4) an explanation if such action was not taken; and (5) recommendations to the Congress of any additional legislative authority or other action to obtain the elimination or reduction of foreign tariff barriers or nontariff barriers to trade in U.S. wine. Directs the President to take all appropriate actions under the Trade Act of 1974 to enforce the rights of the United States under a trade agreement or to obtain the elimination of an act, policy, or practice of a major wine trading country if the President has reason to believe that such act, policy, or practice constitutes a tariff barrier or nontariff barrier to (or other distortion of) trade in U.S. wine and: (1) is inconsistent with the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement; or (2) is unjustifiable, unreasonable, or discriminatory and burdens or restricts U.S commerce. Requires the U.S. Trade Representative to consult with the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee and with representatives of the U.S. wine and grape products industries: (1) before identifying tariff and nontariff barriers to the U.S. wine trade and before designating major wine trading countries; (2) in developing the reports to such Committees; and (3) for purposes of determining whether action by the President is appropriate under the Trade Act of 1974. Encourages the President to: (1) use, for FY 1985, certain authority under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 to make available sufficient funds to initiate an export promotion program for U.S. wine; and (2) request, for each subsequent fiscal year, an appropriation for such a wine export promotion program."
