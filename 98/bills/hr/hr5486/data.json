Prohibits Federal agencies from extending Federal financial assistance to any youth-oriented organization which does not comply with this Act. Allows the chief legal officer of each State to establish a plan for the functioning of a State funneling agency to permit youth- oriented organizations to comply with this Act. Permits such plan to be submitted to the Department of Justice for the approval of the Attorney General. Establishes guidelines for State funneling agencies to receive records and information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Sets forth security procedures for the records and information acquired and maintained by the State. Requires States to have in effect criminal and civil penalties and remedies for any security violation or unauthorized disclosure of records or information. Requires State and local governments to promptly report to the Department of Justice convictions for sexual offenses involving children."
