Permits the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to exempt any class of persons from the application of such regulation. Sets forth the private right of action for violations of such margin requirements. Applies the provisions of this Act to any purchase or carrying of securities 30 days after enactment of this Act, if the loan or extension of credit involved originated, or if the loan proceeds used were disbursed, on or after such date."
