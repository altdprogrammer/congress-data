    "text": "National Community Notification Act of 1984 - Requires a business concern to give written notice of intent to undertake scale-down of operations at an establishment in a State. Requires such notice whenever such action would result in a 50 percent employment loss at such concern in any one-year period. Requires that such notice include a statement of: (1) the nature of the establishment; (2) the reasons for the scale-down; (3) any alternatives; (4) the estimated employment loss; (5) any proposal to minimize the effects of the scale-down on employees and on local governments; (6) the establishment's economic circumstances and any plans for future employment there; (7) the business concern's economic circumstances and the feasibility of transferring employees affected by such scaledown of operations to other establishments of such business concern; and (8) available resources from Federal, State, and local governments and the business concern relating to employment retraining and social services designed to alleviate the hardship such scale-down will cause. Requires that such notice be given to: (1) the Secretary of Labor; (2) the employees and labor union representatives; and (3) such units of State and local government as the Secretary may require by regulation. Requires, with specified exceptions, that such notice be given before the business concern takes such action (in connection with any intended scale- down of operations) to reduce the working hours, or suspend or terminate the employment of any employee. Requires that such notice be given not later than: (1) one year before taking such action, if the number of affected employees who will suffer such employment loss exceeds 100; and (2) six calendar months, if the number of affected employees who will suffer such employment loss is more than 50 but less than 100. Provides that only business concerns employing 100 or more employees shall be affected by this Act. Permits such notice to be later than such required deadlines, upon request of a business concern, if the Secretary finds that an increase in the number of employees at such establishment within the applicable required time period, or other circumstances beyond the control of the business concern, make it impossible for such business concerns to comply with such required dealine. Sets alternative deadlines if in the one-year period begining on the date of enactment of this Act sufficient time does not elapse to permit a business concern to comply with the applicable required deadline. Directs the Secretary, within 30 days after receiving the required notice, to notify each employee at the affected establishment of the summary of information gained from the business concern. Sets forth criminal and civil penalties for specified violations of this Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act for FY 1984."
