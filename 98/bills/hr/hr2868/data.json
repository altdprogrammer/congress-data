    "text": "Truth in Budgeting Act of 1983 - Amends the Federal Financing Bank Act of 1973 to require that the programs financed through the Federal Financing Bank be included in the totals of the Federal budget. Authorizes the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to issue regulations prescribing the manner in which this Act is implemented. Prohibits a Federal agency (other than the Treasury) from issuing, selling, or guaranteeing an obligation of a type ordinarily financed in investment securities markets unless the terms of the obligation prohibit any person or entity except the Bank or a Federal agency from holding it. Permits the Secretary of the Treasury to waive such requirement with respect to obligations which the Secretary determines: (1) are not suitable investments for the Bank; or (2) are financed in a manner which is least disruptive of private financial markets and institutions."
