    "text": "Revises general defense procurement contract law to require a contractor who must deliver technical data or computer software in connection with parts or components which are subject to replacement (spare parts) to grant the contracting agency unlimited rights to the use of such data or software. Grants the United States limited rights in data relating to a component or modification developed completely at private expenses, sufficient to allow subsequent competitive procurement of parts and components from another manufacturer. Restricts the dissemination of proprietary technical data through contract procedures. Directs the Secretary of Defense to examine all current supplies in which the U.S. has only limited rights in the technical data, including an independent contractor's examination of any claims that an item was developed completely at private expenses. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress within the year on such examination."
