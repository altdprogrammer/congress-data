    "text": "Nonimmigrant Worker Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to separate temporary agricultural labor from other temporary labor for purposes of nonimmigrant worker (H-2 visa) provisions. Prohibits the employment of such agricultural workers for more than nine months in a calendar year. Permits the Secretary of Labor to extend such period for pre-existing occupations or extenuating circumstances. Prohibits entry to workers who have violated entry conditions within the past five years. Requires an employer H-2 visa petition to certify that: (1) there are not enough local U.S. workers for the job; and (2) similarly employed U.S. workers' wages will not be adversely affected. Permits the Secretary to charge application fees. Prohibits the Secretary from approving such petition if: (1) the job is open because of a strike or lock-out; or (2) the employer violated temporary worker admissions terms within the past two years or failed to pay a civil penalty for such violation. Provides that an employer may not be denied a certification for more than three years for any such admission violation. Provides with regard to agricultural workers that: (1) the employer need not submit a labor certification (petition) more than 65 days in advance of need; (2) the Secretary shall require a 45-day domestic worker recruitment period; (3) producer associations may file such petitions; and (4) the Secretary shall establish expedited procedures for review of denied petitions or de novo administrative hearings. Requires the Secretary to: (1) report annually to Congress regarding such nonimmigrant worker provisions and their domestic effects; and (2) establish employment standards which are at least comparable to those under existing regulations. Authorizes appropriations beginning with FY 1984 to recruit domestic workers and monitor the nonimmigrant worker program. Requires a program improvement report within 18 months. Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should establish an advisory commission to consult with Mexico and advise the Attorney General regarding such temporary worker program."
