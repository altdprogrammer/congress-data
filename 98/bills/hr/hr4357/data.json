    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to treat as ordinary income any gain realized by any one-percent (or more) stockholder in a stock sale transaction in which the consideration per share of stock exceeds the prevailing market price for such stock. Disallows all corporate income tax deductions attributable to such a transaction. Disallows corporate income tax deductions for any amounts paid by a corporation under a management protection agreement. Defines \"management protection agreement\" as any agreement in which the corporation guarantees continued payments to an employee whose employment is terminated within a specified period after a change in the ownership or control of the corporation. Exempts management protection agreements which do not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. Requires the beneficiary of a management protection agreement to include any payments received in gross income as ordinary income."
