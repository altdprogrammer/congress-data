    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 98-861) Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 - Division A - Tax Reform Act of 1984 - Title I: Tax Freeze; Tax Reforms Generally - Subtitle A: Deferral of Certain Tax Reductions - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to defer from 1985 to 1987 the scheduled increase in the maximum amount of used property eligible for the investment tax credit. (Present law schedules an increase from $125,000 to $150,000 in 1985.) Amends the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 to defer from 1984 to 1988 the effective date of special rules relating to the finance leasing of limited use property and fixed price purchase options. Exempts from such postponement of finance leasing rules: (1) up to $150,000,000 of a qualified lessee's automotive manufacturing property; and (2) property that is part of a coal-fired cogeneration facility for which certification and construction permit applications were filed on specified dates. Freezes the maximum amount of personal property which businesses may elect to expense (in order to claim a tax deduction for such property) each year at $5,000 through 1987.

Title VII: Competition in Contracting - Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 - Subtitle A: Amendments to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to revise Government procurement procedures. Requires any executive agency, when procuring property or services, to obtain full and open competition by using the competitive procedures best suited under the circumstances. Directs any agency to solicit sealed bids when: (1) time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation of sealed bids; (2) the award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors; (3) discussions with responding sources are not necessary; and (4) there is a reasonable expectation of receiving more than one bid. Directs an agency to request competitive proposals when sealed bids are not appropriate. Allows an agency to exclude a particular source when using competitive procedures in order to establish or maintain any alternative source of supply upon determining that to do so would: (1) increase or maintain competition and reduce costs; (2) serve national defense interests by having a facility available for furnishing property or service in case of a national emergency or industrial mobilization; or (3) serve national defense interests by establishing or maintaining an essential engineering, research, or development capability. Allows an agency to restrict competition under a solicitation to small businesses to fulfill statutory requirements concerning small businesses. Authorizes an agency to use procedures other than competitive procedures only when: (1) there is only one source and no substitute for the property or service needed; (2) the agency's need for the property or service is of such unusual or compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the sources from which it solicits bids or proposals; (3) it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source to maintain a source available for furnishing property or services in a national emergency, to achieve industrial mobilization, or to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability; (4) an international agreement or treaty with a foreign government or international organization requires such procedures; (5) a statute authorizes or requires that the procurement be made through another agency or a specified source; (6) the agency needs to procure a brand name commercial item for authorized resale; (7) disclosure of an agency's needs would compromise national security unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources; (8) the agency head notifies Congress that it is in the public interest to use other than competitive procedures in a particular procurement; or (9) the award of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment to other than the original source is likely to result in a substantial duplication of cost or unacceptable delays. Prohibits an agency from awarding a contract using other than competitive procedures unless: (1) the contracting officer justifies the use of such procedures in writing and certifies the accuracy and completeness of such justification; (2) such justification is approved by the competition advocate for the procuring activity, the head of the procuring activity or delegate, or the senior procurement executive of the agency, depending on the value of the contract; and (3) any required procurement notice has been published and all bids or proposals received in response to such notice have been considered. Lists required contents of such a justification. Prohibits any agency from procuring goods or services: (1) using other than competitive procedures on the basis of a lack of planning or agency procurement funds; or (2) from another agency unless such other agency complies with the procurement requirements of this Act. Requires the establishment of special simplified procedures for small purchases of property and services (purchases not exceeding $25,000). Directs an agency, in preparing for a procurement activity, to: (1) use advance procurement planning and market research; and (2) solicit bids and develop solicitation specifications so as to achieve full and open competition. Requires all solicitations for bids or proposals for other than small purchases to state: (1) the relative importance of all significant factors which the agency will consider in evaluating such bids or proposals; (2) in the case of sealed bids, that there will be no discussions with bidders; and (3) in the case of competitive proposals, that proposals are intended to be evaluated with discussions with the offerors, but might be evaluated without discussions. Requires each agency to: (1) evaluate bids and proposals solely on the basis of factors specified in the solicitation; and (2) award contracts to the bidder or offeror whose bid or proposal is most advantageous to the Government, considering the price and other factors. Permits an agency to reject all bids or proposals if such action is in the public interest. Requires an agency, when evaluating competitive proposals, to award a contract: (1) after conducting written or oral discussions with all offerors submitting proposals within a specified range; or (2) on the basis of the proposals as received without discussions with the offerors (beyond minor clarifications) when it can be demonstrated from the existence of full and open competition or accurate prior cost experience with the product or service that acceptance of an initial proposal without discussions would result in the lowest overall cost to the Government. Defines \"competitive procedures\" to include: (1) procurement procedures providing for full and open competition; (2) procurement of architectural or engineering services conducted in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949; (3) the competitive selection of basic research proposals resulting from a general solicitation and the peer or scientific review of such proposals; and (4) the procedures for the multiple awards schedule program of the General Services Administration (GSA) if participation has been open to all responsible sources and the orders and contracts under such procedures result in the lowest overall cost to the Government. Requires a prime Government contractor or subcontractor, with specified exceptions, to submit and certify the accuracy of cost or pricing data before: (1) the award of contracts using other than sealed bid procedures and certain subcontracts if the price is expected to exceed $100,000; or (2) the pricing of any modification to such a contract or subcontract is expected to result in a price adjustment exceeding $100,000. Requires the price to the Government of such a contract, subcontract, or modification to be adjusted to exclude any significant amount by which the price was increased because of inaccurate data. Authorizes an agency representative, for three years after final payment under such a contract or subcontract, to examine the contractor's records and other information to evaluate the accuracy of the cost and pricing data. Directs the board of contract appeals of GSA to review any decision of an agency contracting officer concerning the procurement of automatic data processing equipment that is alleged to violate procurement law. Directs the board, if a request for such a review is filed before or within ten days after the contract is awarded, to: (1) hold a hearing within ten days to determine whether to suspend the GSA Administrator's procurement authority or the Administrator's delegation of procurement authority for the protested procurement pending the board's decision; and (2) suspend such authority unless the agency concerned establishes that urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect U.S. interests will not permit waiting for the board's decision. Requires the board to issue its final decision within 45 working days unless the board's chairman determines that unique circumstances require a longer period. Authorizes the board to: (1) dismiss frivolous or invalid protests; (2) suspend, revoke, or revise procurement authority applicable to a challenged procurement which violates procurement law; and (3) award an appropriate party the costs of filing and pursuing the protest and of preparing a bid or proposal. Provides for the appeal of the board's determination as set forth in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. Declares that a contract affected by the board's action after the contract has been awarded shall be presumed to be valid as to goods or services delivered and accepted before such action. Terminates on January 15, 1988, the authority of the board to review and modify agency procurement authority for automatic data processing equipment. Subtitle B: Amendments to Title 10, United States Code - Amends the Armed Services Procurement Act to revise procurement procedures for the Department of Defense, the military services, the Coast Guard, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to correspond with the procurement procedures set forth in this title. Prohibits the head of an agency from delegating the authority to determine that the use of noncompetitive procurement procedures is necessary in the public interest. Subtitle C: Amendments to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act - Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to require each executive agency to furnish for publication by the Secretary of Commerce in the Commerce Business Daily a notice announcing: (1) its intention to solicit bids or proposals for a contract at a price expected to exceed $10,000; and (2) the award of a contract for a price exceeding $25,000 if there is likely to be a subcontract. Directs an agency not to: (1) issue a solicitation earlier than 15 days after such solicitation notice is published; or (2) provide less than 30 days after such notice is published for the submission of bids. Requires that such notice include: (1) an accurate description of the property or service to be procured; (2) the name, address, and phone number of the contracting officer and the agency representative to contact to obtain a copy of the solicitation; (3) a statement that all responsible sources may submit a bid or proposal; and (4) a justification of any use of noncompetitive procuedures. Declares that such solicitation notice requirements shall not apply: (1) if such notice would disclose agency needs the disclosure of which would compromise national security; (2) to any procurement resulting from an unsolicited proposal that demonstrates a unique or innovative research concept if publication of any notice of such proposal would disclose the innovativeness of the proposal or proprietary information; (3) to any procurement made against an order placed under a requirements contract; (4) to any procurement made for perishable subsistence supplies; or (5) to any procurement for which the agency head and the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy concur that it is not appropriate to publish a notice before issuing a solicitation. Requires each executive agency to: (1) maintain a computer file for five years, by fiscal year, containing unclassified records of all competitive procurements (with competitive procurements for which only one bid was received listed separately) and noncompetitive procurements, excluding small purchases; and (2) transmit such information to GSA for entry into the Federal Procurement Data System. Requires the head of each executive agency to designate an employee (other than the senior procurement executive) to serve as an advocate for competition for the agency and for each procuring activity of the agency. Directs each advocate to: (1) be responsible for promoting and challenging barriers to full and open competition in agency procurement; (2) report to the agency's senior procurement executive on actions taken to achieve full and open competition, conditions restricting such competition, such advocate's activities during the preceding year, barriers to competition, and initiatives to increase competition; and (3) recommend to such executive goals and plans to increase competition and a system of personal and organizational accountability for competition. Directs the head of each executive agency to submit to each house of Congress annual reports for FY 1986 through 1990 describing: (1) agency actions taken to increase competition for contracts and to reduce the number and dollar value of noncompetitive contracts; and (2) activities of the agency's advocate for competition. Requires each agency head to increase the use of full and open competition in agency procurement by practices that assure that the agency receives a sufficient number of bids or proposals from responsible sources to meet the Government's requirements at the lowest reasonable cost.

Prohibits any contract from being awarded or, if awarded within the preceding ten days, performed after a notice of protest has been received and while the protest is pending. Authorizes the head of the agency to authorize the award or performance of a contract notwithstanding a protest after notifying the Comptroller General that compelling, urgent circumstances significantly affecting interests of the United States will not permit awaiting the Comptroller General's decision.

Requires certification of such deposits to be included with required annual certified statements. Requires each insured credit union to pay to and maintain with the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund a deposit in an amount equaling one percent of the credit union's insured shares. Provides for the return of such deposit in the event that its insurance coverage is terminated, it converts to insurance coverage from another source, or in the event the operations of the fund are transferred from the National Credit Union Administration Board. Requires the Board, when at the end of a given insurance year any loans to the Fund from the Government and the interest thereon have been repaid and the equity of the fund exceeds the normal operating level, to effect a pro rata distribution to insured credit unions of an amount sufficient to reduce the equity in the Fund to its normal operating level. Repeals the provisions of such Act which allowed the Board to reduce the premium charge for insurance in such instances. Includes share, share draft, and share certificates within the definition of insured shares. Requires the Board to make annual reports to Congress with respect to the operating level of the Fund, including the results of an independent audit of the Fund.

Specifies various information to be included in such study. Requires CBO, on a trial basis, to conduct a review of the budget estimates prepared by the Department of Defense and one civilian agency to determine: (1) whether there is a systematic underestimation of costs; and (2) what effects any systematic costing errors may have upon the long-run costs of programs, the mix of programs implemented, and the effectiveness of programs in meeting agency missions and goals. Requires the General Accounting Office to look at all phases of budget preparation and program evaluation and to examine historical patterns of funding to determine the effect of cost estimation biases. Requires each of the Directors of CBO and OMB to conduct a study of the administrative feasibility and potential impact of applying alternative formula approaches to the entire Federal budget.
