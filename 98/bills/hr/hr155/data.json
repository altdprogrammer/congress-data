    "text": "Title I - Short Title; Findings and Declaration of Policy; Definitions - Public Land Reform Act of 1983 - Declares that it is Federal policy to transfer legal title to all unreserved, unappropriated public lands to the States for which such lands had been held in trust by the Federal Government. Applies such policy to all lands owned or controlled by the United States and located within State boundaries wholly west of the the one-hundredth meridian. Specifies exceptions. Title II: Federal Land Transfer Board - Directs the President, upon request by the Governor of a State, to create a Federal Land Transfer Board (FLTB) to effect land transfers to any State seeking acquisition of unreserved, unappropriated public lands within its boundaries. Specifies procedures under which FLTBs shall convey Federal rights, title and interest to the States. Authorizes an FTLB to adjudicate claims or disputes arising under the Act. Creates the right to petition the Board for dispute resolution. Establishes procedures for review of previous Board determinations. Authorizes judicial review of final Board decisions by a United States court of appeals. Title III: State Land Management Agencies - Requires establishment of a State Land Management Agency (SLMA) as a prerequisite to State entitlement to lands under this Act. Specifies the powers and responsibilities of an SLMA, and the manner in which it shall administer lands as trustee. Title IV: Conveyance from State Ownership - Imposes restrictions upon State conveyance of lands acquired under this Act. Title V: Miscellaneous - Retains Federal jurisdiction over waters otherwise subject to transfer under this Act, including projects of the Corps of Engineers and the Water and Power Resources Service. Authorizes interstate compacts related to land and water use. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct cost/benefit analyses of Federal and State land management activities and to report the results to Congress. Authorizes appropriations."
