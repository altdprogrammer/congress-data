Broadens the number of agencies and organizations recognized by Congress as participants in native latex research and commercialization to include the National Science Foundation and other public and private industrial research groups. Recognizes the need to develop domestic agricultural sources for products other than rubber which are of strategic and industrial importance. Expands the definition of \"native\" to include other North American agricultural crops of strategic and industrial importance (presently limited to hydrocarbon-containing plants, including guayule). Eliminates the definition of \"regional commissions\" (no longer in existence). Renames the Joint Commission on Guayule Research and Commercialization the Joint Commission on Research and Development of Critical Agricultural Materials. Expands the Commission's membership to include representatives from the Departments of State and Defense, respectively, and from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to select the Commission Chairman from the Department of Agriculture (USDA) members. Broadens the Commission's scope of authority to seek technical advice. States that the USDA shall be the lead agency in carrying out such Act. Expands USDA and Department of Commerce latex research and development provision to include such other agricultural materials. Requires USDA research to: (1) include large-scale (10,000 acres or more) experimental planting to supply a developmental rubber processing facility; (2) accelerate present latex breeding and genetic activities; and (3) develop and construct such rubber processing facility. Directs the Secretary to establish within USDA an Office of Critical Agricultural Materials. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative projects, including the extraction and processing of latex and critical agricultural materials produced in the United States, with Australia and Israel. Broadens State contract and assistance authority of USDA and the Department of Commerce to include projects for all critical agricultural materials (presently only for latex). Broadens similar USDA and Commerce authority regarding regional, national, and international conferences. Includes the Department of State within the scope of Federal agency coordination under such Act. Permits sales of byproducts to other Federal agencies for testing purposes. Extends reporting requirements through 1987. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1988. States that after FY 1988, activities under such Act shall be limited to critical agricultural materials other than native latex."
