Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in New Hampshire shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in New Hampshire which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in New Hampshire reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in New Hampshire without express congressional authorization. States that the provisions above shall also apply to: (1) national forest system roadless areas in New Hampshire which were evaluated in the Kancamagus, Waterville Valley, and Presidential unit plans; and (2) national forest system lands in New Hampshire which are less than 5,000 acres in size. Provides that the Kilkenny Unit Plan Area shall be considered for all uses, including wilderness, during preparation of a forest plan for the White Mountain National Forest. Title II: Wild and Scenic River Study - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate a segment of the Wildcat Brook River in New Hampshire for potential addition to the national wild and scenic rivers system. Title III: National Forest Boundary Expansion - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to purchase lands contiguous to the White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire which are known as the Pilot Range Tracts and which shall be added to such forest. Provides that for purposes of the allocation of land and water conservation fund moneys for land and water acquisition pursuant to the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, the boundary of the White Mountain National Forest shall be treated as if it were the boundary as of January 1, 1965. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title."
