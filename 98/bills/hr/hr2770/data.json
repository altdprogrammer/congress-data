Grants to Hungary and the People's Republic of China for that period: (1) most-favored-nation treatment; and (2) eligibility to participate in any U.S. program that extends credits or credit or investment guarantees. Declares that specified bilateral commercial agreements between the United States and Hungary and between the United States and the People's Republic of China shall be treated as having been renewed for that five year period."
