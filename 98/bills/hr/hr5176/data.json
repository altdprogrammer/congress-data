    "text": "Satellite Television Viewing Rights Act of 1984 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize any person to manufacture, import, distribute, sell, or lease equipment for use in receiving satellite television programming, and to receive satellite programming which is not encrypted, without obligation to any person. Allows any person to receive encrypted programming decoded for private viewing upon compliance with rates, terms, and conditions established by agreement or by the Federal Communications Commission. Prohibits any person from manufacturing, importing, distributing, selling, or leasing equipment intended for the unauthorized reception and decoding of encrypted programming by persons not complying with such requirements. Prohibits any producer or distributor of encrypted programming from requiring a person to purchase or lease decoding equipment from a specific source in order to receive such programming. Prohibits any owner of such programming from restricting the availability of such programming for private viewing, except as provided under this Act. Authorizes the Commission to establish rates, terms, and conditions governing a person's rights to view encrypted programming on the petition of such person if such person is not subject to an agreement or order covering such programming. Authorizes any person who is a party to such an agreement to file the agreement with the Commission. Provides that such agreement shall be placed upon public notice and shall be deemed certified as binding upon the class of persons identified therein unless, within 30 days, a person files an objection alleging that he or she would be directly and adversely affected by certification of such agreement. Sets forth criteria to be considered by the Commission in determining whether such agreement should be certified. Authorizes the Commission, upon the expiration of such an agreement and upon petition by a person subject to such agreement, to issue interim orders necessary to preserve the viewing rights of the persons or class previously subject to such agreement. Authorizes any person subject to such an agreement to commence a civil action in U.S. district court seeking specific performance, actual damages, or such other relief as may be necessary to insure compliance with such agreement. Sets forth penalties for willful violations of this Act."
