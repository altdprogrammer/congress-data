Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to extend authorizations for trade adjustment assistance programs for workers and firms through FY 1985. Requires the Secretary of Labor to certify a group of workers as eligible to apply for such assistance if he or she determines that increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such workers' firm contributed importantly to such total or partial separation, or threat thereof, and to such decline in sales or production. Provides that the Secretary of Commerce, when considering whether to grant a direct loan or to guarantee a loan to a corporation which is otherwise certified under this Act, shall give preference to such corporation that has established and maintains an employee stock ownership plan. Sets forth the requirements for such employee stock ownership plan."
