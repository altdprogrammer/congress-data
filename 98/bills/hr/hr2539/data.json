Declares that such assistance should be provided through private and voluntary organizations, to the maximum extent possible. Authorizes obligating FY 1984 and 1985 funds for development assistance, military assistance, economic support, or military education for Haiti or extending credit or guarantees under the Arms Control Act for Haiti only if the President determines that Haiti is: (1) continuing to cooperate with the United States in halting illegal emigration to the United States from Haiti; (2) cooperating in implementing U.S. assistance programs in Haiti; (3) continuing to comply with the fiscal performance targets set by the International Monetary Fund; and (4) making a concerted and significant effort to improve the human rights situation in Haiti. Requires the President to report to Congress every six months on the extent to which the actions of the Government of Haiti are consistent with each of those conditions. Authorizes using FY 1984 and 1985 foreign assistance funds to work with Haiti to halt significant illegal emigration from Haiti to the United States."
