    "text": "National Defense Education Act of 1983 - Amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to establish a program of assistance for science, mathematics, and foreign language education at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) for programs to improve educational achievement standards. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations to ensure that LEAs achieve qualitative and quantitative educational improvements as a condition of obtaining assistance under such Act. Sets forth application requirements for such grants. Sets forth authorized uses for such grants relating to mathematics, science, and foreign language education, including: (1) development of new curricula and requirements; (2) purchase of laboratory equipment and computers; (3) in-service training and summer institutes for teachers; (4) expansion of summer school programs; (5) purchase of new textbooks and related materials; (6) funding specialists in such fields for elementary education; (7) costs of more stringent standards for graduation, including remedial classes; (8) costs of certification of graduates of postsecondary institutions as teachers in such fields; and (9) demonstration projects for school-year extension. Directs the Secretary to carry out a program of establishing and maintaining funds at institutions of higher education for making low-interest loans to students who: (1) pursue courses of study in mathematics, science, or a foreign language leading to a baccalaureate degree; and (2) intend to enter the profession of teaching such subjects in elementary or secondary schools. Directs the Secretary to make payments to each institution based on its estimated needs for making such loans. Sets forth requirements for applications and agreements relating to such funds. Sets forth limitations on the amount of such loans to an individual student. Sets forth conditions for student eligibility and agreements for such loans. Sets forth loan repayment conditions. Provides for cancellation of 25 percent of such loan for each complete academic year of service as a full-time science or mathematics teacher in an elementary or secondary school (as well as cancellation of all interest accruing on such loan during such year). Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to institutions of higher education for programs of competency testing for students in mathematics, science, and foreign languages in order to determine appropriate undergraduate instruction programs. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to institutions of higher education for continuing education programs for secondary school teachers of science, mathematics, and foreign languages to improve skills and assist in qualification for certification. Sets forth application requirements for such grants. Authorizes the Secretary to award fellowships for graduate study in mathematics, sciences, engineering, and foreign languages to students of superior ability who intend to teach such subjects at elementary, secondary, or postsecondary levels. Limits each fellowship award to a 60-month maximum period. Directs the Secretary to select a panel from the Department of Education to determine such fellowship awards and amounts. Requires nomination by an institution of higher education for such a fellowship. Permits use of such fellowship at any accredited institution of higher education. Conditions continued fellowship payments on maintenance of satisfactory proficiency and full-time study or research in the field for which the fellowship was awarded. Obligates fellowship recipients to teach one year for each year of the fellowship or to repay the total amount of the fellowship, plus interest, at a rate prescribed by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to award grants to colleges for programs of education in high-technology areas. Requires colleges to consult, and coordinate such programs, with other job-training efforts on the Federal, State, and local levels. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to colleges to assist them in long-range planning for engineering programs. Requires colleges to obtain matching funds from non-Federal sources to be eligible for such grants. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
