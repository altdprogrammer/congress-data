    "text": "Sunset Program Evaluation Act of 1983 - Title I: Authorizations of New Budget Authority - Requires Government programs to be evaluated pursuant to a specified schedule to determine whether each such program should be continued, terminated, or altered (sunset review). Prohibits the authorization of new budget authority for a period of more than six years. Exempts from the requirements of this Act specified programs such as interest on Federal debts, health care services, general retirement and disability payments, as well as litigation activities which have as their objectives the protection and implementation of civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and specified retirement pay and benefits. Prohibits the authorization of new budget authority for any program for which there has not been conducted a sunset review. Requires that the report accompanying such review contain specified information. Provides that before the Congress can appropriate funds for any program, after its first review date, there must be a specific authorization in law to support the appropriation. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in consultation with the Director of the Congressional Research Service (CRS), to compile a list of programs subject to a review date for which new budget authority was not authorized. Title II: Program Inventory - Requires the Director of CBO, in cooperation with the Comptroller General and the Director of CRS, to compile and report to Congress by July 1, 1985, an inventory of Federal programs. Requires that the report specify the duration of the new budget authority provided for each program. Enumerates information to be included in the inventory, including the identification of congressional committees having jurisdiction over each program and the agency responsible for administering each program. Requires the congressional committees to review the program inventory and suggest revisions. Requires that the program inventory be revised at the end of each session of Congress, and that such revisions be reported to each House. Requires that periodic reports tabulate the progress of congressional action on bills and resolutions authorizing budget authority for programs in the inventory. Directs the Director of CBO to submit periodic reports to the Congress on the adequacy of the functional and subfunctional categories used for grouping programs of like missions or objectives for review. Title III: Program Evaluation - Requires each House of Congress to select from programs scheduled for sunset review in a given Congress a number of programs for comprehensive evaluation. Requires the President and each congressional committee to recommend such programs. Directs the Budget Committees of each House to incorporate such recommended programs into a resolution for consideration by each House. Sets forth the criteria for evaluating each program continued in such an approved resolution, including an assessment of the degree to which the program attained congressional objectives, and an analysis of the services which could be provided if the program were continued at a lower or higher level. Permits congressional committees which have jurisdiction over common programs to conduct a joint evaluation of any such program. Requires each committee conducting an evaluation to submit to Congress a report on its findings during the session of Congress in which the review date for the program occurs. Directs the President to submit to Congress an evaluation and recommendations concerning each program. Title IV: Citizens' Commission on the Organization and Operation of Government - Establishes, as an independent instrumentality of the United States, the Citizens' Commission on the Organization and Operation of Government to study the organization and operation of all authorities of the executive branch and to make recommendations to promote economic, efficient, and improved services in the transaction of public business. Requires the Commission to submit interim reports to the President and the Congress, and to submit a final report with its findings and recommendations. Requires the Comptroller General to report once a year for two years on the status of actions taken as a result of the report. Specifies the composition of the 18-member Commission and sets forth the duties and powers of the Commission. States that the Commission shall cease to exist 90 days after submission of its final report. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Title. Title V: Miscellaneous - Amends the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 to permit the committees of Congress to obtain from Federal agencies estimates or requests for appropriations, or requests for increases in an item of any such estimate or request, and recommendations as to how the revenue needs of the Government should be met. Requires each agency which administers a program scheduled for review, if requested by Congress, to submit a report setting forth the regulations to be retained, eliminated, or modified if the program is reauthorized. Requires the Comptroller General to furnish Congress with the results of prior audits and reviews of programs being reviewed under this Act. Sets forth House and Senate procedure for the consideration of a sunset reauthorization bill. Stipulates that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to specified agencies until January 1, 1993."
