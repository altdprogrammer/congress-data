    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-06-29", 
    "text": "Competitive American Exports Act of 1984 - Declares that it is the policy of the United States to insist that participants in the Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits honor their pledge not to offer \"tied aid credit\" containing a grant element less than the minimum specified in the Guidelines. Defines \"tied aid credit\" to mean credit which is: (1) provided for development aid purposes; (2) financed by public funds or, as a mixed credit, partly from public and partly from private funds; and (3) tied to the purchase of exports from the country granting the credit. Declares that the United States shall try to negotiate an increase in the minimum grant element of tied aid credits. Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to establish the Competitive Tied Aid Fund. Requires the money in the Fund to be used to cover a portion of the subsidy contained in any credit granted by the Bank. Requires the Bank to extend to any American exporter or firm whose sale of goods is jeopardized by competition in the form of foreign official tied aid credit offers a tied aid credit offer which is substantially equal to the foreign official tied aid credit. Requires the Board of Directors, within ten days of depletion of the Fund, to report to Congress on the amount of funding needed to continue carrying out the tied aid credit program for the remainder of the current fiscal year. Permits the Bank to extend such credit when the Board of Directors and the Secretary of the Treasury determine that: (1) the credit will help U.S. exports competing with exports assisted by foreign official financing in the form of a tied aid credit; (2) the foreign official financing is an abuse of the tied aid credit; and (3) the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the Bank has properly calculated the portion of the subsidy to be covered by money in the fund. Requires the Bank, upon determing that such conditions have been met, to approve a request for a tied aid credit within ten days of the request. Permits the Bank to withhold approval for more than ten days if the party requesting assistance and the Bank jointly determine that doing so would not jeopardize an American export sale. Defines an abuse of tied aid credit. Prohibits the Board from approving tied aid credit unless a portion of its subsidy is covered by funds drawn from the Fund. Requires the Board to report to both Houses of Congress on any approved tied aid credit within 30 days of approving it. Authorizes appropriations. Terminates the authority to provide tied aid credit upon establishment of a formal international agreement to eliminate the use of official tied aid credit offers in international trade. Requires the Board of Directors, before approving a loan, to calculate the subsidy contained in such loan. Sets forth the manner of calculating such subsidy. Requires the Bank to: (1) publish the subsidy it calculates on each loan in its annual report; and (2) specify, in each statement transmitted to Congress, the subsidy on any loan described in such statement. Requires the Bank to include in its annual report: (1) an estimate of the extent of tied aid arrangements by foreign governments that are used in international trade; (2) the number of tied aid credit offers provided in the preceding year and an estimate of the percentage of all tied aid credit offers that these credits constitute; and (3) an estimate of the number of export transactions and the dollar volume of exports that American exporters lost because foreign official tied aid credits outbid the financing package offered by U.S. exporters. Increases the portion of the Bank's available aggregate loan, guarantee, and insurance authority which shall be available to finance exports by small businesses. Increases the percentage of such authority from eight to 25 percent for FY 1985 and thereafter. Requires the Bank to continue and expand its efforts to promote small business exports by: (1) disseminating information about the Bank's services available to small business in various publications; and (2) undertaking activities that increase the knowledge small businesses have of the Bank's small business programs."
