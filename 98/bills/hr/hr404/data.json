    "text": "Small Business Meat Producer and Marketer Protection Act of 1983 - Amends the Small Business Act to add to the definition of \"credit elsewhere\" the requirement that such credit be available at reasonable rates. Provides that loan assistance by the Small Business Administration shall not be considered duplication of activities of other Federal agencies (which is generally prohibited by such Act) if an agency has promulgated and is administering a loan program under which all qualified applicants are not being granted loans. Prohibits any meatpacker or meat marketer whose annual gross sales exceeded $250,000 in any of the preceding three years from selling, buying, or slaughtering, during any calendar week, more than 100 cattle, 300 swine, or 300 sheep which were owned prior to slaughter or sale for a period greater than 20 days by: (1) such meatpacker or meat marketer; (2) any person who owns or controls more than five percent of the stock, voting power, or control of such meatpacker or meat marketer; or (3) any subsidiary or affiliate in which such meatpacker or other person has more than five percent ownership or control. Provides that such prohibitions shall apply to livestock subject to control directly or indirectly by contract, purchase order, option or other arrangement. Provides that the prohibition on sale shall not apply to the execution of a commodity futures contract on a board of trade designated as a contract market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Prohibits any contract which permits any such meatpacker or meat marketer to select the date of delivery of livestock for a period greater than 20 consecutive days from the making of such contract. Sets forth criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Enables this Act to be enforced through the provisions of the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act."
