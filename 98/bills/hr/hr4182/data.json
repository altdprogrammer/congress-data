    "text": "National Coal Science, Technology, and Engineering Development Act of 1983 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to carry out a national coal science, technology, and engineering program which shall be administered by the Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy. Provides that the program shall consist of three research and development programs: (1) the coal science research program; (2) the process science and engineering research program; and (3) the engineering development program. States that: (1) the purpose of the coal science research program shall be to conduct research, for all coal ranks, that seeks an indepth understanding of coal structure and process chemistry; and (2) the program shall be directed toward the understanding of how pollutant species are bound in the coal molecule and how such species can be efficiently and effectively removed. Provides that the coal science research program shall be carried out through the energy-technology centers, the national laboratories, the university community, and the private sector. States that the purpose of the process science and engineering research program shall be to conduct research, applicable to all coal ranks, in the following areas: (1) coal preparation; (2) specification fuels; (3) precombustion cleanup; (4) utilization processes; (5) instrumentation and control; and (6) supporting research and development. Provides that the process science and engineering research program shall be carried out through the energy technology centers, the national laboratories, the university community, and the private sector. States that the purpose of the engineering development program shall be to establish proof of concept and producing developed processes and coal systems at a scale large enough to permit ready commercialization by the private sector. Requires the program to be structured and implemented to achieve the following objectives within five years of enactment: (1) construct a fine coal preparation and cleaning process facility of no more than 500 tons per day; (2) retrofit an oil-fired boiler of at least 100 MWe using chemically cleaned coal; (3) retrofit an oil-fired boiler of at least 100MWe using a coal-water mixture; (4) demonstrate a combined SOX/NOX removal system of at least 50 MWe; (5) conduct a furnace retrofit of in-boiler nitrogen oxide-control technology of at least 50 MWe; (6) demonstrate an atmospheric fluidized bed combustion system of at least 100 MWe; (7) demonstrate a repowering application of a pressurized fluidized bed combustor of from 50 to 100 MWe; (8) demonstrate a repowering application of combined cycle coal gasification of from 50 to 100 MWe; (9) develop and test a coal-fueled gas turbine in a second generation combined-cycle system of at least 50 MWe; (10) develop and test an industrial-scale coal-fueled gas turbine suitable for industrial cogeneration of at least 5 MWe; (11) test a utility phosphoric acid fuel cell system using coal-derived gas at a size of 10 to 50 MWe; and (12) perform an integrated magnetohydrodynamics systems test including generator and downstream steam plant with a superconducting magnet. Requires the program to be structured and implemented so that there are sufficient incentives to attract private sector participation. Directs the Secretary of Energy, with the cooperation of the Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy, to prepare a five-year national coal science, technology, and engineering development research plan. Requires the plan to be submitted by the Secretary to the President and the appropriate committees within six months of enactment. Directs the Secretary to submit reports to the President and the appropriate committees of Congress concerning the program and the five- year plan. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1989 for the coal science research program, the process science and engineering program, and the engineering development program."
