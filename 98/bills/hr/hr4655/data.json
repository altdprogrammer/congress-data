Sets deadlines and priorities for such reports. Authorizes the Administrator of NOAA to reimburse other public or private entities for costs of data collection for such reports in areas where the NOAA does not presently collect such data. Directs the Administrator to report annually to the Congress on the implementation of this Act, within 90 days of the previous calendar year, beginning in 1985. Directs the Administrator to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1987 to carry out specified provisions of this Act."
