Eliminates the Commission's authority to permit more than one-fourth of the directors or stockholders of a parent company of a broadcast licensee to be aliens when it serves the public interest. Declares that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to any interest of ownership or control in existence on February 9, 1984."
