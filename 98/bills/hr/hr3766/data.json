    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) San Juan Basin Wilderness Protection Act of 1984 - Designates the following lands in the Albuquerque District of the Bureau of Land Management in New Mexico as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Bisti Wilderness; and (2) the De-na-zin Wilderness. Withdraws the area in the Albuquerque District of the Bureau of Land Management known as the Fossil Forest from appropriation under the mining laws and from disposition under the mineral leasing and geothermal leasing laws. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to administer the area so as to protect its natural, educational, and scientific research values. Sets forth requirements for an exchange of Federal lands selected by New Mexico for State lands located within the wilderness areas designated by this Act. Requires the Secretary to exchange lands upon the request of an Indian whose lands are located within the De-na-zin Wilderness area. Requires the Navajo Tribe to select lands in New Mexico administered by the Bureau of Land Management of equal acreage in lieu of lands previously selected by the Tribe within the boundaries of the wilderness areas designated by this Act, of the Fossil Forest, and of the Ah-shi-sle-pah Wilderness Study Area. Provides that the Ah-shi-sle-pah Wilderness Study Area in the Albuquerque District of the Bureau of Land Management shall be studied and protected so as to preserve its wilderness character. Releases from management as wilderness all public lands in San Juan County, New Mexico, administered by the Bureau of Land Management and not designated as wilderness or wilderness study areas by this Act."
