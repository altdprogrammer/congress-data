Authorizes the Commission to finance the installation of protective features in the corridor. Requires the Commission to encourage Illinois to ensure that owners and users of property in or adjacent to the corridor will not be subject to excessive liability in connection with activities which affect persons and property in the corridor. Requires the Commission to report annually on its activities to the Governor of Illinois and to the Secretary of the Interior. Sets forth restrictions on the development by the Commission of sites or structures in the corridor and trails along the canal or its towpath.

Requires the United States to convey to Illinois by quitclaim deed all Federal interests in the Illinois and Michigan Canal lands.

Permits such property to be leased for utility or transmission purposes if the revenues from such lease are used for park and recreation purposes within the corridor. Permits Illinois to continue leasing any portion of such property which was leased on or before February 9, 1984, so long as the revenues from such lease are used for park or recreational purposes within the corridor. Provides that private persons occupying any portion of such property may continue to occupy it with written permission from Illinois. Requires a reversion to the United States of the property conveyed to Illinois under this Act if such property ceases to be used in the manner required by this Act. Conditions the conveyance of property under this Act on Illinois' agreement to hold the United States harmless from claims arising from the operations of the lands so conveyed due to conditions existing at the time of the conveyance. Permits the conveyance of interests in the canal prism and towpath lands necessary for the operation and maintenance of the Illinois Waterway navigation project only with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Army. Authorizes appropriations to the Commission and the Secretary.
