Requires the Federal government to pay for the entire project without reimbursement by non-Federal interests. Provides that neither the authorization nor the construction of such project shall be subject to or contingent upon legislation authorizing or imposing tolls, taxes, charges, or fees upon: (1) commercial transportation utilizing any U.S. navigable waterway or U.S. navigational facility; (2) the sale or use of fuel consumed in such transportation; or (3) other specified waterway uses. Directs the Chief of Engineers to mitigate fish and wildlife habitat losses, resulting from such construction, by purchasing specified land at Federal expense. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer such land to the State of West Virginia for operation and maintenance. Requires the Chief of Engineers to submit a final environmental impact statement to Congress prior to initiating such construction. Provides for disapproval of such impact statement by concurrent resolution of Congress within 60 days of its receipt. Exempts, such impact statement and actions to carry out such project from judicial review except as specified. Sets forth procedures for expedited Judicial review. Authorizes appropriations."
