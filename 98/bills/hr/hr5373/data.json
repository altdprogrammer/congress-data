    "text": "Amends the Panama Canal Act of 1979 to exclude from the claims settlement provisions those claims arising by reason of the presence of vessels in the Panama Canal or the waters adjacent to the Canal. Requires that the award of the Panama Canal Commission rather than the acceptance of the award by the claimant shall be final and conclusive on the claimant. Prohibits bringing suit on claims for injuries to persons or property in the Canal against the United States, the Commission, or any officer or employee of the United States. Repeals the provisions dealing with damage to vessels. Authorizes the Commission to adjust and pay, in accordance with the provisions of the Panama Canal Act of 1979 as in effect before enactment of this Act, any claim for injuries filed before October 1, 1984."
