Bases funding on a formula which includes the numbers of persons below the poverty line, unemployed, evicted, and deinstitutionalized. Requires 70 percent of a State's grant to go to municipalities with populations over 250,000. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to draw up a list ranking all States according to need for such assistance. Provides for State comment on such list and for its annual revision. Prescribes grant application procedures. Authorizes a separate program of matching grants to States and local governments for assistance to the homeless, for which local governments may apply directly. Establishes a one-year Homeless Assistance Advisory Committee in the Department of Health and Human Services. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes grant appropriations through FY 1986."
