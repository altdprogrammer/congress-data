    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require each television and radio station licensee to: (1) permit any person to purchase time to broadcast any editorial advertisement; and (2) make time available under the same rates, terms, and conditions to a person who desires to broadcast an editorial advertisement in opposition or response to such an editorial advertisement. Declares that this Act does not restrict the discretion of a licensee with respect to the duration, time periods, rates, or other terms and conditions applicable to editorial advertisements, except that a licensee must apply substantially similar policies and practices to editorial and commercial advertisements. Subjects any person who willfully and knowingly makes any materially false statement in any editorial advertisement to a $10,000 fine and imprisonment for up to five years. Declares that any editorial advertisement relating to cigarettes or little cigars that is broadcast in accordance with this Act shall not be considered to be in violation of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act."
