    "text": "Child Support Enforcement Improvements Act of 1985 - Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of title IV of the Social Security Act to state that the purpose of part D is to assure compliance with the obligations to pay child support to each child in the United States living with one parent. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to provide for payment to a State of past-due child support from Federal tax refunds in cases where collection services have been made available under part D to an individual not otherwise qualified for part D services. Requires a State under part D to maintain a child support clearinghouse: (1) through which support payments will be recorded; (2) into which support payments will be paid and forwarded; (3) which will maintain collection records; and (4) which will have a system for reporting support obligations owed, collected, and disbursed, and for notifying the courts when payments are not made. Requires a State under part D to: (1) seek medical support for children for whom it is seeking financial support; (2) provide for mandatory withholding and payment of past-due support from wages; (3) provide a procedure for imposing liens against property and estates for past-due support; (4) provide for the collection of past due support from State tax refunds; (5) provide that quasijudicial or administrative procedures be available to aid in the establishment and collection of support obligations and in the establishment of paternity; and (6) provide for at least three of the following: voluntary wage assignment to pay support obligations, the use of scientific testing to determine paternity, the imposition of a bond to secure support obligations of absent parents having a pattern of past-due support, a procedure for establishing paternity without participation of the alleged father if such father refuses to cooperate in establishing paternity, or use of an objective standard to guide in the establishment and modification of support obligations by measuring the amount of support needed and the ability of an absent parent to pay such support, so that comparable amounts of support are awarded in similar situations. Amends Federal bankruptcy law to provide that the discharge of a debtor's debts does not discharge the debtor from any debt (currently, the debt must be in connection with a separation agreement, divorce decree, or property settlement) to a spouse, former spouse, or child of the debtor, for alimony to, maintenance for, or support of such spouse or child."
