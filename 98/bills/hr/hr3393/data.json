    "text": "High Technology Research and Development Joint Venture Act of 1983 - Exempts from liability under Federal or State antitrust law any person who notifies the Attorney General in writing within 30 days of the making of a contract for joint research and development projects which are concerned with the increasing industrial innovation, productivity, and the economic competitiveness of the United States. Requires such a contract to be carried out by a management board consisting of one individual representing each party to the contract. Requires the notification to contain a description of each project and all participating parties. Requires such parties to annually report to the Attorney General. Authorizes the Attorney General to investigate such parties with respect to such projects. Prohibits, with respect to all research and development projects being carried out under a contract in connection with a line of commerce, the aggregate share of the parties to such contract for projects in connection with such line of commerce from exceeding 25 percent of the relevant market, subject to stated exceptions. Authorizes the parties to request the Attorney General to determine whether a contract violates such limitation, within ten days of making a contract. Provides that a person shall not be liable under the antitrust laws for an amount in excess of the actual damages sustained by the claimant, the cost of the suit, and any interest awarded with respect to such damages if liability arises from attempting to make, making, or performing a contract to carry out a joint research and development project with another person. Provides that in any antitrust action against a defendant found to be not liable under this Act, the court shall award the cost of the suit to the prevailing defendant. Directs the Attorney General to submit a report to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate describing the operation of this Act and making recommendations."
