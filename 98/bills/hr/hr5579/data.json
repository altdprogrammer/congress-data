Prohibits the use of such funds for: (1) the Pershing II missile program; (2) the sea-launched cruise missile program; (3) the MX missile program, the ground-launched cruise missile program, the B-1B bomber program, or antisatellite weapons; and (4) binary chemical weapons. Title II: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation - Authorizes appropriations for research, development, test, and evaluation for the armed forces and the defense agencies for FY 1985. Prohibits the use of such funds for the Trident II missile program and the same weapons programs as are prohibited in Title I. Title III: Operation and Maintenance - Authorizes appropriations for the military functions of the Department for operation and maintenance for FY 1985, including funds for increases in civilian employee pay and benefits, unbudgeted increases in fuel costs, and inflation.

Title IV: Personnel - Part A: Active Forces - Authorizes strengths for active duty personnel for the armed forces. Part B: Reserve Forces - Authorizes average strengths for the Selected Reserve of the armed forces reserves. Requires the proportional reduction in such strength as specified.

Title V: Personnel Management - Waives the civilian personnel ceiling for FY 1985. Directs the Secretary of the Air Force to recruit an increasing percent of women during FY 1986-1988. Establishes in the Department the Defense Advisory Committee on Women to be composed of nonservicemembers to advise the Secretary on matters relating to the service of women in the armed forces. Requires the Committee to report to the Secretary annually, such report to then be transmitted to the Armed Services Committees of Congress. Title VI: Compensation Matters - Increases the rates of basic pay by 3.5 percent, effective January 1, 1985. Title VII: Educational Assistance Programs - Establishes a new educational assistance program for the all-volunteer force. Excludes graduates of service academies from eligibility for such assistance. Entitles veterans who are graduates of a secondary school and who have served in the armed forces on continuous active duty for at least three years to basic educational assistance. Entitles veterans of the Selected Reserve who are graduates of secondary school and who have served at least two years of continuous active duty in the armed forces and at least four years of continuous duty in the Selected Reserve to basic educational assistance. Sets forth the formula for determining the length of such assistance based on the length of time served. Entitles such veterans to a monthly assistance allowance of $200 for a full-time approved program of education. Permits the Secretary concerned to establish a higher rate of assistance, but not more than $400 a month, for individuals possessing a skill or specialty designated as being in critical shortage. Permits enrollment, if eligible, in a program of education while an individual continues to perform his duties. Entitles veterans who have served five or more consecutive years of active duty in addition to those required for basic educational assistance to supplemental educational assistance.

Entitles such veterans to a monthly supplemental assistance allowance of $100 a month. Permits the provision of assistance at a higher rate, but not more than $300 monthly, to any individual entitled to basic educational assistance who has a skill or specialty in which there is a critical shortage of personnel. Permits the Secretary of Defense to authorize specified individuals to transfer to a dependent part or all of such individuals' entitlement to educational assistance. Sets forth the conditions under which transferred benefits may be provided. Establishes a ten year delimiting period for educational assistance. Excludes from such ten-year limitation: (1) time spent as a prisoner of war subsequent to discharges; and (2) spent physically or mentally disabled. Limits educational assistance to individuals being furnished subsistence to the amount an institution would charge similarly circumstanced nonveterans. Prohibits participation in more than one program of educational assistance. Allocates the administration and costs of such programs to the Veterans Administration, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Defense Education Benefits Fund. Requires the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator to submit to Congress a biennial report on the operations of such programs. Amends the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Act of 1977 to terminate the right to enroll in the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Program after December 31, 1984.

Sets forth other terms and conditions for administering such Fund. Permits the Secretary concerned to grant an eligible member a leave of absence of not more than two years for such member to pursue a program of education. Sets forth the terms and conditions for such leave. Requires the Secretary concerned to provide individual predischarge counseling which includes a discussion of educational benefit entitlements.
