    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 98-1133) Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act (as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976) to authorize appropriations for FY 1985 through 1988 for: (1) general administration by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to carry out such Act (including funds for Resource Recovery and Conservation Panels, hazardous waste management, and support for State, regional, local, and interstate agency solid waste plans); (2) grants to State hazardous waste programs; (3) the hazardous waste site inventory; (4) development and implementation of plans by State, local, regional, and interstate authorities; (5) implementation of State, local, and intermunicipal programs for solid waste management, resource recovery, resource conservation, and hazardous waste management; (6) special communities assistance; (7) assistance to States for recycled oil programs; (8) the Secretary of Commerce to carry out resource and recovery duties; (9) additional EPA officers or employees to conduct criminal investigations under such Act and for support costs for such additional criminal investigators; (10) underground storage tank regulation; (11) grants to States for State underground storage tank release detection, prevention, and correction programs; (12) small quantity generator waste education programs; (13) State and other programs requiring compliance with open dumping/sanitary landfill criteria by solid waste management facilities within 36 months after enactment of this Act; and (14) the National Ground Water Commission (see provisions for such Commission under title VII of this Act). Title I: Provisions Relating Primarily to Subtitles A and B of the Solid Waste Disposal Act - (This title makes amendments relating primarily to general provisions and provisions for the Office of Solid Waste and the authorities of the Administrator under the Solid Waste Disposal Act.) Revises findings and objectives of the Act, to include minimizing the generation and the land disposal of hazardous waste. Directs the Administrator to give a high priority to assisting and cooperating with States in obtaining full authorization of State hazardous waste management programs. Declares it to be the national policy that, wherever feasible, the generation of hazardous waste is to be reduced or eliminated as expeditiously as possible. Declares that waste that is nevertheless generated should be treated, stored, or disposed of so as to minimize the present and future threat to human health and the environment. Directs the Administrator, as promptly as practicable after the enactment of this Act, to submit a report describing: (1) the current data and information available on emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins from resource recovery facilities burning municipal solid waste; (2) any significant risks to human health posed by these emissions; and (3) operating practices appropriate for controlling these emissions. Authorizes the Administrator, based on such report and any future relevant information, to publish advisories or guidelines regarding the control of dioxin emissions from such facilities. Provides that this does not affect the administrator's authority to promulgate any regulations under the Clean Air Act regarding emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins. Directs the Administrator to establish an Office of Ombudsman to receive individual complaints, grievances, and requests for information submitted by any person with respect to any program or requirement under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Directs the Ombudsman to render assistance with respect to such submissions and make appropriate recommendations to the Administrator. Provides that the establishment of such Office shall not affect any procedures for grievances, appeals, or administrative matters. Terminates such Office four years after the enactment of this Act. Title II: Provisions Relating Primarily to Subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act - Subtitle A: Amendments Primarily to Section 3004 - (This title makes amendments primarily to the hazardous waste management provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. This subtitle makes amendments primarily to provisions relating to standards applicable to owners and operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.) Sets forth prohibitions and other provisions relating to land disposal of hazardous waste. Sets forth provisions relating to salt dome formations, salt bed formations, underground mines, and caves. Prohibits the placement of any noncontainerized or bulk liquid hazardous waste in any salt dome formation, salt bed formations, underground mine, or cave, until such time as: (1) the Administrator has determined, after notice and opportunity for hearings in the affected areas, that such placement is protective of human health and the environment; (2) the Administrator has promulgated performance and permitting standards for such facilities; and (3) a permit has been issued for the facility concerned. Prohibits the placement of any other type of hazardous waste in such facilities until such time as a permit has been issued for the facility concerned. Provides that such prohibitions shall not apply to the Department of Energy Waste Isolation Pilot Project in New Mexico. Sets forth provisions relating to liquids in landfills. Prohibits the placement of bulk or noncontainerized liquid hazardous waste or free liquids in hazardous waste (whether or not absorbents have been added) in any landfill, effective six months after enactment of this Act. Provides that specified requirements shall remain in force prior to such date. Directs the Administrator, within 15 months after enactment of this Act, to promulgate final regulations which: (1) minimize the disposal of containerized liquid hazardous wastes in landfills; (2) minimize the presence of free liquids in containerized hazardous waste to be disposed of in landfills; and (3) prohibit the disposal in landfills of liquids that have been absorbed in materials that biodegrade or that release liquids when compressed as might occur during routine landfill operations. Provides that specified requirements shall remain in force prior to the date on which such final regulations take effect. Prohibits, effective 12 months after enactment of this Act, the placement of any liquid which is not a hazardous waste in a landfill for which a hazardous waste permit is required or which is operating under interim status granted under hazardous waste management provisions, unless the owner or operator demonstrates to the Administrator, or the Administrator determines, that: (1) the only reasonably available alternative to such placement is placement in a landfill or unlined surface impoundment (whether or not permitted or operating under interim status) which contains, or may reasonably be anticipated to contain, hazardous waste; and (2) such placement will not present a risk of contamination of any underground source of drinking water. Sets forth prohibitions on land disposal of specified hazardous wastes. Prohibits the land disposal of specified hazardous wastes, effective 32 months after the enactment of this Act (except with respect to underground injection into deep injection wells), unless the Administrator determines the prohibition on one or more methods of land disposal is not required in order to protect human health and the environment for as long as the waste remains hazardous. Provides that, for such purposes, a land disposal method for such a hazardous waste may not be determined protective of human health and the environment unless it has been demonstrated, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the disposal unit or injection zone for as long as the waste remains hazardous. Requires that such prohibition is to be applied, taking into account specified factors, to specified forms, compounds, and concentrations of the following liquid hazardous wastes: (1) cyanides; (2) arsenic; (3) cadmium; (4) chromium; (5) lead; (6) mercury; (7) nickel; (8) selenium; (9) thallium; (10) highly acidic (having a pH of two or less) liquid wastes; (11) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); and (12) nonliquid or liquid wastes containing halogenated organic compounds. Directs the Administrator to substitute more stringent concentration levels where necessary to protect human health and the environment. Provides that such prohibition shall not apply, during the period ending 48 months after the enactment of this Act, to any disposal of contaminated soil or debris resulting from a response action taken under specified provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (the Superfund Act) (CERCLA) or a corrective action under subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (hazardous waste management provisions). Sets forth prohibition on land disposal of specified solvents and dioxins. Prohibits, effective 24 months after the enactment of this Act (except with respect to underground injection in deep injection wells), the land disposal of: (1) specified dioxin-containing hazardous wastes referred to in certain EPA proposed rules; and (2) specified solvent-type hazardous wastes referred to in certain EPA regulations. Provides that such prohibition with respect to one or more methods of land disposal of such wastes shall apply unless the Administrator determines that it is not required to protect human health or the environment, taking into account specified factors. Provides that, for such purposes, a land disposal method for such a hazardous waste (other than one in compliance with specified pretreatment regulations) may not be determined to be protective of human health and the environment unless it has been demonstrated, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the disposal unit or injection zone for as long as the wastes remain hazardous. Provides that such prohibition shall not apply, during the period ending 48 months after the enactment of this Act, to any disposal of contaminated soil or debris resulting from a response action taken under CERCLA or under hazardous waste management provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Sets forth provisions relating to the disposal into deep injection wells of the specified hazardous wastes and the solvents and dioxins subject to the foregoing prohibitions on land disposal. Directs the Administrator, within 45 months after enactment of this Act, to: (1) complete a review of the disposal of such hazardous wastes by underground injection into deep injection wells; and (2) promulgate final regulations prohibiting the disposal of any such hazardous waste into such wells if it may reasonably be anticipated that such disposal may not be protective of human health and the environment for as long as the waste remains hazardous, taking into account specified factors and State prohibitions. Prohibits disposal into any deep injection well of any such hazardous waste for which the Administrator fails to make a determination within such 45-month period. Sets forth provisions for additional land disposal prohibition determinations. Directs the Administrator to submit to Congress, within 24 months after enactment of this Act, a schedule for: (1) reviewing all hazardous wastes listed in specified hazardous waste management provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (as of the date of enactment of this Act) other than those specified wastes, solvents, and dioxins prohibited from land disposal under this Act; and (2) taking final regulatory action on whether or not to prohibit the land disposal of each of such wastes. Directs the Administrator to base such schedule on a ranking of such listed wastes considering their intrinsic hazard and their volume such that: (1) decisions whether or not to prohibit the land disposal of high volume hazardous wastes with high intrinsic hazard shall, to the maximum extent possible, be made within 45 months after the enactment of this Act; and (2) decisions regarding low volume hazardous wastes with lower intrinsic hazard shall be made within 66 months after such enactment. Provides that preparation and submission of such schedule shall not be subject to: (1) the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980; (2) requirements for a hearing on the record; and (3) judicial review. Requires the Administrator to make such regulatory decisions: (1) for at least one-third of all such listed wastes within 45 months after such enactment; (2) for at least two-thirds of all such listed wastes within 55 months after such enactment; and (3) for all such listed wastes within 66 months after such enactment. Requires that such regulatory determinations be made within six months after the date of the identification or listing of any hazardous waste after the enactment of this Act. Directs the Administrator, by the date specified in such schedule, to promulgate final regulations prohibiting one or more methods of land disposal of the hazardous wastes listed on such schedule, except for methods of land disposal which the Administrator determines will be protective of human health and the environment for as long as the waste remains hazardous, taking into account specified factors. Provides that, for such purposes, a method of land disposal may not be determined to be protective of human health and the environment (except with respect to a hazardous waste in compliance with specified pretreatment regulations) unless it has been demonstrated to a reasonable degree of certainty that there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the disposal unit or injection zone for as long as the wastes remain hazardous. Prohibits land disposal of any identified or listed hazardous waste for which the Administrator has failed to make a determination within the 66-month deadline. Allows (until such 66-month deadline prohibition takes effect) such disposal for wastes subject to 45- or 55-month determination deadlines which have not been met, but only if: (1) the facility is in compliance with specified minimum technological requirements applicable to new facilities; and (2) prior to such disposal, the generator certifies to the Administrator that after investigation it has determined that the use of such landfill or surface impoundment is the only practical alternative to treatment currently available to the generator. Sets forth provisions for variances from land disposal prohibitions established under this Act. Requires prompt publication of determinations that a method of land disposal will be protective of human health and the environment. Prohibits the storage of hazardous waste which is prohibited from land disposal unless such storage is solely for the purpose of accumulation of such quantities of hazardous waste as are necessary to facilitate proper recovery, treatment, or disposal. Prohibits the use of waste or used oil or other material, which is contaminated or mixed with dioxin or any other identified or listed hazardous waste (other than a waste identified solely on the basis of ignitability), for dust suppression or road treatment. Sets forth provisions for treatment standards for wastes subject to land disposal prohibitions under this Act. Directs the Administrator, after notice and opportunity for hearings and after consultation with appropriate Federal and State agencies, to promulgate regulations specifying any levels or methods of treatment which substantially diminish the toxicity of the waste or substantially reduce the likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents from the waste so that short-term and long-term threats to human health and the environment are minimized. Permits disposal of such waste in a land disposal facility which meets specified hazardous waste management requirements, if such waste has been treated to such level or by such method. Provides for standards for air emissions from hazardous waste facilities. Directs the Administrator, within 30 months after the enactment of this Act, to promulgate regulations for monitoring and control of air emissions at hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (including but not limited to open tanks, surface impoundments, and landfills) as may be necessary to protect human life and the environment. Establishes minimum technological requirements for landfills, surface impoundments, and incinerators, under Solid Waste Disposal Act provisions for standards and permit requirements for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. Requires that regulations be revised from time to time to take into account technological improvements in control and measurement. Requires installation of two or more liners and a leachate collection system, as well as groundwater monitoring, for landfill or surface impoundment permits. Allows exceptions to the double liner and leachate collection system requirement (but not the groundwater monitoring requirement) only in cases where the owner or operator can demonstrate that alternative design and operating practices, together with location characteristics, will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituents into groundwater or surface water at least as effectively. Requires that all incinerators receiving such permits attain at least the destruction and removal efficiency required by specified regulations. Sets forth provisions for an early leak detection system. Directs the Administrator, within 30 months after enactment of this Act, to promulgate standards requiring that new landfill units, surface impoundment units, waste piles, underground tanks and land treatment units for storage, treatment, or disposal of identified or listed hazardous waste shall be required to utilize approved leak detection systems. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations or issue guidance documents implementing such minimum technological requirements for landfills and surface impoundments within two years after the enactment of this Act. Sets forth descriptions of top liners and lower liners which will satisfy the requirements for installation of two or more liners until the effective date of such regulations or guidance documents. Provides that any such permit which is issued for a landfill located within the State of Alabama shall require the installation of two or more liners and a leachate collection system above and between such liners. Sets forth provisions relating to groundwater monitoring. Requires that hazardous waste regulations specify criteria for the acceptable location of new and existing treatment, storage, or disposal facilities as necessary to protect human health and the environment. Directs the Administrator, within 18 months after the enactment of this Act, to publish guidance criteria identifying areas of vulnerable hydrogeology. Provides that hazardous waste management standards concerning groundwater monitoring which are applicable to surface impoundments, waste piles, land treatment units, and landfills shall apply to such a facility whether or not: (1) it is located above the seasonal high water table; (2) two liners and a leachate collection system have been installed; or (3) the owner or operator inspects the liner (or liners) which has been installed. Declares that such provision shall not be construed to affect other exemptions or waivers from such standards provided in regulations in effect on the date of enactment of this Act or in revisions to those regulations. Authorizes the Administrator to exempt from specified groundwater monitoring requirements on a case-by-case basis any engineered structure which is found to meet specified criteria. Sets forth provisions relating to the burning or blending of hazardous wastes. Requires, within 15 months after enactment of this Act, notification to the Administrator (and to the State in the case of an authorized State hazardous waste program) by: (1) the owner or operator of any facility producing a fuel from any hazardous waste alone or with other material or from used oil alone or with other material; (2) the owner or operator of any facility (other than a single or two-family residence) burning fuel containing any hazardous waste or used oil; and (3) any person who distributes or markets fuel containing hazardous waste or used oil. Requires that such notification describe the location, the facility, the identified or listed hazardous waste involved, and the production or energy recovery activity. Exempts facilities, such as residential boilers, from such notification requirements where the Administrator determines that such notification is not necessary for obtaining sufficient information respecting current practices of facilities using hazardous waste for energy recovery. Directs the Administrator, within two years after the enactment of this Act, to promulgate regulations establishing health and environmental standards applicable to owners or operators of facilities producing fuel from hazardous wastes or burning hazardous waste for energy recovery and to distributors or marketers of such fuels. Exempts from such requirements, and from labeling and other specified requirements, petroleum refinery wastes containing oil which are converted into petroleum coke at the same facility at which such waste were generated, unless the resulting coke product would exceed one or more characteristics by which a substance would be identified as a hazardous waste. Authorizes the Administrator to exempt from such requirements, and from specified labeling and recordkeeping requirements under this Act, facilities which burn minimal quantities of hazardous waste as fuel, as defined by the Administrator, if the waste is burned: (1) at the same facility at which it is generated; (2) to recover useful energy, as determined by the Administrator on the basis of the design and operating characteristics of the facility and the heating value and other characteristics of the waste; and (3) in a type of device determined by the Administrator to be designed and operated at a destruction and removal efficiency sufficient such that protection of human health and the environment is assured. Provides that, until such standards are in effect, the burning of any fuel containing hazardous waste in any cement kiln located within the boundaries of any incorporated municipality with a population greater than 5,000 is prohibited unless such kiln fully complies with hazardous waste regulations applicable to incinerators. Provides for criminal penalties for any person who knowingly violates such prohibition. Sets forth a labeling requirement which (beginning 90 days after enactment of this Act and effective until such time as the Administrator promulgates standards specifically superceding such requirement) prohibits producers, distributors, or marketers of fuels containing hazardous wastes from distributing or marketing such fuels unless the invoice or bill of sale bears a conspicuous warning and lists the hazardous wastes contained in such fuel. Exempts from such requirement, unless the Administrator determines otherwise in order to protect human health and the environment, fuels produced from: (1) petroleum refining waste containing oil if such materials are generated and reinserted onsite in the refining process; and (2) oily materials resulting from normal petroleum refining, production, and transportation practices. Conditions such exemptions on: (1) removal of contaminants; and (2) conversion along with normal process streams into petroleum-derived fuel products at a specified type of facility at which crude oil is refined into petroleum products. Sets forth recordkeeping requirements. Directs the Administrator, within 15 months after the enactment of this Act, to promulgate regulations requiring that any person who is required to file a notification in accordance with provisions for burning and blending hazardous wastes must maintain such records regarding fuel blending, distribution, or use as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment. Sets forth provisions relating to standards for transporters of fuel from hazardous waste. Directs the Administrator, within two years after the enactment of this Act and after opportunity for public hearing, to promulgate regulations establishing standards, as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment and including appropriate requirements, applicable to transporters of fuel produced from any identified or listed hazardous waste alone or in combination with any other material. Sets forth provisions relating to the financial responsibility of owners and operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Provides for direct action against guarantors in appropriate cases. Sets forth provisions relating to continuing releases at permitted facilities. Provides that hazardous waste management standards, and permits issued after the enactment of this Act, must require corrective action for all releases of hazardous waste or constituents from any solid waste management unit at a treatment, storage, or disposal facility seeking a permit under hazardous waste management provisions, regardless of the time at which waste was placed in such unit. Requires that permits contain compliance schedules for such corrective action (where it cannot be completed prior to permit issuance) and assurances of financial responsibility for completing such corrective action. Sets forth provisions relating to corrective actions beyond the boundary of a hazardous waste management facility. Directs the Administrator, as promptly as possible after the enactment of this Act, to amend standards regarding collective action required at facilities for treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste to require that corrective action be taken beyond the facility boundary where necessary to protect human health and the environment unless owners or operators demonstrate that, despite their best efforts, they were unable to obtain the necessary permission to take such action. Makes such regulations effective immediately upon promulgation. Makes such regulations apply to: (1) all facilities operating under hazardous waste management permits; and (2) all landfills, surface impoundments, and waste pile units (including any new units, or replacements, or lateral extensions of existing units) which receive hazardous waste after July 26, 1982. Directs the Administrator, pending promulgation of such regulations, to issue corrective action orders, on a case-by-case basis, for facilities to which such regulations apply. Directs the Administrator, by March 1, 1985, to promulgate final permitting standards for underground tanks that cannot be entered for inspection. Requires, within 48 months after the enactment of this Act, that such standards be modified, if necessary, to cover at a minimum all requirements and standards described in specified provisions for underground storage tank release detection, prevention, and correction regulations (as added to the Solid Waste Disposal Act by title VI of this Act). Includes financial responsibility for corrective action among the evidence of financial responsibility which the Administrator is authorized to require of owners and operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. Authorizes the Administrator to modify specified hazardous waste management requirements under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, in the case of landfills or surface impoundments receiving: (1) solid waste from the extraction, beneficiation, or processing of ores and minerals, including phosphate rock and overburden from uranium ore mining; (2) fly ash waste, bottom ash waste, slag waste, and flue gas emission control waste generated primarily from the combustion of coal or other fossil fuels; or (3) cement kiln dust waste. Provides that such modifications are to take into account: (1) the special characteristics of such wastes; (2) the practical difficulties associated with the implementation of such requirements; and (3) site-specific characteristics. Requires that such modified requirements assure protection of human health and the environment. Subtitle B: Amendments Primarily to Section 3005 - (This title makes amendments primarily to provisions relating to permits for treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste.) Makes permit requirements applicable to the construction of new facilities for hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal. Provides that no permit shall be required under such hazardous waste management provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act in order to construct a facility if such facility is constructed pursuant to an approval, issued under the Toxic Substances Control Act for the inceneration of polychlorinated biphenyls. Allows any owner or operator of such a facility, at any time after operation or construction of such facility has begun, to file an application for a hazardous waste permit under the Solid Waste Disposal Act authorizing such facility to incinerate identified or listed hazardous waste. Requires that permits be for fixed terms and that permits for land disposal facilities, storage facilities, or incinerators or other treatment facilities be for fixed terms not exceeding ten years. Requires review of land disposal permits five years after date of issuance or reissuance to ensure compliance with currently applicable requirements. Provides that the Administrator may review and modify a permit at any time during its term. Requires that review of any permit renewal application shall consider improvements in the state of control and measurement technology as well as changes in applicable regulations. Requires that each permit contain terms and conditions which the Administrator (or the State) determines necessary to protect human health and the environment. Terminates, 12 months after enactment of this Act, interim status for any land disposal facility granted such status before such enactment, unless the owner or operator: (1) applies for a final determination of permit issuance before such 12-month period is over; and (2) certifies compliance with all applicable groundwater monitoring and financial responsibility requirements. Sets similar termination conditions for interim status permits granted to land disposal facilities in existence on the effective date of statutory or regulatory changes under the Solid Waste Disposal Act that render the facilities subject to the requirement to have a permit (with the 12-month period running from the effective date of such changes). Provides that nothing in the Solid Waste Disposal Act (or in any regulation adopted under such Act) shall be construed to prohibit any State from requiring that it be provided with a copy of each manifest used in connection with hazardous waste which is generated within its boundaries or transported to a treatment, storage, or disposal facility within its boundaries. Directs the Administrator to issue final permits or final denials of permit applications: (1) for land disposal facilities within four years after the enactment of this Act; (2) for incinerator facilities within five years after such enactment; and (3) for any other treatment, storage, or disposal facilities within eight years after such enactment.

Requires facilities operating under interim status permits to submit applications for final permit review within the applicable time period, with specified exceptions. Authorizes the Administrator to issue research, development, and demonstration permits for any hazardous waste treatment facility which proposed to utilize an innovative and experimental hazardous waste treatment technology or process for which permit standards have not been promulgated. Sets forth requirements for such permits, including a one-year limit on operation. Allows any such permit to be renewed up to 3 times, with each such renewal covering up to a one-year period. Authorizes the Administrator to modify or waive general permit application or issuance regulations (except those regarding financial responsibility or public participation) to expedite review and issuance of such permits. Authorizes the Administrator to order an immediate termination of all operations at the facility at any time when necessary to protect human health and the environment. Sets forth provisions relating to existing surface impoundments which qualify for interim status permits. Requires such existing surface impoundments, to comply, by the date four years after the enactment of this Act, with the minimum technological requirements for new surface impoundments, with certain exceptions and modifications. Exempts from such requirements any surface impoundment which: (1) has at least one liner with no evidence of leakage; (2) is located more than one-quarter mile from an underground source of drinking water; and (3) is in compliance with generally applicable ground water monitoring requirements for facilities with permits. Exempts, also, from such requirements certain qualified wastewater treatment surface impoundments. Authorizes the Administrator (or the authorized State program) to modify such requirements if the owner or operator demonstrates that such surface impoundment is located, designed, and operated so as to assure that there will be no migration of any hazardous constituent into ground water or surface water at any future time. Requires that specified locational criteria be taken into account in any such modification. Requires that owners or operators apply for such exemptions or modifications within 24 months after the enactment of this Act. Sets forth the types of evidence and other information which such applications must contain. Directs the Administrator (or State) to rule on such applications within 12 months after receipt and not later than 36 months after the enactment of this Act. Sets similar deadlines for applications and rulings and makes the deadline for compliance four years after the date of promulgation, in the case of promulgation of additional listings or characteristics for hazardous waste identification which make a surface impoundment become subject to such requirements at any time after the enactment of this Act. Provides that, in cases where an exemption or modification has been given and a change in condition makes the impoundment subject to such requirements, the compliance deadline shall be two years after the discovery of such change (but three years for wastewater treatment impoundments). Directs the Administrator to report to Congress on specified topics relating to those wastewater treatment impoundments exempted from such requirements, and on the need, feasibility, and estimated costs of making such impoundments subject to such requirements. Authorizes the Administrator (or the State, if appropriate) to impose any requirements necessary to protect human health and the environment in the case of any existing surface impoundment or class of surface impoundments from which hazardous constituents are likely to migrate into ground water. Directs the Administrator (or the State) to only allow the exemption for wastewater treatment impoundments if compliance with the requirements set forth under this Act is not necessary to protect human health and the environment. Provides that, in the case of any surface impoundment in which the liners and leak detection system have been installed in good faith compliance with specified provisions, regulations, and guidance documents, no different liner or leak detection system requirement shall be required for purposes of first permit issuance. Authorizes the Administrator to require a new liner when there is reason to believe that any liner installed pursuant to specified requirements is leaking. Requires, at the closure of certain surface impoundments exempted from requirements on the basis of having a liner which prevents hazardous waste from migrating to subsurface soil, groundwater, or surface water, the owner or operator to: (1) remove or decontaminate all waste residues, all contaminated liner material, and contaminated soil to the extent practicable; and (2) if all contaminated soil is not removed or decontaminated, comply with appropriate post-closure requirements, including ground water monitoring and corrective action. Provides that any incremental cost attributable to these requirements for interim status surface impoundments or to minimum technological requirements under this Act shall not be considered by the Administrator (or the State) in established effluent limitations and standards under specified provisions of the Clean Water Act. Requires interim status surface impoundments used for the storage or treatment of a hazardous waste that has been prohibited from one or more methods of land disposal to meet the minimum technological requirements applicable to new surface impoundments, unless such interim status surface impoundments qualify for an exemption under the one-quarter mile rule or a modification under the no-migration rule. Requires surface impoundments used for the treatment of a hazardous waste that has been prohibited from one or more methods of land disposal to remove the treatment residues at least once a year for subsequent management. Authorizes the Administrator to modify the minimum technological requirements for interim status surface impoundments for which the owner or operator, prior to October 1, 1984, has entered into a consent order, decree, or agreement with the Administrator (or a State with an authorized program) mandating corrective action that provides a degree of protection of human health and the environment that is at least equal to that provided by such requirements. Subtitle C: Amendments Primarily to Other Sections in Subtitle C - Makes amendments primarily to other provisions relating to hazardous waste management under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Revises provisions for identification and listing of hazardous waste to add provisions relating to small quantity generator waste. Directs the Administrator, by March 31, 1986, to promulgate standards for hazardous waste generated by a generator in a total quantity of hazardous waste greater than 100 kg but less than 1,000 kg during a calendar month. Allows such standards to vary from those applicable to hazardous waste generated by larger quantity generators, but requires that such standards be sufficient to protect human health and the environment. Requires, beginning 270 days after enactment of this Act, that any listed or identified hazardous waste which is from a small quantity (100 to 1,000 kg per month) generator and is shipped off the premises shall be accompanied by a copy of the EPA uniform hazardous waste manifest form signed by the generator and containing specified information.

Sets forth provisions relating to exposure information and health assessments. Requires that, beginning nine months after the enactment of this Act, each permit application under hazardous management provisions for a landfill or surface impoundment shall be accompanied by information reasonably ascertainable by the owner or operator on the potential for the public to be exposed to hazardous wastes or hazardous constituents through releases related to a unit. Sets forth minimum requirements relating to such information. Requires submission of such information within nine months after such enactment date by owners or operators of landfills and surface impoundments for which a completed application has been submitted prior to such date. Directs the Administrator (or the authorized State) to make such information available to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Authorizes the Administrator (or the authorized State, with the Administrator's concurrence), whenever a landfill or surface impoundment release poses a substantial potential risk to human health, to request the ATSDR Administrator to conduct a health assessment in connection with such facility and take other appropriate action with respect to such risks as authorized under specified provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (Superfund) (CERCLA). Requires the ATSDR Administrator to conduct such health assessment if funds are provided in connection with such request. Allows any member of the public to submit evidence of releases of or exposure to hazardous constituents from such a facility, or as to the associated risks or health effects. Directs the ATSDR Administrator, in determining the order in which to conduct such health assessments, to give priority to those facilities or sites at which there is documented evidence of release of hazardous constituents, at which the potential risk to human health appears highest, and for which in the judgment of the ATSDR Administrator existing health assessment data is inadequate to assess the potential risk to human health. Directs the ATSDR Administrator to issue periodic reports which include the results of all the assessments carried out under these provisions of this Act. Requires that such assessments or other activities shall be reported after appropriate peer review. Defines the scope of the term \"health assessments\" for purposes of these provisions of this Act. Provides that, in any case in which a health assessment performed under such provisions discloses the exposure of a population to the release of a hazardous substance, the costs of such health assessment may be recovered as a cost of response under CERCLA from persons causing or contributing to such release of such hazardous substance or, in the case of multiple releases contributing to such exposure, to all such releases. Title III: Provisions Relating to Subtitle D of the Solid Waste Disposal Act - Sets forth provisions relating to State and regional solid waste plans under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Adds provisions relating to the size of waste-to-energy facilities. Declares that it is the intention of the Solid Waste Disposal Act that adequate provision be given to the present and future needs of the recycling and resource recovery interest in the area encompassed by the comprehensive planning process in determining the size of waste-to-energy facilities. Directs the Administrator to study the extent to which guidelines and criteria under the Act (other than those for facilities to which hazardous waste management provisions apply) applicable to solid waste management and disposal facilities (including, but not limited to, landfills and surface impoundments) are adequate to protect human health and the environment from groundwater contamination. Requires that such study include: (1) a detailed assessment of the degree to which specified criteria regarding monitoring, prevention of contamination, and remedial action are adequate to protect groundwater; and (2) recommendations with respect to any additional enforcement authority which the Administrator, in consultation with the Attorney General, deems necessary for such purposes. Directs the Administrator, within 36 months after enactment of this Act, to report to Congress on the results of such study, with recommendations based on such study. Directs the Administrator, by March 31, 1988, to promulgate revisions of specified criteria for distinguishing sanitary landfills and open dumps for facilities which may receive hazardous household waste or waste from small quantity generators. Requires that such criteria be those necessary to protect human health and the environment. Allows such criteria to take into account the practical capacity of such facilities. Provides that, at a minimum, such revisions for facilities potentially receiving such wastes should: (1) require groundwater monitoring; (2) establish criteria for the acceptable location of new or existing facilities; and (3) provide for corrective action as appropriate. Makes a prohibition against the establishment of open dumps effective six months after the promulgation of EPA regulations, rather than on a later date of approval of the State plan. Requires each State to adopt and implement a permit program or other system of prior approval and conditions to assure that each solid waste management facility within such State which may receive hazardous waste in household waste or from small quantity generators will comply with specified criteria. Requires that such program be adopted and implemented: (1) within 36 months after the enactment of this Act, with respect to compliance with specified applicable criteria; and (2) within 18 months after the promulgation of revised criteria under this Act, with respect to compliance with such revised criteria. Directs the Administrator to determine whether each State has developed an adequate program. Directs the Administrator to enforce a specified prohibition with respect to such facilities in any State which does not adopt such an adequate program by the deadline with respect to revised criteria. Title IV: Provisions Relating Primarily to Subtitle G of the Solid Waste Disposal Act - Sets forth provisions relating primarily to miscellaneous provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Revises provisions relating to citizen suits.

Grants the district court in citizen suit cases the power to: (1) enforce the permit, standard, regulation, condition, requirement, prohibition, or order involved; (2) restrain (and order to take necessary action) any person who has contributed or is contributing to the past or present handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of the solid or hazardous waste involved; or (3) order the Administrator to perform the act or duty involved, and to apply any appropriate civil penalties under specified provisions. Provides that common carriers by rail shall not be subject to such citizen suits (on the added basis of \"contribution\" to such prohibited acts) if: (1) the waste has left their possession or control; (2) the transportation of the waste was under a sole contractual arrangement arising from a public tariff and acceptance for carriage by common carrier by rail; and (3) such transporter has exercised due care. Waives the current 60-day waiting period after notification for citizen suits relating to violations of hazardous waste management provisions of the Act. Prohibits citizen suits being brought, on the grounds added by this Act: (1) prior to 90 days after the plaintiff has given notice of the endangerment (but allows such suits to be brought immediately after such notification in cases involving a violation of hazardous waste management provisions); (2) if the Administrator (or the State) has commenced and is diligently prosecuting specified actions, is actually engaging in a specified removal action, or has incurred costs to initiate a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RIFS) and is diligently proceeding with a specified remedial action; (3) if the Administrator has obtained a court order or issued an administrative order pursuant to which a responsible party is diligently conducting a removal action, RIFS, or remedial action; or (4) with respect to the siting of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility, or to restrain or enjoin the issuance of a permit for such facility. Provides for a right of intervention in such citizen suits by persons claiming an interest in the subject of the action, subject to specified conditions. Requires the plaintiff in such actions to serve a copy of the complaint on the Attorney General and the Administrator. Provides that only the prevailing or substantially prevailing party may be awarded litigation costs under citizen suit provisions. Revises provisions relating to imminent hazard. Specifies that the persons against whom the Administrator may seek restraining orders include, but are not limited to, any past or present generator, transporter, or owner or operator of a treatment, storage, or disposal facility who has contributed or is contributing to the handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of solid or hazardous waste which may present an immediate and substantial endangerment to health or the environment. Specifies that such a suit by the Administrator may seek both a restraining order and an order to such person to take such other action as may be necessary. Provides that common carriers by rail shall not be subject to such restraining orders (on the added basis of \"contribution\" to such prohibited acts), if they merely transported the waste under a sole contractual arrangement and exercised due care. Directs the Administrator to: (1) provide immediate notice to the appropriate local agencies upon receipt of information that there is a hazardous waste at any site which has presented an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment; and (2) require notice of such endangerment to be promptly posted at the site where waste is located. Directs the Attorney General, at the request of the Administrator and on the basis of a showing of need, to deputize qualified EPA employees to serve as special deputy U.S. marshals in criminal investigations with respect to violations of the criminal provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Provides that specified prohibitions against the open dumping of solid waste or hazardous waste apply whether or not a State plan has been submitted and approved. Revises provisions for Federal enforcement of hazardous waste management requirements to authorize the Administrator to assess a civil penalty for any past or current violation or for violations of compliance orders. Authorizes the Administrator and duly designated agents and employees of EPA to initiate and conduct investigations under the criminal provisions of the Act, and to refer investigation results to the Attorney General for appropriate prosecution. Revises provisions for judicial review of certain actions of the Administrator with respect to permits and to authorized State hazardous waste programs to provide that if review could have been obtained under such provisions then such actions shall not be subject to judicial review in civil or criminal proceedings for enforcement. Provides for public participation in settlements under imminent hazard provisions. Sets forth provisions for interim control of hazardous waste injection affecting underground sources of drinking water. Prohibits hazardous waste disposal by underground injection into or above a formation which contains an underground source of drinking water within one-quarter mile of the well used for such underground injection. Makes such prohibition effective six months after the enactment of this Act, except in the case of any State in which identical or more stringent prohibitions are in effect before such date under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Makes such prohibition inapplicable to the injection of contaminated groundwater into the aquifer from which it was withdrawn, if: (1) such injection is a response action taken under specified provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 or part of corrective action required under specified provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act intended to cleanup such contamination; (2) such contaminated groundwater is treated to substantially reduce hazardous constituents prior to such injection; and (3) such response action or corrective action will, upon completion, be sufficient to protect human health and the environment. Provides that, in addition to enforcement under specified provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act such prohibition will be enforceable under the Safe Drinking Water Act in any State where identical or more stringent prohibitions have been adopted and are being enforced by the Administrator or the State. Title V: Provisions Relating to Several Subtitles of the Solid Waste Disposal Act - Sets forth provisions relating to Federal procurement and various other provisions under the Solid Waste Disposal Act.
