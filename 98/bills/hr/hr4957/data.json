Increases the authorized appropriations out of the Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account) for emergency relief for FY 1984. Makes the following projects eligible for emergency relief funds: (1) a project to alleviate flooding conditions on an interstate highway in the vicinity of Carencro, Louisiana; and (2) a project to repair any Federal-aid primary route in San Mateo County, California, which was destroyed as a result of storms and a mountain slide during the winter of 1982-1983. Makes funds available to Maryland for resurfacing, restoring, rehabilitating, and reconstructing a specified interstate route. Revises provisions with respect to State use of allocated funds. Makes the construction of a bridge in the vicinity of Valley City and Florence, Illinois, eligible for the Federal highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation program. Amends the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 to remove cement from its Buy American provisions."
