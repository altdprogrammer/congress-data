Authorizes appropriations. Requires 75 percent of the amount available for such grants during any calendar quarter to be allocated to metropolitan cities and urban counties based on the relative number of unemployed persons in each city or county exceeding the number representing nine percent unemployment. Requires the Secretary to allocate the remaining amount available for supplementary grants to States for local governments, other than metropolitan cities and urban counties, experiencing high rates of unemployment and serious fiscal problems as a result of adverse economic conditions. Directs the Secretary to determine the amounts of grants to States on the basis of the relative number of unemployed persons in the local governments of each State exceeding the number representing nine percent unemployment. Sets forth grant application requirements and procedures. Allows funds provided under this Act to be used to supplement other Federal grant programs in lieu of local share requirements if the funded projects are consistent with community development objectives."
