    "text": "Joint Research and Development Act of 1984 - Declares that no joint research and development program shall be deemed illegal per se under the Federal antitrust laws or under any similar State law. Excludes from the term \"joint research and development program\" any activity in which two or more participating parties: (1) exchange information regarding the sales, marketing, or distribution of any product, process, or service; or (2) restrict or require the participation by any party in another research and development program, the production, marketing, or other commercial application by any party of any product, process, or service, or the sale, licensing, or sharing by any party of any invention not jointly developed under the program. Permits any party to a joint research and development program to file with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) a written notice disclosing: (1) the parties to such program; (2) the nature, objectives, and duration of the program; and (3) the agreements made by the parties under the program. Directs the Attorney General or the FTC, within 60 days after receiving such notice, to publish in the Federal Register a notice identifying the parties to such program and the general nature and duration of such program. Exempts material submitted as part of such notices from public disclosure. Limits the amount that may be recovered in an action brought by a person or by a State on behalf of its residents for an injury to business or property sustained as a result of a violation of a State or Federal antitrust law, to the amount of the actual damages sustained, interest thereon, and the cost of the suit, if: (1) the action is based on conduct under a joint research and development program that is described in the program notice filed with the Attorney General and the FTC; and (2) such action is filed after the notice of such program is published in the Federal Register. Directs the court to award the prevailing party in such action a reasonable attorney's fee. Provides that such recovery limitation shall not apply to any conduct that occurs after an order granting a permanent injunction has been issued against such conduct as a result of an action under Federal or State antitrust law."
