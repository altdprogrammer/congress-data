    "text": "Homesteading Act of 1983 - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to revise the urban homesteading program. Discontinues participation by a State or State-designated agency in such program. Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to: (1) donate property improved by a one-to four-family residence to a local government or a public agency designated by such government for use exclusively in a single-family homesteading program; (2) convey property suitable for a multifamily homesteading program to such government or agency for negotiated consideration; and (3) provide funds to such government or agency for the acquisition of property for use in a single-family or multifamily program. Requires that a single-family homesteading program provide for: (1) the initial conveyance of property by the government or agency without substantial consideration to a family of low or moderate income (income not exceeding 80 percent of the area median income) upon condition that the family agrees to repair all dangerous defects in the property within one year; (2) the conveyance of such property to such family without substantial consideration after such defects are repaired if the family agrees to occupy the property for at least five years and to make the improvements necessary to meet local housing standards within three years after the initial conveyance; (3) an equitable procedure for selecting property recipients that excludes current homeowners, considers the capacity of the applicant to contribute labor or obtain other assistance, and gives a priority to applicants who pay more than 30 percent of their income for substandard housing and who have little prospect for obtaining improved housing otherwise; and (4) the provision of technical and rehabilitation assistance to property recipients. Requires that a multifamily homesteading program provide for: (1) primarily residential use of all homestead properties following conversion or rehabilitation; (2) 75 percent occupancy by low-or moderate-income families; (3) cooperative ownership; (4) the exclusion of entities operated for profit as the first owners of converted or rehabilitated properties; (4) the contribution of labor by the occupants; (5) technical and rehabilitation assistance; and (6) minimal displacement of prior occupants. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to a local government or agency for the provision of rehabilitation assistance for homestead property recipients. Requires that at least 75 percent of such assistance be allocated to aid families of very low income (income not exceeding 50 percent of the area median income). Lists the criteria to be used by the Secretary in selecting projects to receive homesteading assistance. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, as well as the Administrator of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to comply with the request of a local government or agency of an area for a listing of the vacant residential properties in that area to which the Secretary holds title. Requires that such listings be accessible to the public. Requires the annual report of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to Congress to include an assessment of the extent of which homesteading programs consider the housing need and income of homestead applicants and an estimate of the median income of homestead recipients during the year. Authorizes appropriations for the urban homesteading program for FY 1984."
