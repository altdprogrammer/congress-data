    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 98-1075) Title I: Library Services and Construction - Library Services and Construction Act Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Library Services and Construction Act to revise the declaration of policy under such Act. Sets forth congressional findings relating to such Act. Includes under the definition of \"construction\": (1) remodeling to meet standards under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968; (2) remodeling designed to conserve energy; (3) renovation or remodeling to accommodate new technologies; and (4) the purchase of existing historic buildings for conversion to public libraries. Includes the Northern Mariana Islands under the definition of \"State.\" Defines \"Indian tribe\" (including Alaskan native organizations) for purposes of such Act. Defines \"Hawaiian native\" for purposes of such Act. Revises other definitions under such Act, including language describing physical handicaps. Authorizes appropriations under such Act for FY 1985 through 1989 for: (1) library services; (2) public library construction; and (3) interlibrary cooperation and resource sharing. Authorizes appropriations under such Act for FY 1985 through 1988 for: (1) foreign language materials acquisition; and (2) library literacy programs. Requires that two percent of such funds for library services, public library construction, and interlibrary cooperation and resource sharing be set aside for library services for Indian tribes. Requires that three-quarters of such set-aside funds be available for grants for library services for Indian tribes (including Alaskan native organizations) and that one-quarter of such set-aside funds be available for library services grants to Hawaiian native organizations. Provides for forward funding under such Act. Revises provisions for allotments, plans, programs, and payments for Indian tribes. Deletes references to programs for older readers services. Adds provisions for library grants to organizations primarily serving and representing Hawaiian natives that are recognized by the Governor of the State of Hawaii. Makes specified requirements for grants to Indian tribes applicable to such grants to Hawaiian native organizations. Restricts the use of funds for the administrative costs of library services, public library construction, interlibrary cooperation programs to the greater of: (1) six percent of the amount allotted to each State; or (2) $60,000. Revises provisions for grants to States for library services to allow such grant to be used for assisting libraries: (1) to serve as community information and referral centers; and (2) to provide literacy programs for adults and school dropouts in cooperation with other agencies and organizations, if appropriate. Revises language relating to other authorized uses of such grants. Specifies that individuals for whom library services are to be made accessible through such grants include those whose age, literacy level, or handicap (whether physical or not) makes them unable to receive the benefits of public library services regularly made available to the public. Includes assistance to libraries to serve as community information and referral centers under authorized uses of grants to States from allotments to pay the Federal share of carrying out State plans. Revises provisions for annual State library service programs. Requires that specified maintenance-of-effort provisions apply to services for institutionalized individuals. Requires such annual program to describe: (1) the uses of funds for programs for the elderly, which may include specified uses; and (2) the manner in which funds for programs for handicapped individuals will be used to make library services more accessible to such individuals. Provides for ratable reduction of certain required State minimum expenditures to the extent that Federal allocations to the State are reduced. Restricts the Federal share of the cost of public library construction to one-half of the total cost of each project. Requires that a specified portion of such funds be returned to the Federal government if within 20 years after completion a library constructed with Federal funds is no longer used for library purposes. Changes the heading of title III of such Act to \"Interlibrary Cooperation and Resource Sharing.\" Sets forth resource sharing requirements for State basic and long-range library programs. Requires that the long-range program and annual program of each State include a statewide resource sharing plan which is directed toward eventual compliance with the resource sharing requirements added by this Act. Specifies components which the State long-range program may include. Allows libraries participating in such resource sharing activities to be reimbursed for their expenses in loaning materials to public libraries. Deletes provisions of title IV of such Act for grants to States for older readers services, but revises required plan priorities to include programs and projects that serve the elderly. Sets forth a new title IV of such Act: \"Library Services for Indian Tribes.\" Requires the Secretary of Education to make grants to Indian tribes that have submitted an approved application for library services for Indians living on or near reservations. Provides that funds made available by such grants may be used for: (1) training of Indians as library personnel; (2) purchase of library materials; (3) conduct of special library programs for Indians; (4) salaries of library personnel; (5) construction, purchase, renovation, or remodeling of library buildings and facilities; (6) transportation to enable Indians to have access to library services; (7) dissemination of information about library services; (8) assessment of tribal library needs; and (9) contracts to provide library services. Sets forth provisions for applications and plans for library services for Indians. Directs the Secretary of Education to coordinate with the Secretary of the Interior such programs of library services for Indians with other programs for Indians. Adds a new title V of such Act: \"Foreign Language Materials Acquisition.\" Requires the Secretary to make grants to State and local public libraries for the acquisition of foreign language materials. Limits such grants to $15,000 each for any fiscal year. Requires that such grant recipients be selected on a competitive basis. Adds a new title VI of such Act: \"Library Literacy Programs.\" Requires the Secretary to make grants to State and local public libraries for the purposes of supporting literacy programs. Limits such grants to $25,000 each for any fiscal year. Requires that such grant recipients be selected on a competitive basis. Title II: Howard University Endowment - Howard University Endowment Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to establish an endowment program for Howard University. Authorizes the Secretary, from funds authorized under this title for the University, to make grants to the University. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with the University, including provisions necessary to assure that the purposes of this title will be achieved. Requires the University, in order to receive such a grant, to: (1) deposit in the endowment an amount equal to such grant; and (2) administer the endowment fund in accordance with the requirements of this title. Prohibits the source of funds for such institutional match from including Federal funds or funds derived from an existing endowment fund. Limits the period of any such grant to 20 years. Prohibits the University from withdrawing or expending any of its endowment fund corpus during such grant period. Allows the University, upon expiration of such period, to use the endowment fund corpus plus any endowment fund income for any educational purpose. Sets forth requirements for investments of the endowment fund corpus and endowment fund income. Sets forth provisions relating to authorized withdrawals and expenditures of endowment fund income. Prohibits the use of endowment fund income or corpus for any type of support of the executive officers of the University or for any commercial enterprise or endeavor entered into after January 1, 1981. Sets forth provisions for enforcement of requirements under this title. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such endowment program.
