    "text": "Counterfeit Access Device and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984 - Amends the Federal criminal code to make it a Federal offense: (1) to knowingly and unlawfully produce, buy, sell, or transfer a credit card or other access device which is counterfeit, forged, lost, or stolen; or (2) to produce, buy, sell, transfer, or possess equipment used to produce such fraudulent access devices. Limits the Federal crime to such offenses involving an aggregate value of $5,000 or more during a one year period or ten or more fraudulent access devices. Increases the penalty for subsequent offenses. Provides for an additional offense of using a computer without authorization with the intent to execute a scheme to defraud. Prohibits the unauthorized use of a computer when such conduct modifies or discloses information or prevents the use of such computer and obtains anything of value or creates a loss to another of a value of $5,000 or more during any one year. Grants authority to the U.S. Secret Service to investigate offenses under this Act."
