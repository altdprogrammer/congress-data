Authorizes the Secretary to order a vessel without a valid certificate of inspection to proceed to mooring and remain until a certificate is issued, or to take immediate steps necessary for safety. Increases the criminal penalty amounts for violations of inspection and safety laws. Adds civil penalties. Establishes requirements for periodic reports to the Coast Guard when a vessel owner or other specified person has reason to believe that such vessel may have been lost or imperiled. Amends the Revised Statutes of the United States by increasing the per ton liability of certain shipowners."
