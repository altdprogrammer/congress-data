    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #251 (216-211)) Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1983 - Title I: Control of Illegal Immigration-Part A: Employment - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make it unlawful for a person or other entity to: (1) hire, or recruit, or refer for a fee for U.S. employment any alien knowing that such person is unauthorized to work, or any person without verifying his or her work status (applies to employers of four or more employees); or (2) continue to hire an alien knowing of such person's unauthorized work status. Makes verification compliance an affirmative defense to any violation in the hiring or referral of an alien, including the situation of a State employment agency referral. Applies the sanctions under this Act to employers of four or more employees, except in the case of farm labor contractors. Directs the Attorney General, within two years, to establish an electronic data or telephone method to validate the social security account numbers of employee-applicants. Sets forth the verification process. Requires: (1) the employer to attest, on a form developed by the Attorney General, that the employee's work status has been verified by examination of a passport, birth certificate, social security card, alien documentation papers, or other proof; (2) the worker to similarly attest that he or she is a U.S. citizen or national, or authorized alien; and (3) the employer to keep such records for three years or one year after the employee leaves, whichever is longer. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize a national identity card or system. Makes it unlawful for an employer to require an employee to provide any type of financial guarantee or indemnity against any potential employment liability. Subjects violators, after notice and hearing opportunity, to civil penalties. Subjects employers to citations, graduated civil penalties, or injunctive remedies for hiring violations. Requires the Attorney General to provide notice and hearing opportunity. Permits judicial review of a final administrative penalty. Directs the Attorney General to file suit in U.S. district court to collect unpaid penalties. States that such employer sanction provisions preempt State and local laws. Directs the President to monitor and consult semiannually with Congress concerning implementation of such employment provisions and their impact on the U.S. economy and illegal entry of aliens. Directs the Civil Rights Commission to: (1) monitor the implementation and enforcement of such provisions; (2) investigate allegations of discrimination; and (3) report to the appropriate congressional committees at 18, 36, and 54-month intervals. Makes it an unfair immigration-related employment practice for an employer of four or more employees to discriminate against any individual (other than an unauthorized alien) with respect to hiring, or recruitment or referral for consideration, because of such individual's origin or alienage. Vests authority to enforce employer sanction and non-discrimination provisions in the United States Immigration Board (created by this Act) through specially trained administrative law judges and a Special Counsel. Refers allegations of violations to the Special Counsel and requires the Special Counsel to: (1) notify the alleged violator of the complaint within ten days; and (2) investigate and determine whether to prosecute the complaint within 30 days. Authorizes the Special Counsel to independently investigate and prosecute violations. States that violation hearings shall be held before such administrative law judges, who shall submit recommended orders to the Board for final approval. Authorizes the Board to: (1) accept, modify, or otherwise dispose of such an order; (2) order a party to cease and desist from unlawful activity; or (3) seek judicial enforcement of the order. Sets forth graduated civil penalties and equitable remedies. Permits a prevailing party to be awarded a reasonable attorney's fee. Directs the Attorney General: (1) in cooperation with the Secretaries of Labor, Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Treasury, and Commerce, and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, to disseminate program information for the first year after enactment of this Act; and (2) to issue implementing regulations within seven months. States that no penalties shall be imposed for the first seven months after enactment of this Act. Amends the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act to subject farm labor contractors to the requirements of this Act, beginning seven months after enactment. Makes it illegal to fraudently misuse or manufacture entry or work documents (up to $5,000 fine or two years' imprisonment or both). Part B: Enforcement and Services - States that two essential elements of the immigration control and reform program established by this Act are increased enforcement and administrative activities of the Border Patrol, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and other appropriate Federal agencies. Authorizes supplemental appropriations for INS service and enforcement activities for FY 1984, to be available for expenditure through FY 1985. Directs the Attorney General to develop and transmit to Congress within two months an INS funding and personnel plan for FY 1984, including an in-service training program. Requires FY 1985 and FY 1986 plan revisions as appropriate. Authorizes FY 1985 and 1986 INS appropriations. Subjects a person to criminal penalties for unlawful transportation of aliens into the United States for commercial advantage or private profit.
