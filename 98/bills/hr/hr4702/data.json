Requires that a specified value be added to any article (including distilled spirits) in order for it to be treated as produced in Puerto Rico. Prohibits the rebate of Federal excise taxes on any article if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that an excise tax subsidy was provided by Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands for such article which is different in kind or amount from that generally offered to industries producing articles not subject to Federal excise taxes. Exempts rum and any articles consumed in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands from the provisions of this Act."
