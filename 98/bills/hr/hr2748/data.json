    "text": "Public Housing Tenant Reporting Procedures Act - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to make it the responsibility of each public housing agency operating a lower income housing project to establish a procedure for determining the eligibility of, and rent to be paid by, families applying for, or occupying, project units. Authorizes such an agency to require families to provide only information directly related to accomplishing fair housing objectives or determining eligibility, rental payments, or appropriate unit size. Prohibits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from: (1) requiring any such family to provide information that duplicates information provided to a public housing agency except for a survey of a sample population or an audit of the agency's procedures for determining rent and eligibility; or (2) maintaining any record on an applicant or occupant family unless such record is necessary for an investigation of a specific allegation of fraud by such family."
