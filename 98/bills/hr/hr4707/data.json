    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, in lieu of S. 2242) Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984 - Title I - Designates the following lands in Arizona as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Apache Creek Wilderness in the Prescott National Forest; (2) the Cedar Bench Wilderness in the Prescott National Forest; (3) the Bear Wallow Wilderness in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest; (4) the Castle Creek Wilderness in the Prescott National Forest; (5) lands in the Coronado National Forest which shall be included in the Chiricahua Wilderness; (6) the Fossil Springs Wilderness in the Coconino National Forest; (7) the Four Peaks Wilderness in the Tonto National Forest; (8) lands in the Coronado National Forest which shall be included in the Galiuro Wilderness; (9) the Granite Mountain Wilderness in the Prescott National Forest; (10) the Hellsgate Wilderness in the Tonto National Forest; (11) the Juniper Mesa Wilderness in the Prescott National Forest; (12) the Kendrick Mountain Wilderness in the Kaibab and Coconino National Forests; (13) lands in the Tonto National Forest which shall be included in the Mazatzal Wilderness; (14) the Miller Peak Wilderness in the Coronado National Forest; (15) the Mount Wrightson Wilderness in the Coronado National Forest; (16) the Munds Mountain Wilderness in the Coconino National Forest; (17) the Pajarita Wilderness in the Coronado National Forest; (18) the Red Rock-Secret Mountain Wilderness in the Coconino National Forest; (19) the Rincon Mountain Wilderness in the Coronado National Forest; (20) the Salome Wilderness in the Tonto National Forest; (21) the Salt River Canyon Wilderness in the Tonto National Forest; (22) the Kachina Peaks Wilderness in the Coconino National Forest; (23) the Santa Teresa Wilderness in the Coronado National Forest; (24) lands in the Tonto National Forest which shall be included in the Superstition Wilderness; (25) lands in the Coconino and Prescott National Forests which shall be included in the Sycamore Canyon Wilderness; (26) the West Clear Creek Wilderness in the Coconino National Forest; (27) the Wet Beaver Wilderness in the Coconino National Forest; and (28) the Woodchute Wilderness in the Prescott National Forest; (29) the Strawberry Crater North and South Wilderness in the Coconino National Forest; and (30) the Escudilla Wilderness in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to review and report to specified congressional committees on the Department of Agriculture policies, practices, and regulations regarding livestock grazing in national forest wilderness areas in Arizona. Requires the Secretary to determine the suitability of the following lands in the Coronado National Forest for preservation as wilderness and to submit recommendations to the President: (1) the Bunk Robinson Peak Wilderness Study Area; (2) the Whitmire Canyon Wilderness Study Area; and (3) the Mount Graham Wilderness Study Area. Provides that the President shall submit recommendations with respect to such areas to Congress by January 1, 1986. Requires that such areas be administered so as to maintain their presently existing wilderness character and potential. Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Arizona shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Arizona which were reviewed in the RARE II program (and Arizona national forest system roadless lands of less than 5000 acres) from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending revision of initial land management plans, but requires review of the wilderness option when the plans are revised. Provides that areas in Arizona reviewed in the final environmental statement (and Arizona national forest system roadless lands of less than 5,000 acres) which were not designated wilderness or wilderness study shall be managed for multiple use. Provides that in the event that revised land management plans in Arizona are implemented, areas not recommeded for wilderness designation need not be managed to protect such designation prior to or during plan revision, and areas recommended for wilderness designation shall be managed to protect such designation. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless areas review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Arizona without express congressional authorization. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate a portion of the Verde River in Arizona as a component of the national wild and scenic rivers system. Adds to the Chiricahua National Monument, in Arizona, the Bonita Creek Watershed in the Coronado National Forest. Title II - Designates specified lands in Graham and Pinal Counties in Arizona as the Aravaipa Canyon Wilderness. Title III - Designates the following lands as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Cottonwood Point Wilderness in the Arizona Strip District of the Bureau of Land Management in Arizona; (2) the Grand Wash Cliffs Wilderness in the Arizona Strip District; (3) the Kanab Creek Wilderness in the Kaibab National Forest and in the Arizona Strip District; (4) the Mount Logan Wilderness in the Arizona Strip District; (5) the Mount Trumbull Wilderness in the Arizona Strip District; (6) the Paiute Wilderness in the Arizona Strip District; (7) the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness in the Arizona Strip District and in the Cedar City District in Utah; (8) the Saddle Mountain Wilderness in the Kaibab National Forest; and (9) the Beaver Dam Mountains Wilderness in the Arizona Strip District and in the Cedar City District. Releases from management as wilderness areas those lands in the Arizona Strip District of the Bureau of Land Management in Arizona and those portions of the Starvation Point Wilderness Study Area and of the Paria Canyon Instant Study Area plus contiguous units in the Cedar City District of the Bureau of Land Management in Utah which are not designated as wilderness by this Act. Title IV - States that if any provision of this Act is held invalid the rest of the Act shall not thereby be affected."
