    "text": "Federal Audiovisual Policy Act - Establishes the Office of Federal Audiovisual Policy (OFAP) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Provides for the appointment of the Administrator of OFAP by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Requires the Director of OMB to develop and implement Federal policy and procurement procedures for the acquisition, production, and distribution of audiovisual material by Federal agencies. Lists the duties of the Administrator, including: (1) developing uniform procedures to simplify agency procurement of audiovisual material; (2) requiring agencies to acquire audiovisual material, except for certain classified or confidential material, under contracts with private producers; (3) overseeing the distribution outside the Government of material produced with Government funds; (4) establishing standards and selection criteria and procedures for the establishment and maintenance of a master producer list specifying production capabilities and specialties; (5) providing producer competency review to guide the Small Business Administration in issuing certificates of compentency requested by producers; and (6) report to the President and Congress annually on the audiovisual activities and recommendations of the Administrator and the Director. Requires each Federal agency to conduct its audiovisual activities in an efficient, effective, and economical manner and to comply with audiovisual policies and procedures prescribed by the Director or the Administrator. Directs the head of each agency to designate a senior official to represent the agency in consultations with the Director or Administrator over the development of such policies and procedures and to carry out the agency's audiovisual responsibilities. Requires each agency, at the request of the Administrator, to provide the Administrator with complete information on, and budget requests for, the agency's production, use, and maintenance of audiovisual material. Directs the Administrator to publish such information and deliver it to the Administrator of General Services for deposit into the National Archives. Directs the Administrator of General Services to make such publications available to the public through the National Audiovisual Center. Requires each agency, upon request, to report to OFAP on the success or failure of any production of audiovisual material within one year after completing such production. Limits distribution of such report to the OFAP, the Administrator, the Director, and Congress. Prohibits any agency from entering into a contract with a producer of audiovisual material unless the producer provides the Secretary of Labor with adequate assurances that: (1) employees will be paid at least the prevailing minimum compensation for individuals employed in similar activities; and (2) no work will be performed under conditions that are unsanitary or hazardous. Authorizes appropriations."
