    "text": "Title I: National Jobs Creation - Amends the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to provide that such Act may be cited as the National Jobs Creation Act of 1983. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make grants for a portion of the cost of projects submitted in a jobs creation strategy, upon application of States, local governments, Indian tribes, public nonprofit organizations established for jobs creation purposes, or multijurisdictional units within a State which meet certain eligibility criteria. Permits such job creation assistance to be for: (1) construction, repair, rehabilitation, and improvement of public facilities, including the acquisition of land and other public works improvements to encourage and support private development; (2) revolving loan funds to promote establishment and growth of small businesses and to retain indigenous firms and entrepreneurs which contribute to the creation, retention, and expansion of private sector jobs; and (3) jobs creation activities which address and prevent economic dislocation and facilitate economic adjustment which contributes to economic diversification and long-term economic vitality of the area. Permits States local governments, Indian tribes, or multijurisdictional units within a State which meet eligibility \"distress requirements\" to apply for such grants. Requires grant applications to include: (1) a certification that the area for which the grant is to be made meets the distress requirements; (2) a certification relative to the performance of any responsibilities which the Secretary has agreed to accept under specified provisions of this Act; and (3) a jobs creation strategy prepared in accordance with specified provisions of this Act. Sets forth factors which the Secretary must consider in approving grant applications. Sets forth \"distress requirements.\" Requires that any area receiving such a grant have: (1) a per capita income of 80 percent or less or the national average; (2) an unemployment rate two percent above the national average for the most recent 24-month period for which statistics are available; or (3) experienced or about to experience a sudden economic dislocation resulting in job loss that is significant both in terms of the number of jobs eliminated and the effect upon the employment rate of the area. Requires that documentation of distress be: (1) supported by Federal data, when available through the State government; (2) accepted by the Secretary unless it is determined to be inaccurate; and (3) gathered from the most recent statistics available. Sets forth requirements for the job creation strategy which a grant applicant must prepare. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants under this title to an applicant to establish a revolving loan fund for making or guaranteeing loans to: (1) small businesses for initial or working capital or the purchase of facilities or equipment; (2) businesses where capital is needed to complete financing necessary to retain the business in the area. Limits any grant for the establishment or recapitalization of a revolving loan fund to $1,000,000. Prohibits loans or guarantees from such a fund unless: (1) such financial assistance is not otherwise available from private lenders on specified terms; and (2) reasonable assurance of repayment is provided. Requires the grantee to administer the fund. Prohibits the United States from exercising any control over such administration. Provides that any grant for a project for any eligibility activity under this title shall be in an amount which, when added to that available from all other sources, is sufficient to complete the project, but limits such grant amount to 50 percent of the project completion cost as determined at the time of the grant application. Prohibits any additional funds from being granted or otherwise made available under this title for any project for which such a grant has been made. Limits the amount of any grant for the establishment of a revolving loan fund under this title to an amount equal to that available from all other sources. Limits the amount of any additional grant for the recapitalization of such a fund to one-third of the amount available from all other sources. Prohibits the expenditure in any one State of more than 15 percent of the appropriations made pursuant to this title. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title for FY 1983 and 1984. Prohibits approval of any grant under this title unless the Secretary is satisfied that the project will be properly and efficiently administered, operated, and maintained. Authorizes the Secretary to discharge any responsibilities of his or her relative to a project for which a grant may be made under this title by accepting a certification by the applicant of the applicant's performance of such responsibilities. Authorizes the Secretary to rescind such acceptance, if necessary. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the Congress on operations under this title for FY 1983 and thereafter, by February 1 of the following year. Directs the Secretary to maintain a list of applications approved for a grant under this title, as a permanent part of the Department of Commerce records and available for public inspection. Requires each grant recipient to keep specified records for audit purposes. Grants the Secretary and the Comptroller General access for audit and examination to pertinent records of grant recipients. Title II: Appalachian Regional Transition Assistance - Appalachian Transition Act of 1983 - Amends the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 to declare that investments under such Act shall also be made in severely distressed and underdeveloped counties lacking resources for basic services and in areas without access to sufficient health services. Adds as a purpose of such Act the orderly transition from special Federal assistance to increased State, local, and private investment in Appalachian regional development. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 for the administrative expenses of the Appalachian Regional Commission. Authorizes the Commission to lease office space through FY 1984. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1984 for the Appalachian development highway system. Increases from 70 to 80 percent the subsequent Federal share of an Appalachian development highway segment when a participating State proceeds to construct a segment of such a highway without the aid of Federal funds. Applies such increase to projects approved after March 31, 1979. Extends to October 1, 1984, the date by which specified Federal grant-in-aid programs must be authorized in order to be covered by provisions for supplements to such programs. Authorizes the Commission, after September 30, 1983, to make grants to States and public and nonprofit entities for projects to assist: (1) in creation or retention of permanent private sector jobs, upgrading of the region's manpower, or attraction or private investment; (2) severely distressed and underdeveloped counties which lack financial resources for improving basic services; or (3) in reducing infant mortality or in providing adequate health manpower or reasonable access to primary health care for every resident of the region. Prohibits approval of any project for assistance under such Act after September 30, 1983 (except for development highways and local development district support, research, and technical assistance) unless the Commission determines such project: (1) is necessary for a related private sector commitment which assures either the direct creation or retention of jobs in the region of a specific private investment substantially enhancing area economic development potential; (2) will upgrade manpower for jobs in the region through training relevant to the regional job market; (3) assists a facility to provide safe drinking water, affordable waste disposal, or other similar basic service in a county designated by the Commission as severely distressed or under developed; or (4) assists, for a limited period, the provision of primary health care, infant mortality reduction, or recruitment of health manpower in designated areas. Limits, after September 30, 1983, grants under such Act to 50 percent of project costs (except development highways projects). Permits such grants to increase the Federal contribution to any project to such percentage as the Commission determines within the limitations in such Act. Prohibits funds authorized under this title from being approved under such Act for projects for: (1) libraries, cultural centers, or recreation facilities; (2) construction of schools, hospitals, or government office buildings; (3) community centers, or social services facilities (with specified exceptions); or (4) operations, except costs for startup and first year. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such Act for FY 1984 (in addition to the appropriations authorized for administrative expenses and for the Appalachian development highway system and local access roads). Extends the termination date of such Act to October 1, 1984. (Such termination does not apply to the Appalachian development highway system provisions of such Act). Repeals specified provisions of such Act."
