Amends the Potato Research and Promotion Act to state that provisions for public representatives on the National Potato Promotion Board and for payment to the Department of Agriculture for any referendum and administrative costs so incurred shall not be subject to approval in a producer referendum. Provides for an assessment rate of not more than one cent per hundred pounds of potatoes. Stipulates that if approved by a producer referendum such rate may not exceed one-half of one percent of the immediate past ten-year average potato price. States that the failure of potato producers in December 1982 to approve certain amendments to a marketing plan is not deemed to invalidate such plan."
