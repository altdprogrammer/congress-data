    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Service Industries Commerce Development Act of 1984 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish in the Department of Commerce a service industries development program designed to: (1) develop policies to increase the competitiveness of U.S. service industries; (2) develop a data base for assessing the adequacy of current policies, and for developing future, U.S. policies pertaining to services; (3) collect and analyze information pertaining to the international operations and competitiveness of U.S. service industries; (4) conduct studies of U.S. service industries; and (5) conduct a program of research and analysis of service related issues and problems. Directs the Secretary to try to establish arrangements to gain access to private sector information that is necessary for the service industries development program. Authorizes the Secretary to require such information if the Secretary considers it critical for carrying out the program. Provides for protecting the confidentiality of the information. Sets forth penalties for: (1) refusing to furnish information that the Secretary considers critical for the establishment of a service industries development program; and (2) failing to comply with any rule or regulation issued by the Secretary to carry out this program. Sets forth procedures for enforcing such requirements. Directs the Secretary to consult regularly with respresentatives of U.S. service industries concerning policies on service industry competitiveness. Directs the U.S. Trade Representative, through the interagency trade organization established pursuant to the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to develop and coordinate the implementation of U.S. policies concerning trade in services. Requires each U.S. department or agency responsible for the regulation of service sector industry to advise and work with the U.S. Trade Representative concerning: (1) the treatment afforded U.S. service sector interest in foreign markets; or (2) allegations of unfair practices by foreign governments or companies in a service sector. Requires the Commerce Department and other agencies, upon request, to provide staff support and other assistance for negotiations on service related issues by the U.S. Trade Representative and the domestic implementation of service- related agreements. Expresses the policy of the Congress that the President shall: (1) consult with State governments on issues of trade policy; (2) establish intergovernmental policy advisory committees on trade which shall serve as a principal forum for State and local governments to consult with the Federal Government on trade policy issues; and (3) provide State and local governments and U.S. service industries, upon request, advice, assistance, and information concerning U.S. policies on international trade in services. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to direct the President to seek information and advice from the non-Federal governmental sector on negotiating objectives and bargaining positions before entering into a trade agreement. Authorizes the President to establish policy advisory committees representing non-Federal governmental interests to provide policy advice on such negotiating objectives and bargaining positions and with respect to implementation of trade agreements. Directs the President to include as members of such committees representatives of non-Federal governmental interests where appropriate after consultation by the Trade Representative with such representatives. Requires the Secretary to report biannually to the Congress and the President on the service industries development program. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize the President to restrict the terms and conditions, or deny the issuance, of any service sector access authorization with respect to the services of a foreign country. Permits such actions by the President only after a petition for enforcement of U.S. rights under a trade agreement has been filed with the U.S. Trade Representative. Requires the U.S. Trade Representative, before the President takes such actions, to consult with the head of any Federal or State agency that regulates such services. Declares that the principal U.S. negotiating objective with respect to trade in services shall be to: (1) reduce or eliminate barriers to, or other distortions of, international trade in services including barriers that deny national treatment and restrictions on the establishment and operation of enterprises providing services in foreign markets; and (2) develop internationally agreed rules which will reduce or eliminate such barriers or distortions and help insure open international trade in services."
