Permits such funds to be used for up to 50 percent of the purchase price of high-technology equipment for training programs in the operation and servicing of such equipment. Requires such programs to emphasize multiskill training and to be cooperative and innovative efforts between public and private sectors. Defines \"high- technology equipment\" as recent innovations in tools and equipment, including computers and word processors, which represent the state-of-the-art in a trade or vocation."
