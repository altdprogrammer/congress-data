Permits a retired administrative law judge who is receiving a civil service annuity to be temporarily reappointed an administrative law judge. Title II: Merit Systems Protection Board - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for the Merit Systems Protection Board. Authorizes designated employees of the Board or the Special Counsel to issue subpoenas and order the taking of depositions and order responses to written interrogatories. Permits a civil service employee to appeal a discrimination complaint to the Board if there is no judicially reviewable action taken on the complaint between the 120th and the 365th day after the filing of the employee's petition. Requires the Board to publish sample copies of questionnaires used and results obtained from studies of civil service and other merit systems. Requires the Board to publish comments and information received in response to Board initiatives to carry out its functions. Grants jurisdiction for appeals of disciplinary actions by the Board to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit except in cases involving political activity. Requires employees or individuals who violate the prohibition against influencing elections or taking part in political campaigns to be subject to disciplinary action under a specified provision relating to complaints filed by the Special Counsel. Provides that a denial of a periodic step-increase for failure to meet an acceptable level of competence shall be sustained upon appeal only if it is supported by substantial evidence. Requires that an employee or applicant who prevails in an appeal of an agency action shall be granted the relief provided in the decision pending the outcome of a petition of review. Title III: The Office of the Special Counsel - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for the Office of the Special Counsel of the Merit Systems Protection Board. Authorizes an employee of the Special Counsel designated by the Special Counsel to administer oaths, examine witnesses, take depositions, and receive evidence. Authorizes attorneys appointed by the Special Counsel to appear on behalf of any party in any civil action brought in connection with a function carried out by the Special Counsel and to initiate and prosecute an appeal of any such action. Requires the Special Counsel to prepare an annual budget which shall be included as a separate item in the budget transmitted to the Congress. Provides that funds appropriated to the Office of the Special Counsel shall be the responsibility solely of the Special Counsel and that the Chairman of the Merit Systems Protection Board shall have no responsibility for or authority over such funds. Title IV: Federal Labor Relations Authority - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for the Federal Labor Relations Authority. Designates the Chairman of the Federal Labor Relations Authority as the chief executive and administrative officer of the Authority. Requires an award to be final and binding unless the Authority takes action on the award within 60 days after the exception is filed. Title V: Miscellaneous Technical and Conforming Amendments - Requires that appropriations for the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Special Counsel, and the Federal Labor Relations Authority for any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1984, shall be considered to be authorized only to the extent expressly provided by statute for the fiscal year involved. Makes the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund available, subject to annual congressional limitations, for any expenses incurred by the Merit Systems Protection Board in the administration of certain appeals. Requires the first assistant to the head of an independent agency or an officer of a bureau of such agency (other than the General Accounting Office) to perform the duties of the head of the agency or the officer if that person dies, resigns, or is sick or absent until a successor is appointed or the head of the agency or the officer returns. Limits the duration of details to vacancies caused by death or resignation to 30 days when Congress is in session unless a nomination to fill the vacancy has been submitted to the Senate. Prohibits such a detail after adjournment sine die of the Congress in which such nomination was submitted. Repeals the termination date of the Office of Personnel Management revolving fund used to finance investigations, training, and other functions. Authorizes the Department of the Navy to continue the implementation of a specified personnel demonstration project currently in operation at the Naval Weapons Center, China Lake, California, and at the Naval Ocean Systems Center, San Diego, California, until September 30, 1990."
