    "text": "Used Car Fair Dealing Act of 1983 - Makes it a deceptive act or practice in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act for any used vehicle dealer in the course of a sale to: (1) misrepresent the mechanical conditions of the vehicle; (2) fail to disclose any material defect or condition known to the dealer; (3) represent the vehicle as free from material defects without a reasonable basis for such representation; (4) fail to provide a written copy of the warranty offered in connection with the sale; (5) misrepresent the terms of the warranty; (6) represent a used vehicle as sold with a warranty when the vehicle is sold without such warranty; or (7) fail to disclose that a vehicle is sold without any warranty. Requires the dealer to prepare and display on such a vehicle a \"Used Car Buyers Guide\" reciting the specific terms of the warranty if one is given and clearly stating all disclosures. Requires the dealer to provide the consumer with a copy of such window form. Disallows any oral or written statements of the dealer which alter or contradict the disclosures required by this Act. Requires the window form to be in Spanish if the dealer conducts the sale of the used vehicle in Spanish. Requires the dealer to disclose any material defect in, or material condition of, the used vehicle of which the dealer has knowledge as a result of any inspection or test. Grants State exemptions from the requirements of this Act in certain situations."
