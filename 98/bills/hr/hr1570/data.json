Directs the Secretary of the Army to issue permits to applicants, after notice and opportunity for a public hearing, for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters at disposal sites specified by the applicants, unless the Secretary determines that such disposal sites cannot be specified through the application of the guidelines or other considerations in accordance with provisions for specification of disposal sites. Provides that, except in the case of a State request for Federal jurisdiction over nonnavigable waters, the discharge of dredged or fill material in waters other than navigable waters is not prohibited by or otherwise subject to legislation under such Act or an other Act of Congress. Directs the Secretary to extend application of such Act to nonnavigable waters within a State which are listed and defined by the State Governor in a written request concurred in by the State legislature in accordance with State law. Repeals provisions for an optional State permit program. Deletes the qualifying phrase \"to the maximum extent practicable\" with respect to the 90-day deadline for decisions on permit applications. Makes miscellaneous and conforming amendments."
