    "text": "Telecommunications Competition Act of 1983 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require that any telephone operating company shall retain any terminal equipment which it provided on the effective date of this Act and shall continue to make the equipment available to customers under tariffs in force as of such date until the equipment is fully depreciated except that: (1) State commissions shall permit increases in such tariffs to reflect any reasonable increases in the costs of providing such equipment; and (2) the customer may purchase such equipment for a price fixed by the State commission. Authorizes operating companies to offer other terminal equipment to the public at any time after January 1, 1984, if the equipment: (1) is manufactured by unaffiliated persons; and (2) is offered through a separate subsidiary which meets specified requirements. Permits an operating company to offer an enhanced service to the public only through a separate subsidiary which meets such requirements. Prohibits an operating company from discriminating between the products, services, and requirements of a dominant carrier and those of other persons in the: (1) procurement of facilities, products, and services; (2) establishment and dissemination of technical standards and specifications for procurement and interconnection; (3) interconnection and use of the facilities of the operating company or in the charges for each element of such use; and (4) provision of new services and planning for and implementation of the construction or modification of facilities used to provide exchange access. Sets forth a schedule according to which an operating company shall be required to purchase a specified percentage of its requirements in each product category from manufacturers who are unaffiliated with a dominant carrier. Directs the Federal Communications Commission, ten years after enactment of this Act, to review the effectiveness of this schedule in establishing and maintaining a policy of competitive procurement. Defines an operating company as a carrier owned or controlled by a dominant carrier on January 1, 1983."
