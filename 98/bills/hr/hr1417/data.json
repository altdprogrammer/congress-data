    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-02-10", 
    "text": "Nuclear Nonproliferation Policy Act of 1983 - Title I: Authorizations by the Secretary of Energy for Certain Activities Outside the United States - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require the publication in the Federal Register of authorizations for the production of special nuclear materials outside the United States. Provides that such an authorization will not become effective until at least 15 days after its publication. Requires reports submitted by the President to the Congress pursuant to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 to identify activities so authorized during the preceding year. Directs the Secretary of Energy to require persons who are engaged in activities requiring such authorization but who are not required to apply for authorization to report to the Secretary regarding such activities. Makes authorizations for the production of special nuclear material outside the United States effective with respect to a non-nuclear-weapon state only if the Secretary of Energy determines that such state adheres to the criteria governing U.S. nuclear exports for peaceful uses. Requires the Secretary to publish and submit to the President any recommendation for such an authorization with respect to a non-nuclear-weapon state which does not adhere to such criteria. Authorizes the President to allow such an authorization by executive order if withholding it would prejudice the achievement of U.S. nonproliferation objectives or jeopardize the common defense and security, unless Congress, after reviewing such an order, adopts a concurrent resolution opposing or vetoing such order. Provides that conduct which results in the termination of U.S. nuclear exports to another nation shall result also in the suspension of authorizations for the production of special nuclear material in such nation. Title II: Highly Enriched Uranium - Authorizes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to issue export licenses for highly enriched uranium for nuclear reactors only if: (1) there is no alternative nuclear reactor fuel available; (2) the proposed recipient of the uranium has indicated that it will use an alternative nuclear reactor fuel when one becomes available; and (3) the executive branch is developing an alternative nuclear reactor fuel. Requires the NRC to determine a kilogram limit on the amount of highly enriched uranium of U.S. origin that will be allowed at any one time in each foreign country and at each reactor site in each such country. Requires the NRC and the executive branch to support efforts to improve physical security arrangements for exports of highly enriched uranium. Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress a plan for the development of alternative nuclear reactor fuels for use in foreign reactors. Title III: Arrangements Involving Reprocessing - Requires a determination by the NRC (currently only the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of State) that a significant increase of the risk of proliferation will not result from the Secretary of Energy entering into a subsequent arrangement for: (1) reprocessing of special nuclear material in a facility which has not processed power reactor fuel assemblies or been the subject of such an arrangement prior to enactment of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978; or (2) retransfer to a non-nuclear-weapon state of plutonium, resulting from such processing, in quantities greater than 500 grams. Requires a new or amended agreement for cooperation before approval is given to a nation or group of nations for: (1) retransfer to a third country for reprocessing of special nuclear material, in quantities greater than 31 metric tons, exported by the United States or produced through the use of nuclear material and equipment or sensitive nuclear technology exported by the United States; or (2) reprocessing of special nuclear material in quantities greater than 31 metric tons or the subsequent retransfer of plutonium, resulting from such processing, in quantities greater than 240 kilograms. Title IV: Special Functions of the Secretary of Defense in Nuclear Nonproliferation Matters - Requires the approval of the Secretary of Defense for international cooperation agreements, export licenses, and subsequent arrangements with respect to nuclear material. Title V: Exports of Reprocessing Components and Technology - Prohibits, with specified exceptions, the exportation under a cooperation agreement of: (1) any component part or group of component parts determined by the President to be essential to the operation of a complete facility for nuclear fuel reprocessing; (2) any information, excluding restricted data, which is not available to the public and which is important to the design or operation of such a facility; or (3) other assistance essential to nuclear fuel reprocessing. Title VI: Exports Licensed by the Department of Commerce - Prohibits the issuance by the Secretary of Commerce of a validated license under the Export Administration Act of 1979 for the export to a non-nuclear-weapon state of goods or technology to be used in a production or utilization facility unless the Secretary of Energy determines that such state adheres to the criteria governing U.S. nuclear exports for peaceful uses. Requires the Secretary of Energy, in the event a determination is made to issue a license prohibited under this provision, to publish such decision and to submit the license application in question to the President. Authorizes the President to allow the issuance of such a license by executive order if withholding it would jeopardize the common defense and security, unless Congress, after reviewing such an order, adopts a concurrent resolution opposing or vetoing the order. Provides that conduct which results in the termination of U.S. nuclear exports to another nation shall result also in the prohibition of the issuance of a license for the export of goods or technology to be used in any production or utilization facility."
