Requires that any prevailing rate positions in the Bureau which have been reclassified to a lower grade on or after January 1, 1984, be reclassified to the position classification in effect on December 31, 1983. Entitles any position incumbent to the pay and benefits of the position as it was classified on December 31, 1983, retroactively to January 1, 1984. Permits the proper reclassification of prevailing rate positions within the Bureau in the future, provided that the position of any incumbent shall not be downgraded as a result of any such reclassification within 120 days after GAO submits its report."
