    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Florida Wilderness Act of 1983 - Designates the following lands in Florida as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Bradwell Bay Wilderness Addition in the Apalachicola National Forest; (2) the Mud Swamp/New River Wilderness in the Apalachicola National Forest; (3) the Big Gum Swamp Wilderness in the Osceola National Forest; (4) the Alexander Springs Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest; (5) the Juniper Prairie Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest; (6) the Little Lake George Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest; and (7) the Billies Bay Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to review the following Florida lands to determine their suitability for preservation as wilderness: (1) the Clear Lake Wilderness Study Area in the Apalachiola National Forest; and (2) the Natural Area Wilderness Study Area in the Osceola National Forest. Directs the Secretary to report to the President and the President to make a recommendation to Congress within three years of the enactment of this Act. Prohibits the Department of the Interior from issuing phosphate leases in the Osceola National Forest until the President recommends to Congress that such leases be permitted in a specified area of the forest, based upon a national need for phosphate. Requires the President to submit the basis for such recommendation, a statement of conditions governing the activity, and the required environmental impact statements. Makes a Presidential recommendation effective only upon enactment of a joint resolution of Congress approving it. Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Florida shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Florida which were reviewed in the RARE II program (and roadless Florida lands of less than 5,000 acres) from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial land management plans, but requires review of the wilderness option when the plans are revised. Provides that areas in Florida reviewed in the final environmental statement and not designated wilderness or wilderness study shall be managed for multiple use. Provides that if revised land management plans in Florida are implemented areas not recommended for wilderness designation need not be managed as wilderness, and areas recommended for wilderness designation shall be managed to protect their wilderness designation. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Florida without express congressional authorization."
