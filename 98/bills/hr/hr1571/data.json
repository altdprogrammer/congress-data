    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Ways and Means with amendment, H. Rept. 98-383 (Part I)) Reciprocal Trade and Investment Act of 1983 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to set forth provisions dealing with foreign trade barriers. Requires the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to submit an annual report to the appropriate congressional committees on foreign trade barriers of U.S. exports. Directs that such report contain a comprehensive inventory and an assessment of acts, policies, or practices which restrict market access for competitive U.S. exports of goods or services, or foreign direct investment by U.S. persons with implications for trade in goods or services. Requires such report to be developed and coordinated by the USTR through the interagency trade organization established pursuant to the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Requires the head of each executive branch department or agency to furnish necessary information to the USTR. Authorizes such department or agency heads to detail personnel and to furnish services as the USTR may request. Requires the USTR to submit a report to Congress on factors not addressed in this Act which significantly affect the competitiveness of U.S. high technology industries. Sets forth conditions and limitations upon the President's authority to enforce U.S. rights under trade agreements and to respond to certain foreign trade practices. Authorizes the President to restrict or deny access to a foreign supplier of services to the U.S. service market concerned. Directs that such access restrictions only apply to specified trade authorizations pending on or after a certain petition is filed or the USTR makes a determination to initiate market access restrictions. Requires the USTR to consult with the head of any Federal agency which regulates the services of any foreign country before the President imposes fees or other restrictions on such services. Sets forth provisions for the review of petitions by the USTR. Requires the USTR to publish any determination to initiate an investigation in the Federal Register. Requires the USTR to consult with certain committees before making any such determinations. Requires the USTR to recommend to the President what action to take on the basis of investigations and consultations. Requires the USTR to make such recommendations within specified time periods. Sets forth provisions concerning the availability of certain business information and the use of such information by the USTR. Requires the USTR to publish notice in the Federal Register of any extensions of investigations or recommendations agreed to by the petitioner. Makes conforming amendments. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should seek: (1) negotiations with foreign governments to reduce or eliminate restrictions on fair access to foreign markets for U.S. exports; and (2) the agreement of the contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on certain international trade matters including trade restrictions and barriers. Sets forth the principal U.S. negotiating objectives with respect to trade in services, foreign direct investment, and high technology products. Directs the USTR to develop and coordinate the implementation of U.S. policies concerning trade in services. Requires Federal agencies responsible for regulating any service sector industry to advise and work with the USTR concerning: (1) the treatment afforded U.S. services sector interest in foreign markets; (2) allegations of unfair practices by foreign governments or companies in a service sector; (3) negotiations on service-related issues; and (4) domestic implementation of service-related agreements. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to establish a service industries development program. Sets forth the goals of the program. Expresses the policy of the Congress that the President shall: (1) consult with State governments on trade policy issues affecting the regulatory authority of non-Federal governments or their procurement of goods and services; (2) establish one or more intergovernmental policy advisory committee on trade; and (3) provide advice, assistance and information on U.S. policies on international trade in services to State and local governments. Authorizes the President to establish policy advisory committees representing non-Federal governmental interests to provide policy advice on trade negotiating objectives, bargaining positions, and the implementation of trade agreements. Authorizes the President to enter into trade agreements providing for modifications or continuations of tariff treatment whenever: (1) the President determines that an existing import restriction of a foreign country or of the United States is unduly burdening and restricting U.S. foreign trade and the purposes of this Act will be promoted by the trade agreement; or (2) any action (other than an import relief action) has been taken to increase or impose import restriction that requires new concessions in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions. Prohibits such agreements in any one-year period from affecting the rates of duty for articles which account for more than two percent of the value of U.S. imports for the most recent 12-month period for which import statistics are available. Prohibits using such negotiating authority: (1) with respect to articles which the President designates as import sensitive; or (2) with respect to negotiations that have not been subject to the prerequisites of the provisions dealing with consultations concerning negotiations. Permits the President to enter into such agreements during the three-year period following enactment of this Act. Requires such agreements to meet specified requirements of the Trade Act relating to congressional approval."
