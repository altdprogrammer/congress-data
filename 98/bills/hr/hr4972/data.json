    "text": "Petroleum Overcharge Restitution Act - Directs the Secretary of Energy to distribute the following restitutionary amounts, which are held or received as a result of a settlement, order, or judgment involving overcharges resulting from alleged petroleum pricing violations under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973: (1) amounts held in escrow on the date of enactment of this Act; and (2) amounts received after the date of enactment of this Act. Establishes in the Treasury the Petroleum Overcharge Restitution Fund into which shall be deposited restitutionary amounts which the Secretary determines: (1) exceed amounts needed for refunds to persons who sustained economic injury from overcharges; or (2) cannot be refunded to persons who sustained economic injury because they cannot be reasonably identified or because the amount of injury such persons sustained cannot reasonably be determined or is so small that distribution is not reasonably feasible. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1989 for: (1) the weatherization assistance program for low-income persons under the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976; (2) the energy conservation program for schools and hospitals under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act; and (3) the low-income home energy assistance program under the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981."
