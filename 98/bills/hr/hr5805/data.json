    "text": "Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees to entitle to an annuity any individual who was a former spouse of a participant or former participant in the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System on November 15, 1982, and for whom such participant failed to elect to provide an annuity. Disqualifies any such former spouse who remarries before becoming 60 years of age. Terminates such an annuity on the last day of the month before the former spouse's death or remarriage before attaining age 60. Requires the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to notify such former spouses of their rights under this Act. Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to allow an individual who was married to a CIA employee for ten years, at least five years of which were spent outside the United States by the employee and the spouse, and who was covered under a health benefits plan as a member of the employee's family immediately prior to a divorce or annulment of marriage to such employee, to enroll in such health benefits for self alone or for self and family coverage. Requires that such individual arrange to pay the amount payable by an employee plus the employee's agency contributions for the same coverage. Requires the Director of Central Intelligence to take all steps practicable to notify eligible former spouses of their rights under this Act. Disqualifies any former spouse who remarries before attaining age 60."
