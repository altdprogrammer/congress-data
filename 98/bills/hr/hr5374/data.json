    "text": "Corporate Community Investment and Jobs Preservation Act of 1984 - Requires each corporation involved in a proposed merger to file a community impact statement if: (1) a premerger notification is required under the Clayton Act; and (2) the merger will result in a loss of jobs in any jurisdiction for more than 100 employees of an establishment of one of the corporations involved. Requires such statement to include: (1) the number of jobs to be reduced; (2) the reasons for such reduction; (3) any alternative to such reduction; (4) a plan to minimize the effects of such reduction on the remaining employees and on the local government of the affected area; (5) the nature of the business of the corporation establishment at which the reduction will occur; and (6) the economic circumstances of such corporation,including the profitability of the operation of the affected establishment and any plan for future investments, employment, and production at such establishment. Requires the statement to be submitted to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Department of Justice, the employees of each corporation involved and representatives of their labor unions, and the local governments of the areas where establishments of such corporations are located on the same day that the premerger notification is filed under the Clayton Act. Directs the FTC, if it receives a request within a specified period from such a local government or from ten percent of the employees of one of the corporations, to hold public hearings on and investigate the statement to determine: (1) the economic reasons for any proposed reduction in employment; (2) the estimated economic losses to employees of the establishment where the reduction will occur, the local government having jurisdiction over such establishment, and persons in the geographic area of such establishment; and (3) recommendations of any local government, any employee labor union, or any other person respecting the proposed merger. Directs the FTC to publish a report containing the findings of the investigation and recommendations as to whether legal action should be taken to halt the merger. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to disallow a tax deduction for interest on obligations issued to finance a corporate merger that the FTC finds will adversely affect employment in any jurisdiction."
