    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1984-03-06", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Amtrak Improvement Act of 1983 - Title I: Amtrak and Amtrak-Related Provisions - Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1984 and 1985 for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak.) Requires the Corporation to discontinue service which is projected to have: (1) a specified avoidable loss per passenger mile for FY 1984 and subsequent fiscal years; and (2) less than a specified passenger mile per train mile ratio. Requires the Corporation to continue certain service that it planned to discontinue if the States through which such service passes agree to pay: (1) 80 percent of the short-term avoidable loss in the first fiscal year and 100 percent of the short-term avoidable loss in subsequent fiscal years; and (2) 50 percent of associated capital costs. Allows the continuance of such service if the Corporation projects that it can modify the operation of rail service to meet performance criteria. Declares that the discontinuance provisions of this Act shall not apply to service initiated during FY 1984 for the first year of operation. Directs the Corporation to conduct an annual review of its auto-ferry service to determine if revenues equal or exceed short-term avoidable costs. Requires the discontinuance of such service if the revenues will be less than such costs for any fiscal year. Directs the General Accounting Office (GAO) to study the capital requirements for the auto-ferry service and determine whether such requirements can be met through revenues generated by such service. Requires the GAO, if it determines that the capital requirements are not met, to compare the shortfall with subsidies provided other modes of transportation, and report to Congress on the results of such study. Requires any railroad or person intending to operate intercity rail passenger service to which the Corporation has consented before July 1, 1983, to submit a detailed plan for such service to the Corporation. Requires the Corporation to submit such plan to Congress, along with comments on the effect such service would have on its service. Allows such proposed service (or any change in service) to begin operations 120 days after the plan (or a substantial amendment to it) is submitted to Congress, unless Congress enacts a joint resolution of disapproval. Makes the Corporation's amendments to the Route and Service Criteria effective at the end of 120 days (currently 60 days) of continuous session of Congress after submission of such amendment to Congress. Removes congressional veto provisions for such amendments. Requires the Corporation to recover 55 percent of its operating costs from its revenues beginning in FY 1984. Prohibits the Corporation from discontinuing service between Tampa and Saint Petersburg, Florida. Directs the Corporation to reinstitute such service as it was in operation on January 1, 1984. Directs the General Accounting Office to study the safety implications of stationing only one person in each locomotive powering regularly scheduled Amtrak passenger trains in the Northeast Corridor. Requires a report to Congress on such study within nine months of enactment of this Act. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act to extend the payment of benefits under the employee protection agreement until April 1, 1985 (currently April 1, 1984). Amends the Rail Safety and Service Improvement Act of 1981 to authorize appropriations for the office of the Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration for FY 1984 and 1985. Amends the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 to eliminate provisions which prohibit the Chairman of the Board of the United States Railway Association from having direct financial relationships with any railroad. Extends the term of office of the Chairman from December 31, 1983, until December 31, 1985. Authorizes appropriations for the Association for FY 1984 and 1985. Allows the Consolidated Rail Corporation, prior to November 1, 1985 (currently November 1, 1983), to file with the Interstate Commerce Commission a notice of insufficient revenues for any line which is part of its system. Changes the congressional approval provisions for any plan for the sale of United States' interests in the Corporation and for freight transfer agreements, to require that such plans be enacted into law before implementation. Amends the Interstate Commerce Act to limit the salaries of members of the Railroad Accounting Principles Board to level V of the Executive Schedule. Terminates the Board three years after its members are appointed. Requires the Board to establish cost accounting principles and make a specified report to Congress within two years of such appointments. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1986. Directs the Interstate Commerce Commission to postpone the adoption of the Uniform Rail Costing System until the Board has developed its cost accounting principles. Declares as nonnavigable water two parcels of land in Jersey City, New Jersey. Amends the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 to eliminate the Secretary's authority to reserve the expenditure of certain FY 1983 through 1985 funds for the Northeast Corridor. Reduces the appropriated amount to the United States Railway Association for purchasing securities and accounts receivable of the Consolidated Rail Corporation. Makes authorized appropriations available to: (1) the Delaware River Port Authority to improve rail service; (2) New Mexico for a feasibility study on establishing a high-speed rail corridor between Santa Fe and Albuquerque; and (3) New Mexico for a feasibility study on constructing a rail line for the carriage of coal and other commodities from the northwestern part of the State. Amends the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 to direct the Railroad Retirement Board to issue a warning to any railroad found guilty of a first violation of the job vacancy reporting requirements. Makes any railroad found guilty of a subsequent violation liable for a civil penalty. Ensures that railroad employees are not subject to tax liabilities from more than one State at a time."
