Directs the President, within 60 days after such termination date, to submit a plan to the Congress which transfers the functions of the Department to other agencies, unless such transfer has occurred by law prior to such termination date. Prohibits the submission of any such plan which provides for or effectively creates a new executive department. Provides that such plan shall take effect at the end of the first period of 60 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after the plan is submitted, unless before the end of such period either House passes a resolution of disapproval. Directs the President to submit another plan within 30 days after such disapproval and to continue to submit plans until a plan takes effect."
