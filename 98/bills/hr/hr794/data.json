    "text": "Service Industries Commerce Development Act of 1983 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish within the Commerce Department a service industries development program. Sets forth the purposes of the program, including development of a data base on issues related to service industries and development of policies to strengthen the export competitiveness of U.S. service industries. Authorizes the Secretary to request persons to submit to the Secretary information which the Secretary deems necessary. Authorizes the Secretary to subpoena such information. Sets forth the procedure for issuing a subpoena and the penalties for failing to comply. Directs the Secretary to provide State and local governments, upon request, aid and information concerning U.S. policies on foreign commerce in services. Requires the Secretary to prepare a biennial report for Congress containing: (1) an analysis of the activities of foreign suppliers within the various service industries in the U.S. market; (2) an analysis of Federal, State, and local regulation of such foreign supplies and the potential effect of such regulation on trade relationships and negotiations; (3) an analysis of the activities of U.S. suppliers of services in foreign countries; and (4) a study and analysis of the impact during such year of any act, policy, or practice of each designated major trading country that limits the access of U.S. suppliers of services to markets in that country in a manner that is unjustifiable, unreasonable, or discriminatory and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce. Authorizes the President to impose any limitations that the President deems appropriate upon the eligibility of foreign suppliers to engage in U.S. interstate commerce. Directs the President, within 120 days of the Secretary's report on service industries, to review the report and publish the President's determinations on whether to impose limitations on foreign suppliers. Prohibits the President from imposing any limitation on foreign suppliers until after the timely comments of interested persons have been considered."
