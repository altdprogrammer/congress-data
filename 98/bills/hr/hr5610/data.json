Provides a procedure for a grand jury subpoena. Establishes rights for a grand jury witness. Allows a witness before a grand jury to be accompanied by counsel. Permits a witness to be found in contempt for refusing to comply with an order of the court to testify or to produce a book, paper, or document in a proceeding before or ancillary to a grand jury. Prohibits a grand jury from naming a person in an indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator. Declares that grand jury reports should not single out a person to impugn his or her motives or hold such person up to scorn or criticism.
