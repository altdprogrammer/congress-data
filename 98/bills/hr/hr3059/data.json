Allows a pharmacist to fill or refill a prescription for a drug identified by its proprietary name with a substitute drug of the same established name or the same qualitative composition, unless the prescription requires the proprietary name drug exclusively. Requires that such substitute drugs, whether identified in the prescription by proprietary or by established name, be sold to the patient at a cost which is less than the cost of the drug so identified."
