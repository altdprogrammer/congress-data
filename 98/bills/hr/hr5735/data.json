    "text": "Public Buildings Act Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Public Buildings Act of 1959 (the Act) to authorize the Administrator of General Services (the Administrator) to acquire options to purchase any building which is determined to be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Raises the single-building purchase-price limit from $500,000 to $1,000,000. Adds further information to be included in the Administrator's report to appropriate congressional committees for the purpose of securing approval for purchases of public buildings in excess of $1,000,000. Allows the Administrator to alter, by up to ten percent: (1) the amount expended for a construction or alteration project; or (2) the amount of space to be provided for the project. Requires a report to Congress by the Administrator, together with recommendations, when such changes are in excess of ten percent of the original project prospectus. Authorizes the Administrator to issue obligations, to be purchased by the Secretary of the Treasury (the Secretary), in amounts necessary to finance the acquisition or construction of any public buildings. Allows the Secretary to determine the terms and conditions for such obligations. Allows the Administrator to enter into emergency leases, for up to 180 days, during any period declared by the President to require emergency leasing authority. Authorizes the Administrator to carry out advanced engineering and design for a project, whether or not such project has been authorized under this Act. Directs the Administrator in such instances to consult the Office of the Federal Protective Service for purposes of determining security requirements for such buildings. Directs the Administrator to submit to Congress each January a report showing: (1) the location, space, cost, and status of each uncompleted, authorized public building project; (2) the status of any advanced engineering and design; and (3) a list of delegations of authority made by the Administrator under this Act. Amends the Act to require the Administrator to submit to Congress annually a program of projects and actions deemed necessary by the Administrator to carry out his duties under the Act. Outlines information to be included in such program. Requires the Administrator to provide a comparison of the long-term costs and benefits of construction, acquisition, and leasing of public buildings, together with appropriate explanations. Requires the Administrator, within nine months of the date of enactment of this Act, to submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report detailing methods to be used in formulating the long-term comparisons of costs and benefits as required under this Act. Directs the Administrator to keep Congress fully informed of activities of the GSA under this Act and to supply Congress with any pertinent information requested. Requires the Administrator, within one year of the enactment of this Act, to ensure the availability of the following information for each public or leased building: (1) its location; (2) the Federal agencies occupying such building; (3) space information; (4) building operating costs; (5) income derived; (6) needed repairs and renovations; (7) energy consumed; (8) compliance with Federal law; (9) the percent of the building leased by the Government; (10) total expenditures for improvements and alterations; (11) terms of leases and their expiration dates; and (12) information on each contract in effect. Requires the Administrator, within 60 days from entering into a lease, to report to the appropriate congressional committees the essential elements of such lease. Prohibits the Administrator from making any agreement or undertaking any commitment for construction of any building until the Administrator has established detailed specification requirements for any building leased to or predominately used by the United States. Requires periodic inspection of construction by the Administrator to ensure that such specifications are being met. Requires the Administrator to prescribe one or more standard designs for office buildings, courthouses, warehouses, or other public buildings in compliance with Federal law. Requires higher standards of quality than standard-design in certain circumstances. Prohibits the Administrator from leasing any space to accommodate: (1) major computer operations; (2) secure or sensitive activities related to the national defense or security; (3) offices which would require major structural or mechanical alterations; or (4) a permanent courtroom or administrative office for any U.S. court unless the Administrator determines that such requirements cannot be met in public buildings and submits reasons and explanations for such leasing to the appropriate congressional committees. Requires the Administrator, if possible, to acquire an option to purchase any such leased space. Requires the solicitation of competitive bids to procure space by lease to the Government. Requires the Administrator to provide a copy of any lease agreement entered into to the highest ranking official of each Federal agency occupying space in the building. Prohibits construction or alteration of a public building by the Administrator unless authority to do so has first been made available in appropriation Acts. Requires the same authority for leases whose terms are in excess of three years. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 concerning rates to be charged by the Administrator for space and services in public buildings."
