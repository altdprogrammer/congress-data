    "text": "Leadership in Educational Administration Development Act of 1984 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1990 to carry out this Act. Directs the Secretary of Education, from such appropriations, to make available amounts, up to a specified maximum per State, necessary to establish and operate a technical assistance center in each State. Directs the Secretary to enter into contracts with local educational agencies (LEAs), intermediate school districts, State educational agencies (SEAs), institutions of higher education, private management organizations, or nonprofit organizations (or consortia of such entities) for the establishment and operation of technical assistance training centers in each State. Requires the contractor to: (1) make center services available to school administrators from any of the LEAs in the region; (2) collect information on school leadership skills; (3) assess leadership skills of individual participants; (4) conduct leadership skills training for new and practicing school administrators, especially women and minority administrators; (5) operate consulting programs for school districts; (6) maintain training curricula and materials on leadership skills drawing on expertise in business, academia, civilian and military governmental agencies, and existing effective schools; (7) conduct programs which make available business executives, scholars, and practicing school administrators and which offer internships in business, industry, and in effective school districts to school administrators; (8) disseminate information on leadership skills associated with effective schools; and (9) establish model administrator projects. Directs the Secretary in selecting such contractors to take into account whether their programs would emphasize development of leadership skills identified by graduate schools of management and of education. Requires contracts under this Act to: (1) assure involvement of private sector managers and executives; (2) assure ongoing organizational commitment through obtaining matching funds, making in-kind contributions, demonstrating commitment to continue after expiration of funding under this Act, and organizing a policy advisory committee (which would include representatives from business, private foundations, LEAs, and SEAs); (3) demonstrate the level of development of human relations skills which its programs will instill; and (4) establish a system of program evaluation. Provides that each contract under this Act shall be for a three-year term, subject to availability of funds. Makes such contracts non-renewable, but allows a single three-year extension to be granted if the contractor agrees to maintain the programs with assistance under this Act reduced by one-half. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations to carry out this Act."
