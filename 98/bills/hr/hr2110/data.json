Directs approved State programs to establish a system to cancel a title to any motor vehicle determined nonsalvable and to issue a salvage certificate for such automobile to make it suitable for operation on a highway. Authorizes the issuance of a title certificate based upon the State determination, after inspection, that the salvage vehicle is suitable for operation. Requires State programs to establish a system for the inspection of, and issuance of title for, motor vehicles previously registered in another State. Directs State programs to prohibit the sale of parts of a motor vehicle if a part's identification number has been destroyed, removed, obliterated, or otherwise altered. Requires State programs to include provisions requiring insurers to release pertinent information to law enforcement officers relative to motor vehicle thefts or accidents. Grants immunity from civil liability (in the absence of any fraud or malice) to such insurers. Sets forth provisions for the review of State programs by the Administrator and the direct take-over of any program that fails to meet the Administrator's approval."
