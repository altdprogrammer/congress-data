Permits curriculum development projects to include, but not be limited to, mock elections, model congresses, civics classes, local symposiums on election issues, and programs to assist students, teachers, and other members of the local educational community to register to vote. Requires any public, private, or nonprofit agency, institution, or organization desiring assistance under this Act to submit an application to the Secretary of Education within 60 days after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to ensure that specified criteria are met by programs approved for such assistance. Requires that such programs provide equal access for private, as well as public, schools.
