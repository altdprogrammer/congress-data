    "text": "Small Business Motor Fuel Marketer Preservation Act of 1983 - Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make loans to small businesses acquiring gas stations from a refiner. Makes it unlawful for a refiner, other than an independent or small refiner, to operate a gas station in the United States. Requires a refiner, in disposing of any interest in a station, to offer a right of first refusal to the dealer. Sets forth requirements governing such an offer. Makes it unlawful for any refiner to exceed specified limitations on annual motor fuel sales. Makes it unlawful for any supplier to sell motor fuel on any day at any point of transfer at prices other than the daily wholesale price for that day. Provides that withholding of available fuel from a purchaser for resale at a lower price to a supplier-operated station shall constitute a violation. Permits price differentials which reflect manufacturing, sale, or delivery costs, or which are offered in good faith to meet competitive price reductions. Provides that a refiner may charge purchasers of motor fuel a uniform surcharge for use of a trademark or other identifying symbol. Makes it unlawful for any person to interfere in any way with the purchasing, selling, or storing of motor fuel by a dealer. Permits contracts requiring a dealer to purchase motor fuel exclusively from a particular dealer or supplier if such contract assures the dealer the right to purchase fuel elsewhere if the refiner does not have such fuel readily available. Makes it unlawful for any dealer at a station displaying a trademark or identifying symbol of a particular refiner to sell motor fuel not refined by such refiner without providing notice to purchasers. Requires each refiner within 90 days of enactment and annually thereafter to provide to the Federal Trade Commission information regarding the number of: (1) gallons of motor fuel sold at its U.S. stations during the preceding year; (2) gallons of motor fuel manufactured in the United States during the preceding year; and (3) barrels of crude oil produced and refined during the preceding year. Sets forth fines for violations of this Act. Permits civil actions to be brought by the FTC or private parties against violators. Directs the FTC and the SBA to prescribe regulations required by this Act."
