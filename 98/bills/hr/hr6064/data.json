Exempts vessels designed and used primarily for transporting passengers or property from the duty on equipment and repairs made in a foreign country on a U.S. flag vessel unless the vessel left the United States for the sole purpose of obtaining such equipment or repairs. Provides that customs duties due on the date of liquidation or reliquidation shall be due 15 days after the date of such liquidation or reliquidation. Provides that if payment of the duties is not made within 30 days of such date, then such payment will be considered delinquent and bear interest from the 15th day after the date of liquidation or reliquidation. Provides a refund on any overpayment of duty and interest thereon if an entry is reliquidated as a result of: (1) a protest being filed; (2) a clerical error; or (3) a court order. Increases from $250 to $1,250 the value of imported goods eligible for informal entry. Provides that such an increase does not apply to specified articles of the Schedules or other articles for which formal entry is required without regard to value. Provides that if a State or local authority (incident to its jurisdiction over an airport, or other exit point facility) requires its approval with respect to the operation of a duty-free sales enterprise under which merchandise is delivered to such facility for exportation, then merchandise incident to such operation may not be withdrawn from a bonded warehouse and transferred to such facility unless the operator of such duty-free sales enterprise demonstrates to the Secretary of the Treasury that the required approval has been obtained. Prohibits an individual (other than solely for that person) or corporation from conducting customs business (activities involving transactions with the Customs Service concerning the entry and payment of duties on imported merchandise) unless a valid customs brokers license and permit has been issued by the Secretary of the Treasury to such individual or corporation. Permits the granting of such license to a corporation provided at least one officer of such corporation holds a customs brokers license. (Currently, at least two officers of a corporation must hold a license in order for the corporation to conduct customs business.) Provides for the revocation or suspension of such license and permit or the imposition of a monetary penalty, for a customs broker who: (1) fails to have such a license and permit while transacting customs business; (2) makes false statements on an application for such license or permit, or on a report filed with the Customs Service; (3) has been convicted of certain felonies or misdemeanors after the filing of an application for such license; (4) is licensed as a corporation and fails to have at least one officer validly licensed for a continuous period of 120 days (currently, it is for a continuous 60 day period); or (5) fails to employ for the same period at least one licensed individual within the district in which a permit was issued. Permits a broker to appeal any decision by the Secretary to deny, revoke, or suspend such broker's license or permit, or to impose a monetary penalty upon him or her, by filing a petition in the Court of International Trade. Permits the Secretary to prescribe regulations relating to the issuance of licenses or permits to customs brokers. Permits the suspension or revocation of a brokers license if a customs broker triennial report is not filed with the Secretary.

Grants exclusive jurisdiction to the Court of International Trade on civil action cases which arise out of an import transaction and which are commenced by the United States to recover a monetary penalty due to a violation under the Act. Permits an individual whose license or permit has been denied or revoked due to operation of law to commence an action for review in the Court of International Trade. Provides for the commencement of such actions in cases where a monetary penalty has been imposed. Prohibits the commencement of an action unless it is commenced within 60 days after the entry of a decision relating to: (1) the denial or revocation of a license or permit; or (2) the imposition of a monetary penalty. Provides that the scope of review for decisions by the Secretary to suspend or revoke a broker's license and permit shall be made on the basis of the record before the court in accordance with the provisions of this Act, except for the administrative hearing procedure on the revocation or suspension of a license or permit which shall be made in accordance with 5 USC 706. Provides that with respect to the collection or assessment of a monetary penalty imposed under the Act, the Court of International Trade may not render a judgment in a greater amount than that sought in the initial pleading of the United States. Prohibits a customs officer from permitting the delivery of imported merchandise from a public store or bonded warehouse until proof is produced showing that any customs broker's lien has been satisfied or discharged. Authorizes the Secretary to provide a refund in cases where excess duties have been paid prior to the liquidation of an entry because of clerical error. Subtitle B: Miscellaneous Provisions - Authorizes the President to provide both duty-free treatment under column 1 and modifications in the descriptions of specified articles of the Schedules that are certified for use in civil aircraft. Authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Treasury to grant duty-free entry to articles required for the installation and operation of a joint U.S.-West German telescope project in Arizona. Authorizes the Secretary of the Tresury to provide a refund of any duty paid on organs imported for the use by Trinity Cathedral of Cleveland, Ohio during 1973 through 1978. Requires the Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service to establish the Columbia-Snake Customs District which includes Oregon, and specified counties of the States of Idaho and Washington. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should continue to oppose: (1) the imposition of restrictions on European Community (EC) imports of nongrain feed ingredients and corn gluten and should support the current duty-free binding on such products; and (2) EC proposals which violate the duty-free binding on soybeans and soybean products under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and reaffirm the United States position that the imposition of a consumption tax by EC on vegetable fats and oils would represent a restraint of trade. States that if EC action is taken to inhibit the importation of such products, then the United States should restrict EC imports by the same proportion of reduced U.S. export products."
