Sets forth the circumstances under which a rebuttable presumption arises that a contract materially prevents a pipeline from responding to changes in customer demand or other market forces. Authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to prescribe the maximum duration of a contract for the purchase of natural gas."
