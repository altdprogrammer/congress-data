Directs the Secretary of State to establish an Advisory Council in Northern Ireland to advise the Secretary with respect to the implementation of such employment principles and to review the annual reports which each U.S. person covered by this Act must submit to the Secretary on the progress made in implementing such principles. Directs the Secretary to establish in the United States an American Advisory Council to make policy recommendations regarding labor practices of U.S. persons in Northern Ireland and to review such persons' progress in implementing such employment practices. Directs the Secretary: (1) to take specified actions to insure compliance with the implementation of such employment principles; and (2) to review the compliance of such persons at least biennially. Sets forth penalties for noncompliance. Authorizes the President to waive compliance with the implementation of such principles if such compliance would harm U.S. national security, unless Congress adopts a concurrent resolution disapproving the waiver. Provides for expedited consideration of such resolution. Requires that other Federal agencies cooperate in carrying out this Act."
