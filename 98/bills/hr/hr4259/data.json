    "text": "Computer Fraud Prevention and Home Computer Promotion Act of 1983 - Title I: Computer Security Research Program - Establishes the Computer Security Research Program for the purpose of stimulating research and developing new methods for protecting computer systems from unauthorized access and use. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to administer such program and to grant funds for research and development. Establishes criteria for the Secretary to consider in distributing such grants to individuals. Title II: Interagency Committee on Computer Crime and Abuse - Establishes within the executive branch of the Federal Government an Interagency Committee on Computer Fraud and Abuse. States that the committee shall be composed of the following members or their designees: (1) the Attorney General; (2) the Secretary of Commerce; (3) the Secretary of Defense; (4) the Chairman of the Federal Communications Committee; (5) the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; (6) the Secretary of the Treasury; and (7) other United States officers and employees appointed by the President. Requires the committee to: (1) act as a clearinghouse for Federal agencies in compiling and disseminating information and statistics relating to computer fraud and techniques for preventing such fraud and abuse; (2) coordinate research relating to the development of more secure computer systems among the Federal agencies; (3) make recommendations for improving security of computer systems operated by the Federal Government; and (4) make recommendations to Congress on desirable legislative changes to protect computer systems from fraud and abuse. Title III: Criminal Penalties for Computer Fraud and Abuse - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criminal penalties for any person who uses, attempts to use, or accesses without authorization, a computer with the intent to: (1) defraud; (2) embezzle or steal property; or (3) use the property of another. Makes it an offense to intentionally and without authorization damage a computer or deny use of such computer or access to a computer program or information. Title IV: Tax Credit for the Purchase of Home Computers - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a taxpayer a $200 nonrefundable income tax credit for the purchase of a home computer for educational, professional, or other essentially nonrecreational use in the home."
