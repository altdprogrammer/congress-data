Provides that, in general, the amount of payment shall be: (1) during January 1985 in the case of a current physician, the monthly average payment made under part B for services furnished by that physician during 1984; and (2) during any subsequent month, the amount payable for the previous month increased (or decreased) by the amount by which the amount of payment for that previous month was less (or greater) than the amount that would otherwise have been payable (without regard to this Act) under part B with respect to physicians' services furnished by that physician during the previous month. Defines a: (1) \"participating physician\" as one who has entered into an agreement with the Secretary under which the physician will be paid under part B only in accordance with this Act and will not charge any amount not permitted to be charged under an assignment; (2) \"current physician\" as one who receives payments under part B before January 1, 1985; and (3) \"new physician\" as one who is not a current physician."
