Requires the Secretary to confer with the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency when determining which property is usable for civil defense or educational purposes. Requires the Director to review the available property continuously and to notify the Secretary upon identifying property appropriate for civil defense. Directs the Director to notify Congress whenever the Secretary has refused to accept the Director's recommendation concerning the allocation of such property. Amends the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950 to require the Administrator to: (1) notify the Director whenever an agency other than the Department of Defense informs the Administrator that it has excess property; (2) consult with the Director concerning the suitability of such property for civil defense purposes; and (3) transfer suitable property to the appropriate State agency for distribution to the civil defense organizations identified by the Director. Requires the Director to notify Congress whenever the Administrator has refused to accept the Director's recommendations to transfer any such property."
