    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1984-07-26", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #326 (307-85)) Education Amendments of 1984 - Title I: Adult Education Act Amendments - Amends the Adult Education Act to extend through FY 1986 the authorization of appropriations for: (1) the program of basic education for adults; (2) grants for special projects for the elderly; and (3) grants and contracts for the adult education program for adult immigrants. Extends through FY 1986 the existence of the National Advisory Council on Adult Education. Title II: Revision of the Bilingual Education Act - Amends the Bilingual Education Act (\"the Act,\" which is also title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965) to revise and reauthorize programs under the Act. Expands the list of factors to be recognized in declaring policy under the Act; and revises the declaration of policy under the Act to include: (1) encouraging the establishment of special alternative instructional programs for students of limited English proficiency in school districts where the establishment of bilingual education programs is not practicable or for other appropriate reasons; and (2) providing financial assistance to local educational agencies (LEAs), and, to State educational agencies (SEAs), institutions of higher education, and community organizations. Includes adult programs (in addition to related preschool, elementary, and secondary school programs) among those bilingual education programs to be assisted under the Act. Requires programs under the Act to be designed to enable students to achieve full competence in English. Permits such programs to also provide for the development of student competency in a second language. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Act for FY 1985 through 1989. Authorizes separate appropriations for such period for grants to State programs under the new Part B (Data Collection, Evaluation, and Research). Directs the Secretary to reserve for special alternative instructional programs and related activities: (1) four percent of the sums appropriated to carry out the Act which do not exceed a specified amount; and (2) 50 percent of such appropriations which do exceed such amount, except that the amount reserved for such purpose shall not exceed ten percent of the total appropriations to carry out the Act. Directs the Secretary to reserve, from the appropriations to carry out the Act: (1) at least 60 percent for programs under part A (Financial Assistance for Bilingual Education Programs), and of such reserved amount at least 75 percent shall be reserved for transitional bilingual education programs; (2) at least 25 percent for training activities under a redesignated part C (Training and Technical Assistance); and (3) not more than one percent for the National Advisory and Coordinating Council on Bilingual Education. Revises definitions under the Act to include under the definition of \"limited english proficiency\" difficulties with the English language which deny to specified categories of individuals the opportunity to participate fully in our society. Sets forth a definition of \"program of transitional bilingual education\" which is similar to the current definition of \"program of bilingual education\" under the Act. Deletes a requirement that the principal purpose of any participation of children whose language is English in a bilingual education program must be to contribute to the objective of assisting children of limited English proficiency to improve their English language skills. Deletes certain requirements relating to applications for assistance for bilingual education programs. Sets forth a new definition, defining \"program of developmental bilingual education\" as a full-time program of instruction in elementary and secondary schools which provides, with respect to the applicable years of study, structured English-language instruction and instruction in a second language. Requires that such programs: (1) be designed to help children achieve competence in English and a second language while mastering subject matter skills; and (2) to the extent necessary, be in all courses or subjects of study which will allow a child to meet grade-promotion and graduation standards; and (3) where possible, have classes comprised of approximately equal numbers of students whose native language is English and limited English proficient students whose native language is the second language of instruction and study in the program. Sets forth a new definition, defining \"special alternative instructional programs\" to mean programs of instruction designed for children of limited English proficiency in elementary and secondary schools, which are not transitional or developmental bilingual education programs but have specially designed curricula and are appropriate for the particular linguistic and instructional needs of the children enrolled.
