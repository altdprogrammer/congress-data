Requires a taxpayer, in order to deduct expenses incurred in attending any convention held outside the United States, to establish and substantiate that: (1) the purpose of the convention is directly related to the active conduct of his trade or business; (2) the time spent at the convention is primarily devoted to business-related activities; (3) such expense is not the cost of personal activities incidental to such convention; and (4) such expense is not lavish or extravagant under the circumstances. Defines, \"foreign convention\" as any convention, seminar or similar meeting held outside the United States."
