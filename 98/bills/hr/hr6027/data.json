Provides that such prohibition shall not apply to cases commenced before the effective date of this Act, unless the defendant establishes and the court determines that it would be inequitable not to apply this prohibition to such a pending case. Declares that the existence of a jury verdict or a district court judgment shall be prima facie evidence that such prohibition shall not apply to such a case. Prohibits the recovery of damages, interest on damages, litigation costs, or attorney fees in an antitrust action against a person based on any official action directed by a local government or a local government employee or official acting in an official capacity. Provides that such prohibition shall not apply to cases commenced before the effective date of this Act. Repeals a provision of the Department of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1985 which prohibited the obligation or expenditure of Federal Trade Commission appropriations for any antitrust action against a local government."
