Directs such panel to: (1) designate by random selection one appellate court from among those in which review petitions have been instituted; and (2) consolidate all review petitions in such designated court. Requires the appropriate administrative body to file the record in the designated court. Directs an administrative body to file the record in only one court of appeals if the review petition was received for only one court within ten days after the contested order's issuance. Directs an administrative body to file the record in the court in which review petitions were first instituted if petitions regarding the same order were instituted in multiple appellate courts after the initial ten days of the issuance of an order. Requires the courts to transfer all review proceedings regarding the same order to the court designated by the judicial panel."
