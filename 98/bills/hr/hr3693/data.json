    "text": "Temporary Diversity Jurisdiction Reform Act of 1983 - Amends the judicial code to restrict Federal district court diversity of State citizenship jurisdiction to those cases where none of the plaintiffs is a citizen of the State in which the action is brought. Increases the amount in controversy required as a basis for Federal district court jurisdiction from $10,000 to $50,000. Revises venue requirements to permit the bringing of a civil action in the judicial district in which either: (1) a substantial part of the events occurred which prompted the action; or (2) a substantial part of the property involved is located. Prohibits removal by a defendant of specified civil actions from State court into Federal district court if the plaintiffs could not have brought such action in the district court. Directs the Judicial Conference of the United States to report to the Congress on the effects of this Act."
