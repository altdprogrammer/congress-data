Provides that any previous grants given should be considered in full force unless the holder of such grant elects to be covered under these provisions. Exempts grants made under this subsection from any right-of-way fees or payments to the United States. Provides that such grant shall continue in effect as long as the system is used for agricultural, livestock, or private domestic purposes, and that the holder of such grant complies with the following requirements: (1) timely and proper recording of such grant; (2) free access to the Federal government and the public to such right-of-way for purposes not inconsistent with the exercise of such grant; (3) safe construction of facilities, with due regard to any wildlife involved; (4) providing indemnification to the United States Government against liability arising from use of the granted right-of-way. Authorizes the appropriate Secretary to terminate, suspend, or abate the use of any granted right-of-way only upon abandonment or noncompliance with the use for which the grant was made. Declares that structures or improvements not removed within a reasonable time after termination or abandonment shall become property of the United States. Provides that mineral and vegetation material within such a granted right-of-way remains the property of the United States, but may be used on the right-of-way in case of emergency."
