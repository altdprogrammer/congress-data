    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Surface Transportation Amendments of 1984 - Approves the interstate highway cost estimate for FY 1985 and 1986 and the interstate substitute cost estimate for FY 1984 and 1985. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to adjust and reallocate the minimum allocation made on March 9, 1984, to reflect the apportionments made under this Act. Revises the procedures for releasing interstate construction funds and interstate substitute funds, including allowing the Secretary to release such funds without congressional approval. Decreases the Federal share payable for emergency relief funds for repair projects on the Federal-aid highway system and the Interstate System, unless such emergency repairs are to minimize damage, protect facilities, or restore essential traffic and are accomplished within 30 days after the occurrence. Provides for the funding of certain highway projects with interstate discretionary funds. Requires that a specified percentage of State withdrawal funds be available to the Secretary for State highway research and planning. Authorizes Federal matching funds for bridge replacement and rehabilitation for specified bridges not on the Federal-aid highway system. Amends the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 to include small business concerns owned and controlled by women among such concerns that are eligible for a specified percentage of expenditures under such Act. Amends the General Bridge Act of 1906, the General Bridge Act of 1946, the International Bridge Act of 1972, the Department of Transportation Act, and various other Acts to repeal provisions which regulate toll facilities. Requires toll increases on such facilities to be just and reasonable. Declares that no report, list, schedule, or survey compiled by a State concerning the evaluation of hazardous roadway conditions or rail-highway crossings in order to plan and prioritize safety projects shall be required to be admitted into evidence or used for any other purpose in a Federal or State court. Requires toll authorities to certify to the State Governor that such facilities are adequately maintained and that funding is available for the replacement or repair of such facilities. Provides that if funds from the Highway Trust Fund are used for such repairs, then such State's apportionment for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by such amount. Exempts international toll facilities and such facilities on the Federal-aid system from such requirement. Provides for: (1) crediting the fair market value of right-of-way donations for highway projects to the State matching share when such donations are made to the State; and (2) revesting such property to the donor if it is not required after environmental assessments. Directs the Secretary to reserve amounts expended for right-of-way for a route withdrawal until the right-of-way disposition decision has been made. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of the Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program. Sets forth the following items for inclusion in such study: (1) an analysis of the progress made toward replacing and rehabilitating inadequate bridges on or off the Federal-aid system; (2) a review of the bridge inspection program; (3) an analysis of the effectiveness of the bridge discretionary program; and (4) a review of the bridge program's effect on the rehabilitation of historic bridges. Requires the Transportation Research Board of the National Research Council to carry out a study of the bridge formula with respect to vehicle weights and the life span of bridges. Makes costs incurred to mitigate harm to historic bridges as a result of Federal-aid projects, eligible for Federal-aid highway funds. Permits States to use demolition funds for preservation of historic bridges. Requires (currently, authorizes) States to inventory bridges on the Federal-aid system for historic significance. Directs the Secretary to approve the planting of native wildflowers for landscaping and scenic enhancement of Federal-aid highways. Makes the repair or reconstruction of a Federal-aid primary route in the vicinity of Horseshoe Bend, Idaho, which has experienced slide damage, eligible for emergency relief funds.

Revises the method of determining the amount of rental housing replacement assistance to be provided to displaced tenants. Eliminates the $4,000 rental assistance limitation and establishes the amount of such assistance for a person whose income exceeds 50 percent of the median area income at the lesser of: (1) $4,500; or (2) 36 times the difference between the monthly cost of a suitable replacement dwelling and the monthly cost of the displacement dwelling.

Authorizes a displacing agency to provide replacement housing for persons eligible for low-income housing assistance through public housing programs. Permits a Federal agency to discharge its responsibilities by accepting the certification by a State agency that it will implement State law to carry out the Federal relocation assistance program, provided that the lead agency determines that such State law will accomplish the purpose and effect of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970. Directs the head of the lead agency to monitor and report biennially to Congress on State agency implementation of such certification. Permits an agency to withdraw acceptance of a certification after providing the State government with notice and an opportunity to demonstrate why such action is inappropriate. Permits a Federal agency to withhold approval of any grant, contract, or cooperative agreement with any displacing agency found to have intentionally circumvented such State law. Provides that any payment a displaced person receives under State law shall replace a housing replacement or real property acquisition payment for substantially the same purpose under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act.

Permits a Federal agency to discharge its acquisition responsibilities under such Act by accepting a certification by a State agency, which must be verified by the lead agency, that it will implement State law in a manner that will accomplish the acquisition policies and objectives of such Act. Directs the lead agency to monitor State agency implementation of such certification. Authorizes the sale or lease of the Fairley Group Building in King County, Washington, if the transfer provides for the continued use of such building as a public market.
