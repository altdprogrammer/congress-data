Requires the Secretary to: (1) ensure that equal treatment is provided to domestic and foreign purchasers and users where the importation of a manufactured product made from agricultural commodities, made available for export under this Act, would place domestic users of such commodities at a competitive disadvantage; (2) ensure that such agricultural commodities are used to encourage increased use of U.S. commodities and to avoid unnecessary market displacement of domestic agricultural commodities; and (3) take reasonable precautions to prevent the resale, transshipment, or any use of such commodities for other than domestic use in the importing country. Requires the Secretary to carry out this program through the CCC."
