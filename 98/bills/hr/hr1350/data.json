Includes among major public improvements bridges, highways, roads, railroads, airports, mass transit systems, locks and dams, water systems, and sewer systems. Requires the Commission to develop a National Public Improvements Plan, based on such inventory, which ranks all major public improvements on the basis of need for replacement or major repair. Requires the inclusion in such plan of recommendations with respect to: (1) financing such replacement or repair and routine maintenance; and (2) necessary changes in Federal, State, or local laws to sustain national economic development or to achieve equity among regions in the quality of major improvements. Sets forth procedures for the submission of such plan to the President and Congress. Terminates the Commission the day after it submits such plan. Authorizes appropriations."
