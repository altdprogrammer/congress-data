    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Declares that all Federal right, title, and interest in specified lands is held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior for the Pueblo de Cochiti (New Mexico). Directs the Secretary to conduct a cadastral survey of such lands. Declares such lands to be part of the Pueblo Reservation and prohibits their development for uses other than those existing on the date this Act is enacted. States that permittees of such lands who are not members of the Pueblo shall be given the opportunity to renew their permits in the same manner as appropriate before enactment of this Act. Sets the term for permits renewed under this Act at thirty years or the death of the permittee, whichever occurs later. Allows the spouse or children of a deceased permittee to assume the permit for the balance of the thirty-year period upon notice to the Pueblo and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Declares that, if the Pueblo obtains relinquishment of a certain number of grazing permits in the portion of the Caja del Rio allotment in the Santa Fe National Forest that overlaps the Santa Cruz Spring Tract, then the remaining permittees in that overlap area shall lose their interests and all rights to renew their permits. Preserves the grazing rights of remaining permittees within that portion of the Caja del Rio allotment which does not overlap the Santa Cruz Spring Tract. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to deposit all permit fees into the Treasury to the credit of the Pueblo. Authorizes the Pueblo to: (1) obtain relinquishment of permits on specified lands; and (2) grant in consideration of such relinquishments, agricultural or grazing leases or permits to existing permittees on other Pueblo Reservation lands for a maximum 50-year term. Subjects such grants to the Secretary's approval. Requires the Secretary to give full recognition to all land interests acquired by the Department of the Army in the Cochiti Lake project under specified Memoranda of Agreement and through fee acquisition, until such time as the project is deauthorized by Congress."
