    "text": "National Coal Science, Technology, and Engineering Development Act of 1984 - Directs the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) to carry out a national coal science, technology, and engineering program which shall be administered by the Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy (the Assistant Secretary). Provides that the program shall consist of three research and development programs: (1) the coal science research program; (2) the process science and engineering research program; and (3) the engineering development program. States that: (1) the purpose of the coal science research program shall be to conduct research, for all coal ranks, that seeks an in-depth understanding of coal structure and process chemistry; and (2) the program shall be directed toward the understanding of how pollutant species are bound in the coal molecule and how such species can be efficiently and effectively removed. Provides that the coal science research program shall be carried out through the energy-technology centers, the national laboratories, the university community, and the private sector. States that the purpose of the process science and engineering research program shall be to conduct research, applicable to all coal ranks, in the following areas: (1) coal preparation; (2) specification fuels; (3) precombustion cleanup; (4) postcombustion cleanup; (5) utilization processes; (6) instrumentation and control; (7) solids transport; and (8) supporting research and development. Provides that the process science and engineering research program shall be carried out through the energy technology centers, the national laboratories, the university community, and the private sector. States that the purpose of the engineering development program shall be to carry out the projects listed in the following sentence, by making grants to eligible applicants, in order to establish proof of concept and produce developed processes and coal systems. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Assistant Secretary, to make grants for any one or more of the following projects: (1) constructing and operating a fine coal preparation and cleaning process facility of no more than 500 tons per day, capable of testing both physical and chemical coal cleanup devices and processes; (2) retrofitting an oil-fired boiler of at least 100 MWe using deeply, physically, or chemically cleaned coal, or any combination of such types of cleaned coal; (3) demonstrating a regenerable flue gas desulfurization system of at least 50 MWe; (4) demonstrating a combined SOX/NOX removal system of at least 50 MWe; (5) conducting a furnace retrofit of in-boiler sulfur control technology of at least 50 MWe; (6) demonstrating an atmospheric fluidized bed combustion system of at least 100 MWe; (7) demonstrating a repowering application of a pressurized fluidized bed combustor of from 50 to 100 MWe; (8) demonstrating a repowering application of combined cycle coal gasification of from 50 to 100 MWe; (9) developing and testing a coal-fueled gas turbine in a second generation combined-cycle system of at least 50 MWe; (10) developing and testing an industrial-scale coal-fueled gas turbine suitable for industrial cogeneration of at least 5 MWe; (11) testing a utility phosphoric acid fuel cell system using coal-derived gas at a size of 10 to 50 MWe; (12) demonstrating engineering feasibility of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) technology at a size of ten to 50 MWe; and (13) demonstrating an advanced coal liquefication process of at least five to ten tons of coal per day. Provides that the engineering development program shall be administered by the Assistant Secretary. States that a grant may be used only to pay for a portion of an approved project's total cost in an amount determined by the Assistant Secretary. Directs the Secretary, with the cooperation of the Assistant Secretary, to prepare a five-year national coal science, technology, and engineering development research plan. Requires the plan to be submitted by the Secretary to the President and the appropriate committees of Congress within six months of enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to submit reports to the President and the appropriate committees of Congress concerning the program and the five-year plan. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1989 for the coal science research program, the process science and engineering program, and the engineering development program."
