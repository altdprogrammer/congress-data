Title II: General Provisions - Prohibits the use of funds authorized under this Act where the costs of the program exceed 105 percent of the program authorization or the costs exceed by more than $10,000,000 the amount authorized by this Act, whichever is the lesser. Prohibits the use of funds authorized by this Act for programs which have not been presented to or requested of Congress unless the Secretary of the Energy transmits to the appropriate committees a full and complete statement of the action proposed. Authorizes the Secretary to start any general plant project only if the maximum estimated cost of such project does not exceed $1,200,000. Sets forth procedures for approval of projects that exceed the 25 percent estimated cost provision, and exempts from such procedures any project which has an estimated cost of less than $5,000,000.

Authorizes the Secretary to perform construction design services for construction projects in support of national security programs as appropriated under this Act. Directs the Secretary to notify the appropriate committees of Congress within 30 days of planning and design costs in excess of $1,000,000.
