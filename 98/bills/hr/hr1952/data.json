Includes as a U.S. firm any entity controlled by foreign firms or citizens if their nation provides U.S. firms and citizens equivalent access to research and development efforts in that nation. States the requirements for qualified ventures, including: (1) the use of identical terms for the same levels of participation by firms; (2) the identification of each research and development program to be conducted and the contributions required for a firm's participation in each program; (3) a finding by the Attorney General that the participation of any firm that accounts for a large specified percentage of worldwide industry sales of a product is critical to the program's success, is in the national interest, and will not directly affect future production of such product; and (4) the notification of the Attorney General of the formation of a venture, the parties to the venture, the programs to be conducted, the participants in the programs, and agreements under the venture. Limits a venture's activities to conducting one or more research and development programs (including programs in which universities participate) which are projected to be completed within ten years after their inception.
