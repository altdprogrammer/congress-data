Prohibits sole source procurements of spare parts unless competitive bidding would not result in fair and reasonable prices. Prohibits consideration of procurement bidding where: (1) the low competitor has a definite advantage over the other competitors; (2) only two bids are received and one bidder is not a manufacturer; or (3) the lowest final price is not reasonable, in that it results in substantial price increases over the previously paid unit price."
