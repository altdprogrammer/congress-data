    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Soil Conservation Act of 1984 - Title I - Defines specified terms for purposes of this Act. Title II - Declares that any person who produces an agricultural commodity on highly erodible land (on a field on which such highly erodible land is the predominant class) shall be ineligible with respect to such commodity for: (1) price or income support assistance; (2) a loan for the construction or purchase of a storage facility; (3) crop insurance; (4) a disaster payment; or (5) any new loan if used for a purpose which will contribute to excessive erosion of highly erodible land. Exempts from such restrictions lands and crops cultivated before enactment of this Act or between 1973 and 1984, and any crop produced under an approved conservation system. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to complete as soon as possible specified land capability soil surveys. Title III - Requires the Secretary to submit to the appropriate congressional committees by February 15, 1985, a study of various voluntary set-aside programs. Requires such study to include: (1) an analysis of the impact of such programs on water quality; and (2) an analysis of a program under which cropland set aside for approved grasses and legumes may qualify for future stabilization program acreage base inclusion or for conserving use acreage. Requires the Secretary to conduct an economic study of the costs and benefits of all current soil conservation programs, including research and extension efforts. Directs the Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service to lead such study. Requires a report within nine months to the appropriate congressional committees. Title IV - Requires the Secretary to provide for a land and water conservation reserve program for erosion-prone land through long-term (seven to 15 years) contracts to replace crops with grasses, hay, or trees.
