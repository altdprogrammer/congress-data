Directs the President to use barter in the acquisition and disposal of materials from the stockpile when in the national interest. (Under current law, the President is encouraged to use barter.) Authorizes the President to require agency heads to barter or transfer excess material or defense industrial property under such agency's control. Sets forth bartering procedures. Makes stockpile material and property available for transfer at fair market value as payment of incidental expenses incurred in an acquisition or transfer. Establishes in the Executive Office of the President the Barter Coordination Council, an interagency council headed by a chairman who shall be designated by and report to the President. Requires the Council to establish a procedure to identify opportunities for barter. Makes technical and conforming amendments."
