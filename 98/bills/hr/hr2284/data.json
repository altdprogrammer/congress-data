    "text": "Defense Department Overseas Teachers Act of 1983 - Amends the Defense Department Overseas Teachers Pay and Personnel Practices Act regarding Department of Defense overseas dependents schools to limit the term of teaching positions and the travel and quarters allowance benefits for teachers who are recruited outside the United States. Provides exemptions from such limitations in specified teaching situations. Eliminates the limitation on the amount of leave an overseas teacher may accumulate. Permits the use of leave for paternity purposes. Entitles a Federal or District of Columbia government employee who becomes an overseas teacher to a lump-sum payment for annual leave accumulated as such an employee. Transfers leave accumulated by such a teacher as sick leave if the teacher becomes a Federal or District of Columbia government employee. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to grant a sabbatical to any teacher on the condition that the teacher agrees to serve in the civil service for three years after completing the sabbatical."
