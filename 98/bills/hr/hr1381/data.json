    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries with amendment, H. Rept. 98-79) Amends the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Act of 1980 to authorize appropriations to the Secretary of Commerce for FY 1984 and 1985 for the use of the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in carrying out such Act. Provides that the ocean thermal energy conversion facilities to be authorized and regulated under such Act shall be facilities located in whole or in part between the highwater mark and the seaward boundary of the territorial sea. Prohibits the issuance of a license for the ownership, construction, or operation of an ocean thermal energy conversion facility if the proposed facility will be documented under the laws of a foreign nation. Provides that marine environmental protection and safety regulations shall apply only to ocean thermal energy conversion facilities which have major components other than water intake or discharge pipes located seaward of the highwater mark. Makes technical and conforming amendments. Requires the Administrator to report to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives on the administration of the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Act of 1980 during each of FY 1984 and 1985. (Under current law, the Administrator must report on the administration of such Act through FY 1983.) Requires the Administrator to report to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives on the steps the Government is taking and plans to take to promote the export potential of ocean thermal energy conversion components, facilities, and plantships manufactured by U.S. industry. Prohibits the Administrator from taking final action on an application for a license for the ownership, construction, or operation of an ocean thermal energy conversion plantship or facility unless the applicant has paid to the Administrator a reasonable administrative fee which shall be deposited in the miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury."
