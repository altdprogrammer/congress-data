    "text": "Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the Secretary of Labor to certify certain groups of workers as eligible for trade adjustment assistance upon a determination that: (1) increased imports \"contributed importantly to\" (currently, substantially caused) worker separations and sales or production reductions; or (2) a significant number of workers of a firm have been or are in danger of total or partial separation due to the relocation of such firm to a foreign country or instrumentality. Makes changes in the qualifying requirement for adjustment assistance for workers. Directs the Secretary of Labor to approve job training assistance for workers adversely affected by imports. (Currently the Secretary is authorized to approve such training.) Directs the Secretary to pay a daily supplemental assistance benefit to any worker who begins approved job training after enactment of this Act and who is not eligible for trade adjustment allowances. Increases the maximum job search and relocation allowances to $800. Establishes an Adjustment Assistance Trust Fund in the Treasury. Authorizes appropriations to the Trust Fund, payable out of the general fund of the Treasury attributable to the collection of customs duties, to carry out provisions for adjustment assistance for workers. Extends adjustment assistance for workers and firms until September 30, 1985. Amends the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 to amend the definition of \"suitable work\" for a worker who would be eligible for a trade readjustment allowance if the worker were not eligible for extended compensation."
