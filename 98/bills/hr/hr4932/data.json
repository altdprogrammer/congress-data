Reserves such lands for defense-related uses by the Department of the Air Force. Terminates such withdrawal and the Department of the Air Force's use of such land on December 31, 1987. Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Air Force to issue an environmental impact statement regarding the continued withdrawal of such lands after the termination date. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to manage such lands during the withdrawal period. States that all uses of such land are secondary to its military uses. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to gain the concurrence of the Secretary of the Air Force before authorizing any non-military use of the land. Authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to require closure of such lands to public use upon the happening of certain conditions. Requires the Secretary of the Air Force to reimburse the Secretary of the Interior for the costs of preparing and publishing a legal description of the lands in the Federal Register. States that this Act does not intend to affect existing water rights or water uses. Requires an Act of Congress to extend or renew the withdrawal of lands under this Act."
