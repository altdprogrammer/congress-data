    "text": "Domestic Automobile Industry Revitalization Act - Title I: United States Automobile Industry Advisory Council and Formulation of a Comprehensive Domestic Automobile Industry Strategy - Establishes in the Department of Commerce the United States Automobile Industry Advisory Council to assist the Secretary of Commerce in formulating and implementing a comprehensive domestic automobile industry strategy. Directs the Secretary to formulate such strategy, including measures to: (1) reduce or offset tax and production cost advantages accruing to foreign motor vehicle manufacturers on domestic and foreign sales; (2) extend assistance to workers unemployed in the domestic automobile industry; (3) improve the availability of capital to the industry and credit to motor vehicle purchasers; (4) provide research and development assistance to the industry; (5) enhance the sales of the industry in interstate and foreign commerce; and (6) eliminate or reduce the cost disadvantages and market uncertainties resulting from misalinements and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Sets forth analyses for the Secretary to carry out on a continuing basis to form data on which to base the strategy. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the President, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation (the Committees) on the implementation and results of the strategy, including legislative recommendations. Title II: Import Relief for the Domestic Automobile Industry - Requires the United States International Trade Commission, within 30 days of enactment of this Act, to begin investigating whether automobile products are being imported in such quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or a threat of serious injury to the domestic automobile industry. Directs the Commission to report its findings to the President and the Committees. Provides, in the event that a serious injury, or threat of serious injury exists, for the implementation of one or of the following remedial actions: (1) the imposition of domestic content ratios on vehicle manufacturers; (2) an increase in tariffs on imported automotive products; (3) the imposition of quotas or tariff-rate-quotas, on such products. Prescribes procedures by which the President may implement the recommended remedial actions or, if he notifies Congress that he will not take such action, that Congress may disapprove his decision and require him to take it. Prescribes procedures for imposing domestic content ratios. Sets forth procedures for the Commission to follow to modify such remedial actions after an annual review of their effectiveness. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Establishes the Task Force on Currency Exchange Stabilization to undertake, within 60 days of enactment, an investigation of the impact of fluctuating and inequitable rates of exchange between the dollar and foreign currencies used in international trade. Directs the Secretary to report findings and recommendations to the Committees. Establishes the Study Group on Antitrust Law, Policies, and Unfair Practices Affecting the Domestic Automobile Industry to investigate impediments in such law, policies, and practices and report to the President and the Committees on legislative recommendations deemed appropriate. Directs the Secretary to develop recommended legislation to eliminate or reduce the tax advantages accruing to foreign manufacturers of automotive products and to encourage the production of domestic automotive products for export. Requires a report to the Committees and the President, within one year of enactment, on such recommendations. Authorizes appropriations."
