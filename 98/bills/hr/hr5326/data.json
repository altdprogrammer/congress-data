Sets the rate of such withholding at the lesser of: (1) ten percent of the amount realized on the disposition; or (2) the transferor's maximum tax liability. Allows specified exemptions from such withholding requirement. Revises requirements relating to returns and reporting with respect to U.S. real property interests."
