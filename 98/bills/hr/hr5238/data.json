    "text": "Mining Extension Service Act of 1984 - Directs the Secretary of Labor to: (1) establish and carry out a national mining extension service pilot program to be administered by the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health; and (2) issue grants for the establishment and operation for a period of at least two and not more than four years of two national mining extension service pilot projects, one to be located in a coal mining region and one to be located in a region where other minerals are mined. Requires each project to be established at or in connection with a State or a university with experience in operating an extension service (which need not be a mining extension service). States that the purposes of the national mining extension service pilot program shall be to: (1) prepare and distribute mining information reports and bulletins; (2) cooperate with and assist associations, agencies, and special committees having an interest in mining and miner training; (3) promote, organize, and conduct seminars and workshops with respect to mining health, safety, and productivity; (4) work with Federal agencies, State agencies, and academia in identifying new technology which could solve current health and safety problems or increase productivity; (5) determine how the needs of small mine operators can be met and whether cooperative efforts between small mines could help meet such needs; (6) determine how a national mining extension service could be integrated with the national Agricultural Extension Service; and (7) determine if a national mining extension service can be cost effective and if not, what other method would be cost effective in accomplishing the purposes of the extension service. Requires each pilot project to have two full-time field agents and no more than five full-time administrative and support staff. Sets forth the functions of the field agents. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes Congress, by concurrent resolution, to terminate the project at any time after the second year of operation of any pilot project under this Act. Authorizes amounts to be appropriated."
