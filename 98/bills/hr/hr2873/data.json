    "text": "Broadcast Deregulation Act of 1983 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from regulating the programming of radio broadcast station licensees. Directs the FCC to renew a broadcast station's license if the station has not seriously violated the Communications Act and, with respect to television stations, the licensee has substantially met the needs of residents of its service area. Prohibits the FCC, when acting on a license renewal application, from considering the license application of another person for the same facilities. Directs the FCC, consistent with sound spectrum management, to encourage the introduction of new and additional services. Allows any person to file with the FCC a petition to establish, or an application to offer, such a service. Directs the FCC: (1) within one year, to determine whether such proposed service is in the public interest; and (2) to presume that such proposed service is in the public interest if it is technically feasible without causing significant technical degradation to, or interference with, radio transmissions by other licensees."
