Provides for lesser penalties for offenses involving $100 or less. Establishes a new offense of bank fraud. Makes it a Federal offense to execute a scheme to defraud a federally chartered or insured financial institution or obtain any money, funds, or securities under the custody or control of such a financial institution by means of false or fraudulent pretences, representations or promises. Establishes a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than five years or both.
