    "text": "(House receded and concurred in certain Senate amendment with an amendment) Military Construction Appropriations Act, 1984 - Appropriates funds for FY 1984 for military construction operations for the: (1) Army; (2) Navy; (3) Air Force; (4) Defense agencies; (5) North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) infrastructure; (6) Army National Guard; (7) Air National Guard; (8) Army Reserve; (9) Naval Reserve; (10) Air Force Reserve; (11) family housing for the Army; (12) family housing for the Navy and Marine Corps; (13) family housing for the Air Force; and (14) family housing for the Defense agencies. Makes these appropriations available through FY 1988. Makes previously appropriated funds available to the respective military departments through the authorizations enacted by the Ninety-eighth Congress. Prohibits the expenditure of funds for: (1) payments under a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract for work except as specified; (2) the construction or replacement of any bakery or laundry facilities unless the Secretary of Defense certifies that such services are not obtainable commercially; (3) the hire of passenger vehicles; (4) the construction of new military bases inside the continental United States for which specific appropriations have not been made; (5) the purchase of land or land easements in excess of 100 percent of their value except as specified; (6) certain family housing costs; (7) procurement of steel for any construction project for which American manufacturers have been denied the opportunity to compete; (8) dredging in the Indian Ocean by foreign contractors except as specified; (9) construction of any site-specific facilities for the MX missile system until the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act are met; and (10) the payment of unlawfully admitted aliens. Permits the use of funds for advances to the Federal Highway Administration for the construction of certain access roads certified as important to the national defense. Limits the expenditure of appropriations for consulting services. Permits the obligation of funds for military construction projects through the fourth fiscal year after the fiscal year in which such funds were appropriated. Prohibits the use of funds for the sale or lease of Fort DeRussy, Honolulu, Hawaii. Prohibits the use of funds to initiate a new installation overseas without prior notification to the Committees on Appropriations. Prohibits the use of funds for the F-16 beddown projects at Misawa, Japan, unless the Appropriations Committees have been notified that the Government of Japan has increased funding in FY 1984 for such projects over the FY 1983 levels. Merges appropriations previously made for military construction with these appropriations, all appropriations to remain available until expended. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Administration should call on members of NATO and Japan to meet or exceed their pledges for at least a three percent real increase in defense spending. Prohibits any appropriations being made available to any country which has not taken adequate measures to control drug cultivation, manufacture or transportation. Requires the President to report to Congress when a country has taken such measures before such prohibition will be removed. Requires that ten percent of the funds available for consultant services in FY 1984 be held in reserve. Directs the Secretary of Defense to annually make geographic comparisons, by State and region, of the economic impact and amount of expenditures made by the Department of Defense. Requires that such information be included in the annual economic report under the Employment Act of 1946."
