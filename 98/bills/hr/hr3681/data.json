Sets forth the membership and powers of the Boards. Directs the President to decide whether to follow the recommendations of the Board. Requires the recommendations of the Board to take effect if Congress passes a joint resolution disapproving a determination by the President not to provide the recommended relief. Provides for expedited consideration of such a resolution. Establishes a Transitional Industry Board with respect to the domestic automobile industry. Requires the Secretary of Commerce, through the International Trade Administration, to receive petitions for future boards from interested parties and to submit petitions to the Congress. Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress on trade barriers. Authorizes appropriations."
