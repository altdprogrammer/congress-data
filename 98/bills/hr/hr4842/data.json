    "text": "Revises general defense procurement contract law to require a contractor who must deliver technical data or computer software in connection with parts or components which are subject to replacement (spare parts) to grant the contracting agency, upon request, rights to the use of such data or software. Requires that such data and software be sufficiently informative as to allow subsequent competitive procurement of parts and components from another manufacturer. Sets forth the parameters and limitations on such requirement, including exemptions for data or software sold or leased generally to the public. Directs the Secretary of each military department to establish a board to review exemption requests."
