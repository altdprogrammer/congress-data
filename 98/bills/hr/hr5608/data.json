    "text": "Electric Utility Transmission Reform Act of 1984 - Amends the Federal Power Act to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to direct by order an electric utility to provide transmission services for an applicant electric utility or to increase the transmission capacity of any bulk power transmission facilisy which it owns or operates whenever the Commission, upon its own motion or upon application by a State commission or any electric utility, determines after public notice, notice to the State commission and electric utilities affected, and a hearing that such action is needed to conserve energy, promote the efficient use of facilities and resources, increase competition in the bulk power supply market, or protect the public interest. Provides that the Commission shall have no authority under this Act to: (1) compel the enlargement of generating facilities; (2) take any action which would unduly burden an electric utility or would impair the reliability of an electric utility's system or the utility's ability to provide adequate service to its customers; or (3) order the transmission of electric energy to an ultimate customer, other than customers of Federal or State agencies."
