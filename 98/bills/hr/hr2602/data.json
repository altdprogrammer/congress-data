Rept. 98-105) Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to authorize appropriations for the International Trade Commission for FY 1984. Amends the Customs Procedural Reform and Simplification Act of 1978 to authorize appropriations for the U.S. Customs Service for FY 1984. Specifies certain amounts to be used for: (1) the implementation of the Operation EXODUS program; (2) a second air module; and (3) a program to provide technical and educational assistance regarding technical customs matters to developing countries. Prohibits using such appropriations to pay U.S. Customs Service employees overtime pay in an amount exceeding a specified sum. Permits the Commissioner of Customs to waive this limitation in individual cases. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require that certain imported packaging material be entitled to a refund of its tariff duty. Requires that certain information when contained on a ship's manifest shall be available for public disclosure. Exempts such information from public disclosure if: (1) the Secretary determines that disclosure is likely to pose a threat to personal injury or property damage; or (2) the information is otherwise exempt under Federal law. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures to provide access to manifests. Prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury from charging interest on the duties assessed on imported merchandise ten days after the entry of such merchandise into the United States. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize appropriations for the Office of the United States Trade Representative for FY 1984. Limits the amount that may be used for entertainment and representation expenses."
