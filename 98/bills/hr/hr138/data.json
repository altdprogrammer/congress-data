Sets forth the weights of such coins. Declares that any gold coin minted under this Act shall not have a designation of its value, but shall have a designation of its weight in troy ounces. Requires such coins to bear designs suitably memorializing Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and Benjamin Franklin. Sets forth the standard for gold coins of the United States. Repeals the provisions of the Gold Reserve Act which discontinued gold coinage."
