    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to enter into cooperative projects with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members for the research, production, or support of defense equipment to further standardization within NATO. Permits the Secretary to make contracts on behalf of a cooperative project if all participants agree to make funds available for contract costs. Permits another participating government to make contracts on behalf of a project if it is done competitively. Exempts contracts awarded outside the United States from buy American restrictions if necessary and if the project in question involves at least two member nations. Authorizes a cooperative agreement to exempt such projects from U.S. law concerning the disposal of U.S. property. Permits the reciprocal waiver of customs and duties. Requires all Department of Defense project costs to be shared equitably by all participants, permitting offsets. Requires the Secretary to gain agreements from each participant not to release project information or property to non- government officials without prior consent of the Secretary and to maintain security measures comparable to the United States. Permits earlier Department agreements which meet the requirements of this Act as having been made under this Act."
