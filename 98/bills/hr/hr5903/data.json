    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1984-06-20", 
    "text": "Water Quality Renewal Act of 1984 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the Act) (also known as the Clean Water Act) to authorize appropriations for FY 1983 through 1988 for: (1) specified research, investigation, and training programs in water pollution control; (2) State and interstate pollution control programs; (3) undergraduate programs in water quality control; (4) grants for developing waste treatment management plans for areas with substantial water quality control problems; (5) water pollution control programs in agricultural areas; (6) agreements among Government agencies providing for maximum use of existing programs for water quality control; (7) grants to States for lake pollution control; and (8) carrying out the Act generally. Increases the authorization for grants for construction of waste treatment works for FY 1984 and 1985. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for FY 1986 through 1988. Revises the timetable for compliance of all pollutants with effluent limitations. Extends the compliance date for all toxic pollutants referred to in a specified table of a congressional committee print (the priority toxic pollutants). Requires such compliance as expeditiously as possible, but in no case later than three years and six months after the date effluent limitations are established. Extends the compliance date for all other toxic pollutants which may be listed under specified provisions of the Act. Requires such compliance as expeditiously as possible, but in no case later than three years and six months after the date effluent limitations are established. Extends the compliance date for application of best conventional technology (for specified conventional pollutants) from July 1, 1984, to July 1, 1987. Extends the compliance date for application of best available technology for all other pollutants. Requires such compliance as expeditiously as possible, but no later than three years and six months after effluent limitations are established. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate final regulations establishing effluent limitations for direct dischargers and limitations requiring pretreatment for all the priority toxic pollutants which are discharged from certain categories of point sources in accordance with a specified schedule. Requires the Administrator to publish in the Federal Register a list of all navigable waters in each State the water quality of which is being impaired by the discharge from specific sources of toxic pollutants. Directs the Administrator to establish an individual control strategy for each listed segment of navigable waters which shall reduce the discharge of toxic pollutants from such sources so as to allow the achievement of water quality which provides for the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and provides for recreation in and on the water. Increases the civil penalties for violations of requirements with respect to water quality standards under the Act, but provides that States are not required by the Act to have civil penalties in the same monetary amount for such violations. Requires the Administrator to monitor, study, and report to Congress on the effects of the impoundment and discharge of waters by dams upon the quality of navigable waters. Sets forth provisions for nonpoint source control implementation programs. Provides for State nonpoint source control reports and plans and grants to States for implementation of such plans. Directs the Governor of each State to prepare and submit for the approval of the Administrator a report on: (1) those portions of the navigable waters within a State that, as a result of pollution from nonpoint sources in whole or in part, are not meeting applicable water quality standards or the goals and requirements of the Act; (2) those categories and subcategories of nonpoint sources which add significant pollutant loadings to each portion of such waters in amounts which contribute to nonattainment of such water quality standards for such goals and requirements; (3) State and local programs for controlling pollutant loadings added from nonpoint sources to such waters, including but not limited to programs receiving Federal assistance under this Act; and (4) the process, including intergovernmental coordination and public participation for identifying best management practices and measures to control such categories and subcategories of nonpoint sources and to reduce, to the maximum extent practicable, the level of pollution resulting from such categories and subcategories. Requires that such reports and updates be based on available information. Permits such reports or updates to include all or part of an approved existing water quality management program. Directs the Governor of each State to prepare and submit for the approval of the Administrator: (1) a plan which the State proposes to implement in the four-fiscal-year period beginning after the date of submission of the report for controlling pollution added from nonpoint sources to navigable waters within the State and for improving the quality of such waters; and (2) a report identifying each Federal department, agency, or instrumentality which is likely to be engaging in, supporting, or providing financial assistance for any activity or program within the State during such four-fiscal-year period and which would be inconsistent with plan implementation, and recommending appropriate administrative modification of such program or activity. Requires that such plans specify the following State practices and measures during the four-fiscal-year period: (1) each portion of navigable waters and land area contributing to nonpoint source pollution which significantly affects portions of such waters; (2) the order of, and schedule for, such implementation; (3) the categories and subcategories of nonpoint sources of pollution; (4) the best management practices and measures; (5) the methods by which the State will encourage, assist, or require such implementation (by category and subcategory of pollution source); and (6) sources of Federal and other assistance other than that provided under this Act which will be available for support of such implementation and the purposes for which such assistance will be used. Requires that such plan be accompanied by a certification by the State attorney general or the head attorney of the State water pollution control agency that State laws provide adequate authority to carry out such programs or a list of any additional authority needed. Requires that such schedule: (1) establish for each category and subcategory of sources an expeditious time period for implementation of best management practices and measures; and (2) indicate estimated dates for such implementation. Requires States to utilize local public and private agencies and organizations with expertise in nonpoint source pollution control, to the maximum extent practicable, in developing and implementing such plan. Requires States, to the maximum extent possible, to develop and implement such plan on a watershed-by-watershed basis. Requires that any State reports or plans required under these nonpoint source control implementation program provisions be submitted to the Administrator within 270 days after enactment of this Act, but provides for a 270-day extension upon request of the Governor. Directs the Administrator to prepare a report which makes specified identifications for a State if the Governor does not submit such report within the required period. Directs the Administrator to consolidate and submit recommendations for modifications of Federal activities and programs submitted by the States to the appropriate Federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities. Directs such entities to carry out their activities and programs in a manner consistent with the approved State plan and helpful to its implementation. Sets forth procedures and deadlines for approval, disapproval, or revision of reports, plans, and updates. Directs the Administrator to provide technical assistance to local agencies or organizations in developing plans, whenever a State fails to submit or the Administrator does not approve a plan. Makes such local agencies or organizations eligible to receive implementation assistance after development of such plan. Authorizes the Administrator, upon State request, to provide technical assistance to a State in developing a plan. Sets forth requirements for State petitions, interstate management conferences and agreements, and State plans for reduction of interstate water pollution from nonpoint sources. Directs the Administrator, upon State application, to make grants to each State for which a report and a plan is approved. Provides that such grants shall be made to assist States in implementing such plans. Limits the Federal share of the cost of each plan implemented with Federal assistance in any fiscal year to 50 percent of the cost to the State in implementing such plan, but requires that the Federal share be at least 50 percent and not more than 60 percent of those costs of a plan which are attributable to a watershed area with respect to which the Administrator determines that a significant number of non-Federal, non-State interests of such area are willing and able to enter into agreements to participate in such year in nonsource pollution control measures under such plan. Limits administrative costs (except costs of implementing enforcement and regulatory activities, education, training, technical assistance, demonstration projects or technology transfer programs) to ten percent of the grant amount. Sets forth maintenance of effort requirements for such grants. Limits to 15 percent of the amount appropriated for such grants the amount which may be used to make grants to any one State, including any grants to any local agency or organization with authority to control pollution from nonpoint sources in any area in such State. Authorizes the Administrator to give priority in making grants for each fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1986, to any State which has included effective regulatory mechanisms in its plan and has implemented such mechanisms in the preceding fiscal year.
