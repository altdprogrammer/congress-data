Authorizes the Attorney General or the Secretary of State to determine whether an individual is entitled to a reward and the amount to be paid. Provides that a reward of $100,000 or more may not be made without the approval of the President. Allows for the protection of the identity of the recipient of a reward if it is determined that such measures are necessary. Authorizes appropriations. Makes Federal, State and local officers and employees ineligible for such payment."
