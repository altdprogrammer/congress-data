Requires the Secretary and the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating to require the use of the best available and safest technologies and operating procedures on all new drilling and production operations and, wherever practicable, on existing operations wherever failure of equipment or procedures would have significant effect on safety, health, or the environment."
