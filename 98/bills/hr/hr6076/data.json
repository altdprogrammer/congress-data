    "text": "Motor Vehicle Safety Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to prohibit the registration or licensing of motor vehicles when the ownership is transferred in interstate commerce unless: (1) the application for a new certificate of title is accompanied by the prior owner's most recent registration card and title; and (2) the new certificate of title is printed in a specified manner indicating the odometer mileage. Increases the criminal penalty for violations of odometer requirements from one to three years maximum imprisonment. Amends the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 to authorize a tire dealer or distributor whose business is not owned or controlled by a tire manufacturer to elect to be subject to tire registration requirements. Revises the restrictions on certain imported vehicles that do not conform to Federal standards. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to exempt certain motor vehicles or equipment from such restrictions for purposes of research, investigation, study, demonstration, training, national security, or completion in the United States of an incomplete foreign-built vehicle or equipment item. Prohibits dealers from selling defective motor vehicles or motor vehicle equipment. Imposes criminal penalties upon manufacturers who knowingly and willfully fail to notify owners or purchasers of motor vehicle safety defects or of failures to comply with motor vehicle safety standards. Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to direct the Secretary to promulgate Federal motor vehicle safety standards: (1) establishing passenger car crashworthiness rating and labeling requirements; and (2) establishing passenger motor vehicle bumper system rating and labeling requirements. Establishes the position of Associate Deputy Administrator for Motor Carrier Safety in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to carry out any delegated duty related to motor carrier safety. Directs the Secretary to arrange with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of the effectiveness of State motor vehicle safety inspection programs in reducing highway accidents and limiting the number of defective or unsafe motor vehicles on the highways. Requires completion of the study and transmittal to Congress by September 1, 1985."
