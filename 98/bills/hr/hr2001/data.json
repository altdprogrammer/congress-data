Provides an exception for small businesses whose depreciation deduction does not exceed $5,000. Specifies that a business which does not meet this requirement shall be limited to the depreciation available under the former asset depreciation range system. Prohibits employers from replacing present employees with new employees for the purpose of complying with the requirements of this Act."
