Includes within the definition of perishable product specified agricultural products. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, within 14 days of the filing of the petition, to: (1) advise the President to take emergency action if the Secretary has reason to believe that the agricultural product is being imported in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury or threat of injury to a competing domestic industry; or (2) publish a notice of the decision not to recommend emergency action and so advise the petitioner. Requires the President, within seven days of receiving the Secretary's recommendation to take emergency action, to increase the duty on the article causing or threatening to cause serious injury to such industry or publish a notice of the determination to take emergency action. Provides for the termination of the emergency action."
