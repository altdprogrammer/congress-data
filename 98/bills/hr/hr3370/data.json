Directs the Attorney General of the United States to reimburse a Federal officer for: (1) any litigation expenses incurred for defending himself or herself in an action brought against such officer for violating a State law while making such an arrest; and (2) any resulting fine or damages imposed, if a State officer would be immune to liability for the same conduct. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude the amount of any such reimbursement from the officer's gross income."
