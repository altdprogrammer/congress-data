    "text": "Adds a new title to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971: \"Title V - Financing of General Election Campaigns for the House of Representatives.\" Establishes eligibility criteria entitling candidates to receive campaign payments on a matching basis. Establishes formulae to determine such sums. Limits expenditure of personal funds to $37,000 per election. Waives spending limits for eligible candidates: (1) whose opponents have spent sums exceeding the limit imposed upon such candidates; or (2) whose opponents have exceeded specified spending and contribution limitations. Requires candidates ineligible for matching funds to notify the Federal Election Commission within a specified time if they exceed specified expenditures. Authorizes the Commission to determine whether candidates have exceeded expenditure limitations. Permits certain additional payments to specified candidates whose opponents use independent funds for communication. Requires the Federal Election Commission to certify the eligibility of candidates to the Secretary of the Treasury, who shall disburse funds to such candidates. Directs the Secretary to establish a separate United States House of Representatives Election Campaign Account in the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and to deposit certain sums in such account in accordance with specified guidelines. Directs the Commission to audit campaign accounts. Requires repayment of excess payments and unexpended payments. Penalizes the use of funds for other than campaign purposes. Authorizes the Commission to institute repayment actions in U.S. district courts. Specifies the administrative authority of the Commission in carrying out this Act. Requires the Commission to make certain reports to the House of Representatives. Authorizes appropriations."
