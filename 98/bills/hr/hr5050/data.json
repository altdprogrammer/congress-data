Amends the American Fisheries Promotion Act to extend the authority and authorize appropriations for FY 1985 and 1986 for loans to avoid default on obligations covering fishing vessels and loans to cover fishing vessel operating losses. Limits loans to avoid default regarding reconstructed or reconditioned fishing vessels to vessels reconstructed or reconditioned in the United States. Repeals the requirement that the vessel be used in the harvesting of fish from an underutilized fishery."
