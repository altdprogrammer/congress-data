    "text": "Social Security Alien and Foreign Resident Limitations Act of 1983 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to prohibit entitlement to title II benefits in the case of an individual who is not a U.S. citizen or national and whose entitlement is based upon the wages and self-employment income of a resident of a foreign country who is entitled to old-age or disability benefits, unless such individual bears a spousal, filial, parental, divorced, or surviving relationship to such resident as of the date such resident reaches age 57. Prohibits entitlement to title II benefits in the case of an individual who is not a U.S. citizen or national on the basis of such individual's own wages and self-employment income. Entitles a non-U.S. citizen or national to a single lump-sum benefit on the basis of such individual's wages and self-employment income if such individual is lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence or employment purposes or if such individual's status is changed to permit such individual to work in the United States. Prohibits entitlement to title II benefits in the case of a non-U.S. citizen or national whose entitlement is based upon the wages and self-employment income of a non-U.S. citizen or national who is not a permanent resident of the United States or who has not been admitted to the United States for employment purposes. Prohibits entitlement to title II benefits in the case of a U.S. citizen or national whose entitlement is based upon the wages and self-employment income of a non-U.S. citizen or national."
