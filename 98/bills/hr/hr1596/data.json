Increases such credit for solar, wind, and geothermal property. Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to require that not less than 12 percent of the loan authority of the Export-Import Bank shall be made available only to businesses with $25,000,000 or less in previous-year sales. Requires that a portion of such loan authority be made available for transactions involving renewable energy. Amends the Public Utlilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to specify rules for the rates for purchase by electric utilities of electric energy from any qualifying cogeneration facility or qualifying small power production facility. Amends a specified reorganization plan to require the Department of Commerce to provide the same treatment and export assistance to businesses involved in renewable energy as it does to other U.S. industries. Amends the Small Business Innovation Act of 1982 to specify that renewable energy and energy conservation businesses shall receive a reasonable portion of the Department of Energy's small business research and development funds."
