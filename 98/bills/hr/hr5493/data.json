    "text": "Amends title X (Population Research and Voluntary Family Planning Programs) of the Public Health Service Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for family planning services. Requires a participating entity to provide each person requesting its services with benefit and risk information (including methods of pregnancy prevention and courses of action available to a person already pregnant) and to provide appropriate referral services. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for personnel training. Specifies that such personnel training shall include clinical training for obstetric-gynecologic nurse practitioners and training for educators and counsellors. Repeals existing formula grant provisions. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct and make grants and contracts for contraceptive development and evaluation. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1989 for such purpose. Specifies that research grants and contracts may be made for improving the clinical management and direct delivery of family planning services. Specifies that informational and educational grants and contracts may be made for projects respecting pregnancy, human sexuality, and parenthood. Authorizes the Secretary to provide related technical assistance and information clearinghouse activities. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for such purpose. Prohibits funds under such title from being used to perform or pay for abortions (presently prohibited from use in programs where abortion is a family planning method). Directs the Secretary to annually collect data on: (1) the numbers and age, sex, and family income of persons who receive family planning services; (2) the types of services chosen; (3) the number of low-income persons and teenagers at risk of unintended pregnancies; and (4) the sources of funding for subsidized family planning services in the United States. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants or contracts for such data collection. Requires such information to be made available to the public."
