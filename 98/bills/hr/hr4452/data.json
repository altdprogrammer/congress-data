Directs that certain expenditures, as determined by the Secretary of the Army, shall be nonreimbursable. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) maintain minimum water flows in the American River (downstream from Nimbus Dam) for fish, recreation, and National Wild and Scenic River System purposes; and (2) release water from the Nimbus Dam necessary for the operation of an expansion of the Nimbus fish hatchery. Requires the cost of water to be nonreimbursable, provided that the costs of construction, operation, and maintenance of such hatchery are borne by the State of California. Requires that the costs for maintaining minimum flows in the American River shall be nonreimbursable, provided that the costs of constructing and operating the Hood-Clay Pump Connection and Clay Station Reservoir shall be reimbursable. Authorizes appropriations for the Auburn-Folsom South unit in terms of July 1982 prices, starting with FY 1985. (Current law authorizes appropriations of a lesser sum in terms of 1965 prices.) Amends the Flood Control Act of 1970 provide for the relocation of the southern terminus of the existing Placer County Road from Auburn to Foresthill, California."
