    "text": "Disability Beneficiaries Protection Act of 1983 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to analyze, evaluate and report to specified congressional committees on the effects of the periodic reviews of disability cases to determine continuing eligibility for those individuals receiving disability benefits under titles II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) and XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act. Requires the Secretary to make revisions, based upon such evaluation, to the criteria embodied in the \"Listing of Impairments\" in effect under part 404 of title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations so that such criteria can be used to realistically evaluate the ability of an impaired individual to engage in substantial gainful activity in a competitive workplace. Prohibits the Social Security Administration from carrying out continuing eligibility reviews until such revisions have been established by regulation. Makes such prohibition inapplicable in any case involving fraud or where an individual is engaged in substantial gainful activity. Sets forth requirements for the redetermination of disability determinations made: (1) after the enactment of this Act and before the date on which the Secretary's revisions are established by regulation; and (2) between March 1, 1981, and the date of the enactment of this Act."
