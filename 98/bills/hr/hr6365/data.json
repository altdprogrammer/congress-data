Provides relief from State or Federal civil liability for any licensed medical personnel or air carrier employee who renders emergency medical aid on an airplane or who continues such aid until arrival at a medical facility. Extends such relief to an airplane's crew and owner or operator for providing on-board emergency medical supplies. Makes such relief from liability inapplicable if the actions were done recklessly or with gross negligence."
