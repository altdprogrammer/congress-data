    "date": "1983-10-06", 
    "text": "Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act) to add provisions relating to Chesapeake and Narragansett Bays. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to continue the Chesapeake Bay program and to establish and maintain in the EPA an Office, Division, or Branch of Chesapeake Bay Programs to: (1) collect and disseminate research and other information on the environmental quality of the Bay; (2) coordinate all Federal research projects pertaining to the Bay; (3) conduct research on sediment deposition in the Bay; and (4) conduct research on natural and man-induced environmental changes' impact on the living resources of the Bay, with particular emphasis on the impact of pollutant loadings of nutrients, chlorine, acid precipitation, dissolved oxygen, and toxic pollutants, including organic chemicals and heavy metals, and with special attention to the impact on the striped bass. Directs the Administrator, at the request of the Governor of a State affected by the interstate management plan developed under the Chesapeake Bay program, to make a grant to implement management mechanisms in the plan if the State has, within one year after the date of enactment of this Act, approved and committed to implement all or substantially all aspects of the plan. Requires a State or combination of States to submit a description of proposed abatement actions and estimated costs for the approval of the Administrator. Limits such grants to 55 percent of the plan implementation costs in any year and requires non-Federal sources to provide the remainder of such costs during such fiscal year. Limits administrative costs to ten percent of the annual Federal grant to a State. Requires States to submit progress reports in conjunction with the EPA to the Congress within 18 months after the receipt of such grants. Directs the Administrator, at the request of the Governor of an affected State and after consultation with appropriate Federal and State agencies and other interested persons, to make a grant for purposes of assessing the principal factors having an adverse effect on the environmental quality of the Narragansett Bay, as perceived by both scientists and users, in conjunction with developing and implementing a management program to improve such Bay's water quality. Requires States to submit descriptions of the proposed programs for the approval of the Administrator. Directs the Administrator to approve such programs if the applicant State demonstrates that it will: (1) establish a committee to provide advice on design and implementation of a management program and to coordinate communication on issues affecting such Bay's water quality; (2) coordinate research and pollution abatement programs to address adverse water quality factors; (3) establish methods for improving sampling data collection and a system for collecting, analyzing, storing, and disseminating such data; and (4) develop, and implement within three years after enactment of this Act, water quality management practices and measures (including land use requirements) to reduce to the greatest extent feasible pollutant loadings in such Bay and to improve its water quality. Limits such grants to 55 percent of the program implementation costs and requires non-Federal sources to provide the remainder. Requires States to submit descriptions of the proposed programs for the approval of the Administrator. Requires States to submit progress reports to the Administrator, within two years after issuance of such grants and annually thereafter. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1987 for such Chesapeake and Narragansett Bays programs."
