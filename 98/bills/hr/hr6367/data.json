    "text": "Amends titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to prohibit hospitals providing \"swing-bed\" services (long-term care usually provided by nursing homes) from being reimbursed for such services at a higher level than nursing homes. Limits those hospitals which can provide swing-bed services to those designed to hold fewer than 50 beds. (Current law permits hospitals with less than 50 beds to offer such services.) Prohibits a hospital from providing swing-bed services unless at least 96 percent of the beds in the nursing homes in the region of the hospital are occupied. Requires swing-bed hospitals to meet the same certification, licensing, and staff training standards as nursing homes. Limits agreements between the Secretary of Health and Human Services and a swing-bed hospital to 12 months. Permits such a hospital to apply for a renewal of an agreement."
