Title II: Imposition of Moratorium - Makes it unlawful (except to a certain extent for on-going operations or if ownership, control, or affiliation is explicitly authorized by Federal or State law on January 1, 1983) for: (1) any securities firm to own or control, to be owned by, or to be affiliated with any insurance company or depository institution; (2) any insurance company to own or control, to be owned or controlled by, or to be affiliated with any securities firm or depository institution; (3) for any depository institution to own or control, to be owned or controlled by, or to be affiliated with any securities firm or insurance company; and (4) any securities firm, insurance company, or depository institution to own or control, or to be owned or controlled by, or to be affiliated with any business organization which is primarily engaged in nonfinancial activities. Makes it unlawful, except for on-going or explicitly authorized activities, for any securities firm, insurance company, or depository institution, or business organization primarily engaged in nonfinancial activities to engage directly in any business activity if that activity is one in which it would be prohibited by this Act from engaging in indirectly (through ownership, control, or affiliation). Sets forth provisions concerning the continuation of on-going operations. Permits an action to be brought for violation of this title by a Federal or State agency responsible for the supervision, regulation, or inspection of securities firms, insurance companies, or depository institutions or by any aggrieved person or organization. Terminates the provisions of this title at the close of December 31, 1985. Title III: Commission on Capital Markets - Establishes the Commission on Capital Markets to evaluate the regulation of financial intermediaries by the Federal and State governments and the functioning of such intermediaries in the accumulation and allocation of capital and credit within the U.S. economy. Sets forth the information to be included in such evaluation. Requires the Commission to report its evaluation to Congress not later than nine months after the initial meeting. Terminates the Commission 90 days after the submission of its final report. Authorizes appropriations."
