    "text": "Indian Gambling Control Act - Declares gambling illegal within Indian country unless a tribal government has adopted rules and regulations for the conduct of gambling, and such rules have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Prohibits gambling activity within Indian country where Federal law or State public policy proscribes such activity. Requires the Secretary to approve tribal ordinances which meet specified standards for the conduct, licensing or regulation of gambling. Requires such ordinances to be as restrictive as those established by State law governing similar gambling. Proscribes the issuance of a tribal gambling license to any person who is ineligible to receive a State gambling license. Prohibits a tribe from entering into a management contract for the operation of a tribal gambling enterprise if such contract is based upon any percentage of the gross or net revenues of such enterprise."
