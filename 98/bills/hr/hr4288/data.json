    "text": "Amends the patent laws to make it an infringement of patent to use or sell in the United States without authority a product produced by a patented process. Places the burden of proof upon the party asserting that a product was not produced with the patented process in an infringement action where the court finds a substantial likelihood that the product was so produced and the claimant has exhausted all means of discovery. Amends both the patent and copyright laws to state that neither the patent nor copyright owner otherwise entitled to relief for infringement shall be denied relief if such owner engaged in certain commercially restrictive practices which, however, did not violate the antitrust laws."
