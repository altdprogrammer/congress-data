Directs the Secretary of the Interior to provide for the location, salvage, restoration, and preservation of such ships. Authorizes a State to acquire shipwrecks lying beneath its navigable waters if it has an approved salvage and restoration plan. Limits the power of a State to acquire a right, title, or interest in any shipwreck from the United States should the Secretary order or contract for its salvage before such a plan is adopted. Permits the modification of a State plan with the approval of the Secretary. Prohibits the Secretary of the Army from exercising his authority to break up, remove, sell, or otherwise dispose of such vessels without the prior approval of the Secretary of the Interior. Provides civil penalties for violations of this Act. Terminates a State's right, title, or interest in a shipwreck for plan noncompliance."
