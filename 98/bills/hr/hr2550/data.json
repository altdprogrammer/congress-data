    "date": "1983-04-13", 
    "text": "Agricultural Export Expansion Act of 1983 - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to develop and carry out a program under which agricultural commodities acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation are made available for export, without charge, to domestic exporters, domestic processors (for export), and foreign purchasers. Requires the Secretary to: (1) ensure that equal treatment is provided to domestic exporters and foreign purchasers and to domestic processors in cases where the importation of a manufactured product made from agricultural commodities, made available for export under this Act, would place domestic processors of such commodity at a competitive disadvantage; (2) give priority among foreign purchasers to purchasers who have purchased U.S. agricultural commodities in the past and who continue to do so in increased quanities; (3) ensure that agricultural commodities, made available for export under this Act, are used to encourage increased use of such commodities and to avoid unnecessary market displacement of domestic agricultural commodities; and (4) take reasonable precautions to prevent resale, transshipment or any use of such commodities other than domestic use in the importing country. Authorizes the Secretary to make supplemental distributions of commodities to a foreign purchaser who uses funds realized from the sale of commodities made available under this Act to construct or rehabilitate facilities in the importing country for specified purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to determine the intervals and quantities of such supplemental distributions. Requires the Secretary to carry out such program through the Commodity Credit Corporation. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to include specified agricultural commodities (currently only dairy products) acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation as donations for distributions to needy persons outside the United States. Provides for direct distribution, sale or barter of such commodities. Requires the proceeds realized from the sale or barter of such commodities to be used exclusively for assistance to needy persons. Prohibits the use of such proceeds to defray operating costs or overhead expenses. Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 to authorize the President to use agricultural commodities and products acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation to increase the level of agricultural exports under the Food for Development Program and under the program for the sale of agricultural commodities for foreign currencies and long-term dollar-credit. Directs the Secretary, through the Commodity Credit Corporation, to sell for export a specified amount of dairy products in each of FY 1983 through 1985. Requires the Secretary to make semiannual reports to the appropriate congressional committees on such sales. Authorizes the Secretary to make available to U.S. poulty and egg producers supplies of corn owned by the Commodity Credit Corporation. Requires the Secretary, in consultation with the U.S. Trade Representative, to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the use of predatory export subsidies by foreign nations competing with the United States for world markets in connection with agricultural commodities. Requires the President to submit a written report to Congress by June 1, 1983, describing the negotiation of a long-term grain sales agreement with the U.S.S.R., providing a higher minimum purchase requirement than the present agreement. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to submit a report to Congress describing the growth of and prospects for bilateral agricultural trade agreements and the potential impact of such agreements on trade."
