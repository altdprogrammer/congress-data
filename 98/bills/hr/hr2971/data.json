    "text": "Export Administration Amendments Act of 1983 - Title I: Amendments to Export Administration Act of 1979 - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to set forth penalties for: (1) conspiring or attempting to export goods in violation of such Act; (2) attempting to evade the provisions of such Act; and (3) possessing goods or technology with the intent to export them in violation of a national security or foreign policy export control or with the knowledge or reason to believe they would be so exported. Permits a waiver of the revocation of the authority to export goods or technology only if specified congressional committees are first consulted. Provides that persons who violate national security export controls may be subject to U.S. import controls on their goods or technology. Requires persons convicted of violating a national security or foreign policy export control to forfeit: (1) the goods or technology that were the subject of the violation or that were used in the violation; and (2) the proceeds from the transaction from which the violation arose. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to designate Commerce Department employees to take specified actions to enforce the Export Administration Act. Limits the authority of customs officers with respect to such Act to: (1) inspection and seizure of goods or technology at those places in which such officers are lawfully authorized to conduct such searches and seizures; and (2) investigations conducted before such inspection, search, or seizure. Limits the U.S. Customs Service inspections of goods and technology in the enforcement of this Act to those goods and technology about which the Customs Service has received information of possible violations. Prohibits the Customs Service from conducting random inspections. Limits the amount of money which the Customs Service may spend in enforcing export controls. Authorizes the Secretary to issue licenses authorizing multiple exports instead of a validated license for each export, including: (1) a qualified general license, authorizing exports for approved end uses; (2) distribution licenses; (3) project licenses; (4) service supply licenses; and (5) comprehensive operations licenses. Prohibits requiring permission for the exportation of goods or technology covered by national security controls if they are being exported to countries which maintain export controls cooperatively with the United States. Requires the exporter to notify the Commerce Department of such exports. Prohibits any Federal department or agency from recommending denial of an application to export to China goods or technology covered by national security export controls solely on the basis of their technical level if that level does not exceed a specified level. Permits denial of such applications solely on the basis of their technical level if the goods or technology: (1) are intended for a nuclear related end use or end-user; (2) could, if used for purposes other than those for which export is intended, be of significance for nuclear explosives; or (3) are otherwise subject to certain procedures established by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. Makes technology and related goods, including militarily critical technologies, eligible for a comprehensive operations export license. Makes exports of goods and technology eligible for a distribution license or other licenses authorizing multiple exports. Requires the removal of a national security export control on a good if all applications for an export license of such good during the previous year have been granted. Exempts from such requirement all export controls which the United States maintains cooperatively with another country. Prohibits imposing a national security export control on a good solely because the good contains a nonreprogrammable imbedded microprocessor. Permits imposing an export control on such a good only if the functions of the good are such that, if exported, it would make a significant contribution to the military potential of a country that would be detrimental to U.S. national security. Limits the duration of national security export controls on goods or technology that are available in foreign countries. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring a validated license for the export of such goods or technology if the availability has not been eliminated within six months of the President's determination that the absence of such export controls would be detrimental to national security. Requires the Secretary to accept the representations of export license applicants with respect to the foreign availability of goods or technology unless the representations are contradicted by reliable evidence. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress within 90 days on a finding by a technical advisory committee that goods or technology subject to national security export controls are available in foreign countries. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring a validated export license for such goods or technology if after six months, the foreign availability has not been eliminated. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense to complete the integration of the list of militarily critical technologies into the commodity control list not later than April 1, 1984. Requires the list to include only goods or technologies which are not possessed by nor available to countries to which national security controls apply. Requires the Secretaries to specify to Congress why U.S. military or national security is benefitted if the list includes a good or technology which is available in other countries. Requires the Director of the Office of Technology Assessment and the Comptroller General to appoint a task force to evaluate the attempt to integrate the list of militarily critical technologies into the commodity control list. Sets forth matters to be considered by the Task Force. Requires the task force to report its findings to Congress by April 1, 1984. Requires the Secretaries and the task force to consider mechanisms to reduce the list of militarily critical technologies, including removing from the list: (1) goods and technology the transfer of which would not lead to a significant near-term improvement in the defense capability of a country to which exports are controlled; (2) slowly evolving technologies; (3) technology that is not process-oriented; and (4) components used in militarily sensitive devices that in themselves are not sensitive. Requires the President, before imposing foreign policy export controls, to consult with certain countries, including the countries with which the United States maintains export controls cooperatively. Requires the President to submit a report to Congress within ten days of imposing, expanding, or extending foreign policy export controls. Requires such report to include the extent and results of consultations with industry and other countries before the foreign policy export controls were imposed. Prohibits any export controls imposed for foreign policy reasons from affecting: (1) export contracts entered into before the controls were imposed; or (2) export licenses issued before such time. Prohibits export controls imposed on goods or technology in short supply from affecting export contracts entered into before the controls were imposed. Prohibits foreign policy export controls from authorizing export controls on donations of goods intended to meet basic human needs. Expresses the intent of Congress that foreign policy export controls not be imposed on goods or technology if the principal effect of their export would be to help meet basic human needs. Authorizes the President to prohibit or curtail the exportation from the United States of any goods, technology, or other information produced in the United States to the extent necessary to further significantly U.S. foreign policy or to fulfill U.S. international obligations. Applies foreign policy export controls to activities undertaken with the intent to evade such controls even if such controls would not otherwise apply to such activities. Authorizes the President to impose foreign policy export controls with respect to an expanded number of goods or technology if: (1) the President reports to Congress on the proposed controls; and (2) a law is enacted authorizing such controls. Reimposes for one year the foreign policy export controls which were in effect on February 28, 1982, and ceased to be effective on March 1, 1982, September 15, 1982, and January 20, 1983 (except those controls with respect to the 1980 summer Olympic games). Authorizes one year extensions of such controls. Prohibits the President from rescinding a determination that a country supports international terrorism unless the President submits a report to Congress justifying the rescission and certifying that the country has not provided such support for a year. Authorizes entities which represent an industry or a substantial segment of an industry which processes metallic materials capable of being recycled to petition the Secretary to monitor exports of such material or impose export controls on such material if: (1) a domestic price increase or a domestic shortage resulting from increased exports has or may have a significant adverse effect on the economy; and (2) a significant increase in exports is a substantial cause of serious injury to a domestic industry or the economy. Requires such petition to include information demonstrating that specified criteria are satisfied. Sets forth the factors to be used in determining serious injury. Requires the Secretary to issue regulations defining specified terms. Sets forth the criteria the Secretary shall use in determining whether to impose monitoring or controls on such materials. Prohibits the Secretary from considering another petition with respect to such material within six months of the final action on the prior petition. Deletes the provision permitting the Secretary to impose temporary controls on such materials after a petition has been filed. Requires specified procedures to be followed before export controls on such materials may be imposed. Terminates the short supply export controls on domestically produced crude oil on September 30, 1987. Requires the President to notify Congress whenever the President determines that short supply export controls should be imposed on refined petroleum products. Declares that foreign policy or short supply controls imposed on agricultural commodities shall cease to be effective if, within 60 days of receiving the President's report on such controls, the Congress does not adopt a joint resolution approving the controls. Requires the Secretary to issue or deny within 60 days of submission those export license applications which are not referred to another department or agency. Requires the Secretary to allow an export license applicant 30 days to respond to a decision to deny the license application. Prohibits the Secretary from returning a license application without action if the license requirements are changed after the application has been submitted. Authorizes the Secretary to request additional information in such a case. Requires the Secretary to provide a proper classification of a good or technology on the commodity control list within ten days of receiving a request for such classification. Requires the Secretary to respond within 30 days to an inquiry about the applicability of export license requirements to a proposed export transaction or series of transactions. Requires the Secretary to include in the annual report to Congress on the administration of the Export Administration Act detailed information on the removal of export controls pursuant to a specified section. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the purposes of such Act for FY 1984 and 1985. Extends the authority granted by such Act until September 30, 1985. Requires the Secretary to modify the office hours of the Office of Export Administration on at least four days of each workweek to accommodate exporters throughout the United States.
