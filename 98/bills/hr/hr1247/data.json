    "text": "Reverse Freedom of Information Procedure Act - Amends the Freedom of Information Act to require each Federal agency to promulgate regulations by which the agency notifies a person who has submitted information (submitter) of any request for its disclosure. Requires an agency to permit a submitter or requester to submit written arguments regarding a disclosure request. Prohibits an agency, upon deciding to honor a disclosure request, from disclosing the information for ten days after notifying any submitter who objected to such disclosure of such decision. Grants jurisdiction to the Federal district courts to enjoin an agency from disclosing information, upon complaint of any submitter. Directs the court, in an action in which the complainant seeks the withholding of records, to uphold the agency's determination unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with law."
