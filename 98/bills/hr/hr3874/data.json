    "text": "Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Act of 1983 - Title I: Findings and Purposes - Declares that the purposes of this Act are to: (1) improve locking devices for motor vehicles; (2) improve identification numbering systems for motor vehicles and major components; (3) increase Federal criminal penalties for persons trafficking in stolen motor vehicles and parts; and (4) establish regulatory procedures to reduce the opportunity for criminals to export stolen motor vehicles. Title II: Improved Security for Motor Vehicles and Their Parts - Amends the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to establish standards to reduce the theft of motor vehicles and their parts. Title III: Anti-Fencing Measures - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties for: (1) altering or removing motor vehicle identification numbers; and (2) trafficking in motor vehicles or their parts which have altered or removed identification numbers. Requires the forfeiture of any vehicle or part which has had such number removed, with specified exceptions. Designates as nonmailable matter any manipulative device which is designed or adapted to operate, circumvent, remove, or render inoperative the ignition switch or lock or door or trunk lock of two or more motor vehicles, or any advertisement for the sale of such device. Title IV: Importation and Exportation Measures - Imposes criminal and civil penalties upon anyone who imports, exports, or attempts to import or export any stolen motor vehicle, vessel, or aircraft. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require persons who export or attempt to export a used motor vehicle to present to the appropriate customs officers the vehicle and a document describing that vehicle. Title V: Reporting Requirements - Directs the Attorney General to report to Congress, within 18 months of enactment of this Act, on developments in the area of vehicle identification of off-road motor vehicles. Requires the Attorney General to report to Congress on the implementation of this Act."
