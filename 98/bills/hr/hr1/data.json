    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1983-07-13", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #247 (263-158)) Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 - Title I: Community and Neighborhood Development and Conservation - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to require that not less than 51 percent of the assistance provided under the community development block grant (CDBG) program be used to support activities that benefit persons of low and moderate income. Amends the definitions of a \"metropolitan city\" and an \"urban county\" for purposes of such program by revising population requirements. Defines \"low and moderate income\" as family income not exceeding 80 percent of the median income of the metropolitan city, urban area, or nonentitlement area involved. Provides that any metropolitan city that qualified for assistance under such program in FY 1983 because it was defined as a central city of a metropolitan area shall continue to qualify for such assistance for FY 1984 and each succeeding fiscal year if it utilizes 75 percent of such assistance received for FY 1982 and each succeeding fiscal year in areas, or on projects, directly benefiting persons of low and moderate income. Authorizes appropriations for such program for FY 1984 through 1986. Prohibits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from awarding a grant under such program to any metropolitan city or urban county unless the applicant certifies that: (1) it has developed a three-year community development plan that identifies community development and housing needs, a comprehensive strategy for meeting such needs, and short and long-term community development objectives; (2) it has formulated a program that describes activities to be undertaken to meet community development needs and objectives, indicates resources expected to be provided from other sources for such activities, needs, and objectives, and specifies a plan to minimize the displacement of persons as a result of such activities and to assist persons who are displaced; (3) it will administer its program in conformity with civil rights laws and will affirmatively further fair housing opportunities; (4) prior to submission of its application, it has prepared and followed a written citizen participation plan in the development of its program and application, notified citizens of the amount of funds available for housing and community development activities and of the range of proposed activities, and held public hearings on housing and community development needs; (5) it will provide citizens with reasonable access to records of an applicant's use of funds and reasonable notice of any substantial proposed change in the use of funds; (6) it will not attempt to recover any capital costs of public improvements financed by CDBG funds by charging any fee against properties owned by persons of low and moderate income, unless such funds are used to pay the proportion of such fee that relates to capital costs financed from other revenue sources; and (7) it will comply with all applicable laws. Prohibits the Secretary from awarding a grant to a State for nonentitlement areas unless the applicant meets the certification requirements for metropolitan cities and urban counties, with a specified exception, and certifies that it has: (1) consulted with local governments in nonentitlement areas in developing its community development plan and its procedure for allocating CDBG funds; and (2) developed a competitive process for selecting applications for assistance from such local governments under which an application may not be denied on the basis of the particular eligible activity selected by such local government to meet its community development needs. Prohibits a State or the Secretary from distributing any CDBG funds to any local government in a nonentitlement area unless the applicant meets specified certification requirements prescribed for a metropolitan city or urban county and certifies that: (1) it will utilize such funds to offset amounts charged against properties of low and moderate income persons for capital costs of public improvements in water, sewage, or air quality systems; (2) it will determine the amount of such offset on the basis of the person's ability to pay; and (3) it has developed a statement that identifies its community development and housing needs, includes a strategy for meeting such needs, and includes planned activities to meet such needs with estimates of the costs of such activities and the extent to which they will benefit persons of low and moderate income. Limits to ten percent of any CDBG the amount of funds that may be used for unspecified local option activities. Prohibits the allocation or distribution of CDBG funds by the Secretary or any State unless the applicant involved certifies that not less than 51 percent of the assistance received shall be used for the support of activities that benefit persons of low and moderate income. Requires that the housing assistance plan of a local government receiving CDBG funds include the number of vacant and abandoned dwelling units to be upgraded and preserved. Requires each State, metropolitan city, urban county, and nonentitlement area receiving CDBG funds to submit an annual performance report on its housing and community development activities to the Secretary or the State, as appropriate. Requires that such report include: (1) an assessment of the relationship of such activities to CDBG program objectives, the entity's certification requirements, the entity's community development and housing needs and objectives, and achievement of the goals of an entity's housing assistance plan; (2) in the case of a local government, an assessment of the benefits provided to low and moderate income persons as a result of such activities, on a project by project basis; and (3) any citizen comments received. Directs the Secretary to prescribe a standard form for such reports. Requires the Secretary to: (1) conduct such reviews and audits as are necessary to determine if nonentitlement areas have satisfied performance criteria; and (2) require each State and local government receiving CDBG funds to maintain such records as necessary to enable the Secretary and States to conduct adequate performance reviews. Authorizes a local government receiving CDBG funds to request and receive funds for certain projects in one lump-sum payment. Requires that any interest accrued on such payment be expended on such project. Allows any local government to retain any program income that is realized from any CDBG made by the Secretary or a State if such income is realized after the initial disbursement of CDBG funds and such government has agreed to use such income for eligible community development activities. Permits a State to: (1) make a grant to a local government on the condition that such government pay any such income to the State to be used for additional eligible community development activities; and (2) waive such condition to the extent such income is applied to continue the local government's activity. Provides that CDBG funds made available to a local government shall be considered to be financial assistance for the purposes of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970. Entitles persons displaced by an activity carried out with such funds to assistance from the local government as provided under such Act. Permits local governments to: (1) use up to 20 percent of CDBG assistance for the provision of public services; or (2) match any higher percentage of such assistance used for such purpose in FY 1981, 1982, or 1983. Includes as an activity that is eligible for CDBG funding the development of shared housing opportunities by neighborhood-based nonprofit organizations or other private or public nonprofit organizations. Requires that any acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation activity of a public or private non-profit entity and any economic development activity of a for-profit entity that is identified by a CDBG applicant as predominately benefiting persons of low and moderate income: (1) be conducted in a neighborhood consisting predominantly of such persons and provide essential services to such persons; (2) involve facilities designed for use predominately by such persons; or (3) involve employment of individuals, the majority of whom are persons of low and moderate income. Sets forth criteria for determining the extent to which certain activities benefit persons of low and moderate income. Prohibits providing CDBG funds for any project intended to relocate any industrial or commercial facility unless the Secretary determines that the relocation will not significantly and adversely affect the unemployment or economic base of the area from which the facility is to be relocated. Authorizes the Secretary to reallocate to any metropolitan city any CDBG funds that were allocated to, but not received by, an urban county and earmarked for such city prior to its qualification as a metropolitan city, if such city and county agree to such reallocation of funds and the transfer of responsibility for the administration of such funds. Sets aside a specified amount of the funds authorized for the CDBG program for the Secretary's special discretionary fund for FY 1984 through 1986. Authorizes the Secretary to allocate amounts from such fund to any State or local government that is determined by the Secretary to have received insufficient amounts under a CDBG because of a miscalculation. Requires the Secretary to provide a specified amount of such fund for grants: (1) to institutions of higher education for continuing programs in effect during FY 1983 for providing assistance to economically disadvantaged and minority students who participate in community development work study programs; and (2) in behalf of new communities. Authorizes additional appropriations for FY 1984 for grants by the Secretary to States, local governments, and Indian tribes for the provision of shelter and essential services for persons who are subject to life-threatening situations because of their lack of housing. Directs the Secretary to enter into commitments during FY 1984 to guarantee notes and obligations of a specified aggregate amount issued by local governments to finance the acquisition or rehabilitation of real property. Prohibits the Secretary from guaranteeing such a note or obligation unless the issuer certifies that: (1) at least 51 percent of the amounts received through the issuance of such note or obligation will be used to support activities that benefit persons of low and moderate income; (2) it will not attempt to recover any capital costs of public improvements assisted with amounts received from such note or obligation by charging any fee against properties owned by persons of low and moderate income, unless such amounts or CDBG funds are used to pay the portion of such fee that relates to the capital costs financed from other revenue sources; (3) it will use amounts received from such note or obligation or CDBG funds to offset amounts charged against properties of such persons for capital costs of public improvements required to comply with Federal and State water, sewage, or air quality standards; and (4) it will determine the amount of such offset on the basis of a person's ability to pay. Authorizes appropriations for urban development action grants (UDAGs) for FY 1984 through 1986. Provides that an identifiable unincorporated community of an urban county that meets certain poverty criteria shall qualify for an UDAG. Requires UDAG applicants to certify for the Secretary that an analysis of the impact of proposed activities on neighborhood residents has been made available to neighborhood-based nonprofit organizations. Allows the Secretary's criteria for selecting UDAG recipients in FY 1984 to provide for a leveraging ratio of as low as two dollars of private investment for each grant dollar provided to any city that has a population of less than 50,000 and is not a central city of a metropolitan statistical area, if such amounts are to be used for projects involving industrial facilities or providing housing for persons of low and moderate income. Directs the Secretary to assist such cities in evaluating their needs and developing programs to meet such needs upon determining that such assistance would benefit such cities. Requires the Secretary to allocate amounts available for UDAGs in order to achieve a balance among programs designed to: (1) restore seriously deteriorated neighborhoods; (2) reclaim underutilized real property; and (3) renew commercial employment centers. Prohibits the Secretary from denying UDAG assistance on the basis that such assistance is to be used solely for the provision of housing. Directs the Secretary to guarantee loans made to nonprofit organizations based in neighborhoods in which activities are funded by UDAGs, if: (1) loan funds are used to finance neighborhood revitalization activities designed to meet housing and related needs of persons of low and moderate income; (2) there is reasonable assurance of repayment of the loan; and (3) financial institutions would not provide the loan without the guarantee. Limits the amount of such loans that may be guaranteed during FY 1984 to an amount equal to ten percent of the amount appropriated for UDAGs. Directs the Secretary to make grants to assist eligible neighborhood development organizations in conducting neighborhood development activities designed to: (1) create jobs; (2) establish or expand new businesses; (3) develop or rehabilitate neighborhood housing stock; (4) deliver essential services; or (5) plan, promote, or finance voluntary neighborhood improvement efforts. Permits the Secretary to provide up to $50,000 to an organization at a ratio of between three and ten Federal dollars for every dollar received from private sources, depending on the degree of economic distress in relation to the number of households in each neighborhood. Requires an organization to certify that: (1) the private funds will be provided during the period in which the eligible activity will be conducted; and (2) the local government of the neighborhood involved has been notified of, and provided an opportunity to comment on, the grant application. Directs the Secretary to award such grants on the basis of: (1) the degree of economic distress of the neighborhood involved; (2) the extent to which the proposed activities will benefit persons of low and moderate income; and (3) the extent of neighborhood participation in such activities. Directs the Secretary to establish a neighborhood development advisory committee to assist the Secretary in operating and evaluating such grant program. Authorizes appropriations for such program for FY 1984. Revises the urban homesteading program. Discontinues participation by a State or State-designated agency in such program. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) donate property improved by a one- to four-family residence to a local government or a public agency designated by such government for use exclusively in a single-family homesteading program; (2) convey property suitable for a multifamily homesteading program to such government or agency for negotiated consideration; and (3) provide funds to such government or agency for the acquisition of property for use in a single-family or multifamily program. Requires that a single-family homesteading program provide for: (1) the initial conveyance of property by the government or agency without substantial consideration to a family of low or moderate income (income not exceeding 80 percent of the area median income) upon the condition that the family agrees to repair all dangerous defects in the property within one year; (2) the conveyance of such property to such family without substantial consideration after such defects are repaired if the family agrees to occupy the property for at least five years and to make the improvements necessary to meet local housing standards within three years after the initial conveyance; (3) an equitable procedure for selecting property recipients that excludes current homeowners, considers the capacity of the applicant to contribute labor or obtain other assistance, and gives a priority to applicants who pay more than 30 percent of their income for substandard housing and who have little prospect for obtaining improved housing otherwise; and (4) the provision of technical and rehabilitation assistance to property recipients. Requires that a multifamily homesteading program provide for: (1) primarily residential use of all homestead properties following conversion or rehabilitation; (2) 75 percent occupancy by low- or moderate-income families; (3) cooperative ownership; (4) the exclusion of entities operated for profit as the first owners of converted or rehabilitated properties; (5) the contribution of labor by the occupants; (6) technical and rehabilitation assistance; and (7) minimal displacement of prior occupants. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to a local government or agency for the provision of rehabilitation assistance for homestead property recipients. Requires that at least 75 percent of such assistance be allocated to aid families of very low income (income not exceeding 50 percent of the area median income). Lists the criteria to be used by the Secretary in selecting projects to receive homesteading assistance. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, as well as the Administrator of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to comply with the request of a local government or agency of an area for a listing of the vacant residential properties in that area to which the Secretary holds title. Requires that such listings be accessible to the public. Requires the annual report of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to Congress to include an assessment of the extent to which homesteading programs consider the housing need and income of homestead applicants and an estimate of the median income of homestead recipients during the year. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 for the urban homesteading program. Amends the Housing Act of 1964 to limit the amount of appropriations that may be approved for rehabilitation loans for FY 1984. Prohibits the Secretary from establishing: (1) any requirement that a certain portion of such a loan be used for any particular type of dwelling unit; or (2) any priority for receipt of such a loan that is based on an applicant's receipt of other Federal assistance under any program other than the urban homesteading program. Amends the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act to authorize appropriations for the Corporation for FY 1984. Directs the Corporation to use a specified amount of such appropriations to conduct a mutual housing demonstration program emphasizing housing rehabilitation. Declares that any city that has a population of less than 50,000 persons, that is not a central city of a metropolitan area, and that was eligible for an UDAG shall continue to be eligible for an UDAG until the Secretary revises eligibility standards for such cities and includes the extent of unemployment as a standard of distress for such cities. Title II: Assisted Housing - Part A: Lower Income Housing Programs - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to: (1) increase, on October 1, 1983, the maximum amount of annual contributions which the Secretary may make to public housing agencies for low-income housing projects; (2) limit the amount which may be obligated over the duration of contribution contracts with respect to additional authority provided on October 1, 1983; and (3) earmark specified amounts of such additional authority for homeownership assistance payments, rehabilitation assistance, public housing modernization, rent subsidies, assistance to upgrade public housing projects, amendments to assistance contracts or reservations, the conversion of other housing assistance to rent subsidies, and for public housing receiving assistance other than rent subsidies, including Indian housing. Requires recaptured authority to be used for the construction of housing for elderly and handicapped families and for rent subsidies. Authorizes appropriations for public housing operating assistance for FY 1984. Declares that income limits for occupancy and rent in public housing shall be fixed by the public housing agency and approved by the Secretary. Limits the amount that a family shall pay as rent for public housing to not more than the highest of: (1) ten percent of the family's monthly income; (2) the portion of the family's welfare assistance designated for housing costs; or (3) 25 (currently 30) percent of the family's monthly adjusted income. Revises the definitions of a family's income and adjusted income to specify amounts to be excluded or deducted, respectively. (Currently such amounts are determined by the Secretary.) Amends the National Housing Act and the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 to adopt such definitions of income and adjusted income. Reduces the tenant's contribution to rent under the rental assistance payment program from 30 to 25 percent of a family's monthly adjusted income. Increases the amount of rental assistance under the rent supplement program from the lesser of 70 percent of the fair market rent or the amount by which such rent exceeds 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income to the lesser of 70 percent of such rent or the amount by which such rent exceeds 25 percent of the tenant's adjusted income. Directs the Secretary to limit to ten percent any annual increase in a family's rental payments resulting from any change in Federal law redefining which governmental benefits are to be considered as income. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to authorize the Secretary to waive the limitation on the percentage of public housing units that may be occupied by single persons who are not 62 years old, disabled, handicapped, displaced, or a remaining member of a tenant family, if a unit is not, and is not likely to be, occupied by a person in one of such categories within 12 months because of the unit's location or condition. Prohibits the Secretary from recapturing any authority allocated to a public housing agency for public housing development prior to FY 1984 for 24 months after enactment of this Act. Permits such agency to use such authority for comprehensive improvement assistance after consulting its local government. Prohibits the Secretary from establishing any preference based on the types of activities for which comprehensive improvement assistance is requested other than the preferences currently required. Directs the Secretary to establish, annually revise, and publish reasonable maximum limitations on public housing development costs. Directs the Secretary to require public housing agencies to: (1) implement an administrative grievance procedure for tenants and applicants; and (2) use leases that do not contain unreasonable terms and conditions, that obligate the agency to maintain the projects in a decent, safe, and sanitary condition, that require the agency to provide specified written notice of termination of the lease, and that prohibit the agency from terminating the lease except for serious or repeated violations or other good cause. Makes it the responsibility of each public housing agency operating a lower income housing project to establish a procedure for determining the eligibility of, and rent to be paid by, families applying for, or occupying, project units. Authorizes such an agency to require families to provide only information directly related to accomplishing fair housing objectives or determining eligibility, rental payments, or appropriate unit size. Prohibits the Secretary from: (1) requiring any such family to provide information that duplicates information provided to a public housing agency, except for a survey of a sample population or an audit of the agency's procedures for determining rent and eligibility; or (2) maintaining any record on an applicant or occupant family, unless such record is necessary for an investigation of a specific allegation of fraud by such family. Establishes as the fair market rental for existing public housing projects the median rent paid for comparable units by tenants who moved into the area within the most recent two-year period for which data is available. Requires the maximum monthly rent to be reasonable compared with unassisted units. Prohibits the rent for an assisted unit from exceeding the rent charged for comparable unassisted units in a project. Requires the Secretary to revise such fair market rentals at least once each year. Directs the Secretary to offer to renew any assistance contract with a public housing authority for five-year periods in order to extend the total period of assistance to 15 years, if the authority has carried out the terms of the contract. Allows a public housing agency to attach a contract providing assistance payments to an owner of an existing structure to that structure or the tenant. Permits an owner to renew such a contract attached to a structure for up to a total period of 15 years. Limits to ten percent any annual increase in rent for elderly tenants due to the conversion of certain housing assistance programs. Prescribes revisions to the standards to be used by the Secretary in determining costs of operations and projections of income for the purpose of calculating amounts of public housing operating subsidies. Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress: (1) an annual report setting forth detailed estimates of the amount of operating assistance required under such standards and any recommendations for modifications to such standards; and (2) by March 1, 1984, a report setting forth recommendations for standards modifications or other regulatory legislative changes for the purpose of providing incentives to public housing agencies to implement management improvements designed to reduce costs and provide for more efficient operation of projects and delivery of services. Provides that a specified rule concerning gross rent in the calculation of such operating subsidies may not be considered to have been effective before a specified date with respect to public housing agencies that were parties to a civil action to enjoin implementation of such rule. Repeals provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 that restrict the percentage of public housing units available to lower income families other than very low-income families. Requires at least 30 percent of the families assisted under the program providing rent subsidies to owners of existing lower income housing projects to be very low-income families. Establishes conditions governing the demolition, sale, or disposal of public housing projects. Amends the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1981 to permit a public housing agency to retain: (1) the greater of its legal expenses in obtaining a judgment or 50 percent of the amount of a judgment obtained in recovering amounts wrongfully paid as a result of fraud or abuse in any housing program (currently one specific program) under the United States Housing Act of 1937; and (2) 50 percent of wrongfully paid amounts recovered by means other than court actions. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to prohibit the Secretary from imposing a percentage or other arbitrary ceiling on rent or cost increases on certain federally-assisted lower income housing projects. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the status of the program established by the Secretary to provide housing assistance to local governments in areas of concentrated housing and community development activities under the CDBG program. Declares that utility payments made by persons living in certain federally-assisted low-income housing projects shall be considered to be rental payments for purposes of determining eligibility or the amount of benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Authorizes the Secretary to provide rental subsidies to housing owners under the United States Housing Act of 1937 for dwelling units without bathrooms and kitchens if the local government in which such unit is located and the local public housing agency certify that the unit complies with local health and safety standards. Directs the Secretary to conduct a demonstration program of making grants to assist public housing agencies in providing child care services for lower income families which reside in public housing and are headed by a person who is single or separated or whose spouse is elderly, handicapped, or disabled. Requires the Secretary to design such program to determine the extent to which the availability of such a service facilitates the employability of such persons. Lists criteria for awarding such grants, including requirements that a service be designed to involve parents and employ elderly residents of the housing project involved. Directs the Secretary to: (1) award grants to the largest number of lower-income housing projects possible; (2) ensure a reasonable distribution of such grants between rural and urban areas; (3) conduct periodic evaluations of the effectiveness of each program established; and (4) report to Congress within two years on his or her findings, conclusions, and recommendations concerning such program. Authorizes appropriations. Part B: Other Assisted Housing Programs - Amends the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 to provide that operating assistance shall be available to troubled multifamily housing projects: (1) without regard to whether such projects are insured under the National Housing Act; and (2) that are converted from assistance under the rent supplement and rental assistance payments programs to the rental subsidy program under the United States Housing Act of 1937. Amends the National Housing Act to extend through FY 1984 the period during which the Rental Housing Assistance Fund may be utilized for such assistance. Requires the Secretary to offer, annually, to amend rental assistance payment contracts under the National Housing Act to provide sufficient payments to cover necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of tenants, regardless of whether project mortgages are insured under such Act. Directs the Secretary to use authority recaptured as a result of the conversion of such contracts to rental subsidy contracts under the United States Housing Act of 1937 for remaining rental assistance payment contracts. Amends the Housing Act of 1959 to limit the maximum annual interest rate and administrative allowance charge on loans by the Secretary for the provision of housing for the elderly and handicapped families. Authorizes an increase in the Treasury borrowing authority and establishes a loan limitation for such loan program for FY 1984. Earmarks a specified amount of the funds available for such program for FY 1984 for the development of housing for the handicapped. Requires that not more than 20 percent of such funds be provided for housing for handicapped persons who have been released from residential health treatment facilities. Permits up to 25 percent of the units financed with such a loan for elderly and handicapped housing to be efficiencies. Authorizes the Secretary to require the sponsor of such a housing project to deposit up to $10,000 in an escrow account to assure the sponsor's commitment and management capabilities. Directs the Secretary to: (1) consider design features for the elderly and handicapped when establishing project unit cost limitations; and (2) adjust such limitations annually to reflect changes in construction costs. Conditions the sale, transfer, or prepayment of any such loan on the assurance that the project involved will continue to operate until the original maturity date on terms at least as advantageous to the elderly and handicapped as the terms of the original loan.
