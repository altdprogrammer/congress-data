Requires such recommendations to be transmitted to the appropriate standing committees, which shall report back to their respective bodies, within 14 days, legislation carrying out the budget recommendations. Permits legislation to provide for a ceiling on Federal expenditures for FY 1986, 1987, and 1988, at a declining percent of the Nation's gross national product if a balanced budget is inappropriate for a fiscal year. Requires Congress to consider a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget before considering the budget resolution for FY 1986."
