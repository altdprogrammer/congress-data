    "text": "District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act - Amends the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act to remove the requirement that budget acts disapproved by the Mayor be sent to the President. Removes the exclusion for the Council of the District of Columbia of reading budget acts twice. Authorizes the Council to establish the maximum amount of funds for allocation to the District's court system but prohibits the Council from specifying the purposes of expenditures. Allows the enactment of the District's budget without congressional approval. Allows the hiring of employees when such positions are approved by acts of the Council. (Currently, positions may be authorized only by Acts of Congress). Declares that the District government will operate on the preceding fiscal year's budget when the budget act for any fiscal year has not timely become law. Provides that expenditures of funds derived from revenue bonds shall not be affected by budget adoption procedures of the Council. Makes conforming amendments to provisions of this Act. Extends the interim loan authority of the District until October 1, 1985, or upon enactment of the FY 1986 appropriation act. Requires the Council, not later than 120 days after enactment of this Act, to enact a budget and accounting act for the District."
