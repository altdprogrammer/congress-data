    "text": "Outer Continental Shelf Lands Amendments Act of 1983 - Title I: Findings and Purposes Concerning Management of Outer Continental Shelf Lands Resources - Sets forth findings and purposes of this Act. Title II: Amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to revise provisions of the Outer Continenal Shelf leasing program. Requires the location, timing, and size of such leasing activity to be specified on the basis of individual geological basins on the Outer Continental Shelf in such manner as will provide definitive notice of the areas to be affected by each activity under such schedule. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, for purposes of determining the size, timing, and location of leasing activity, to propose or seek actively oil- and gas-bearing areas within individual geologic basins. Permits potential oil and gas producers to nominate tracts within such areas and States, local governments, and interested groups and individuals to submit comments, recommendations, and negative and positive nominations to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary, after consideration of such nominations, comments, and recommendations, to establish the schedule for exploration, development, and production. Permits only those tracts receiving a high level of industry nominations and no negative State recomendations to be included on the schedule, unless the Secretary rejects the recommendation. Requires an equitable sharing of developmental benefits and environmental risks associated with exploration, development, and production of oil and gas within each geologic basin, including the developmental benefits and socioeconomic risks for persons, local governments, or States within any portion of the affected coastal area. (Currently, an equitable sharing of developmental benefits and environmental risks among various regions is required.) Directs the Secretary, in considering the relative environmental sensitivity and marine productivity of areas of the Outer Continental Shelf, to consider both the particular and cumulative environmental and socioeconomic effects of exploration and development. Provides that in the case of all leasing following enactment of this Act, for purposes of the timing, location, and extent of such leasing, prior leasing activities in the geological basins concerned shall not be considered. Directs the Secretary to select the timing, extent, and location of leasing so as to minimize to the greatest extent possible the risk of environmental damage or adverse effects on the coastal zone. Authorizes the Secretary to reject a specific recommendation of the Governor of an affected State only if the recommendation does not provide for a reasonable balance between the national interest and the well-being of the citizens of the affected State. Requires the Secretary to show compelling reasons for rejecting the Governor's recommendations. Provides that the Secretary's determination as to whether or not an affected State's recommendations provide for a reasonable balance between national interests and the State's interests shall not, alone, be a basis to invalidate a proposed lease sale or development and production plan in any suit or judicial review, unless the determination is not supported by substantial evidence. Provides that in all oil and gas bearing areas not offered for lease sale before 1978, no tract in such areas may be offered for lease sale for three years after the first lease sale in such area except in the Alaskan oil and gas bearing area, where there shall be no tract offered for lease sale for five years after the first lease sale in the area concerned. Revises provisions relating to the use of the best available and safest economically feasible technologies for drilling and production operations to require the use of the best and safest technologies. (Currently, the best and safest technologies are required if they are determined to be economically possible.) Requires the research elements of the national earthquake hazards reduction program, established by the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977, to include studies of the seismic activity on Outer Continental Shelf development. Title III: Moratorium on Oil and Gas Leasing On Outer Continental Shelf Lands - Prohibits the issuance of any of any oil and gas lease on any submerged lands located: (1) within specified geographical areas off the coastline of California and Massachusetts until January 1, 2000; and (2) within certain other specified geographical areas off the coastline of Massachusetts until January 1, 1990. Prohibits the issuance of any license or permit or the approval of any exploration plan or any development and production plan until January 1, 2000, which: (1) affects or provides for any activity affecting the geographical area described in clause one above; and (2) involves drilling for oil and gas. States that the above prohibitions shall not affect the authority of the Secretary to approve any plan or to grant any permit allowing scientific exploration or other activities."
