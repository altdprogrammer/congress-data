    "text": "Central America Peace and Reform Act of 1984 - Requires the withdrawal, within 30 days of the enactment of this Act, of all U.S. armed forces in the territory, airspace, or waters of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, or Nicaragua which exceed the level of U.S. armed forces in each such country on August 1, 1983. Prohibits the introduction of additional U.S. armed forces into such countries for training exercises or other purposes unless: (1) Congress has declared war or enacted specific authorization for their presence in such areas; or (2) the forces are necessary to provide for the immediate evacuation of U.S. citizens or to respond to a clear and present danger of military attack on the United States. Excludes embassy security forces from such prohibition. Prohibits any U.S. support for any military or paramilitary operations in or against Nicaragua. Suspends security assistance to El Salvador unless and until the President finds and certifies to the Congress and the Congress enacts a joint resolution concurring with the President's findings that: (1) the Government of El Salvador is negotiating with all major parties to the Salvadoran conflict for the achievement of a cease-fire and an equitable political settlement; (2) documented progress has been made in implementing the land reform program; (3) the Government of El Salvador is demonstrating compliance with internationally recognized human rights; (4) the Government of El Salvador has moved to establish the rule of law; (5) the Government of El Salvador has begun to exercise control over its military, security police, and paramilitary forces; and (6) the right of free assembly in El Salvador is being effectively protected. Prohibits the use of the President's special drawdown authority under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 with respect to El Salvador during FY 1984 and 1985. Prohibits using a specified authority of the Arms Export Control Act to delay billing El Salvador for sales from U.S. defense stocks during FY 1984 and 1985. Prohibits the following unless Congress has enacted a joint resolution specifically approving such action: (1) obligating funds for military assistance or international military education and training assistance for Guatemala; (2) issuing arms sales credits or loan guarantees for Guatemala; (3) issuing licenses for arms exports to Guatemala; (4) issuing licenses for arms exports for the armed forces of Guatemala; and (5) assigning or detailing members of the U.S. armed forces to Guatemala. Excludes from such prohibitions: (1) sales of construction equipment and mobile medical facilities to assist in certain development programs; (2) sales of training, to be provided outside of Guatemala, which is related to sales of such equipment and facilities; and (3) a limited amount of loan guarantees and credits under the Arms Export Control Act for FY 1984 and 1985 for sales of such equipment, facilities, and training. Limits the authority of the President to waive provisions of this Act. Provides that such waiver shall cease to be effective 30 days after the President submits written notification of such waiver to Congress unless, within those 30 days, Congress enacts a joint resolution approving the waiver."
