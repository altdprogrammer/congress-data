Directs the Secretary of Commerce to conduct a continuing study, and report annually, so as to determine whether existing captured fisheries could be adversely affected by competition from products produced by commercial aquacultural enterprises and include in such study an assessment of any adverse effect on fisheries. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to undertake a study, and report to Congress by February 1, 1985, to identify exotic species introduced into U.S. waters as a result of aquaculture activities, and to determine the potential benefits and impacts of the introduction of exotic species. Makes the current biennial reporting requirement on the status of U.S. aquaculture an annual requirement.
