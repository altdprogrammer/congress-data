    "text": "Flatside Wilderness Act - Designates certain lands in the Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas as the Flatside Wilderness. Provides that the following areas in Arkansas may be reviewed as to their suitability for preservation as wilderness: (1) the Hurricane Creek Wilderness Area, the Richland Creek Wilderness Area, the East Fork Wilderness Area, the Upper Buffalo Wilderness Area Additions, the Leatherwood Wilderness Area, and the Penhook Wilderness Area, all in the Ozark National Forest; and (2) the Black Fork Mountain Wilderness Area, the Dry Creek Wilderness Area, the Belle Starr Caves Wilderness Area, and the Upper Kiamichi River Wilderness Area, all in the Ouachita National Forest. Requires that such wilderness study areas be administered so as to maintain their presently existing wilderness character. Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Arkansas shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Arkansas which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Arkansas reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Arkansas without express congressional authorization."
