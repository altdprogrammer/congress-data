Makes it unlawful for any person to manufacture or import armor piercing ammunition. Allows for: (1) the manufacture or importation of armor piercing ammunition for the use of the United States or any State or local government; and (2) manufacture for the sole purpose of exportation. Establishes a licensing fee of $1,000 per year for manufacturers and importers of armor piercing ammunition. Imposes an additional mandatory sentence of not less than five years for any person who uses or carries a firearm and is in possession of armor piercing ammunition during the commission of a violent felony. Provides that such sentence shall not be suspended nor probation nor parole granted."
