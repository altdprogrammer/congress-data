States that the summary plan description requirement may not be met solely with statements directing the reader to consult the text of an employee benefit plan. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to assess civil penalties against a plan which violates such requirement. Prescribes procedures for the submission and investigation of complaints which allege violations of the summary plan description requirement."
