    "text": "Environmental Programs Assistance Act of 1983 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (Administrator) to develop a program, through grants or contracts, designed to assist Federal, State, and local environmental agencies in carrying out projects of pollution prevention, abatement, and control. Provides that such program may include projects such as: (1) air monitoring and emission testing; (2) pesticides inventory and control; (3) water quality and supply sampling and monitoring; (4) technical libraries and public information projects; (5) carcinogenic surveys and followup; (6) hazardous materials routing surveys; (7) health screening in rural areas and among migrant workers; and (8) noise abatement and control. Directs the Administrator to: (1) submit to Congress, within 180 days after enactment of this Act a report identifying projects which serve the purpose of the program; (2) consult with representatives of State and local environmental agencies concerning ways to implement this Act; and (3) utilize the talents of older Americans available for project participation and consult with the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator of the Administration on Aging to ensure coordination with similar projects under the Older Americans Act of 1965 or the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (or under any successor statute). Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to and cooperative agreements with, public and private institutions and individuals to carry out the program under this Act. Prohibits the Administrator from making any grants to, or agreements with, any State or local environmental agency for any activities which would take the job of any agency employee or impair any existing contract for services. Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator for FY 1984 through 1988 to carry out the administrative provisions of this Act. Provides that environmentally related programs described under this Act shall be eligible for funding made available through title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965 and title III of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (or the corresponding provisions of any successor statute)."
