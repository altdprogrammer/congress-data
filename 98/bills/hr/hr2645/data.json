Requires the Secretary of the Interior to exchange federally owned \"exchange lands\" for non-Federal lands of equal value, within the boundaries of the recreation area. Requires the Secretary to make periodic progress reports in the Federal Register on such land exchanges. Terminates the exchange authority ten years after the enactment of this Act. Provides that lands identified for exchange but not exchanged by such date shall be retained by the Government, as part of the recreation area. Requires Federal and State agencies and instrumentalities which construct any project recommended in the study entitled \"Metropolitan Atlanta Water Resources Management Study\" (June 1, 1982) which adversely affect the Bowman's Island tract to mitigate such effects, upon request by the Secretary. Requires such mitigation to be provided by payment to the Federal Government of up to $3,200,000. Directs the Secretary to use such funds to acquire replacement lands. Increases the amount of funds which may be used for land acquisition for the recreation area. Extends the time period within which the Secretary must develop a general management plan for the recreation area. Sets forth requirements for the notification of the Secretary and Congress by any Federal agency which undertakes or is connected with an action within the land corridor adjacent to the banks of the Chattahoochee River which may have a direct and adverse effect on the natural or cultural resources of the recreation area. Establishes the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area Adivsory Commission to advise the Secretary regarding the management and operation of the recreation area, the protection of resources within the area, and the priority of lands to be acquired within the area. Terminates the Commission ten years after the enactment of this Act."
