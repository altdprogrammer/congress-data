Authorizes all Federal departments and agencies to establish or cooperate with other levels of government or the private sector in establishing programs and activities for the training and education of such personnel. Establishes in the National Science Foundation (NSF) a special Engineering and Science Personnel Fund to promote and develop the quality of U.S. technical, engineering, and scientific personnel resources. Authorizes the NSF to expend funds through a system of 50-50 matching grants with other private or public sector sources. Terminates the Fund after five years. Requires the NSF to report to Congress at least biennially on expenditures from the Fund. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984-1988."
