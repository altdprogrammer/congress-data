    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1984-10-10", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) National Fisheries Marketing Council Act of 1984 - Establishes a National Fisheries Marketing Council to: (1) prepare and submit to the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) an annual marketing and promotion plan and an annual Council budget; (2) maintain accounting records and other records and prepare reports for the Administrator; (3) receive and report to the Administrator complaints of assessment requirement violations; and (4) reimburse the Administrator for the actual costs of the collection and enforcement of assessments. Provides for regional representation on the Council. Requires each annual marketing and promotion plan to try to: (1) increase the demand for fish; (2) expand the marketing, promotion, and use of fish; and (3) improve the dissemination of data collected by consumer education, research, and other marketing and promotion activities. Requires the Council's annual budget to allocate funds among the fishing regions represented on the Council and to allocate funds for national marketing and promotion and Council administration. Sets forth the duties of the Administrator. Requires the Administrator to order receivers and importers whose fish purchases amount to $500,000 or more during the twelve months preceding October 1, 1987 to pay an assessment equal to .2 percent of the price of fish: (1) sold by a harvester to a receiver; or (2) imported by an importer. Authorizes the Council to increase or decrease the rate of assessment. Permits receivers and importers to be exempted from the assessment if the Administrator determines that a petition for exemption is signed by receivers and importers who handle over 50 percent of the volume of fish in a segment of the fishing industry. Prohibits any representative of such segment of the fishing industry from serving on the Council. Prohibits the Council from taking action to benefit such segment of the fishing industry. Provides for judicial review of petitions for exemption. Establishes in the Treasury a Fisheries Marketing Fund to be used to pay for the Council's annual marketing and promotion plan and annual budget. Sets forth the sources of the Fund's appropriations. Requires the Administrator, within 90 days before October 1, 1987, to: (1) identify any importer or receiver with fish purchases of $500,000 or more within a specified period; (2) identify any person who catches fish for commercial purposes if within 30 days before the survey starts such person registers with the Administrator and provides evidence of certain quantity of fish sales within a one year period; and (3) initiate a survey of such importers, receivers, and commercial fishermen who have not been exempted from the assessment to determine whether the Council shall continue. Terminates the Council within 90 days of the survey if the continuation of the Council is disapproved by such importers, commercial fishermen, and receivers whose relative value of fish imported, caught, and sold collectively equals or exceeds 35 percent of the total value of fish imported sold and purchased by all persons surveyed during the period ending 30 days before the date on which the survey is initiated. Permits such surveys to be taken every two years if specified conditions are met. Provides for enforcement of this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to make such investigations as necessary to carry out this Act and to determine whether violations of this Act have occurred. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to require, if the Secretary of Commerce determines that vessels of a foreign nation have exhibited a consistent pattern of serious violations of U.S. fishery laws, that: (1) any vessel of such nation which has been cited for a serious violation and is seeking a fishing permit in a fishery conservation zone shall be boarded and inspected by an authorized U.S. fishery enforcement officer before beginning such fishing; (2) each such vessel shall have a U.S. observer on board while fishing within the fishery conservation zone; and (3) each such vessel shall be boarded and inspected by a U.S. fishery enforcement officer upon completion of fishing in the fishery conservation zone. Permits rescission of such requirements when the Secretary of Commerce deems it appropriate taking into account compliance of such foreign vessels with U.S. fishery laws. Authorizes the United States Section, in the administration of the North Pacific Fisheries Act of 1954, to: (1) initiate multinational symposia and provide other forums to exchange scientific information concerning all fishery stocks of the North Pacific; and (2) initiate a review of multinational cooperative development plans for North Pacific fishery stocks. Authorizes appropriations to fund such activities."
