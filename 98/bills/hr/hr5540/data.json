Declares tribal members to be eligible for all Federal services and benefits furnished to federally recognized tribes without regard to the existence of a reservation for such Tribe or the residence of tribal members on such a reservation. Makes the Act of August 12, 1954, inapplicable to the Tribe and restores all rights and privileges diminished by such Act. Precludes the restoration of hunting, fishing, or trapping rights. Declares the tribal membership roll to be open. Prescribes procedures to determine eligibility for enrollment. Includes listing in the Tribe's Census Roll of 1940 among specified enrollment criteria. Grants the franchise to tribal members who are 18 years old. Establishes an Interim Council to govern the Tribe until a constitution and by-laws have been adopted by a majority vote. Directs such Council to draft and distribute a proposed constitution and by-laws. Sets 30 percent of those entitled to vote as the minimum vote required for the adoption of a constitution and by-laws. Provides for the election of tribal officials after the adoption of a constitution and by-laws. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to accept specified lands in trust for the Tribe in Coos County and Curry County, Oregon, if such lands are offered to the Government free of purchase cost. Prohibits the Secretary from accepting a certain parcel until: (1) one year after enactment of this Act; and (2) final adjudication of certain lawsuits concerning the lands. Grants the State of Oregon civil and criminal jurisdiction over the reservation in accordance with specified Federal law."
