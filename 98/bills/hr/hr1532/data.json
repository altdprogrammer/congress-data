Authorizes any person required by a foreign nation to disclose confidential business information to apply to the Commission for a protective order. Grants the Commission authority to issue such an order upon specified findings. Provides that no sanction for nondisclosure imposed by a foreign nation shall be enforceable in a U.S. court if such nondisclosure was permitted by rule of the Commission. Establishes civil penalties for any violation of a rule or order promulgated under this Act."
