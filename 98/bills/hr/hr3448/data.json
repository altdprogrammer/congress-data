    "text": "Hostage Relief Act Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Hostage Relief Act of 1980 to define \"hostage period\" to mean a period determined by the Secretary of State. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a savings fund for the pay of an American hostage who remains in a captive status for 30 days or more. Authorizes payment of medical and health care expenses of any individual who is an American hostage or a family member of such individual to the extent the care: (1) is incident to the individual being a hostage; (2) is not covered by insurance; and (3) is not covered by other Governmental medical or health programs. Authorizes payment of certain educational expenses of a spouse or child of an American hostage. (Current law requires that such expenses be paid.) Specifies the method and duration of such payments. Authorizes payment of certain educational expenses of a hostage to the extent not authorized by any other law. Extends certain benefits of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 to \"individuals who are placed in captive status during a hostage period.\" (Current law extends such benefits to \"American hostages\".) Repeals a provision which applies to a hostage taken in Colombia. Repeals provisions which excludes from income tax compensation paid to hostages during the hostage period and which exempts from income tax hostages who die as a result of captivity. Sets forth the method of determining whether a person is hospitalized as a result of captive status for purposes of postponing tax deadlines under such Act. Deletes the title referring to the treatment of the hostages in Iran. Authorizes the President to provide a payment to any American hostage or to the surviving spouse or dependent of any American hostage who dies in captive status."
