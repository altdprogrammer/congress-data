Designates certain lands in the Allegheny National Forest, Pennsylvania, as the Allegheny National Recreation Area. Directs the Secretary to administer the national recreation area in accordance with the following objectives: (1) protection of fish and wildlife habitat; (2) protection of watershed and free flowing streams; (3) conservation of certain values; and (4) development of privately owned oil, gas, and mineral resources subject to conditions for the protection of the area. Directs the Secretary to require a plan of operations for oil, gas, or mineral development activities. Requires such plan to provide for adequate reclamation. Directs the Secretary to prepare a management plan for the national recreation area. Presents guidelines for the plan. Permits hunting and fishing in accordance with Federal and State laws within the boundaries of the national recreation area. Requires the Secretary to consult with the appropriate State fish and game department before implementing any regulations. Withdraws the minerals in all Federally owned lands within the national recreation area from all forms of appropriation and disposition under either mining laws or mineral leasing laws. Directs the Secretary to file maps and legal descriptions of the wilderness and national recreation areas with specified congressional committees. States that the RARE II final environmental statement shall not be subject to judicial review concerning the national forest system lands in Pennsylvania. States that the wilderness designation under this Act is not a congressional intent to create buffer zones around such wilderness area."
