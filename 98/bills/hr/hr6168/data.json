Permits a depository institution and retail banking customer to agree in writing to a greater period of time if special circumstances are involved. Declares that the regulations promulgated under this Act shall require each depository institution to: (1) notify each of its retail banking customers, in writing, of the applicable time limitations on the right to draw on items received for deposit in the customer's account; and (2) keep posted in a conspicuous place at each branch a notice which substantially sets forth such applicable time limitations."
