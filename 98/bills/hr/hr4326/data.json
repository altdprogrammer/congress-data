    "date": "1983-11-08", 
    "text": "Public Assistance Amendments of 1983 - Part B - Amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Social Security Act to authorize any State having an approval plan under part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of title IV of such Act to establish and conduct one or more pilot projects to demonstrate the use of integrated service delivery systems for human services programs in the State. Requires the integration of service delivery systems for human services programs in any State under a pilot project to include: (1) the development of a common set of terms; (2) the development for each applicant of a single comprehensive family profile; (3) the establishment of a single resources directory; (4) the development of a unified budget; (5) the implementation of unified planning; (6) the consolidation of agency locations; (7) the standardization of purchasing procedures; (8) the creation of communications linkages among agencies; (9) the development of uniform application procedures; and (10) any other procedures determined desirable by the Secretary. Requires a State interested in such a project to apply to the Secretary of Health and Human Services within six months of enactment. Directs the Secretary to: (1) approve between three and five projects (including at least one project which will be operated on a statewide basis); and (2) pay to each State with an approved project 90 percent of the State's costs during the projects first 18 months, 80 percent in the following 12-month period, and 70 percent for the next 12-month period. Defines \"human services program\" to include AFDC, title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act, the Federal food stamp program, and any other Federal or federally assisted program (other than a program under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973) which provides assistance based on need or income or which is designed to help in an emergency or a crisis. Requires reports from participating States. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress. Directs the Comptroller General to evaluate the effectiveness of the projects and report the results to Congress. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to publish regulations under which any State which is currently participating in the AFDC program, the Medicaid program (title XIX of the Social Security Act), and the food stamp program and which desires to conduct a demonstration project designed to demonstrate the use in the AFDC program of rules, procedures, and specifications which are the same as those in either or both of the other two programs may apply to the Secretary to conduct such a project. Directs the Secretary to approve no more than five of the applications. Provides that a project shall be conducted for no longer than three years, except that the Secretary may approve a two-year extension. Authorizes a State conducting a demonstration project to develop for the three programs: (1) a common set of terms and definitions; (2) uniform application and eligibility determination procedures; (3) a unified budgeting process; (4) a single-family case file; and (5) a common administrative structure. Provides that expenses incurred in carrying out a demonstration project shall be considered to be expenditures either as AFDC payments under an approved State plan or for the administration of such plan. Requires reports from participating States to the Secretary and the submission of the final report to Congress along with the Secretary's findings and recommendations. Exempts under the AFDC program a women who is pregnant from registering for work training and employment if her child is expected to be born within three months. Authorizes a State to take into account changes in family composition, income, resources, and other circumstances which increase the financial need of a family when determining the eligibility of an AFDC family which has received a nonrecurring lump sum of income. Provides for the direct reimbursement of AFDC recipients for transportation and day care costs attributable to participation in community work experience programs, to the extent that the State is unable to provide such services. Excludes from an AFDC family's resources burial plots, funeral agreements, and real property which the family is making a good-faith effort to sell. Waives the requirement imposed on a State to seek recovery of an AFDC overpayment made to a former AFDC recipient, if recovery costs would equal or exceed the amount of the overpayment. Permits a State to make AFDC protective payments for a child in cases where an applicant, recipient, or relative refuses to cooperate with the State in seeking employment, assigning other support rights to the State, determining paternity, and obtaining support payments. (Under current law, a State is required to make AFDC protective payments for a child in such cases.) Makes ineligible for AFDC for three years any alien whose sponsor was a public or private agency, unless the State determines that the sponsor no longer exists or cannot meet such individual's needs. Revises the formula for determining the maximum number of hours per month of work required in a community work experience program. Permits disclosure of information concerning AFDC applicants and recipients to a law enforcement officer, if the officer demonstrates that the information is necessary to apprehend a fugitive felon. Establishes the payment schedule for the reimbursement of certain back claims due the States for expenditures under certain Social Security Act provisions."
