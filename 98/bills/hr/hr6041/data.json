Makes such prohibition applicable to: (1) gasoline retailers offering unleaded and leaded gasoline for sale at the same time at the same retail outlet; and (2) refiners, distributors, or resellers offering unleaded and leaded gasoline at the same time under the same conditions of sale. Prohibits, effective January 1, 1986, any person from selling, offering to sell, or introducing into commerce, for use as a fuel for any motor vehicle any gasoline which contains more than 0.1 grams per gallon of lead or lead additives. Makes violators of such prohibitions subject to specified civil penalties under Clean Air Act provisions for regulation of fuels."
