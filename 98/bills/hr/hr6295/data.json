Provides for financial sanctions for States with error rates exceeding certain levels. Permits waivers of the sanctions in certain instances. Defines \"error rate\" as the ratio of erroneous payments to total payments. Defines \"erroneous payments\" as: (1) payments to ineligible families; (2) overpayments to eligible families; and (3) underpayments to eligible families. Directs the Secretary to study and to report to Congress concerning: (1) the nature of AFDC client errors; and (2) measures of a States' performance under the AFDC program which are broader than the current quality control system based on payment accuracy alone. Provides, with respect to title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Act, for the continuation of certain regulations relating to Federal liability when the error rate in the payment of federally administered State supplementation exceeds national standard."
