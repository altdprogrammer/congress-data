    "text": "Progressive COLA Act of 1984 - Limits the percentage of any automatic cost of living adjustment (COLA) that an individual may receive under certain Federal entitlement programs based on the ratio of that individual's benefits to the program's maximum rate of benefits, whenever such ratio exceeds 40 percent. Prescribes a formula for determining each individual's allowable COLA. Defines a covered entitlement program to exclude any assistance program based on need and to include: (1) the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System; (2) the retirement pay system for the uniformed services; (3) the retirement salary system for U.S. justices and judges; (4) the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance program; (5) the railroad retirement program; and (6) the Federal workers' compensation programs. Requires the President to issue and maintain a comprehensive list of all covered entitlement programs."
