Declares that a design approval shall be considered to be a license for the purpose of such Act. Requires the Commission to establish procedures for an additional ten-year renewal of such a design approval. Requires the Commission to establish procedures, standards, and criteria permitting the approval of a site or sites for one or more utilization or production facilities for industrial or commercial purposes for a period of ten years. Authorizes the Commission, after a determination that a proposed site is suitable, to issue a permit which shall be considered to be a license. Requires the Commission to establish procedures for a ten-year renewal of site permits. Requires that before issuance of construction and operating licenses: (1) an opportunity be provided for public hearings; and (2) the applicant establish competency to construct and operate the facility in conformity with the application. Requires the holder of a license to notify the Commission of the proposed date of initial operation at least nine months before commencement. Directs the Commission to adopt regulations establishing criteria to govern all modifications of Commission regulatory requirements. Declares that the Commission, in making any determination under this Act, need not consider or reconsider any issue that has been resolved in any other proceeding under this Act, in the absence of significant new information substantially affecting the conclusions reached in the other proceeding. Title II: Technical and Conforming Amendments - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to conform to the provisions of this Act."
