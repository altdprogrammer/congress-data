    "text": "Patent, Trademark, and Copyright Protection Act of 1984 - Title I: Patents - Makes liable for infringement any person who, without authority, imports into or sells or uses within the United States a product made in another country by a process patented in the United States. Entitles the patent owner to recover actual damages and the infringer's profits. Title II: Unfair Practices in Import Trade Regarding United States Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to declare unlawful as an unfair practice in import trade the importation of articles into the United States or their sale which violates the rights of holders of U.S. patents, trademarks, and copyrights. Requires the U.S. International Trade Commission to conclude any investigation of such practices within six months (12 in a more complicated case). Title III: Trademarks - Establishes criminal penalties for trafficking or attempting to traffic in a counterfeit trademark in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States. Authorizes civil suits as well, with a successful claimant entitled to treble damages or treble defendant's profits, whichever is greater. Sets forth court jurisdiction and authorities. Title IV: Computer Software - Amends the copyright law to extend copyright protection to computer software. Continues for copyright holders any protections under State trade secret law which are not equivalent to any of the exclusive rights under the copyright law."
