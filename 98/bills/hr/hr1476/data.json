    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criteria for the imposition of the death penalty for Federal crimes. Requires a separate sentencing hearing before a jury, or the court upon motion by the defendant, when the defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense for which death is a possible penalty. Provides that no presentence report shall be prepared in such cases. Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, without regard to the rules of evidence. Specifies mitigating and aggravating factors. Requires the jury to determine by majority vote whether the aggravating factors sufficiently outweigh the mitigating factors to justify the death sentence. Authorizes the court to sentence the defendant to death upon such a determination or to impose another authorized sentence. Provides that the sentence in any case in which the death penalty is authorized shall be appealable by either party. Limits the circumstances under which the offense of delivering defense information to aid foreign governments is punishable by death. Allows the death penalty to be imposed for the murder of foreign officials and for an offense of kidnapping resulting in the death of the person. Eliminates the death penalty for the crime of rape. Makes it a Federal crime to kill a Government employee holding a level one position of the Executive Schedule."
