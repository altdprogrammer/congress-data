    "text": "Health Insurance for Unemployed Workers Act of 1983 - Permits States to establish and regulate reinsurance pools providing three or more qualified pool health options for unemployed individuals. Requires each State reinsurance pool to offer three or more health plan options to any unemployed individual and his family, at a monthly rate which is discounted from the average premium amount. Authorizes the State insurance commissioner or other official having jurisdiction over group health plans to be responsible for establishing and overseeing the operation of the pool. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to certify whether a State reinsurance pool meets all the stipulated requirements. Allows for private reinsurance pools in States which do not establish a State reinsurance pool. Directs the Secretary to carry out the duties of the State insurance commissioner in such instances. Directs the Secretary to establish a Federal pool in States where there is no State or private reinsurance pool. Waives participation in a pool by any group health plan provider which extends coverage under a group plan for covered employees after involuntary termination or layoff, at a level equal to or surpassing the minimum extended coverage required by a qualified pool health plan. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to disqualify for income tax deductions an employer's premium payments to any group health plan that does not provide coverage according to this Act. Requires qualifying group health plans to provide for the continuation of health insurance coverage following an employee's involuntary severance. Makes qualified unemployed individuals in States without pool health plans eligible to enroll in the hospital insurance program and in the supplementary medical insurance program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. Directs the Secretary to establish expedited enrollment procedures. Provides for conversion from such Social Security coverage to pool health plan coverage. Provides for Federal contributions to reinsurance pools when the national unemployment rate exceeds seven and one-half percent and the individual State's unemployment rate is equal to 110 percent of the national rate for the previous six months."
