Directs the Secretary of Labor to determine, when promulgating occupational health standards dealing with toxic substances or harmful physical agents, whether: (1) a particular standard will substantially reduce employee health risks; (2) such standard will threaten the competitive stance of the regulated industry; (3) engineering or work practice controls are readily available for use in the regulated industry; and (4) such controls can achieve the compliance levels established for the regulated industry."
