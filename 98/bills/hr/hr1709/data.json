Extends the scope of such offense to include: (1) using or carrying a firearm during commission of any felony over which the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction; or (2) using or carrying illegally any firearm in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce during commission of any crime punishable by more than one year's imprisonment. Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to a minimum term of five years' imprisonment for a first offense (currently, one to ten years) and to a minimum term of ten years for a second or subsequent offense (currently, two to 25 years). Extends to first offenders the requirement, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose concurrent sentences. Prohibits granting parole to such offenders."
