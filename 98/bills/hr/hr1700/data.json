Permits such interim dumping only if the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that: (1) there is no other technologically feasible method of disposal or treatment; or (2) any such method is more dangerous to human health than ocean dumping. Exempts from such prohibition any substance which is rapidly neutralized in the marine environment. Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to place similar prohibitions on the land disposal of liquid hazardous waste. Requires the Administrator of EPA to notify Congress within two years of those liquid hazardous wastes which can only be land disposed. Authorizes Federal agencies to dispose of liquid hazardous wastes by means other than ocean dumping or land disposal."
