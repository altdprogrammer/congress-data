    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on the Judiciary with amendment, H. Rept. 98-156 (Part III)) Federal Trade Commission Authorization Act of 1983 - Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to revise the definition of unfair act or practice to include any act or practice that causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers. Stipulates that such a \"substantial injury\" be not reasonably avoidable by consumers and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition resulting from the act or practice. Permits the court to review certain cease and desist orders made by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Limits the authority of the FTC to find a method of competition unfair if, in any action under the Sherman Act, such method would be held to constitute State action. Authorizes the FTC to issue notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to any unfair or deceptive act or practice or false advertisement, only if it has issued two or more cease and desist orders or it believes a pattern of unfair and deceptive acts or practices or false advertisement exists. Extends the civil investigative demand procedures to the FTC's antitrust authority. Prohibits the FTC from studying, investigating and prosecuting agricultural cooperatives for certain conduct. Limits the authority of the FTC to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices engaged in by professionals in a particular State if such exercise of authority would invalidate certain State licensing and professional standards laws. Provides for Congressional review and veto of final rules promulgated by the FTC. Makes any such rule effective unless a concurrent resolution of disapproval is introduced within 35 days after the rules submission to Congress, and such resolution is adopted by both Houses within 90 days of the rule's submission. Permits any interested party to institute an action in U.S. district court to question the constitutionality of the congressional veto provision. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984-1986. Prohibits the FTC from intervening in the proceedings of any Federal or State agency without first notifying specified congressional committees at least 60 days in advance, or as soon as practicable."
