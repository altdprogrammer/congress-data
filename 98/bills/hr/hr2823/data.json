Repeals the establishment of the Mishak National Wildlife Refuge under such Act. Requires that the Secretary of the Interior establish such project according to engineering plans as modified by the plans shown in the Fish and Wildlife Plan dated June 1982. Provides that the maintenance of the Alamosa National Wildlife Refuge and the Blanca Wildlife Habitat Area shall be second on the priority list for the supply of water from the project. Prohibits the amount of project salvaged water delivered to the refuge and the habitat area from exceeding 5,300 acre-feet annually. Permits private lands required for permanent project facilities, at the option of the United States, to be acquired by fee title."
