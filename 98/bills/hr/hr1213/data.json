    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Public Lands and National Parks Act of 1983 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to convey specified land within the Effigy Mounds National Monument in Iowa in exchange for land adjacent to the monument which shall be added to it. Increases the authorizations of appropriations for land acquisition for: (1) the Cape Cod National Seashore in Massachusetts; (2) the Cape Lookout National Seashore in North Carolina; (3) the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in Michigan; and (4) the Congaree Swamp National Monument in South Carolina. Increases the authorization of appropriations for the development of essential facilities for the Congaree Swamp National Monument. Increases the maximum authorization of appropriations allowed for land acquisition and development with respect to Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial in Ohio. Amends the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation Act of 1972 to increase from $100,000,000 to $120,000,000 the borrowing authority of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation. Authorizes appropriations for the Corporation's operating and administrative expenses for FY 1984 through 1988. Prohibits significant changes in the development plan for the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Area and significant actions by the Corporation which relate to housing, any major structure, historic preservation, office space, or retail uses within the development area for 30 days after notice of any such changes or actions have been submitted to specified congressional committees, unless within such time period each such committee notifies the Corporation that it does not object to such changes or actions. Requires the Corporation to transmit to Congress an estimate, for each fiscal year, of the additional funds needed to carry out the development plan through FY 1990. Requires the Corporation to report annually to the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on: (1) its actions to protect and enhance the significant historic and architectural values of structures under its jurisdiction; and (2) actions and issues relating to historic and architectural preservation in the upcoming fiscal year. Provides for the conveyance by the United States of its reverter and reserved mineral interests in certain lands in Florida to the State of Florida in exchange for conveyance to the United States of marketable title to other specified land in Florida. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, immediately upon receipt by the United States of such title to such land, to convey such land to Florida, but with the mineral rights and a right of reverter in such land to be held by the United States. Provides that the conveyance limitation under the Color of Title Act (which limits conveyances under such Act to a maximum of 160 acres) shall not apply to any patent claim filed under such Act for a specified parcel of land (described as Saint Helena Meridian) in Louisiana. Provides for the conveyance of certain Federal lands in the Sequoia National Forest in California to persons who submit written applications to the Secretary of Agriculture within five years after enactment of this Act. Revises the exterior boundaries of the San Juan and San Isabel National Forests in Colorado in order to provide for: (1) the consolidation of lands in such forests, lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management, Montrose District, and lands acquired by the Bureau of Reclamation as part of the McPhee Dam and Reservoir; and (2) more efficient administration of such lands."
