Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to make grants to local governments to assist them in developing local assistance programs for persons adversely affected by: (1) the conversion of their residential rental units to residential units offered for sale; or (2) local multifamily rental unit vacancy rates of four percent or less. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for FY 1985 through 1987. Requires the Secretary to establish a Commission on the Conversion of Residential Rental Units to study and report to Congress on the problems resulting from the conversion of residential rental units to residential units offered for sale."
