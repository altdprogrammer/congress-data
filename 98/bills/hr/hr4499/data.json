    "text": "Made in America Act - Limits the total number of new imported motor vehicles that may be introduced into interstate commerce for retail sale during any calendar year to 15 percent of the total number of new motor vehicles that were introduced into interstate commerce for retail sale during the base year. Defines the \"base year\" as the second calendar year preceding a calendar year for which such restrictions are established. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to allocate the number of new imported motor vehicles among foreign vehicle manufacturers on the basis of their respective shares of the U.S. market during the base year. Requires the Secretary to determine the limits for each calendar year at least four months before the beginning of the year. Requires the Secretary to publish the limits and the allocations for foreign manufacturers in the Federal Register. Imposes civil penalties for violations of the quantitative restrictions on imports. Requires each foreign vehicle manufacturer that produces more than 25,000 new imported vehicles that were introduced into interstate commerce for retail sales during any calendar year after 1981 to provide the Secretary with production, importation, distribution, and sale information. Terminates the quantitative limitations any time after December 31, 1990, if the Secretary finds that injury to the domestic industry has been prevented or remedied. Requires the Secretary to report annually to Congress on actions taken under this Act and on the impact of this Act."
