    "text": "Higher Education Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) (\"the Act\") to revise and extend programs under the Act. Sets forth amendments to title I of the Act, renaming such title \"Continuing and Community Postsecondary Education.\" Eliminates title I, part A provisions relating to the establishment of the Commission on National Development in Postsecondary Education. Switches title I, part B provisions for Education Outreach Programs to part A and revises such provisions. Decreases the portion of funds for Education Outreach Programs which is required to be used for State allotments from 90 to 50 percent. Increases the portion of such funds which is required to be available for Federal discretionary grants from ten to 40 percent. Requires that each State use no more than 15 percent (currently, no less than 15 and no more than 20 percent) of its allotment for Education Outreach Programs to conduct comprehensive statewide planning. Revises the formulas (based on a range of appropriation amounts for this part) for determining when a State must use at least ten percent, and when it may not use more than ten percent, of its allotment for such purpose. Deletes provisions relating to the National Advisory Council on Continuing Education, but refers to the National Advisory Council on Postsecondary Education which is established later in this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990 to carry out Education Outreach Programs. Removes a limitation on the portion of a State allotment which may be used to carry out continuing education programs. Adds new title I, part B provisions for Literacy Training. Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants to institutions of higher education and consortia of institutions that have entered into agreements to operate literacy training programs in their own communities and in rural areas in the vicinity. Sets forth requirements for literacy training program agreements, including: (1) establishment of academic credit courses combining undergraduate training in the humanities and social sciences with experience as tutors in a literacy training program; (2) requiring students in such courses to perform at least six hours of voluntary uncompensated service each week of the academic term with a community-based or other nonprofit organization as a tutor in such organization's literacy training program; and (3) providing that such service may be compensated under the work-study program and that preference in the award of work-study assistance will be given to eligible students performing such service. Limits use of such grants for literacy training programs to covering specified program costs. Directs the Secretary, to the extent that specified funds are available, to enter into technical assistance and coordination contracts with qualified nonprofit private organizations to assist, manage, and coordinate such literacy training programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990 to carry out Literacy Training program provisions. Adds new title I, part C provisions for Federal Correctional Education Assistance. (Provides that such part shall be known as the \"Federal Correctional Education Assistance Act.\") Declares the purposes of such part to be to provide financial assistance to the States to carry out educational programs for criminal offenders in juvenile and adult correctional institutions. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990 to enable the Secretary of Education to make grants to States under such part. Allows such appropriations to remain available until expended. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to State educational agencies and grants for programs of national significance. Sets forth formulas for the allocation of funds under such part. Prohibits the use of funds for purposes inconsistent with the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. Sets forth permissible uses of grants made to States under such part, including: (1) academic programs for basic education, special education, bilingual or bicultural study, secondary school credit, postsecondary study, fine arts, recreation and health, and curriculum development; (2) vocational training; (3) library development and services; (4) teacher training; (5) educational release programs; (6) guidance; (7) supportive services; and (8) job training. Sets forth requirements for State applications for assistance under such part. Authorizes the Secretary to make, from specified reserved funds, grants to State and local educational agencies, institutions of higher education, State correctional agencies, and other public and nonprofit organizations and institutions to meet the costs of programs of national significance which the Secretary determines give promise of improving the education of criminal offenders. Sets forth provisions for payment and withholding of funds under such part. Switches provisions for a Veteran's Cost-of-Instruction Program from title IV to title I, part D. Extends such program payments to institutions of higher education through FY 1990. Retains the formula for determining institutional eligibility for such payments, but raises the minimum number of veterans who must be enrolled in undergraduate attendance at an institution before such eligibility formula applies from 25 to 100. Makes technical and conforming amendments relating to such program. Sets forth amendments to title II (College and Research Library Assistance and Library Training and Research) of the Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990 for title II programs under part A (College Library Resources), part B (Library Training, Research, and Development), and part C (Strengthening Research Library Resources). Establishes a Library Unit within the Office of Postsecondary Education which shall be responsible for administering and coordinating all library programs within the Department of Education. Revises title II, part A (College Library Resources) provisions for resource development grants. Directs the Secretary, in selecting applicants for receipt of such grants, to rate each applicant who meets specified requirements in accordance with a numerical index established by regulation and based on the following factors (to be weighed according to the order in which they are listed): (1) the extent to which the institution is in the lowest quartile of applicants with respect to its library resource holdings; (2) the extent to which the institution's own effort in support of its library exceeds a specified percentage of its operating budget; (3) the number and percentage of low- income students; (4) whether the institution is eligible under title III (Institutional Aid) of the Act; and (5) such other factors as the Secretary determines relevant and useful (not to exceed ten percent of the points awarded under such index). Requires the National Institute of Education to: (1) evaluate the use of such index in allocating such funds to eligible applicants most in need; and (2) report the results of such evaluation to Congress by May 30, 1989. Revises title II, part B (Library Training, Research, and Development) provisions for research and demonstration project grants and contracts. Directs the Secretary, in selecting recipients of such funds for FY 1986 and succeeding fiscal years, to give priority to expanding the study of the uses of information transfer and communications technology in libraries. Sets forth amendments to title III (Institutional Aid) of the Act. Adds to the definition of \"eligible institution\" for purposes of title III, part A (Strengthening Institutions) any institution of higher education which has an enrollment of which at least 40 percent are Mexican American, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or other Hispanic students, or combination thereof, and which also satisfies specified requirements for such eligibility. Revises title III, part B, renaming such part \"Strengthening Historically and Traditionally Black Colleges and Universities.\" Redefines \"part B institution\" to mean any historically or traditionally black college or university that maintains a student body that is at least 50 percent black students. Directs the Secretary to make part B grants to institutions for specified purposes, including academic instruction in disciplines in which black Americans are underrepresented. Directs the Secretary to make allotments of grants to part B institutions according to a formula based on the numbers of Pell Grant recipients, graduates, and graduates admitted to graduate or professional schools from such institutions. Sets forth reallotment provisions. Sets forth part B grant application requirements, including requirements for annual reports to the Secretary and for auditing. Sets forth provisions for grants to eligible part B independent professional or graduate institutions. Directs the Secretary, subject to the availability of funds appropriated for such purpose, to award program grants to such postgraduate institutions as may be eligible as part B institutions except that: (1) the institution offers a medical, dental, veterinary degree, or other graduate or professional degree beyond the baccalaureate degree; and (2) such independent, postgraduate institution listed under this Act is determined by the Secretary to be making a substantial contribution to the legal, medical, dental, veterinary, or other graduate education opportunities for black Americans. Limits the duration of such grants. Sets forth authorized uses of such grants. Sets forth application requirement, including a demonstration of how grant funds will be used to improve graduate educational opportunities for black and low-income students, and lead to greater financial independence. Lists the following independent professional or graduate institutions as eligible for such grants: (1) Morehouse School of Medicine; (2) Meharry Medical School; (3) Charles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical School; and (4) Atlanta University. Sets forth reporting and audit requirements. Sets forth criminal penalties for misuse of funds. Revises title III, part C (Challenge Grants for Institutions Eligible for Assistance Under Part A or Part B) provisions. Adds to institutions eligible for such challenge grants any institution which received a grant in FY 1981 or 1982 to assist health professions schools in financial distress from the Department of Health and Human Services under specified provisions of the Public Health Service Act. Adds the following provisions for endowment grants (which are similar in part to those added to the Act by the Challenge Grant Amendments of 1983, Public Law 98-95). Establishes a program to provide matching endowment grants to institutions of higher education which are eligible for assistance under the challenge grant program. Authorizes the Secretary to award such matching endowment grants from sums available under the challenge grant program. Limits the endowment grant period to not more than 20 years, during which time the institution may not withdraw or expend the endowment fund corpus (the amount of the grant plus the matching amount deposited by the institution). Permits the institution, after grant period termination, to use the endowment fund corpus plus any endowment fund income for any educational purpose. Provides that institutions may receive more than one such grant, but may only receive such a grant for two fiscal years out of any period of five consecutive fiscal years. Limits the amount of an endowment grant to an institution to: (1) not less than $50,000 for any fiscal year; and (2) not more than $250,000 for FY 1984 or $500,000 for FY 1985 or any succeeding fiscal year. Permits an eligible institution to designate a foundation, which was established to raise money for the institution, as the recipient of the endowment grant. Sets forth requirements which the foundation and the institution must meet for such an award. Sets forth requirements for investment of the endowment fund corpus and income. Permits an institution to withdraw and expend the endowment fund income to defray any expenses necessary to the operation of the college. Prohibits an institution from spending more than 50 percent of the total aggregate endowment fund income earned prior to the time of expenditure. Authorizes the Secretary to permit an institution to spend more than the 50-percent limit under specified emergency circumstances. Provides for repayment by an institution of funds withdrawn prematurely from the endowment fund corpus or improperly expended from endowment fund income. Set forth auditing requirements. Directs the Secretary, in selecting eligible institutions for endowment grants, to: (1) give priority to an applicant which is a recipient of a title III grant under part A or part B, during the academic year in which the endowment grant is applied for; (2) give priority to an applicant with a greater need for such grant, based on the current market value of the applicant's existing endowment in relation to the number of full-time equivalent students enrolled at such institution; and (3) consider the effort made by the applicant to build or maintain its existing endowment fund and the degree to which an applicant proposes to match the grant with nongovernmental funds. Sets forth provisions for endowment grant applications and approval. Authorizes the Secretary to terminate and recover an endowment grant, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, if the grantee institution fails to properly expend, invest, or account for endowment funds. Adds new title III, part D (Reservation for Hispanic Institution) provisions. Directs the Secretary to reserve at least $10,000,000 or 15 percent of appropriations for title III, part A (Strengthening Institutions), whichever is more, for Hispanic institutions as defined under part A. Switches title III general provisions from part D to part E, and revises such general provisions. Directs the Secretary to publish all policies and procedures required to exercise the authority to approve applications for grants under title III. Provides that no other criteria, policies, or procedures shall apply. Directs the Secretary to: (1) use the most recent and relevant data concerning the number and percentage of students receiving need-based assistance under title IV (Student Assistance) of the Act in making eligibility determinations under title III, part A provisions for Strengthening Institutions; and (2) advance the base-year forward following each annual grant cycle. Adds to title III general provisions relating to waiver authority. Directs the Secretary to waive specified title III requirements (including grant eligibility criteria involving an enrollment which includes a substantial percentage of students receiving title IV need-based assistance) in the case of an institution which: (1) is extensively subsidized by the State and charges low or no tuition; (2) serves a substantial number of low- and middle-income students as a percentage of its total student population; (3) is contributing substantially to increasing higher education opportunities for black Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, and low-income individuals; or (4) is substantially increasing higher educational opportunities for individuals in rural or other isolated areas which are unserved by postsecondary institutions. Revises requirements for the Secretary's annual report to Congress to exclude discussion of part B institutions and to include discussion of part D Hispanic institutions which have been determined eligible although not satisfying specified eligibility criteria involving low institutional expenditures per student. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990 for institutional aid programs under parts A, B, and C of title III. Raises the percentage of part A funds which must be made available to junior or community colleges from 24 percent to 30 percent. Requires that at least $10,000,000 or 15 percent of part A funds, whichever is more, be used for Hispanic institutions. Sets forth amendments to title IV (Student Assistance) of the Act. Renames part A of title IV \"Need-Based Student Assistance\" and revises the statement of purpose of such part. Renames subpart 1 of part A \"Pell Grants,\" thus conforming to the already renamed grants program. Extends the Pell Grants program through FY 1990. Revises the formulas for determining the amount of each Pell Grant. Declares that the purpose of the program is to provide a Pell Grant that: (1) as determined under specified provisions for the amount of such grants, will meet 75 percent of a student's tuition and fees not in excess of $3,000; and (2) in combination with reasonable parental or independent student contribution and supplemented by work-study and institutional block grant programs, will meet 80 percent of a student's cost of attendance, unless the institution determines that a greater amount of assistance would better serve the purposes of part A. Sets the amount of a Pell Grant for an eligible student at $3,000 for the award year from July 1, 1985, through June 30, 1986 (or for any subsequent award year, $3,000 plus the sum of specified inflation adjustments) minus the amount of the expected family contribution with respect to that student for that year. Retains provisions for proportional reductions or grants for part-time students. Revises the maximum limit on a Pell Grant amount. Provides that such Grant shall not exceed the sum of: (1) 75 percent of tuition, required books, and uniform compulsory fees, plus (2) a standard cost allowance for each award year, as determined by the institution. Limits such standard cost allowance to: (1) $1,200 for a student residing with a parent or guardian; (2) $1,600 for a student residing neither with a parent or guardian nor in specified institutional housing; or (3) $2,000 for a student residing in institutionally owned, operated, or subsidized housing. Prohibits any Pell Grant from exceeding the sum of such tuition, books, fees, and cost allowance minus the expected family contribution. Retains the $200 minimum limit for Pell Grant awards, but eliminates provisions for exceptions to such limit. Directs the Secretary, for each Pell Grant award year beginning after June 30, 1986, to publish: (1) the percentage change for the price index for the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which such award year begins; (2) an inflation adjustment, determined by a specified formula, for such award year, if the price index has increased by more than three percent; and (3) the Pell Grant amount in effect after taking into account each of the inflation adjustments determined. Sets forth provisions for family contributions scheduled for Pell Grants. Makes the period of student eligibility for Pell Grants five academic years, or the equivalent, but provides that no eligible student shall be precluded from receiving a Pell Grant for the first year of graduate or professional study because of such five-year limitation. Includes English instruction for individuals with limited English proficiency among those noncredit or remedial courses preparatory to pursuit of a baccalaureate degree for which Pell Grant support may be given to eligible students. Retains provisions relating to Pell Grant application procedures and the noncontractor status of institutions. Deletes certain provisions relating to insufficient available funds and to excess funds. Deletes title IV, part A provisions for Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (subpart 2) and Grants to States for State Student Incentives (subpart 3), but continues the purposes of such programs under a new Institutional Block Grant program. Switches to a new part C (Special Services) the title IV part A subparts 4 and 5 provisions for Special Programs for Students from Disadvantaged Backgrounds and Special Programs for Students Whose Families are Engaged in Migrant and Seasonal Farmwork. Deletes those subpart 6 provisions for Assistance to Institutions of Higher Education which involve certain payments to institutions of higher education, but switches to title I those provisions of subpart 6 which involve veterans' cost-of-instruction payments to institutions of higher education. Switches provisions for Work-Study Programs from title IV part C to title IV part A subpart 2, and revises such provisions. Extends through FY 1990 the authorization of appropriations for Work-Study Programs. Replaces provisions for allotment of work-study funds to States with provisions for allotment of such funds to institutions. Retains provisions for grants for work-study programs to institutions which enter into specified agreements. Deletes provisions relating to within-State distribution of assistance. Sets forth provisions relating to sources of matching funds. Provides that nothing in provisions for Work-Study Programs shall be construed as restricting the source (other than Work-Study Programs funds) from which the institution may pay its share of the compensation of a student employed under a work-study program covered by an agreement. Allows such share to be paid to such student in the form of services and equipment (including tuition, room, board, and books) furnished by such institution. Retains provisions for job location and development programs and agreements. Revises provisions for work study for community service-learning on behalf of low-income individuals and families to include literacy and other language-proficiency services. Establishes an Institutional Block Grant program, under title IV part A subpart 3, to permit institutions to make their own allocation decisions on the funding of certain student assistance programs. Declares that such Institutional Block Grant program is to permit such institutions to: (1) continue to provide supplemental grants, increase student employment, and operate institutional loan programs in a manner similar to that in which such activities were conducted prior to October 1, 1985, under the supplemental educational opportunity grant program, the State student incentive program, and the national direct student loan program; (2) capitalize a loan program to continue to use the Federal capital contribution to the national direct student loan (NDSL) program as part of the capital for the new loan program; and (3) supplement the funds available for work-study programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990 for such Institutional Block Grant program. Sets forth provisions for allotment of such block grant funds to institutions based on the amount of Pell Grants and guaranteed student loans made to students at an eligible institution. Requires that an eligible institution be allotted: (1) for FY 1986, at least the sum of the amounts such institution received for 1985, under provisions in effect prior to the start of FY 1986, for Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants, Grants to States for State Student Incentives, and the national direct student loan program (NDSL); and (2) for any succeeding fiscal year, at least 90 percent of the amount such institution received for the proceeding year under Institutional Block Grant provisions.
