    "text": "Agricultural Export Subsidy Offset Act of 1982 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish an export subsidy program under which agricultural commodities acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation through price support operations are given to U.S. exporters, U.S. processors, or foreign countries to encourage additional export sales of such commodities. Directs the Secretary to ensure that: (1) export sales of such commodities and of products of such commodities do not displace usual U.S. marketings; (2) such commodities and products are not exported to any country which is not eligible for most-favored nation treatment; and (3) such commodities and products after export are not resold or transhipped to another nation or used for purposes other than domestic purposes of such country. Requires the Secretary, if the program places U.S. processors at a disadvantage, to give to such processors the agricultural commodities acquired by the Corporation through price support operations. Terminates the Secretary's authority under this Act after December 31, 1985."
