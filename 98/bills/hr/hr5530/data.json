Rept. 98-774 (Part I)) Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to contract with a private entity for a supplemental reporting system and data center on the transportation of hazardous substances. Changes from May 1 to June 15 of each year the date for submission of the Secretary's annual report on the transportation of hazardous materials. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the feasibility, cost, desirability of and problems in implementing a prenotification system which would make available to State and local governments information concerning the timing, nature, and routing of shipments of hazardous materials. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985. Requires the Secretary and the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to evaluate programs for: (1) planning for emergency response to incidents involving the transportation of hazardous materials; (2) training for such response; and (3) compliance with and enforcement of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act."
