    "text": "Natural Gas Equal Access Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 to require a natural gas transporter, if the transporter has the capacity, to transport natural gas at a just and reasonable rate upon receipt of a written request from a natural gas producer or purchaser. Defines a \"natural gas transporter.\" Prohibits a transporter not having the capacity to fulfill a request from transporting any gas other than the minimum amount required to be transported pursuant to contracts in effect before the date of the unfulfilled request. Provides that in the case of a contract entered into by a purchaser of natural gas other than gas required to be transported as provided for above, the minimum bill under such contract and the service obligation pursuant to such contract shall each be reduced by the amount of natural gas subsequently purchased by such purchaser and transported under a required transportation arrangement. Provides that in the case of a person receiving delivery of natural gas required to be transported as provided for above on the same dates as such person is receiving delivery of other natural gas, the service classification of such other natural gas may not be changed for such dates without the prior approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Provides a defense to any civil action against a natural gas seller under either a contract for gas sales from a well begun after December 31, 1982, for such a contract which specifies a renegotiation date, or such a contract where the purchaser takes less than 50 percent of the deliverability amount for three consecutive months, if the seller: (1) under contract gives notice to the purchaser 120 days in advance that the contract is to be rescinded; (2) does not breach the contract before the end of the notice period; and (3) offers the purchaser a full release. Provides that if provisions of the Natural Gas Act exempt certain persons then any other person receiving gas from such persons shall also be exempt. Provides that in the case of any first sale between any interstate pipeline and any affiliate of the pipeline, any amount paid in any first sale shall be deemed just and reasonable if, in addition to other requirements, such amount does not exceed the lowest amount paid in comparable first sales (currently, it may not exceed the amount paid in comparable first sales) between persons not affiliated with the pipeline. Sets forth effective dates."
