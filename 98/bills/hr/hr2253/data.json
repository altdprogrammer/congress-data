    "text": "Dairy Production Act of 1983 - Title I: Dairy Compliance Program - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982, to eliminate the scheduled 50-cent milk assessments. Sets milk support levels at $13.10 per hundredweight for FY 1984 through FY 1985 for those farmers producing at or below their 1981-1982 marketing history levels. Sets forth provisions for farmers with less than full, or no 1981-1982 production levels. Establishes a reduced dairy compliance price (of up to $12.00, resulting in a blend price of not less than $12.10 per hundredweight) for overproduction as determined annually by the Secretary of Agriculture. Provides that the difference between the price support received and the reduced dairy compliance price shall be remitted to the Commodity Credit Corporation and credited to the Dairy Stabilization Settlement Fund to be used to: (1) reduce dairy program costs; and (2) make diversion payments ($10.00 per hundredweight) to farmers reducing production below their 1981-1982 marketing histories. Prohibits the transfer of marketing histories. Requires farmers to get marketing history certifications from their county committees. Provides civil penalties for program violations. Title II: Dairy Promotion Program - Provides for the creation of a National Dairy Promotion and Research Board made up of milk producers appointed by the Secretary from nominations provided by certified dairy organizations. Empowers such Board to budget, develop, and administer dairy promotion and nutrition programs. Funds such program through mandatory 15-cent per hundredweight producer assessments. Terminates such program after its initial September 30, 1985, period unless its continuation is approved by at least 50 percent of the voters in a producer referendum. Provides civil penalties for program violations. Authorizes appropriations. Stipulates that appropriated funds shall not be used to cover Board expenses."
