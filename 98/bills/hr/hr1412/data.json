    "text": "Job Retraining Act of 1983 - Amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to direct the President to take immediate action to develop and implement a national program to train workers in skills which are, or are anticipated to be, in short supply. Provides that assistance under such program shall be in the form of grants to State boards of vocational education or other State agencies designated by Governors. Permits extension of such grants only if a State plan for a five-year program of skills training has been submitted to, and approved by, the President. Authorizes the President to provide assistance in coordinating State plans and conducting skills training programs. Requires that State plans: (1) be developed with the management and workers of the industries involved and with educational institutions; (2) include workplace and apprenticeship training; (3) give meaningful opportunities for minorities and women; (4) be certified by the Governor; (5) include training, skill upgrading, and retraining of workers, in depressed areas, in surplus labor areas, or with skills which might become obsolete, in skills that are or may be in short supply; (6) consider bona fide public or private training programs eligible to apply to deliver such training services; (7) allow the State employment and training council to participate in developing, reviewing, and commenting on the plan; (8) show that alternative services or facilities will be more effective, if funded activities duplicate otherwise available services or facilities; (9) coordinate funded activities with other employment-related programs in the State; and (10) certify that specified labor training standards and requirements are met. Sets forth requirements for State contributions, from public or private sources, to carry out a State training program plan. Directs the President to act, based on recommendations by the Secretaries of Defense, Education, and Labor, upon each State plan within 90 days after receipt. Sets forth nondiscrimination provisions. Limits State plan administrative expenditures to five percent of the grant amount. Permits assistance under this Act to be used to purchase by means of competitive bidding and to install equipment for training purposes. Provides that, for purposes of installing Government-owned equipment pursuant to specified provisions of such Act, the term \"industrial facilities\" includes vocational schools, other schools offering technical and vocational training programs, and any other location in which workers are trained under this Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act for FY 1983 through 1987."
