    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #172 (288-132)) Follow Through Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 to reenact Follow Through programs (as the \"Follow Through Act\") with certain technical amendments. Authorizes appropriations for such programs for FY 1984 and 1985. Requires (currently authorizes) the Secretary of Education to: (1) provide financial assistance for research, demonstration, or pilot projects designed to develop new methods of overcoming the special problems of primarily low-income children in continuing to develop to their full potential in kindergarten and the primary grades; and (2) provide technical assistance for Follow Through programs and training for program personnel. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide for an analysis of all previous evaluations of Follow Through programs; (2) include in the next evaluative report of such programs an analysis of their impact on preschool-elementary school linkage efforts and their effectiveness in narrowing the gap in successful educational performance between children from low-income families and other children; and (3) submit such report to the President and Congress by January 30, 1985. Establishes a National Commission on Follow Through Education. Directs the Council to: (1) review all research, demonstration, and pilot projects conducted under Follow Through programs; (2) determine the most effective approaches developed through such programs that are conducive to replication on a national basis; (3) recommend Federal, State, and local actions necessary to facilitate the replication of such approaches; and (4) report to the President and Congress by January 30, 1985, on its activities and recommendations. Terminates the Commission on September 30, 1985. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 and 1985 for the Commission. Repeals provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 relating to the Follow Through program. Amends the Native American Programs Act of 1974 (title VIII of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964) to require that determinations made regarding specified financial assistance requests be made without regard to whether the agency making such request serves, or the project to be assisted is for the benefit of, Indians who are not members of a federally recognized tribe. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that each project assisted under such Act is consistent with the priorities established by the agency which receives such assistance. Prohibits disapproval of any project for assistance solely because the agency requesting such assistance is an Indian organization in a nonreservation area or serves Indians in a nonreservation area. Provides that the general authorization of programs authorized in the Native American Programs Act of 1974 shall remain within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and may not be transferred outside of such Department. Directs the Secretary of HHS to continue to administer grants under specified provisions through the Administration for Native Americans. Prohibits the Commissioner of such Administration from delegating outside such Administration any functions, powers, and duties under such provisions. Permits other delegation or authorization of redelegation of functions, powers, and duties under such Act between agencies of such Department if such funds are used for the purposes for which they are authorized and appropriated. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit interagency funding agreements between the Administration for Native Americans and other Federal agencies for the development and implementation of specific grants or projects. Requires that at least 90 percent of the funds made available to carry out the Native American Programs Act of 1974 shall be expended for financial assistance to public and nonprofit agencies for specified Native American economic developments projects."
