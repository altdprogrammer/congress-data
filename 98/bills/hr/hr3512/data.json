    "text": "Aid to Families With Dependent Children Cost Control and Management Improvement Act of 1983 - Amends part A (Aid to Families With Dependent Children) of title IV of the Social Security Act to specify that \"earned income\" shall mean the total amount of earnings prior to taking a payroll or any other deduction when used to determine income disregards. Disregards from income, for AFDC purposes, any amount received as an earned income tax credit. Authorizes a State which does not now have a plan for providing AFDC to families where the principal wage earner is unemployed to establish an experimental program under which the State must meet the present requirements for such a program, except that the State may: (1) limit aid to six months; (2) eliminate the child care deduction; (3) impose stricter work requirements; or (4) take any two or more of the above three actions. Authorizes a full-time secondary school student to receive AFDC until age 21. Exempts pregnant women in their third trimester of pregnancy from registering for manpower services, training, and employment. Makes optional with a State the present requirements of: (1) a monthly report by each AFDC family; and (2) the determination of benefits based upon the previous month's income and resources. Provides Federal funding for State supplementary payments. Authorizes a State to recalculate the period of ineligibility in any case where changes in family composition, income, resources, or other circumstances have increased the financial need of a family, in the situation where a family receives nonrecurring lump sum income. Authorizes the direct reimbursement of AFDC recipients for transportation and day care costs attributable to participation in community work experience programs. Excludes from income and resources: burial plots, funeral agreements, and real property which the family is making a good-faith effort to sell. Authorizes a State to forego seeking recovery of an overpayment if the State reasonably expects that the cost of recovery will equal or exceed the amount of overpayment involved. Grants a State agency discretion in choosing the manner of a protective payment (a payment to someone other than a child's parent). Provides for a demonstration program of five States (selected from applications submitted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services) under which a State will develop for the AFDC, food stamp, and Medicaid (title XIX of the Act) programs: (1) a common set of terms and definitions; (2) uniform application and eligibility determinations; (3) a unified budgeting process; (4) a single-family case file; and (5) a common administrative structure that allows for unified planning and evaluation. Requires reports by each State with a demonstration project. Makes any alien whose sponsor was a public or private agency ineligible for AFDC during the three years following the alien's entry into the United States, unless the sponsoring agency ceases to exist or is unable to meet the alien's needs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 in order to assist States to provide emergency shelter and related assistance to homeless individuals and families. Defines \"homeless individuals and families\" so as to include: (1) individuals and families who are without any form of regular shelter and who need emergency shelter and related assistance; and (2) individuals who have been battered or otherwise abused and as a result have found it necessary to leave their homes. Directs the Secretary to develop and publish regulations with respect to this Act. Sets forth the effective date of this Act."
