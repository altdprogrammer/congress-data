    "as": "Passed House amended",

    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Grand Ronde Restoration Act - Deems the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon one tribal unit for purposes of Federal recognition and eligibility for Federal benefits, as well as for purposes of tribal self-government, and the establishment of a tribal reservation. Extends Federal recognition to the Tribes and reinstates the tribal corporate charter issued under specified law. Applies to the Tribes all federal laws generally applicable to Indians. Renders the act approved August 13, 1954, inapplicable to the Tribes, and restores all rights and privileges which may have been diminished or lost under it. Makes the Tribes and their members eligible for all Federal services and benefits furnished to federally recognized Indian tribes regardless of the existence of a reservation. Provides that tribal members residing in specified counties will be deemed to be residing on or near a reservation for purposes of the availability of Federal services. States that the establishment of a reservation for the Tribes will not affect a member's eligibility for Federal services. Precludes the restoration of any hunting, fishing or trapping rights under this Act. Establishes an Interim Council of the Tribes to represent and govern them until a permanent governing body has convened. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) announce the date of a general council meeting to nominate candidates for election to the Interim Council; (2) hold an election by secret ballot to elect Interim Council members by a specified date; and (3) ensure that specified tribal members receive at least ten days notice of meetings and elections. Grants such Council authority to receive grants, enter into contracts, and bind the tribal governing body as successor in interest for a maximum of six months. Vests the Interim Council with responsibility for preparing the tribal constitution and bylaws including bylaws covering the election of a tribal governing body. Establishes: (1) an open tribal membership roll; (2) criteria governing membership eligibility; and (3) procedures to verify such eligibility. Directs the Secretary to: (1) enter into negotiations with the first elected tribal governing body to establish a tribal reservation; (2) develop a plan for the establishment of such reservation within a specified time; and (3) notify and consult with State and local governmental officials to avoid prejudice by the proposed enlargement of the reservation. Enumerates restrictions placed upon any tribal reservation plan developed by the Secretary. States that any reservation for the tribe shall be established by an Act of Congress enacted after the enactment of this Act."
