    "text": "Vocational Education and Community-Based Organizations Act of 1984 - Amends the Vocational Education Act of 1963 (VEA) to add as a purpose of State vocational education programs under VEA to reduce the structural unemployment of the hard-to-employ, by funding State and local proposals which: (1) develop new self-help, community-based preparation programs that provide prevocational, motivational, attitudinal, and basic skills training necessary for existing vocational and technical training schools; (2) assist in providing adequate prevocational preparation targeted to the inner-city youth, the non-English-speaking barrios, the Appalachian hollows, and other urban and rural pockets of poverty; and (3) provide for cooperation between self-help community-based organizations of demonstrated effectiveness and existing vocational and technical training institutions. Includes self-help community-based organizations of demonstrated effectiveness among those groups to be represented in: (1) the membership of State and local advisory councils on vocational education; (2) participating in the formulation of State five-year plans for vocational education; and (3) the membership of the National Advisory Council on Vocational Education. Requires States, in considering the approval of applications for vocational education funds under VEA, to give priority (along with other priority factors) to those applicants that make proposals which contribute to the purpose added by this Act and which provide for career intern programs of demonstrated effectiveness, utilize intermediary organizations with a record of demonstrated effectiveness in developing cooperative partnerships with business and industry and vocational education institutions, or improve the basic skills of prevocational students. Allows any eligible recipient of funds under VEA that is a self-help community-based organization to appeal to the Secretary of Education any final action of the State with respect to any application for funds under VEA. Requires expeditious determination of such appeals. Allows VEA basic grants to States to be used to provide vocational education support services by self-help community-based organizations for programs which contribute to carrying out the goals added by this Act and which provide for career intern programs of demonstrated effectiveness, utilize intermediary organizations with a record of demonstrated effectiveness in developing cooperative partnerships with business and industry and vocational education institutions, or which improve the basic skills of prevocational students. Allows VEA grants to States for program improvement and supportive services to be used for research and demonstration programs which contribute to the goals added by this Act and which provide for career intern programs of demonstrated effectiveness, utilize intermediary organizations with a record of demonstrated effectiveness in developing cooperative partnerships with business and industry and vocational education institutions, or which improve the basic skills of prevocational students. Requires that at least ten percent of each State's allotment, and ten percent of funds for program improvement and supportive services, be used to pay up to 50 percent of the cost of programs, services, and activities which contribute to the goals added by this Act and which provide for career intern programs of demonstrated effectiveness, utilize intermediary organizations with a proven record in developing cooperative partnerships with business and industry and vocational education institutions, or which improve the basic skills of prevocational students. Includes self-help community-based organizations under the VEA definition of \"eligible recipient.\" Gives examples of the types of programs and organizations referred to in this Act. Authorizes appropriations in such sums as are necessary to carry out the VEA for FY 1985 through 1989."
