    "text": "Full Employment Work Opportunity Act - Directs the Secretary of Labor to make grants to local governing boards to assist local job projects to employ unemployed individuals. Defines \"eligible area\" (for purposes of receiving funds under this Act) as a county or comparable unit of local government as designated by the Secretary after consultation with affected officials in each State. Requires that the populatio of such an eligible area not exceed 300,000, but authorizes the Secretary to waive this requirement. Directs each eligible area to establish a local governing board composed of: (1) two members (who are not members of the same political party) appointed by the State Governor; and (2) 11 members appointed by local governments within the eligible area, including representatives from major political parties, labor organizations, business management, and education. Directs the local governing board to: (1) select a manager for job projects, in accordance with criteria prescribed by the Secretary; and (2) determine the job projects to be assisted, after receiving recommendations from and subject to the Secretary's approval. Makes an individual eligible for job project employment only if such individual has been unemployed for at least 30 days. Prohibits job project employment of more than two individuals from the same household. Requires that preference in selection for job project employment be given to: (1) honorably discharged veterans; and (2) individuals from households in which no one is employed. Requires that job project wages equal the higher of the minimum wage under: (1) the Fair Labor Standards Act; or (2) the applicable minimum wage law. Restricts job project employment to not more than 32 hours per week. Prohibits eligibility for unemployment compensation during, or on the basis of, job project employment, but otherwise requires that job project employees be provided benefits and employment conditions comparable to those provided to others employed in similar occupations by the same employer. Limits the number of supervisory employees to ten percent of those on any job project. Permits such supervisors: (1) to be selected without regard to eligibility requirements; and (2) to receive wages in excess of the rate determined for other employees. Requires each job project to be of limited duration and to be directed to the completion of a specific objective. Requires each job project to maintain an evaluation file for each employee. Requires that the file be made available to the employee monthly, but not be available to any other person without the employee's consent. Requires that the employee be afforded the opportunity to discuss any matter contained in or omitted from the file. Directs the President, within 60 days after enactment of this Act, to appoint a task force to plan for the coordination of job projects assisted under this Act with welfare and unemployment compensation programs. Requires that such task force include representatives of the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services and of labor organizations and business management. Directs the task force to report to Congress within one year after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish and appoint a 13-member national advisory council to oversee and make recommendations on: (1) job projects assisted; (2) the type of jobs to be provided; and (3) a comprehensive list of the type of projects the local governing board shall consider. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1989."
