Sets forth the procedure for issuing a temporary control order. Authorizes the Attorney General to exempt certain compounds, mixtures, or preparations from control. Provides that persons who dispense controlled substances shall obtain from the Attorney General a registration for a period for not more than three years. Allows the Attorney General to deny, suspend, or revoke a registration if such registration is inconsistent with the public interest. Establishes authority for the Attorney General to take control of drugs when a registration expires or a registrant ceases doing business in the manner the registration contemplates. Requires registrants to notify the Attorney General of a change of address. Raises the penalties for criminal offenses involving manufacturing or distributing schedule II nonnarcotic substances. Makes it a Federal offense to knowingly obtain controlled substances by use of an expired registration number. Authorizes the Attorney General to assist State and local governments in suppressing the diversion of controlled substances from legitimate medical, scientific, and commercial channels. Provides for forfeiture of controlled substances possessed in violation of such Act. Amends the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to allow the Attorney General to authorize the importation of certain narcotic raw materials (opium, poppy straw, and coca leaves) necessary for medical or scientific purposes. Revises the importation requirements for narcotic and nonnarcotic substances. Makes changes in the registration requirements for importers and exporters of controlled substances. Allows the Attorney General to deny, revoke, or suspend a registration taking into consideration the public interest and international obligations. Makes it unlawful to export controlled substances from the United States without the required proof that the export does not violate the law of the importing country."
