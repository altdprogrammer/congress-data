    "text": "Elementary School Guidance and Counseling Incentive Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize appropriations: (1) for FY 1984 through 1988 for comprehensive elementary school guidance and counseling programs, supplemental grants to States for such programs and research and demonstration programs; (2) through FY 1988 for employment of one new and/or additional elementary guidance counselor per school district, evaluation of programs, and in-service counselor training; and (3) for teacher and counselor centers. Provides formulas, based on the population of elementary school children, for determining allotments to States for such programs. Directs the Assistant Secretary of Elementary/Secondary Education to administer State allotments and State plans through the Office of Guidance and Counseling of the Department of Education. Requires that each State, to be eligible for such allotments, submit to the Assistant Secretary a State plan for providing comprehensive elementary school guidance and counseling programs for a five-year period, with necessary annual revisions, which meets such criteria as the Assistant Secretary may by regulation prescribe. Sets forth required provisions of such plans and programs. Provides for appeal by a State of a final action of the Assistant Secretary to a circuit court of appeals. Authorizes the Assistant Secretary, through the Office of Guidance and Counseling, to make supplemental grants to States with approved plans for distribution to local educational agencies and for support of State agency leadership activities on the basis of statewide needs and priorities in elementary school guidance and counseling. Sets forth approved uses of such grants. Directs the Assistant Secretary to carry out a research and demonstration program relating to elementary and secondary school guidance and counseling. Directs the Assistant Secretary to make an annual evaluation report to the appropriate congressional committees. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to include training for counselors under the teacher centers program. Provides for a program of in-service training for elementary school guidance counselors. Requires the designation of professionally trained counselors: (1) at the Federal level, to provide information on, and to administer, such programs; and (2) at the State, local school district, and intermediate administrative unit levels, to supervise such programs."
