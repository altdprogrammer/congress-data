Directs the Administrator to establish a small business computer security and education program to provide: (1) computer security and technology information to small business; (2) periodic forums for small businesses to assist them in improving their knowledge of computer security; and (3) training opportunities to educate small business users on computer security techniques. Allows the SBA, without expressly endorsing a particular profitmaking organization's product or service or utilizing any one profitmaking organization in a marketing area, to make use of such organizations in providing training to small businesses with respect to computer security. Sets forth specified actions which shall be included in such training to small businesses. Requires the SBA, not later than December 1, 1987, to report to the Committees on Small Business of both Houses on the impact of such assistance being provided in cooperation with such profitmaking organizations. Terminates such assistance by the SBA on October 1, 1988."
