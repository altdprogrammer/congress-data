    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue leases of up to 99 years within the El Portal administrative site adjacent to Yosemite National Park in California to any individual, to any concessioner, or to any public or private corporation or organization for purposes of providing community facilities, administrative offices, maintenance facilities, and commercial services in addition to the employee housing already authorized under current law. Permits subleases in the cases of concessioners, corporations, or other organizations. Provides that the proceeds from such leases may be credited to the appropriation for the costs of administering the leases and for construction and maintenance costs within the El Portal administrative site. Authorizes the Secretary to contract for the management of the leases and of the leased premises and for the use of any improvements to such property for purposes of the El Portal administrative site or for the Park. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire the unexpired term of any lease or sublease issued under this Act. Requires the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees, concurrent with regulations governing the issuance of leases under this Act, a summary report on the El Portal administrative site, including existing and projected lease arrangements, along with a timetable for the consequent removal of specific facilities in Yosemite National Park. Requires the Secretary to submit to such committees an annual fiscal year report for a period of ten years on the development of the site and on the progress in the removal of such facilities from the park."
