States that the United States will assert its sovereignty in such zone subject to international freedoms of the high seas. Directs the Secretary of State to: (1) enter into marine research agreements with coastal States; and (2) submit research requests to the appropriate States. Requires: (1) Federal agencies to report to the President regarding programs affected by such zone's establishment within 12 months; and (2) the President to submit a comprehensive report to Congress within 18 months. Title II: Exploration for, and Exploitation of, the Mineral Resources of the Exclusive Economic Zone, Outer Continental Shelf, and Deep Seabed - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to redefine \"Outer Continental Shelf\" to include a distance of 60 nautical miles from the foot of the continental slope. Renames the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act the Deep Seabed Mineral Resources Act. Eliminates specified references to the Law of the Sea Treaty. Terminates the prohibition on issuing permits for new commercial recovery activities (presently prohibited through January 1, 1988). Authorizes appropriations through FY 1987. Renames the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Removal Tax Act of 1979 (Internal Revenue Code) the Deep Seabed Mineral Removal Tax Act of 1979. Eliminates references to an international deep seabed treaty, including a treaty-related tax termination date imposed on the removal of mineral resources. Requires the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce to issue a memorandum of understanding regarding certain mining operations on both the outer continental shelf and the deep seabed. Title III: Fishery Conservation and Management - Amends Federal law to state that the United States shall exercise sole fishery management authority (except with regard to highly migratory fishes) within the exclusive economic zone."
