Authorizes the Administrator, upon application of the city of San Diego, to issue a permit which modifies specified requirements under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to permit the discharge of pollutants from any ocean outfall constructed with Federal assistance under this Act if such pollutants have received primary or more advanced treatment. Provides that such permits shall not be effective after December 31, 1993. Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator to make such grants for FY 1985 and succeeding fiscal years."
