    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Education and Labor with amendment, H. Rept. 98-77) Amends the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978 to revise definitions and purposes. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, subject to appropriations, to make grants for defraying, at the determination of the tribally controlled community college, expenditures for the operation and maintenance of the college (including administrative, academic, and educational programs.) Requires that grant applications include a description of recordkeeping procedures for the expenditure of funds. Directs the Secretary to establish a program of grants to tribes and tribal entities for planning and development of proposals for the establishment of tribally controlled community colleges, or for determining the need and potential for such colleges. Directs the Secretary to reserve a specified amount from appropriations for title I of the Act to make such planning grants available to as many as five approved applicants. Revises provisions relating to technical assistance contracts. Replaces requirements for \"feasibility studies\" with requirements for \"eligibility studies\". Reduces the percentage of title I funds which may be used to carry out such studies. Revises formulas for determining the amount of each grant to a tribally controlled community college on the basis of the \"Indian student count\" at such colleges. Prohibits the alteration of grant amounts under this Act because of funds also received under the Snyder Act. Prohibits denial of Snyder Act funds because of funds received under this Act. Provides that any Indian student who receives a student assistance grant from the Bureau of Indians Affairs (BIA) for postsecondary education shall be deemed to have received such assistance under the Pell Grants program of the Higher Education Act of 1965, for purposes of such Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through FY 1987 to carry out provisions for: (1) technical assistance contracts; (2) grants to tribally controlled colleges; and (3) construction of new facilities. Provides for a transition to the forward funding method of timing appropriation action. Revises provisions for grant adjustments. Directs the Administrator of General Services to: (1) study facilities available for use by tribally controlled community colleges; (2) report study results to the Congress by September 30, 1984; and (3) in consultation with the BIA, conduct a program of renovation, alteration, repair, and reconstruction of BIA facilities. Directs the Secretary to provide grants for construction of new facilities for any tribally controlled community college for which the report of the Administrator of General Services identifies such a need. Sets forth requirements for eligibility and for the college's share of such construction costs. Authorizes the Secretary to waive such requirements. Directs the Secretary to establish a program of endowment grants to tribally controlled community colleges which are current recipients of specified assistance under the Act or under the Navajo Community College Act. Sets forth agreement requirements for receipt of such endowment grants. Sets forth provisions for the use and allocation of such endowment grant funds and for compliance with a matching funds requirement. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 to carry out such endowment grant program. Amends the Navajo Community College Act to extend the authorization for construction funds through FY 1987."
