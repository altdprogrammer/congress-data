Makes dumping site designations by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandatory. Includes the following factors in dump site selection: (1) waste types and quantities; (2) detoxification ability of site water; (3) importance of the site to the surrounding biological community; and (4) effects on human health and adjacent ecosystems. Requires consultation with the Secretary of the Army. Requires the Administrator at appropriate sites to: (1) monitor the effects of the dumping; and (2) make three-year dumping estimates. States that the Administrator shall close a site or limit dumping as necessary, upon consultation with the Secretary. Requires the Administrator or the Secretary to impose on permittees any special provisions deemed necessary to minimize the harm from dumping, including measures to find alternative disposal methods, eliminate contaminants, or recycle such materials. Makes permit processing fees mandatory. Directs the Administrator and the Secretary to establish quality assurance programs to ensure the validity, accuracy, and sufficiency of information submitted with permit applications. States that the Administrator and the Secretary shall adhere to the requirements of the London Dumping Convention that are binding upon the United States. Sets forth transitional provisions, including \"grandfathering\" (with certain exceptions) specified dumping sites from amendments under this Act. Defines \"monitoring\" for purposes of such Act. Amends the definition of \"ocean waters\" to include \"subjacent areas.\" Establishes criminal penalties for the knowing falsification of information or tampering with testing devices required by this Act. Grants jurisdiction to U.S. district courts to issue writs of mandamus to compel the Administrator to designate dumping sites. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984. Directs the Administrator to establish and submit to Congress a dumping designation schedule within 180 days. Requires separate annual reports to Congress by the Administrator and the Secretary."
