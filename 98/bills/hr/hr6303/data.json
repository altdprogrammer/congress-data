    "text": "Osage Tribe of Indians Technical Corrections Act of 1984 - Makes technical corrections to a certain Act relating to the Osage Tribe of Oklahoma. Prohibits the transfer by an Osage Indian of any headright interest (an individual share in the Osage mineral estate) to a non-Osage Indian. Prohibits non-Osage Indian persons from receiving any headright interests other than a life estate. Prohibits the devise or inter vivos transfer of any interest in a headright to any person which is not an individual. Provides for Osage Tribe payments of fair market value to individuals who would have received a remaining interest under a will or trust but for their non-Osage status. Prohibits the sale or transfer of headrights by non-Indian owners without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. Subjects to certain rights of purchase among Osage Indians: (1) the remaining interests in a headright of any deceased non-Osage who had held a life estate; or (2) the sale of any headright interest by a non-Osage. Authorizes the use of income from the Osage mineral estate for the purchase of any headright offered for sale to the Osage Tribal Council if certain conditions are met. Construes the term \"Osage Indian\" to include any child properly adopted by an Osage Indian, and any of such child's lineal descendants. Exempts Osage Indians under guardianship or conservatorship from the requirement of having their wills acknowledged and subscribed in the presence of a district judge. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to approve any settlement regarding the will contest of an Osage Indian if the contested property falls under such Secretary's jurisdiction. States that certain property interests placed by an Osage Indian decedent into a testamentary trust for Indian beneficiaries without a certificate of competency may only have the Secretary of the Interior appointed as trustee. States that only a bank or trust institution may serve as trustee for non-Indian beneficiaries of such property. Precludes adopted children who are not Osage Indians from inheriting as collateral heirs of an Osage Indian decedent any property interests held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior."
