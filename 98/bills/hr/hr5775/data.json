Extends through FY 1988 the VA's program for the treatment and rehabilitation of veterans suffering from alcohol or drug abuse dependencies or disabilities in halfway houses and other community-based programs. Expands the amount of authorizations available for the research and education activities of VA geriatric centers. Extends from FY 1986 through 1991 the authorization of appropriations for grants to States for veterans' homes. Eliminates the restriction on the percent of appropriations under such grant program which may go to one State."
