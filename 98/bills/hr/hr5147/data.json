Directs the Secretary of State (the Secretary) to act for the United States under such agreement. Directs the Secretary to appoint a U.S. representative to a specified international Council. Applies the Fisherman's Protective Act of 1967 to the seizure of a U.S. vessel by a party to such Agreement for a violation of such Agreement within an Agreement area, unless the Secretary makes a specified determination. States that the seizure of a U.S. vessel by a party to such Agreement shall not constitute a seizure under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act if such seizure is consistent with such Agreement. Requires disposition into the Treasury of fees collected under Article III of such Agreement. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to issue regulations to carry out such Agreement and this Act. Sets forth specified prohibited activities for persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction, including: (1) fishing for designated tuna within an Agreement area without an authorized license; (2) violation of regulations; and (3) failure to keep certain records. Establishes civil penalties for committing such prohibited activities, and subjects catches resulting from such prohibited activities to forfeiture. Sets forth the enforcement authority for this Act, including the issuance of warrants. Establishes such authority as the joint responsibility of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating, the Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Customs Service. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to designate enforcement officers. Provides for the disposal, or stay of disposal, of any species of tuna seized pursuant to a court order under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
