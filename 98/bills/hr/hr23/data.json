States that for FY 1983 and 1984 the parity price of milk shall be determined as of October 1 of each such marketing year.

Allows an applicant to appeal a State committee's marketing base decision only to the Secretary of Agriculture.

Requires reports to Congress on both studies. Sets milk support levels at not less than 75 percent of parity beginning in FY 1985. Restores existing price support provisions beginning with FY 1985. Repeals specified provisions of this Act on specified dates.
