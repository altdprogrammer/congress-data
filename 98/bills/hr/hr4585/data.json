Establishes an Office of Environmental Quality Management Fund to receive advance payments from other agencies or accounts that may be used solely to finance: (1) study contracts that are jointly sponsored by the Office and one or more other Federal agencies; and (2) Federal interagency environmental projects (including task forces) in which the Office participates. Provides that any study contract or project that is to be so financed may be initiated only with the approval of the Director of the Office. Requires the Director to promulgate regulations setting forth policies and procedures for operation of the Fund. Revises the area authorized for acquisition for the establishment of the Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge in Louisiana to include any additional lands and waters adjacent to the boundaries on the February 1980 map of such refuge which the Secretary of the Interior considers appropriate for inclusion."
