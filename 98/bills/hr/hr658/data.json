    "text": "Social Security Disability Benefits Equity Act of 1983 - Prohibits: (1) the termination of disability benefits under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act on the basis of continuing disability investigations; and (2) the collection of disability benefits overpayments made on or after May 1, 1982, to benefit recipients determined to be no longer entitled to benefits on the basis of continuing disability investigations. Exempts from such prohibitions those cases where a disability benefit termination or a determination that benefit payments are overpayments is based on: (1) a finding that the individual involved is able to engage in substantial gainful activity; (2) a finding of fraud; or (3) a scheduled review of which such individual was notified at the time of his or her entitlement. Amends title II of the Social Security Act to permit a disability insurance beneficiary who has been found to be no longer entitled to disability benefits to elect to have such benefits continued until the disability determination has been affirmed or overturned on appeal. Provides that benefits paid pursuant to such an election shall be considered overpayments if the decision on appeal affirms the determination that the individual involved is no longer entitled to benefits."
