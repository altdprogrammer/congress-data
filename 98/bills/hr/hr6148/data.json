    "text": "Health Spa Consumer Protection Act - Declares the purpose of this Act to be to protect the public from fraudulent, misleading, unscrupulous, and deceptive practices in the health spa industry. Requires any health spa owner or operator (seller), before any membership contract is executed, and before the seller collects any membership fees from the prospective health spa member (buyer), to: (1) provide the buyer with a copy of the membership contract for review; (2) orally inform the buyer of the buyer's rights to review and cancel the contract and of the conditions under which such rights may be exercised; and (3) obtain the buyer's acknowledgement of such oral notice by signature. Voids any membership contract and any renewal in excess of two years. Sets forth provisions that must be included in each membership contract. Requires the buyer to provide written notice in order to cancel the contract. Requires the seller to include a notice of cancellation in each membership contract which the buyer may detach and send to the seller. Sets forth registration and bonding requirements that must be met before any membership contract in a covered health spa may be sold. Makes any waiver by the buyer of any requirement of this Act unenforceable and any contract containing any such waiver void as against public policy. Sets forth enforcement procedures when a seller fails substantially to comply with the requirements of this Act. Declares that the rights and remedies provided under this Act are in addition to any other rights and remedies relating to the validity or enforceability of any contract or obligation. Sets forth exclusions to the provisions of this Act. Makes this Act effective with respect to any membership contract executed or renewed on or after August 10, 1984."
