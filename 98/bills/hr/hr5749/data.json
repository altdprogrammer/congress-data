    "text": "Secondary School Basic Skills Act - Establishes a program of grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) having especially high concentrations of children from low-income families to enable such agencies to provide more effective instruction in basic skills for economically disadvantaged secondary school students. Defines \"basic skills\" to include reading, writing, and mathematics computational proficiency as well as comprehension and reasoning. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1990. Makes certain amounts of such appropriations available for specified activities and types of grants under this Act. Makes a secondary school eligible to receive assistance under this Act for program grants only if 20 percent or more of children aged 14 to 17, inclusive, who are enrolled in such school are counted under LEA basic grant provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as modified by the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA). Requires that funds made available under this Act for program grants be used to develop new approaches to, and carry out, educational services and activities designed specifically to raise the basic skills of low achieving disadvantaged children. Authorizes the Secretary of Education, through the National Institute of Education (NIE) and from specified funds appropriated for program grants for FY 1985 through 1990, to make grants to LEAs, institutions of higher education, and other public agencies and nonprofit private organizations. Provides that such grants shall be made to such entities on behalf of and for the purpose of assisting eligible secondary schools to develop, implement, and carryout new approaches to achieving improved basic skills instruction of low- achieving economically disadvantaged secondary school students. Sets forth application requirements. Requires that the application be made on behalf of the eligible school by: (1) the LEA; or (2) an institution of higher education, public agency, or private nonprofit organization if such entity will provide educational services or conduct educational activities subject to the proposal. Requires applicants to assure their participation in a national evaluation. Requires that administrators and teachers in the eligible school participate in the preparation of the proposal. Requires that the appropriate State educational agency (SEA) review and comment on the application before submittal to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to assure that: (1) eligible applicants represent various geographic regions of the country, including both rural and urban secondary schools within those various geographic regions; and (2) at least one demonstration grant is made in each State in each fiscal year, unless no applications are received from a State. Requires each LEA which desires to receive program grants under this Act to file with the Secretary an application containing specified assurances. Provides that each LEA and each institution of higher education, public agency, and private nonprofit organization applying on behalf of an eligible secondary school may receive payments for any fiscal year in which it files an application with the SEA. Sets forth requirements for such applications. Requires consultation with parents and teachers of low-achieving economically disadvantaged secondary school students in program design and implementation. Establishes a National Secondary School Basic Skills Panel in NIE to: (1) identify successful model programs; and (2) advise the Secretary with respect to specified aspects of program grant applications and proposals. Directs the Secretary, through NIE, to annually conduct a national evaluation of the effectiveness and the implementation of program grants. Requires that such assessment results be submitted to Congress and disseminated to SEAs, LEAs, State legislatures, and Governors. Directs the Secretary, through NIE, to monitor grants and coordinate activities under this Act with other research activities conducted by NIE and through the Office of Educational Research and Improvement. Authorizes NIE, once program grants are awarded, to provide eligible recipients with technical assistance. Prohibits the Secretary from disapproving an LEA application without affording notice and opportunity for a hearing. Directs the Secretary to make payments as expeditiously as possible after approval of applications. Prohibits any grant from being made with respect to any eligible secondary school for more than two fiscal years unless there is: (1) an improved performance of the targeted secondary school students at the school on a State approved basic skills test; or (2) a decrease in the dropout rate at the school. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations relating to such prohibition."
