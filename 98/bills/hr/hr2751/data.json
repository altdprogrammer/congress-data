Includes the Director of such Institute on the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities. Requires members of the National Council on the Arts and the Humanities to serve after the expiration of their terms until their successors take office. Increases the authorization of appropriations for the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts for FY 1984. Amends the Museum Services Act to eliminate the Secretary of Education from the National Museum Service Board. Reduces from eight to seven the number of Board members required to make a quorum. Increases the authorization of appropriations for the Institute of Museum Services for FY 1984. Repeals the previous authorization levels set for the endowments and the Institute by the Omnibus Education Reconciliation Act of 1981. Establishes a National Medal of Arts to be awarded by the President to nominees of the National Council on the Arts for outstanding contributions to the excellence, growth, support, and availability of the arts in the United States. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a 30 year agreement with the college of Santa Fe, Sante Fe, New Mexico, to provide and improve facilities for cooperative educational arts programs with the Institute of American Indian Arts. Directs the Secretary, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, to study the need and feasibility of establishing a museum facility for the Institute and to report to Congress by February 1, 1985, on such study. Sets forth requirements concerning possible land set-asides for such facility which would involve no cost to the Federal Government."
