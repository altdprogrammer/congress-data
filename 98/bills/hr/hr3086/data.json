    "text": "United States Marshals Service and Witness Security Reform Act of 1983 - Title I: Protection of Government Witnesses - Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the Attorney General to relocate and protect witnesses and their families involved in Federal or State trials of violent offenses. Authorizes the Attorney General to take action to protect the person from bodily injury or otherwise to assure the health, safety, and welfare of that person. States that the Attorney General shall not protect any person where the risk of danger to the public in the proposed community of relocation outweighs the need for that person's testimony. Requires the Attorney General to establish guidelines defining the types of cases which constitute \"violent offenses.\" Requires any person protected under this Act to enter into an agreement with the Attorney General. Requires the agreement to set forth such person's responsibilities, including agreement: (1) if an actual or potential witness, to provide information to all appropriate law enforcement officials and to testify in all proceedings; (2) to refrain from committing any act punishable by a prison term; (3) to take all necessary steps to avoid detection by others of the facts concerning the protection provided; and (4) to cooperate with all reasonable requests of government employees. Establishes a procedure for the termination of protection upon substantive breach of such agreement. Provides for service of process on a protected person and compliance with a judgment in a civil proceeding. Establishes within the United States Treasury a Victims Compensation Fund. Funds the trust fund, in part, with fines received from prosecution of racketeering offenses. Directs the Attorney General to promulgate guidelines for the administration of the fund. Requires all Federal agencies to cooperate with the Attorney General in carrying out this Act. Allows the Attorney General to agree with a State government to provide protection for a person. Title II: United States Marshals Service and Service of Process - Revises the United States Marshals Service System. Authorizes the Attorney General to appoint a director and other officials. Specifies the powers and duties of the Service. Grants an official of the Service the same powers that a State sheriff may exercise. Prescribes the schedule of fees that the Service may collect."
