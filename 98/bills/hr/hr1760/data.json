    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-03-02", 
    "text": "Natural Gas Consumer Regulatory Reform Amendments of 1983 - Title I: Purchased Gas Cost - Amends the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 to prohibit, until 1986, the guaranteed passthrough to natural gas customers of price increases resulting from an interstate pipeline paying more for its gas, unless the pipeline applies to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for an increase and such application is approved. Directs the FERC to permit recovery if the costs sought to be recovered were just, reasonable, and prudently incurred. Title II: Removal of Wellhead Price Control and Repeal of Jurisdiction Over Certain First Sales - Provides for the removal of price controls on all first sales of natural gas by January 1, 1986. Repeals FERC jurisdiction over all interstate sales of committed or dedicated natural gas, as of January 1, 1985. Repeals provisions permitting the President or Congress to reimpose price controls. Title III: Transitional Price and Contract Provisions - Sets forth transitional pricing provisions establishing price limits which terminate upon the removal of all price controls. Grants purchasers subject to a take-or-pay contract the right to refuse volumes in excess of 70 percent of available deliverability. Authorizes either party to a contract for the first sale of natural gas which was in effect as of enactment to terminate the contract beginning January 1, 1985, provided the terminating party: (1) gives notice as specified; (2) does not materially breach the contract prior to the end of the notice as specified; and (3) offers the other party a release from all future duties and obligations. Sets forth the obligations of parties upon termination. Provides that no price escalator clause can operate to establish a price for natural gas higher than the gas cap price (a price used in determining maximum price during the transitional period). Title IV: Removal of Impediments to Interstate Movements of Gas - Revises provisions relating to interstate and intrastate sales and transportation to: (1) authorize the FERC to permit any interstate pipeline to transport natural gas on behalf of any person; (2) authorize the FERC to permit any intrastate pipeline or local distribution company to transport natural gas on behalf of any person; and (3) authorize the FERC to permit any pipeline or local distribution company to sell natural gas to any pipeline or local distribution company. Authorizes the FERC to permit any pipeline or local distribution company to assign surplus gas to any other pipeline or distribution company. Provides that interstate pipelines and local distribution companies shall not be subject to FERC jurisdiction on the basis of their buying natural gas in certain \"covered transactions.\" Directs the FERC to order any interstated pipeline, upon application by a producer of natural gas or by a purchaser of natural gas from a producer, to carry gas under contract between producer and purchaser upon such terms and subject to such conditions as it considers just and reasonable if the Commission finds that the pipeline has the available capacity. Provides that the consideration for such carriage shall be five cents per million Btu's plus the cost of such transportation. Title V: Repeal of Certain Restrictions on Natural Gas and Petroleum Use Pricing - Amends the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 to repeal: (1) prohibitions on the use of natural gas and petroleum as a primary energy source in new electric powerplants and new major fuel-burning installations; (2) the prohibition on the construction of new powerplants without alternate fuel capability; (3) the authority of the Secretary of Energy to prohibit the use of natural gas in certain boilers used for space heating; (4) the prohibition on the use of natural gas for decorative outdoor lighting; and (5) the authority of the Secretary to restrict increased uses of petroleum by existing powerplants. Repeals the incremental pricing provisions of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978."
