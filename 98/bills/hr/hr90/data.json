    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to pay an employee training to be an air traffic controller at the employee's basic pay rate for training hours exceeding 40 hours a week. Prohibits the reduction or termination of the annuity or retired or retainer pay of a civil service annuitant or a former member of the uniformed service who is temporarily reemployed by the Department of Defense to serve as an air traffic controller or to train others to be controllers during a period when there is an unusual shortage of controllers. Permits the Secretary to pay premium pay to: (1) certain employees directly involved in the operation and maintenance of the air traffic control system; (2) specified flight test pilots; (3) certain controllers who are not required to be certified to perform duties, including the control of air traffic, but who are so certified; (4) controllers assigned to provide on-the-job training in the control of live air traffic; and (5) any controller or flight service training specialist required to work the fourth through sixth hours of an eight-hour day without a meal break. Exempts such employees from provisions limiting premium pay for Federal employees."
