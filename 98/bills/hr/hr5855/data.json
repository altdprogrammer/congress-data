    "text": "Atomic Bomb Fallout Compensation Act of 1983 - Establishes a Federal tort claims procedure for cancer related nuclear fallout from Nevada bomb tests. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish a list of radiation related cancers. Requires the Secretary of Energy to publish charts giving average environmental exposure levels for geographic areas subjected to radioactive fallout resulting from open air atomic bomb tests at the Nevada test site between 1951 and 1962. Makes Federal data available for discovery by a party in an action for cancer related to nuclear fallout from the Nevada tests. Authorizes a court to make in camera inspections of certain exempt Federal data. Sets formulae for the calculation of damages where a certain probability of causation has been established. Makes this Act the exclusive remedy for radiation-related cancer caused by nuclear fallout from the tests. States that recovery under this Act is in addition to rights and benefits available under other Federal programs. Sets a statute of limitations. Exempts funds awarded under this Act from any liability for Federal, State or local income taxes. Sets a ceiling upon fees which attorneys may collect for actions brought under this Act. Establishes criminal penalties for violations of such ceilings."
