Sets forth information that shall be included in the agreement, including the requirement that: (1) assistance provided by the Bank shall be directed at improving employment opportunities and enhancing the economic development of the geographic and economic sectors of Mexico which are the major sources of undocumented Mexican nationals who enter the United States; and (2) the United States and Mexico contribute equally to the Bank. Directs the President to appoint the U.S. Directors of the Bank. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, upon the United States entering into an agreement with Mexico to establish the Bank, to subscribe to the capital stock of the Bank. Authorizes appropriations to pay for such subscription. Requires that the provision of the Bretton Woods Agreement Act that establishes the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems shall apply to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund. Prohibits any person or agency on behalf of the United States, unless authorized by Congress, from: (1) agreeing to an increase in the U.S. subscription to the Bank; (2) agreeing to an agreement which increases U.S. obligations or which would change the Bank's purpose or functions; or (3) providing financing to the Bank."
