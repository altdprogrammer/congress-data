Makes such exemptions inapplicable upon a determination by the Secretary of the Treasury that the exchange of information between the United States and a foreign country is inadequate to prevent income tax evasion. Excludes from the gross estate of a nonresident alien for purposes of the estate tax, any interest eligible for the income tax exemption under this Act."
