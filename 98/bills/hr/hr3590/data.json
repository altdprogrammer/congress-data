Prohibits coverage for the expenses, in any 12 month period, of routine monitoring of a cardiac pacemaker or pacemaker lead in excess of six transtelephonic monitorings, or in excess of four monitorings at a physician's office. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Administrator of the Food and Drug Administration, to provide for a registry of all cardiac pacemaker devices and pacemaker leads for which payment under title XVIII was made. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on diagnosis-related group type reimbursement for physicians' services related to cardiac pacemaker device implantation."
