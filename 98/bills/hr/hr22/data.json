    "text": "Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended by the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981, to set milk price support levels at: (1) $13.10 per hundredweight for FY 1983 and 1984; and (2) the percentage of parity which $13.10 represents as of October 1, 1984, for subsequent fiscal years. States that the price of milk shall be supported through milk and milk products purchases. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to provide for a FY 1983 through 1985 one dollar per hundredweight proceeds deduction to be remitted to the Commodity Credit Cororation (CCC) to help offset milk support costs. Prohibits such offsets unless estimated fiscal year purchases would be more than 5,000,000,000 pounds. Divides the refunds of such offset between producers reducing their commercial marketings (85 percent) and dairy promotion programs (15 percent). Sets forth refund provisions. Grants U.S. district courts jurisdiction to enforce provisions and restrain violations of this Act. Provides civil penalties for such violations. Provides for domestic and foreign donations of dairy products. States the policy of Congress to be to carry out a coordinated program of dairy products promotion in order to strengthen and expand the industry's domestic and foreign positions. Authorizes the Secretary to issue, amend, or suspend dairy promotion orders (with due notice and hearing). Authorizes the Secretary, by dairy products promotion order, to establish a National Dairy Promotion Board made up of dairy farmers to promote dairy products. Requires approval of a proposed promotion order by a producer-referendum. Finances such Board through dairy producer assessments. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth permissive and required promotion order terms. Provides for certification of milk producer organizations (under this Act) by the Secretary. Sets forth certification requirements. Provides for cooperative association representation. Sets forth enforcement and related investigative provisions."
