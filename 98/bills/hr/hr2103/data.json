    "text": "Capital Construction and Employment Act of 1983 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 and succeeding fiscal years to carry out this Act. Allocates such funds equally among the States whose Governors submit plans meeting specified requirements. Directs the Secretary of Labor to prescribe a schedule for plan submission. Requires that funds under this Act be used only for wage and benefit payments to employees working on specified public works projects. Requires that, of those employed on any such project, at least: (1) 85 percent have been unemployed for at least the preceding ten weeks; and (2) 75 percent are residents of areas which had an average rate of unemployment of nine and one-half percent during the preceding 12 months. Requires that any project specified in the plan be: (1) for construction or reconstruction of a public facility important to the State economy or general welfare; and (2) in a location which will benefit residents of areas with an unemployment rate described above, through employing such residents and promoting economic growth in such area. Requires that funds under this Act be used to supplement, not supplant, funds from non-Federal sources for such projects. Permits States to supplement, with funds from non-Federal sources, the wages and benefits paid with funds under this Act. Limits the rate of individual wages paid under this Act to between $7,000 and $15,000 per year. Requires that the Governor's coordination and special services plan under the Job Training Partnership Act include provisions for State employment service agency maintenance of current information on job opportunities under this Act and referral of eligible individuals to those opportunities. Sets forth program labor standards relating to conditions of employment and training, health and safety, workers' compensation benefits, and job benefits and working conditions. Prohibits displacement of any currently employed workers by participants in programs funded under this Act. Prohibits the creation of jobs in a promotional line that will infringe in any way on the promotional opportunities of currently employed individuals. Requires recipients of funds under this Act to provide the Secretary with assurances that none of such funds will be used to assist, promote, or deter union organizing. Requires that an opportunity for comment be provided for any labor organization representing a substantial number of employees engaged in similar work or training in the same areas as those proposed to be funded under this Act. Requires States to report annually to the Secretary on each project specified in their State plans. Requires that copies of such reports be transmitted to the Congress upon receipt."
