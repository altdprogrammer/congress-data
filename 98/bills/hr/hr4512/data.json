    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-11-18", 
    "text": "Consumer Products Energy Efficiency Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to provide that a labeling rule applicable to a consumer product covered under such Act shall require the disclosure, in any printed matter displayed or distributed at the time of sale of such product, of information which is required under such Act to be disclosed on the product's label or in advertising related to such product. Requires the Federal Trade Commission to require a manufacturer of a covered product to which a labeling rule applies to disclose in any of its advertisements the information which is required to be disclosed on the product's label. Requires that such disclosures be made in a manner likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. Requires the Secretary of Energy to make available to consumers comparative guides of each type and class of covered products, indicating its energy efficiency and annual operating cost. Directs the Secretary to prescribe energy standards for water heaters, central air conditioners, and furnaces, which shall be no less than the median energy efficiency for each type of product for 1980 and which shall be based upon test procedures prescribed by the Secretary. Includes as factors to be considered by the Secretary in doing a cost-benefit analysis with respect to an energy efficiency standard: (1) the effect of such standard on the promotion of domestic production; and (2) the effect of such standard on the reduction of unemployment and the improvement of the economy. Requires that the Secretary's annual report on the energy conservation program for consumer products include information on the percentage of covered products which are imported and on the percentage of components of covered products which are imported. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe energy efficiency standards for covered products if the Secretary determines, among other factors, that an improvement of 20 percent or more in the energy efficiency of the products is technologically feasible. (Under current law, it must be determined that a substantial improvement in the energy efficiency of a product is technologically feasible before the Secretary may prescribe such standards.) Revises the factors which the Secretary must consider in determining whether a performance-related feature of a covered product justifies the establishment of a higher or lower energy efficiency standard for such product. Requires the Secretary to prescribe a combined average energy efficiency standard for each of the types of covered products under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Provides that if the average energy efficiency of the total number of a type of covered product made by a manufacturer or marketed by a private labeler are determined to meet the combined average energy efficiency standard for such type, such manufacturer or labeler shall be treated as meeting the applicable energy efficiency standard for the 12-month period beginning with the date of such determination. Requires the Secretary to issue a guideline for improvement in the energy efficiency for a type of covered product for each of the following five years if no standard is prescribed for such product. Requires the Secretary to monitor such improvements and to prescribe an energy efficiency standard whenever a type of product fails, for three consecutive years, to achieve at least half of the improvement under such a guideline."
