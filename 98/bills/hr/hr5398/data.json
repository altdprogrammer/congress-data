Revises the formula for the reimbursement of administrative expenses to State and local agencies who monitor educational institutions attended by GI bill veterans to increase such allowance. Increases the subsistence allowance rate under the vocational rehabilitation program. Title II: Veterans' Employment in Civil Service - Extends veterans' readjustment appointments in the Federal Government up to and including the GS-11 level (currently fixed at GS-7). Grants a Vietnam veteran so appointed and terminated within the year the same right of appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board as is held by a career or career-conditional employee during the first year of employment. Extends such appointments through FY 1987 (currently through FY 1984). Requires the Office of Personnel Management's annual report to Congress on veterans' readjustment appointments to breakdown by agency the number and grade of appointments, the number converted to career or career-conditional appointments, and the number and categories of causes of termination. Requires such report to breakdown such information for all veterans, with a separate breakdown for veterans of the Vietnam era who are disabled. Title III: Miscellaneous - Amends the Emergency Veterans' Job Training Act of 1983 to extend from 60 to 90 days the duration of a certificate issued by the Administrator of Veterans Affairs for an eligible veteran's presentation to an employer offering a job training program under such Act. Extends the availability of FY 1985 appropriations through FY 1987. Terminates such job training assistance for applications after May 29, 1985, or for programs beginning after September 1, 1985."
