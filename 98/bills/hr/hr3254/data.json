Requires the Administrator of EPA to cooperate and collaborate with the Secretary of State, Secretary of Agriculture, and the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in identifying overseas pesticide use patterns on food crops exported to the United States. Requires the Administrator to prepare an annual report summarizing such information. Requires that information on pesticide exports be kept confidential except as it must be disclosed to comply with reporting requirements. Requires an official of an importing nation to be informed of: (1) the nature and severity of any unreasonable adverse effects on the environment identified by the Administrator in the course of considering the regulatory status of the pesticide; (2) the fact that a pesticide is not registered for use in the United States and may not be sold in the United States; and (3) the availability of regulatory and scientific documents on the pesticide. Requires notice to, and an acknowledgement by, a foreign purchaser of an acutely toxic pesticide and appropriate officials in an importing nation of any acute hazards associated wtih exposure to the pesticide. Requires such acknowledgement statement to include steps to assure accessible instructions for the safe use of the pesticide. Directs the Administrator to foster the safe use of pesticides in other countries through the international exchange of information. Directs the Department of State to pursue diplomatic efforts to obtain the agreement of other exporting countries to regulate foreign pesticide sales. Prohibits the use of a temporary tolerance established as part of an experimental use permit from covering pesticide residues on imported foodstuffs, unless such tolerance was obtained in conjunction with an experimental use permit including use of a pesticide overseas. Requires the Administrator to revoke tolerances for residues associated with suspended or canceled uses of a pesticide. Authorizes the Administrator, in the case of a pesticide that is voluntarily withdrawn, to revoke a tolerance and establish a residue action level if the Administrator determines that the pesticide residue will unavoidably persist in the environment. Prohibits the Administrator from making available for public inspection any information obtained from another country or international organization if: (1) the information was obtained on conditions that it not be disclosed; (2) the information is not otherwise available; and (3) the foreign government or international organization continues to demand that the documents or information not be made available for public inspection. Authorizes the Administrator to disclose to foreign governments or international organizations certain information as long as an agreement is reached that such information will be disclosed only under specified circumstances."
