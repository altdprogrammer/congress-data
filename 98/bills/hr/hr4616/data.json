Requires each State to expend at least eight percent of such funds for developing and implementing comprehensive programs concerning the use of child restraint systems in motor vehicles. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to reduce the required expenditure for any State which demonstrates that the percentage of children under four years of age in such State who are properly utilizing such restraint systems is greater than 75 percent. Changes the basis of the formula for assisting highway safety programs in the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the American Samoa from monies in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated to a percentage of State apportionments. Includes under the alcohol traffic safety program traffic safety problems resulting from persons driving under the influence of drugs. Directs the Secretary to establish criteria for rehabilitation and treatment programs for persons arrested and convicted of driving while under the influence of drugs. Directs the Secretary to make grants to States which implement accident-reduction projects using computerized safety recordkeeping systems. Requires the Secretary to withhold five percent in FY 1987 and ten percent in FY 1988 of certain Federal-aid highway funds for States in which the minimum drinking age is under 21. Makes States eligible for special grants for enacting statutes providing penalties for drunk driving as set forth in this Act."
