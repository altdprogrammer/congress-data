    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Appropriations with amendment, S. Rept. 98-567) Military Construction Appropriations Act, 1985 - Appropriates funds for FY 1985 for military construction operations by the Department of Defense for: (1) the Army; (2) the Navy; (3) the Air Force; (4) the Defense agencies; (5) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Infrastructure; (6) the Army National Guard; (7) the Air National Guard; (8) the Army Reserve; (9) the Naval Reserve; (10) the Air Force Reserve; (11) family housing for the Army; (12) family housing for the Navy and Marine Corps; (13) family housing for the Air Force; and (14) family housing for the Defense agencies. Limits the amount of money which may be available for study, design, and engineer services. Makes previously appropriated funds available to the respective departments through the authorizations enacted by the 98th Congress. Prohibits the expenditure of funds for: (1) payments under a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract for work except as specified; (2) starting construction of new bases inside the continental United States for which specific appropriations have not been made; (3) the purchase of land or land easements in excess of 100 percent of their value except as specified; (4) the relocation of activity from one base to another without prior notification to the Appropriations Committees; (5) base realignment or closure which is not in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act; (6) the procurement of steel for construction projects for which American steel producers have been denied an opportunity to compete for such steel procurement; (7) dredging in the Indian Ocean by foreign contractors except as specified; (8) construction of any site-specific facilities for the MX missile system until the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act are met; (9) the payment of property taxes to a foreign nation; or (10) the compensation of unlawfully admitted aliens. Permits the use of funds for advances to the Federal Highway Administration for the construction of certain access roads certified as important to the national defense. Limits the expenditure of appropriations for consulting services. Permits the obligation of funds for military construction projects through the fourth fiscal year after the fiscal year which such funds were appropriated. Prohibits the use of funds for the sale or lease of Fort DeRussy, Honolulu, Hawaii. Prohibits the use of funds to initiate a new installation overseas without the prior approval of the Appropriations Committees. Prohibits the expenditure of funds for F-16 beddown projects at Misawa, Japan, until the Committees determine that the Japanese budget has increased funding for FY 1985 for such purposes. Prohibits funds for certain military construction projects in the U.S. territories and possessions in the Pacific and on Kwajalein Island from being used for the performance of any work by foreign contractors unless the lowest bid from a U.S. contractor exceeds the lowest foreign bid by more than 20 percent. Permits the Secretary to waive such prohibition in the public interest. Earmarks Army military construction funds to pay for design of a replacement facility for the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. Directs the Secretary of Defense to inform the Appropriations and Armed Services Committees of the plans and scope of certain proposed military exercises involving construction before the exercises occur. Transfers unexpended balances in the Military Family Housing Management Account and other specified funds available during FY 1985 to the appropriations for family housing under this Act. Prohibits the expenditures of funds for any country the President determines is failing to take adequate measures to prevent the narcotics and controlled substances trade and traffic in or through such country. Continues such prohibition until the President notifies Congress that such country has taken appropriate actions. Permits the President to waive such restriction in the interest of national security. Reduces the amounts otherwise available for consulting services by ten percent unless a particular agency's budget for FY 1985 is below a prescribed level. Expresses the sense of Congress that the pertinent members of NATO and Japan should meet or exceed their pledges of at least a three percent real increase in defense spending."
