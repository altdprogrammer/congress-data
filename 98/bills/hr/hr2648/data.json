    "text": "Local Fiscal Assistance Block Grant Act of 1983 - Declares that the purpose of this Act is to consolidate revenue sharing and community development block grant programs into a single program of assistance to local governments. Establishes in the Treasury a Local Fiscal Assistance Block Grant Fund. Restricts the use of amounts in such Fund to payments to local governments and transfers to Federal administering departments. Requires a local government eligible to receive payments under the community development block grant program-entitlement portion and revenue sharing to notify the Secretary of the Treasury of its wishes to designate one or both of the programs. Declares that a decision to designate a program shall entitle such government to receive a block-grant payment for that fiscal year and each succeeding fiscal year for which payments are authorized. Provides that in the absence of a designation such government shall be entitled to receive payments in accordance with the statute and regulations applicable to the program. Requires the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to inform the Secretary of the Treasury of the amount allocable under the community development block grant-entitlement portion to each local government in the applicable fiscal year. Requires that such block-grant payments be made in quarterly installments not later than the fifth day after the close of a quarter. Declares that any community development block grant - entitlement portion shall be paid in payments that reasonably reflect the historical outlay pattern of budget authority paid to local governments for that program. Makes appropriations for FY 1983 through 1987 to the Local Fund to carry out programs pursuant to this Act. Terminates the authority of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and of the Secretary to obligate the amounts appropriated to the Local Fund on September 30, 1990. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth restrictions on the use of block-grant funds by local governments. Requires a local government, in order to be eligible to receive block-grant payments for a fiscal year, to report on their intended and actual uses. Requires assurance by a local government that it has complied with the requirements of this Act. Requires public participation in the decision-making process on the expenditure of block-grant payments. Requires independent audit of a government's financial statements on such expenditures."
