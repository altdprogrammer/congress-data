    "text": "National Industrial Antitrust Act of 1984 - Provides that attempting to make, making, or performing a contract to carry out jointly a research and development program directly related to an essential industry shall not be deemed per se to violate the antitrust laws. Prohibits the imposition of a criminal penalty for an antitrust violation arising from such conduct if the parties involved have submitted to the Attorney General an annually updated notice disclosing each party to the joint research and development contract, each research and development program to be conducted under such contract, the parties participating in each program, and the written and oral agreements pertaining to such contract or program. Provides that no person shall be liable for an amount exceeding actual damages, interest, and the cost of suit for an antitrust violation arising from conduct for which such a notice is submitted to the Attorney General. Restricts the disclosure of information submitted for such notice. Defines an \"essential industry\" as: (1) the manufacture of automobiles and trucks; (2) the manufacture or milling of steel; (3) the manufacture of rubber, generally, or of rubber products for use in automobile or truck manufacturing; or (4) the manufacture of machine tools. Provides that a merger between persons engaged solely in the same essential industry shall not be prohibited under the Clayton Act unless as a result of such merger there will be fewer than three other persons who compete substantially nationwide in each line of commerce common to both persons involved in the merger."
