    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1984-02-09", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #27 (362-9)) Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1984 - Authorizes appropriations to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for FY 1984 and 1985 for activities authorized under the: (1) Clean Air Act; (2) Federal Water Pollution Act; (3) Safe Drinking Water Act; (4) Solid Waste Disposal Act (provides that a specified amount of such funds is to be expended in FY 1985 for fate studies and research into enhanced degradation of 2, 3, 7, 8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin); (5) Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); (6) Public Health Service Act (radiation activities); (7) interdisciplinary activities provisions; (8) Toxic Substances Control Act; (9) energy research programs; (10) acid rain research programs; and (11) Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (Superfund) (hazardous waste activities). Authorizes appropriations to the EPA Office of Research and Development for FY 1984 and 1985 for program management and support. Sets forth permissible uses of such funds. Provides for congressional oversight of transfers of funds between categories. Prohibits the Administrator of the EPA from using any funds appropriated under this Act for a reduction-in-force, unless the Administrator has provided certain information to Congress in advance. Directs the Administrator of the EPA to establish and maintain a separately identified program of continuing long-term environmental research and development that will support and contribute to each research category for which appropriations are authorized under this Act. Requires that at least 20 percent of such funds be obligated for such long-term research and development. Directs the Administrator to report annually on the performance of such long-term research and development programs to the appropriate congressional committees at the time the President's budget is submitted to the Congress. Requires that appropriations authorized for energy research under this Act be used for environmental research associated with: (1) synthetic fuels production; (2) coal, oil, natural gas, and their fossil fuel extraction, processing, transportation, and combustion; and (3) other energy development activities and related problems posing threats to public health and the environment (including indoor air pollution). Directs the Administrator to: (1) establish and maintain a long-term health and ecological effects research program with related Federal research programs; and (3) establish and maintain an energy-related pollutants monitoring program. Directs the Administrator to continue to conduct development and demonstration of energy-related pollution control technologies as required by pertinent pollution control statutes. Directs the Administrator to develop a Senior Environmental Assistance Program to aid Federal, State, and local environmental agencies in carrying out programs under this Act. Requires, to the fullest extent possible, the utilization of existing older American programs in providing such assistance. Requires State and local environmental agencies to certify that activities thus assisted will supplement and not supplant existing jobs. Amends the Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1978 set a minimum daily rate of compensation for members of the Science Advisory Board. Directs the Administrator to carry out a research program with respect to indoor air quality. Requires that such program be designed to: (1) gather data and information on all aspects of indoor air quality in order to contribute to the understanding of health problems associated with the existence of air pollutants in the indoor environment; and (2) coordinate Federal, State, local and private research, development, and demonstration efforts relating to the improvement of indoor air quality. Authorizes the Administrator to establish committees of representatives of appropriate Federal agencies, and advisory groups of representatives of the scientific community, industry, and public interest organizations, as may be necessary to assist in carrying out such indoor air quality research program. Directs the Administrator to consult and coordinate with State and local officials and other interested parties having concerns related to such program. Requires the indoor air quality research program to include research concerning: (1) monitoring of pollution sources and levels; (2) effects of indoor air pollution on human health; (3) control technologies; and (4) information dissemination to assure public availability of research findings. Directs the Administrator to submit to the Congress: (1) an indoor air quality research implementation plan within one year after enactment of this Act; (2) a progress report within 36 months of such enactment; and (3) a final report within 54 months of such enactment. Requires that the progress report and final report be submitted to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) within a reasonable period before submittal to the Congress and contain any NAS comments when submitted. Reserves specified amounts to carry out such program from funds appropriated pursuant to authorization under this Act for FY 1984 and 1985. Requires the EPA, within 120 days after enactment of this Act, to conduct an investigation and report to the Congress and the President on the feasibility of available alternatives, such as irradiation, to the use of ethylene dibromide (EDB) as a citrus, soil, and grain fumigant. Requires that such report include: (1) assessments in areas that are severely impacted, particularly those in citrus-producing States; and (2) recommendations concerning alternatives to such use that the Administrator determines to be the most reasonable and prudent. Directs the Administrator, pursuant to specified FIFRA provisions, to take appropriate steps to carry out such EDB investigation and report in coordination with the Secretary of agriculture's research and implementation program. Directs the Administrator, from FY 1985 appropriations authorized under this Act for activities under the Solid Waste Disposal Act for research, development, and demonstration on control technologies, to expend at least 25 percent of such amount on control technologies which may serve as feasible alternatives to land disposal, storage, and containment. Expresses the sense of the Congress that, with respect to authorities contained in this Act, the EPA shall give priority to full cooperation with local citizens groups who are trying to protect and preserve the environmental quality of their communities."
