Applies this limitation to all pension, annuity, retirement, disability, or similar programs operated by the Federal government including the Civil Service Retirement System, the Uniformed Service Retirement System, the Railroad Retirement System and the Social Security System. Requires the President to submit budgets for FY 1985 and later which implement these limitations. Provides procedures for an expedited consideration of such measures by Congress."
