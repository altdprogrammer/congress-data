    "text": "Federal Supplemental Compensation Act Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Federal Supplemental Compensation Act of 1982 to extend the payment of benefits under the Federal supplemental unemployment compensation program for 18 months, through March 31, 1985. Revises provisions for the number of weeks for which such compensation is payable. Provides that the amount established in an individual account, beginning after September 30, 1983, shall be the equal of the lesser of: (1) 50 percent of the total amount of regular compensation (including dependents' allowances) payable to the individual with respect to the benefit year (as determined under State law) on the basis of which the individual received regular compensation; or (2) specified applicable limits (during certain State unemployment periods) times the individual's average weekly benefit for the benefit year. Provides for the following applicable limits on weeks of such benefits: (1) ten weeks in States with an insured unemployment rate (IUR) of five percent or greater (a \"five- percent period\"); (2) eight weeks for an IUR between four and five percent (a \"four-percent period\"); and (3) six weeks for an IUR less than four percent (a \"low-unemployment period\"). Directs the Secretary of Labor to require modification of agreements with States under such Act to conform with the amendments made by this Act within a specified period."
