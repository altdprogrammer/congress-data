    "text": "Sludge Management Act of 1983 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to study the environmental, health, and economic effects of: (1) subsurface landfilling sludge on soils and ground water; (2) surface landspreading of sludge on agricultural lands; and (3) various sludge disposal options (including ocean disposal, incineration, landfilling, and surface spreading on crops). Directs the Administrator to study the development and application of methods of sludge disposal, processing, transport, or use in land reclamation. Directs the Administrator to develop guidelines for sludge disposal and landspreading which are consistent with public health and welfare and air and water quality standards. Authorizes the Administrator, in cooperation with appropriate State and municipal agencies, to recommend model codes, ordinances, and statutes designed to implement environmentally sound sludge disposal and landspreading practices. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to States and local governments for up to 40 percent of the cost of removal of sludge or solid waste from navigable waters and adjacent shorelines. Directs the Administrator to establish an Environmental Protection Agency task force to provide surveillance, notice, and technical assistance for such removal of sludge or other waste from waters and shorelines. Directs the Administrator to conduct, cooperate with, and assist special research and demonstration projects relating to the restoration of rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water which have been degraded by the discharge of sludge or sewage. Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to prohibit grants for construction of waste treatment works unless the applicant demonstrates that there will be adequate provision for the \"confined disposal of pollutants\" (i.e. impoundment, storage, use, application, or disposal in such a manner as will prevent the degradation of ground or surface water resources or the entrance of pollutants into the human food chain in concentrations or amounts which may threaten human health or result in other environmental pollution)."
