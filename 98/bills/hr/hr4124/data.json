    "text": "Comprehensive Trade Law Reform Act of 1983 - Title I: Countervailing and Antidumping Duties - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to direct the administering authority to order the suspension of all entries of merchandise subject to a preliminary determination in an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation if the preliminary determination of the International Trade Commission (ITC) is affirmative. Imposes the burden of persuasion with respect to allegations in such investigations upon the person in possession of the specific information necessary to verify or negate such allegations. Establishes within the Department of Commerce the Small Business International Trade Advocate Office (Advocate) which shall assist small businesses in the preparation for, and participation in, any proceedings related to the administration of the U.S. trade laws (including arguing on behalf of petitioners who are financially unable to prosecute antidumping and countervailing duty investigations). Provides that the Advocate may request the ITC to conduct on behalf of small businesses no more than three fact- finding investigations in a given fiscal year. Requires the Advocate each fiscal year to report its activities to specified congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the administering authority and the ITC to make available under a protective order confidential information submitted by a party to an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation upon receipt of an application which describes the information requested. (Current law requires that the application must describe the information with particularity and must set forth the reasons for the request.) Requires that the information to be disclosed shall include all confidential information available to or prepared by the administering authority during an investigation, excluding customer names and the identity of market research organizations. Declares that it shall not be a requirement of disclosure that the person making the request demonstrate a need to have access to the information. Requires the administering authority or ITC to act upon requests for such information within ten days. Directs the ITC, in determining material injury or the threat of material injury in antidumping or countervailing duty investigations, to consider the cumulative impact of imports of merchandise under investigation when combined with imports of the same class or kind which are subject to similar investigations. Declares that in determining whether a petition requesting an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation states a cause of action the absence of a history of imports in sufficient volume to be a present cause of material injury shall not be a basis for a negative determination when a capability to increase exports is asserted. Amends the definition of the nature of a subsidy to require the ITC, in determining whether there is a threat of material injury, to consider information other than the information presented to it by the administering authority and to consider whether the alleged subsidy is related to a promotional program benefitting a specific industry. Sets forth the time periods to be considered by the ITC in determining material injury or threat of material injury. Requires the ITC, in determining threat of material injury, to consider evidence of: (1) increasing domestic inventories of imported merchandise; (2) new or increased capability to manufacture or export such merchandise in the countries under investigation or shift of production and exports among industry product lines; and (3) any effort by a foreign government or instrumentality to promote the development or growth of export capability of the industry under investigation through a combination of policies or programs. Authorizes the imposition of countervailing duties upon merchandise which is likely to be imported into the United States if such merchandise meets all the other requirements for the imposition of countervailing duties. Requires the imposition of countervailing or antidumping duties on merchandise if a U.S. industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded by sales of imports or offers of sales of imports. Requires the ITC to make its preliminary determination in antidumping or countervailing duty investigations on the basis of the information contained in the petition and any information received by way of questionnaire response. Provides an extension of time for making a preliminary determination if the ITC does not believe the information contained in the hearing and the questionnaire responses establish material injury. Requires the ITC, in such a case, to schedule a hearing during which interested parties may address the factual issues of concern to the ITC. Permits an extension of time during which the preliminary determination by the administering authority in an antidumping or countervailing duty case may be made only if the petitioner files a timely request for such extension and the case is extraordinarily difficult. (Current law permits such extension if either of these conditions is met.) Excludes claims for antidumping and countervailing duties from the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to compromise Government claims. Amends the Trade Agreement Act of 1979 to require the ITC, in cases involving revocation of countervailing duties, not to base a negative determination of potential material injury on any export taxes, duties, or other charges levied on the export of merchandise to the United States specifically intended to offset the subsidy received. Directs the administering authority, upon being notified of a negative determination of potential material injury based upon clear and convincing evidence presented by any party seeking revocation, to revoke an existing countervailing duty order and refund the countervailing duties that had been collected. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to prohibit the ITC and the administering authority from reviewing a final determination in a countervailing or antidumping duty case or the suspension of an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation less than five years after publication of notice of that determination or suspension. Authorizes the administering authority, after review, to revoke a countervailing or antidumping duty order or to terminate a suspended investigation. Prohibits the administering authority from taking such actions unless, upon clear and convincing evidence presented by any party seeking revocation or termination of a suspended investigation: (1) the administering authority finds that it is substantially unlikely that subsidized sales or sales at less than fair value will be resumed; and (2) the ITC makes a negative determination of potential material injury to U.S. industries by imports covered by the order or investigation. Prohibits the administering authority from revoking a countervailing duty order or terminating a suspended investigation on the basis of any export taxes, duties, or other charges levied on exports to the United States specifically intended to offset the subsidy received. Prohibits the administering authority from revoking a countervailing or antidumping duty order or terminating a suspended investigation unless the affected foreign manufacturers, producers, or exporters give assurances that they shall not receives subsidies or make sales at less than fair value. Sets forth penalties for violations of such assurances. Requires the administering authority and the ITC to continue an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation if the administering authority, within 20 days of publication of the notice of suspension of an investigation, receives a request for continuation of the investigation from the petitioner. Changes the definition of \"interested parties\" to include: (1) a trade or business association at least ten percent of whose members manufacture, produce, or wholesale a like product in the United States; and (2) a coalition which includes one or more certified unions or recognized groups of workers associated with the production of a like product in the United States and one or more entities which manufacture, produce, or wholesale a like product in the United States. Changes the definition of \"like product.\" Directs the administering authority to reimburse petitioners, upon request, for the costs of preparing an investigation petition and of participating in an investigation if the investigation results in the issuance of a countervailing or antidumping duty order or a suspension agreement. Requires the payments to be made out of an account which shall be established by the administering authority and into which all countervailing and antidumping duties shall be paid. Declares that there shall be no presumption for or against agency action in any civil proceeding arising under the antidumping or countervailing duty provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930. Permits the administering authority to extend the deadline for a final determination in a countervailing duty investigation to the date of its final determination in an antidumping duty investigation if an antidumping duty investigation is initiated simultaneously with the countervailing duty investigation. Adds definitions of \"negative determination\" and of \"affirmative determination\" with respect to antidumping and countervailing duty determinations. Authorizes the administering authority to suspend a countervailing duty investigation if the subsidizing government or the exporters who account for substantially all of the imports of the merchandise subject to the investigation agree: (1) to eliminate the subsidy program completely within six months, except that the administering authority shall not accept an agreement unless the suppression or undercutting of price levels of domestic products by imports of that merchandise will be prevented; or (2) to cease exports of that merchandise to the United States within six months. Authorizes the administering authority, for the purpose of determining the net subsidy, to subtract from the gross subsidy only the amount of: (1) any payment made to qualify for or to receive the benefit of the subsidy; and (2) any loss in the value of the subsidy resulting from its deferred receipt if the deferral is mandated by Government order. Changes the definition of \"subsidy\" to include a domestic subsidy provided directly or indirectly to a supplier of any input to the class or kind of merchandise imported into the United States. Amends the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 to require the ITC to review countervailing duty orders, upon request, if the request is received before a countervailing duty petition is filed with the administration authority. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to prohibit designating a country as a country under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures until the country has committed itself under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to eliminate its export subsidies. Permits countries which are beneficiary developing countries under the Trade Act of 1974 to be designated as countries under the Agreement if, in lieu of such commitment such country agrees: (1) to phase out existing export subsidies within five years; (2) not to increase existing export subsidies, nor extend such subsidies to new merchandise, nor introduce new export subsidies; and (3) to eliminate within one year export subsidies on merchandise which the ITC determines is either produced by an import sensitive U.S. industry or already competitive in the U.S. market and would be competitive in the absence of export subsidies. Requires the President to review the status of and compliance with such agreements at least once during each 12-month period following the date on which the agreement becomes effective and upon the request of certain interested parties. Sets forth the effect of a finding by the President that a country designated as \"a country under the Agreement\" has not honored its commitments relating to eliminating subsidies. Requires that a countervailing duty order shall presumptively apply to all merchandise of the class of kind which have been determined to materially injure U.S. industries and which are exported from the country investigated, except that differing duties may be imposed if the administering authority determines that there is a significant differential between companies receiving subsidy benefits or if a State-owned enterprise is involved. Adds to the definition of \"subsidy\" specified programs and protections when used as part of a program to develop a significant export capability in a particular product sector. Requires that the foreign market value of the merchandise under investigation shall be the constructed value of the merchandise if the administering authority determines that the cost to the foreign producer of any foreign material incorporated in the merchandise under investigation is unreasonable. Requires that the cost of such preference or subsidy shall be included in the constructed value of the imported merchandise. Authorizes the administering authority to accept an agreement to restrict the volume of imports of merchandise into the United States (with either the government of the country where the merchandise which is being investigated is produced or with the exporters of such merchandise who account for substantially all the imports of such merchandise) if the agreement will eliminate completely the injurious effect of such imports. Authorizes the administering authority to prescribe regulations governing the entry or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of merchandise covered by: (1) agreements to eliminate completely sales at less than fair value or to cease exports of merchandise; or (2) agreements to eliminate injurious effect. Requires the administering authority to have received the written consent of the petitioner before suspending an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation. Prohibits making an adjustment to the foreign market value of an import for specified differences in circumstances of sale or discounts. Requires the purchase price and exporter's sales price to be adjusted by being reduced by, among other costs, the costs relating to the circumstances of sale. Requires that \"cost relating to\" circumstances of sale rather than \"differences in\" circumstances of sale shall be taken into account if they cause a difference between the U.S. price and the foreign market value of the merchandise. Requires that the foreign market value of imported merchandise shall be the weighted average price of all sales or offers for sale of such merchandise subject to specified conditions. Prohibits the administering authority from using items selected by foreign manufacturers, producers, or exporters, or the U.S. importers of merchandise under investigation when the authority uses averaging or sampling techniques to determine the foreign market value of such merchandise. Revises the definition of sales at less than the costs of production to include sales through a related party if such sales are made below the cost of production including related party marketing costs. Requires such sales to be disregarded in determining foreign market value if they have been made over an extended period of time and in substantial quantities. (Current law requires that such sales, in order to be disregarded must also have been at prices which do not permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade.) Includes within the definition of \"exporter\" for purposes of determining U.S. price, any person who owns or controls five percent (currently 20 percent) or more of the voting power or control in the business carried on by the person by whom or for whose account the merchandise is imported into the United States and also five percent (currently 20 percent) or more of such power or control in the business of the exporter, manufacturer, or producer. Requires that any differences between the U.S. price and the foreign market value of imported merchandise which are due to circumstances of sales shall reflect the actual selling expenses incurred by the purchasers in their markets. Repeals the provision for posting security in lieu of estimated antidumping duties pending an early determination of the antidumping duty. Authorizes the administering authority, upon request by an interested party, to negotiate settlement agreements the implementation of which shall be subject to the withdrawal of the petitions resulting in the antidumping or countervailing duty investigation. Provides for the enforcement of such agreements. Title II: Escape Clause - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize an entity which is representative of an industry (including an industry which produces parts irrevocably destined for incorporation in an article like or directly competitve with an imported article) to petition the ITC for import relief. Requires that the ITC, in determining whether increased imports of an article are causing or threatening serious injury to domestic industries, shall take into account whether the article under investigation is incorporated in an imported article. Deletes the provision which defines \"substantial cause\" for purposes of injury determination as a cause which is important and not less than any other cause. Requires that the ITC, whenever it has reason to believe that the increased imports are attributable to circumstances which come within the purview of other remedial provisions of law, shall promptly notify the appropriate agency and such agency shall initiate the appropriate action. Requires that an affirmative determination of serious injury under this title shall be considered to be an affirmative determination of material injury under other remedial provisions of law if the affirmative determination of serious injury has been made within 12 months of the date on which the petition was filed under the other statutes. Requires that the ITC, if it finds that a serious injury or the threat of a serious injury exists, shall, in order to prevent or remedy such injury: (1) find the amount of increase in or imposition of any duty; (2) determine a tariff rate quota on such article; (3) determine the quantitative import restriction on the import into the United States of such article; or (4) recommend any combination of such actions. Requires at least six months to elapse between investigations of import injury. Requires the ITC to determine, within 45 days of the filing of a petition, whether or not a reasonable indication that conditions for an affirmative finding of serious import injury exist if a petitioner alleges that imports of an article have increased by more than ten percent in volume or 20 percent relative to domestic production in the previous 12 months. Requires the Commissioner of Customs, if the ITC makes an affirmative determination of such indication, to order the suspension of liquidation of entry of such articles. Requires the suspension to continue until: (1) the ITC makes a negative determination of serious injury; or (2) import relief actions take effect. Requires an additional duty to be imposed on any article that is subject to a suspension of liquidation of entry if the ITC makes an affirmative determination of import injury. Deletes the provision authorizing the President to grant trade adjustment assistance instead of import relief to an industry which has been seriously injured by imports. Directs the President, if the President finds that it is in the national economic interest to provide import relief, to either place into effect the determination of the ITC or to negotiate one or more orderly marketing agreements pursuant to the ITC's determination. Requires the President, if the President determines that the import relief recommended by the ITC is not in the national economic interest and that there are alternatives which offset the injury to the same extent as the ITC's recommendations, to transmit to Congress a document setting forth: (1) such determination; (2) the reasons why the ITC's recommendation is not in the national economic interest; (3) other information with respect to the alternatives; and (4) proposed legislation to implement the President's recommendation. Provides for expedited consideration of the President's proposal in the Congress. Requires the President, within 31 days of the submission of such proposal to Congress to: (1) proclaim the actions recommended by the ITC if Congress does not enact the President's proposal; or (2) take the action recommended in the President's proposal. Requires that the import relief proclamation, if it provides for the imposition of or an increase in the rate of duty, shall also provide for periodic review and adjustment of the duty rate in order to maintain substantially the same amount of import relief that has been proclaimed. Requires that bilateral or multilateral orderly marketing agreements negotiated by the President shall limit the export from foreign countries and the import into the United States of articles subject to the import relief proclamation. Prohibits an orderly marketing agreement from becoming effective unless the ITC determines that it provides at least the same level and duration of import relief as found by the ITC to be necessary. Requires the President to proclaim the import relief found by the ITC if the ITC finds that the orderly marketing agreement does not provide the necessary import relief or if the ITC is evenly divided on the question. Requires the import relief to last for not less than five years and not more than ten years. (Current law terminates import relief after five years unless renewed.) Authorizes the import relief to be phased down during the period of such relief but only after the first three years have elapsed. Deletes the provisions providing for extension of import relief. Authorizes the President to reduce or terminate import relief but only after at least five years have elapsed. Requires at least one year to elapse between the end of a period of import relief with respect to an article and the beginning of a new investigation into import relief with respect to such article. (Current law requires two years to elapse between investigations.) Title III: Enforcement of United States Rights - Authorizes the administering authority, based upon information available to it or upon a petition filed with it, to initiate investigations relating to the enforcement of U.S. rights under trade agreements and relating to the U.S. response to certain unfair foreign trade practices. (Current law authorizes the President to begin such investigations.) Authorizes the administering authority to take specified steps to enforce such rights or to respond to the foreign trade practices. Declares that a foreign practice that denies fair and equitable market opportunities to U.S. goods or services or denies to U.S. businesses fair and equitable opportunities for the establishment of an enterprise shall be considered an unreasonable practice which burdens U.S. commerce. Declares that foreign industrial targeting of a specific sector or sectors of the economy shall be considered an unreasonable practice that burdens U.S. commerce. Requires the administering authority to take action if a foreign government has engaged in industrial targeting which causes or threatens to cause material injury to a U.S. industry or which materially retards the establishment of an industry in the United States. Authorizes any interested person to file a petition with the administering authority requesting action to enforce U.S. rights under trade agreements and to respond to certain foreign trade practices. Requires the administering authority to review the sufficiency of the allegations of the petition within 20 days of its filing date. Requires the administering authority, if it finds that the petition provides the basis for action, to publish the petition and provide an opportunity for hearing. Requires the administering authority, if it finds no basis for action in the petition, to reject the petition and inform the petitioner of the reasons for the rejection. Deletes the provision requiring consultation with the affected foreign country regarding issues raised by the petition. Directs the administering authority to present questionnaires to the affected foreign governments and foreign enterprises to develop information about the allegations. Requires the administering authority to verify the information provided by such governments and enterprises and relied upon by the administering authority. Requires the final determination of the administering authority to be based upon the best information available if the foreign governments or entities do not respond to the questionnaires or if the responses cannot be verified. Requires the administering authority to issue a preliminary determination within five months of the initiation of the investigation. Requires the administering authority, if the preliminary determination is affirmative, to take specified actions on a provisional basis. Requires the administering authority to make a final determination within 11 months of the initiation of the investigation. Requires specified actions to be taken within 30 days if the final determination is affirmative. Requires the administering authority to consult closely with the petitioner on the nature of the action taken. Directs the administering authority to make confidential information submitted during an investigation available upon request. Prohibits disclosing customer names and the identity of market research organizations. Authorizes the administering authority, if the contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) disapprove an action taken by the United States, to modify or terminate the action or take such other action as it deems appropriate to compensate an adversely affected foreign country. Defines \"administering authority\" to mean the U.S. Trade Representative or any other U.S. officer to whom the responsibilities of the administering authority under this title are transferred by law. Requires the administering authority to collect data on foreign nontariff trade barriers, foreign barriers to investment, and foreign government programs to promote particular industries. Requires the administering authority to report quarterly to Congress on the information collected. Provides for judicial review of determinations of the administering authority by the U.S. Court of International Trade. Requires the Court to hold unlawful any determination found to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record or otherwise not in accordance with law. Title IV: Private Remedies - Amends the Revenue Act of 1916 to permit a civil suit against manufacturers, exporters, or importers of an article if: (1) the article is manufactured or produced in a foreign country and imported or sold within the United States at a price less than the foreign market value or constructed value of such article; (2) the importation or sales cause or threaten material injury to U.S. industry or labor or prevent the establishment or modernization of any industry in the United States; and (3) the person filing the suit is injured in business or property because of the importation or sale. Authorizes a plaintiff, if a defendant is found liable, to recover the costs of the action, damages for the injury sustained, or appropriate equitable relief. (Current law provides for criminal penalties and treble damages in civil suits.) Declares that the standard of proof in such actions is the preponderance of the evidence. Grants subpoena power to the district court involved in the case. Makes the District Director of the U.S. Customs Service for the port through which the article is commonly imported the agent of the manufacturer or exporter for service of process. Imposes a four year statute of limitation on such actions. Supends the running of the statute of limitation during certain administrative proceedings under the Tariff Act of 1930. Authorizes the court to enjoin further importation, sale, or distribution of the article or take any other action authorized by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if the defendant fails to comply with court orders. Preserves the confidentiality of information used in such action. Requires such an action to be expedited in every way possible. Includes within the foreign market value or constructed value of the article any subsidy provided to the manufacturer, producer, or exporter of the article. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the provisions of this title are consistent with the GATT. Title V: Miscellaneous - Sets forth the effective date of this Act."
