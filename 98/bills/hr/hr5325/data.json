    "text": "Older Americans Amendments of 1984 - Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to consolidate into one authorization of appropriations the authorizations of appropriations for supportive services and senior centers, congregate nutrition services, home delivered nutrition services, and administration. Authorizes amounts to be appropriated for FY 1985 through 1987 for the purposes of making grants for such services and administration. Limits to 85 percent the Federal share of all such costs, including the cost of conducting an ombudsman program. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to donate for nutrition services certain agricultural commodities acquired under the surplus commodities and price support programs. (Current law requires the Secretary to donate the commodities). Authorizes amounts to be appropriated for FY 1985 through 1987 for: (1) the Federal Council on the Aging; and (2) grants for Indian tribes. Requires a State, in order to be eligible for a State and community programs on aging grant, in addition to present requirements: (1) to provide, with respect to nutrition services and supportive services, that each project providing such services will give participating individuals a chance to make a voluntary contribution for the cost of the service provided, and that such contributions will be used for the supportive or nutrition services provided; (2) to provide, with respect to nutrition services, that the State agency will publish before the beginning of each fiscal year a statement of its goals as to the number and the cost per meal of congregate and home-delivered meals to be served in that fiscal year, and will publish after the end of each fiscal year a statement of the actual number of meals served. Authorizes the Commissioner of the Administration on Aging to make grants or provide reimbursement to a State for disaster relief services, upon application for such grants or reimbursement. (Current law authorizes the Commissioner to provide reimbursement but not grants). Provides that such payments may be used for supportive services or nutrition services. (Current law provides only for the use of such payments for supportive services). Revises provisions for training, research, and discretionary projects and programs. Continues, with some revisions, authority to make grants for: (1) the education and training of personnel for the field of aging; (2) gerontology centers; (3) research, development, and demonstration projects; and (4) national impact activities. Authorizes amounts to be appropriated for such grants for FY 1985 through 1987. Eliminates requirements that special consideration be given to grants for: (1) special health care needs of the elderly; (2) assistance in meeting the special housing needs of the aged; (3) certain education and training for the aged; (4) the improvement of services to special categories of the elderly; and (5) transportation systems for the rural elderly. Eliminates authority for: (1) certain special projects in comprehensive long-term care; (2) special projects on legal services for the elderly; and (3) utility and home heating cost demonstration projects. Makes technical amendments. Sets forth the effective date. Amends the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 to require that reports from Federal agencies and departments to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and that reports by the Secretary to Congress, shall be made only as often as the Secretary requires the reports from the departments and agencies. (Current law requires annual reports)."
