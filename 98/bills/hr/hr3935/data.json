    "text": "Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (\"the Act\") to provide that, for any fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1983, nothing in the Act shall be construed to preclude participants in programs under the Act from receiving the same benefits and allowances which were payable in comparable programs under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA). Provides that funds used to pay any such benefits and allowances shall not be counted against specified cost limitations. Directs the Secretary of Labor to promptly notify each administrative entity of the extent to which the amendments made by this Act permit such entities to increase the benefits and allowances paid to participants."
