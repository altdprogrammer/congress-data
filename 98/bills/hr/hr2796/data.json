Directs the Secretary of Commerce to administer the import limitations established by this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to take certain actions to avoid disruption of regional markets. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress four and one-half years after enactment of this Act on whether the quotas should be continued, modified, or revoked and on the effects of the quotas established by this Act on the: (1) economic soundness and employment opportunities in the specialty steel industry; (2) general economy; (3) U.S. balance of payments; and (4) national security. Requires the quotas to continue in effect for at least five years after enactment of this Act."
