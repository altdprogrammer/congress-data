    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Amends title III (Institutional Aid) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to reserve for each fiscal year from the amount appropriated for part B (Aid to Institutions With Special Needs) such sums as may be necessary to fund continuation awards for multiple year grants awarded to institutions under specified Part C challenge grant provisions prior to October 1, 1983. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to increase the authorization of appropriations for FY 1984 for the Office of Inspector General, Department of Education. Amends Federal law relating to grants for the Allen J. Ellender fellowships (Close Up Foundation) to disadvantaged secondary school students and their teachers to participate in a Washington (D.C.) public affairs program to authorize appropriations for FY 1984 through 1989. Extends through FY 1989 the authorization of appropriations for the law school clinical experience program under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (by declaring that specified limited amounts may be appropriated for such program in FY 1985 through 1989, notwithstanding any other provision of law). Amends the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA) to direct the Secretary of Education to first fund the law- related education program (as formerly authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965) at a specified level (along with other specified programs) before using the remainder of the Secretary's discretionary funds for other authorized activities. Makes a technical amendment, for purposes of ECIA provisions for authorized State program design, to specify conditions under which certain children of migratory fishermen are to be included among those to be served by specified State educational agency programs. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to the Urban Education Foundation of Pennsylvania, Inc., located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for reconstruction and renovation (and related costs) of the combined undergraduate and graduate facilities at the urban research park established as such Foundation. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose. Authorizes the Secretary to use for such purpose a specified amount from any amounts recovered by the Department of Education from prior fiscal year obligations from the Higher Education Appropriation Account for the Department of Education. Provides that the amount authorized to be appropriated for such purpose shall be reduced by any amounts expended for such purpose from such recovered amounts."
