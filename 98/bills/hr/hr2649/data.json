Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish the Federalism Account in the Highway Trust Fund to make payments to eligible States. Sets forth terms and conditions under which States shall be entitled to such grants including written assurances, reporting requirements, financial and compliance audits, and discrimination prohibitions. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation, when it is determined that any eligible State refuses compliance with provisions of this Act, to refer the matter to the Attorney General for appropriate civil action, withhold payments to such State, or take such other action as provided by law. Makes conforming amendments to specified highway Acts."
