    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-09-20", 
    "text": "Single-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1983 - Title I: Amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to add the following new terms and definitions: (1) contributing sponsor; (2) control groups; (3) single-employer plan; (4) composite single-employer plan; (5) amount of unfunded guaranteed benefits; and (6) amount of unfunded nonforfeitable benefits. Increases from $2.60 to $6.00 the annual premium rate payable to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation by single-employer plans for plan years beginning after December 31, 1982. Authorizes the Corporation to establish annual premiums in accordance with revised rate bases. Amends the Act to require congressional approval of revised premium schedules by a joint resolution (currently a concurrent resolution is required.) Directs the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress to study the premiums established under the single-employer pension plan termination insurance program set forth in Title IV of ERISA. Requires submission of a report and recommendations to the Congress within two years. Authorizes appropriations. Prescribes procedural guidelines for the termination of single-employer plans by plan administrators. Requires a plan administrator to warn plans maintained under collective bargaining agreements that a notice of intent to terminate within a specified time will be filed with the Corporation. Grants the employee organization representing plan participants the right to object to such termination. Prohibits the plan administrator from filing a notice of intent to terminate if such employee organization files a written objection to the proposed termination within a specified period. Voids any notice of intent to terminate which violates these prescriptions. Prescribes procedures under which single-employer plans may terminate under a standard termination. Imposes upon standard terminations the same prior notice requirement that is placed upon plans maintained under collective bargaining agreements. Requires the plan administrator to include with the notice-of-intent-to-terminate a statement of the current values of: (1) plan assets; (2) nonforfeitable benefits; (3) accrued benefits; and (4) the actuarial assumptions and techniques used in determining the values of such assets and benefits. Sets benefit accrual guidelines for services performed after the termination date. Requires contributing sponsors (or members of their controlled groups) to contribute additional amounts necessary to pay all the benefits due for the appropriate plan year if a plan has insufficient assets on the standard termination date to pay such benefits. Allows the closing out of a single-employer plan in a standard termination if the plan has enough assets to pay all the benefits to which participants would have been entitled had they separated from service on a certain distribution date. Requires the plan administrator to send notice of the final distribution date to the Corporation, each plan participant, and each employee organization representing plan participants. Requires such notification to include certification by an enrolled actuary of the plan asset amounts, and of the present value of nonforfeitable plan benefits. Requires the final distribution of plan assets to fully satisfy the payment of all outstanding benefits. Limits the cessation of benefit accruals to standard termination cases only. Considers failure to satisfy the requirements of the minimum funding standards to be a failure on the part of each contributing sponsor (and each member of such sponsor's controlled group) to meet an outstanding obligation. Prescribes procedures for the termination of single-employer plans under a \"distress termination.\" Requires notification of the intent to terminate under distress. Conditions the validity of such termination upon: (1) an indication in the benefit plan that all contributing sponsors (and each member of such sponsors' controlled groups) have assumed termination trust obligations; and (2) receipt of notice by the plan administrator that the Corporation has made specified determinations. Requires all plans maintained by contributing sponsors or by substantial members of such sponsors' controlled groups to have been granted funding waivers by the Internal Revenue Service for three of the five plan years preceding the termination, including the most recently completed plan year. Requires the contributing sponsors and each substantial member of their controlled groups to have filed a liquidation petition (under either State or Federal law) which has not been dismissed or converted under the Federal bankruptcy code. Requires the contributing sponsor to present substantial evidence to the Corporation that unless a distress termination is granted, such sponsor and each substantial member of the sponsor's controlled groups will be unable to pay outstanding debts and continue in business. Requires the plans maintained by the contributing sponsor and each substantial member of the sponsor's controlled group to show that the ratios of required pension contributions to gross income and to total annualized wages have doubled within a certain period. Defines a \"substantial member\" of a controlled group as a person whose assets comprise five percent or more of such group's total assets. Subjects the effectiveness of distress terminations to the condition that the Corporation be satisfied it will receive from the appropriate liable employers the outstanding amounts in an acceptable form. Requires the Corporation to: (1) determine by a specified time whether the plan's assets are sufficient to discharge all basic benefit obligations when they fall due; and (2) to notify the plan administrator of its findings. Precludes any service performed after the distress termination date from being taken into account for any benefit plan purposes. Voids any distress termination based solely upon the filing of a liquidation petition if the case was either dismissed or converted to a case under the reorganization provisions of Federal bankruptcy law. Requires the Corporation to institute court proceedings to terminate a single-employer plan if it finds that the plan is either unable to pay benefits when due, or has been abandoned. Establishes a termination trust for single- employer plans terminated under a distress termination. Requires contributing sponsors of such plans (and members of their controlled group) to fund such trusts with annual contributions. Prescribes procedure for the payment from the trust to eligible benefit plan participants. Includes termination trusts within the ERISA definition of \"employee welfare benefit plan.\" Authorizes a plan administrator to restore terminated single-employer plans to pretermination status, under procedures prescribed by the Corporation. Imposes primary liability upon persons who are contributing sponsors (or members of such sponsor's controlled group) upon the termination date of a plan terminated by either the plan administrator or by the Corporation. Imposes joint and several liability upon persons who were under common control upon such termination date. Establishes liability to the Corporation for the amount of: (1) unfunded guaranteed benefits under the plan as of the termination date; (2) total unpaid contributions due as of the termination date (including contributions for which waivers were granted); and (3) unpaid contributions which would have been due but for the filing of a bankruptcy petition under Federal or State bankruptcy laws. Sets formulae for the computation and payment of such liability. Makes contributing sponsors and members of their controlled group liable for annual contributions to a plan's termination trust. Imposes contingent liability upon a formerly obligated contributing sponsor (or controlled group member) if a single-employer plan to which obligations were transferred is itself terminated. Imposes joint and several liability upon formerly obligated persons for five years. Extends the period of contingent liability to ten years upon bankruptcy, liquidation, receivership, or an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Imposes contingent liability upon: (1) formerly obligated sponsors, if one single-employer plan is transferred to another; (2) each member of a formerly contributing sponsor's controlled group, if such sponsor has stopped contributing; (3) the departing member of a controlled group, if any other member in such controlled group is a contributing sponsor; and (4) each remaining controlled group member for the benefit obligations of a departing contributing sponsor. Specifies exemptions to contingent liability. Authorizes the Corporation to prescribe regulations imposing similar contingent liability on composite single-employer plans. Provides guidelines for the amount and payment of contingent liability. Authorizes the amortization of contingent liability payments for a maximum of fifteen years. States that persons who are secondarily liable are also liable for the annual termination trust contributions. Provides for recourse of contingently liable persons against other liable persons. Sets guidelines under which: (1) contingent liability may be reduced; and (2) exemptions from contingent liability may be granted. Exempts from contingent liability persons who remain primarily liable. Authorizes the Corporation to waive or grant variances for liability upon a determination that its interests are adequately protected. Directs the Corporation to consolidate all civil actions involving any one single-employer plan termination in a single Federal court. Creates a lien in favor of an affected single-employer plan if the Internal Revenue Service grants a waiver of the plan's minimum funding standards. Provides guidelines for the satisfaction of such lien. Authorizes the Corporation to bring a civil action to: (1) enjoin violations; (2) obtain equitable relief; or (3) enforce termination provisions. Authorizes specified interested parties who are adversely affected by a violation of the plan termination provisions to bring a civil action for: (1) enjoinment; (2) redress; (3) enforcement; or (4) other equitable relief. Makes a single-employer plan amenable to suit as an entity. Grants Federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over such civil actions, without regard to the amount in controversy, or the citizenship of the parties. Authorizes the court to award attorney's fees to the prevailing party. Treats corporate reorganizations designed to evade or avoid pension plan liability as though the reorganized corporate entity were the same as the entity to which this Act originally applied. Title II: Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to conform to title I of this Act. Allows a deduction from gross income for payments of contingent liabilities in connection with terminated plans. Makes termination trusts tax-exempt organizations."
