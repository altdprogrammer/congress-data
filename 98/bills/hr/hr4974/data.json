    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1984-04-25", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #95 (252-99)) National Science Foundation Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1985 - Authorizes appropriations for the National Science Foundation for FY 1985 for the following categories: (1) mathematical and physical sciences; (2) engineering; (3) biological, behavioral, and social sciences; (4) astronomical, atmospheric, earth and ocean sciences; (5) antarctic research programs; (6) scientific, technological, and international affairs; (7) program development and management; (8) science and engineering education; and (9) advanced scientific computing. Allocates out of the funds for biological, behavioral, and social sciences at least: (1) $73,880,000 to the Behavior and Neural Sciences Division and the Social and Economic Sciences Division; and (2) $8,000,000 to the Information Science and Technology Division. Eliminates from this Act authorizations for earthquake research since a similar authorization for such research has been signed into law (Public Law 98-241, the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act). Provides that with respect to the allocations for biotic systems and resources and for atmospheric sciences, emphasis shall be placed on the basic scientific research of acid rain. Limits the amounts of appropriations which may be expended for: (1) consultation; and (2) expenses of the Foundation incurred outside the United States. Requires that if the funds appropriated are less than the amount authorized, the funds are to be apportioned among activities in the same proportion as they are apportioned in the authorization Act. Limits the transfer of funds among categories to ten percent of the amount authorized for a particular category. Prohibits transfers to or from any category exceeding ten percent of the amount listed for that category until 30 calendar days have passed after the Director has notified the Speaker, the Vice President, and the appropriate congressional committees of such proposed transfer. Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to delete the requirement that National Science Foundation Board Members be notified of meetings by registered or certified mail. Authorizes the Board to establish special commissions to study and make recommendations to the Foundation on issues relating to research and education in science and engineering. Authorizes the Board discretion in fixing the size and composition of a special commission (currently, limited to six scientists and five non-scientists). Repeals the prohibition against National Science Foundation employees owning U.S. patents on inventions resulting from their work at the Foundation. Repeals the prohibition against the Director, Deputy Director, or Assistant Director of the Foundation engaging in any other business, vocation, or employment while serving in such position. Repeals the requirement that the Director establish a Resource Center for Science and Engineering at an educational institution enrolling a substantial number of minority and/or low-income students. Deletes the requirement that contracting officers of the Foundation report any financial or academic affiliation with a grant applicant. Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to: (1) initiate and support fundamental engineering research and education programs through contracts, grants, loans, and other forms of assistance; (2) foster the interchange of engineering information among scientists in the United States and foreign countries; (3) foster and support the development and use of computer and other scientific technologies, primarily for research and education in engineering; (4) evaluate the status and needs of the engineering field; (5) maintain a central clearinghouse for the collection and analysis of engineering resource data; (6) initiate and maintain a program for the determination of the total amount of money by grant, contract, or other arrangement from U.S. agencies for engineering research; (7) initiate and support engineering activities relating to international cooperation, national security, and its effect upon society through contracts, grants, loans, and other forms of assistance; and (8) initiate and support engineering research at academic and other nonprofit institutions and applied scientific research when relevant to national problems in the public interest. Requires the National Science Board and the Director of the Foundation to recommend and encourage the promotion of research and education in science and engineering. Requires the Foundation to strengthen research and education in engineering and to avoid undue concentration in such areas. Requires persons with engineering backgrounds to be nominated for appointment as members to the Board. Requires the President to give due consideration to: (1) equitable representation of women and minority engineers when making such nominations; and (2) any recommendations for nomination submitted to him by the National Academy of Engineering or other engineering organizations. Authorizes the Foundation, within specified limits, to: (1) award scholarships and graduate fellowships for study and research in the sciences or in engineering at appropriate nonprofit American or foreign institutions; (2) enter into contracts or other arrangement for engineering activities and such specific engineering activities relating to international cooperation or national security; (3) prescribe, with specified approval, the extent to which vouchers for funds expended under contracts for engineering research shall be subject to itemization or substantiation prior to payment; and (4) publish engineering information to further the dissemination of such information consistent with the national interest. Requires provisions dealing with the patent laws of the United States to be included in contracts or other arrangements entered into pursuant to this Act which relate to engineering research. Authorizes the Foundation to cooperate in any international engineering activities that are consistent under this Act. Requires the Foundation to utilize appropriations to make contracts or other arrangements for engineering research. Permits the transfer of funds available to U.S. agencies for engineering research to the Foundation. Requires the Secretary of Defense and the Foundation to establish security safeguards, including measures restricting access to information and property, with regard to engineering research activities relating to the national defense. Directs the Director of the Foundation to require as a precondition of any award made by the Foundation for precollege engineering curriculum development activities, the awardee, including any subcontractors, to make available for inspection by the parents of children engaged in such educational activities all instructional materials provided under such award or subcontract."
