    "date": "1984-09-26", 
    "text": "Withdraws certain public lands in Maricopa, Pima, and Yuma Counties, Arizona, from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws. Reserves such lands for defense-related uses by the Department of the Air Force. Apportions management responsibility for the withdrawn lands between the Secretary of the Air Force and the Secretary of the Interior. Assigns top priority to the military use of the lands and requires the concurrence of the Secretary of the Air Force before any easements, leases, or rights-of-way may be issued by the Secretary of the Interior. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to consult with the Secretary of the Air Force regarding the development of a land resource management and implementation program and to enter into a memorandum of understanding to implement that plan. Requires the land within the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge to be managed by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966. Maintains the status of the water rights and water usage on the withdrawn lands as they existed prior to the passage of this Act. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit within a specified time to the Congress an analysis of the mineral potential of the withdrawn lands and to identify lands which should be opened to operation of the mining laws. Returns the lands to their pre-withdrawal status 25 years from the effective date of this Act, unless the Secretary of the Air Force files for an extension of the withdrawal three years before such termination date. Prescribes a timetable and notification procedure for the extension or relinquishment of the withdrawn lands. Requires the Secretary of the Air Force to determine the extent of contamination incurred by the withdrawn lands prior to filing a notice of intent to relinquish. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to refuse to accept jurisdiction of contaminated lands offered for relinquishment. Sets five-year reassessment periods to determine the feasibility of land decontamination procedures. Limits the functions which may be delegated by the Secretary of the Interior under this Act."
