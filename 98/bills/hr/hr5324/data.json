Directs the President, in determining whether to designate a country a beneficiary developing country, to consider the extent to which such country is providing means for foreign nationals to exercise exclusive rights in intellectual property (including patent, trademark, and copyright rights). Requires the President to determine, by January 1, 1986, whether each beneficiary developing country satisfies the requirement relating to protection of intellectual property rights of foreign nationals. Directs the President to terminate a country's designation as a beneficiary developing country if the country fails to satisfy those requirements. Requires the President to report annually to Congress on the extent to which assurances on protection of intellectual property rights have been satisfied."
