Allows the person bringing such an action to proceed with it if the Government does not proceed with the action with reasonable diligence within 60 days after entering an appearance. (Under current law, the person bringing such an action may proceed if the Government does not proceed with the action within six months after entering an appearance.) Requires the court to dismiss such an action brought by such a person on discovering that the action is based upon evidence the Government had as a basis for allegations made in a prior proceeding, unless the Government proceeds with the action. Provides that the minimum amount which a person bringing such an action may receive for disclosing evidence which the Government did not have when the action was brought shall be 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim by the Government. (Under current law, the amount which such a person may receive shall not exceed ten percent of such proceeds.)"
