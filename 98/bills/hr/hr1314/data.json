Revises the procedure for the congressional veto of a reorganization plan. Declares that such a plan shall be effective only if: (1) both Houses of Congress pass a joint resolution approving the plan within 90 days of continuous session of Congress after the plan is transmitted to Congress; and (2) the President approves the resolution. (Under the Reorganization Act of 1977, a reorganization plan became effective if neither House passed a resolution disapproving it within 60 days.) Lengthens the period during which the President may amend or withdraw a reorganization plan submitted to Congress, and the period by which the Committee on Government Operations of the House or the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate must report a resolution approving the plan or be discharged from consideration thereof. Directs the President to include with each reorganization plan transmitted to Congress: (1) information describing in detail the nature and substance of actions expected to be required to implement the reorganization and the preliminary actions taken; and (2) a projected timetable for completing the implementation process. States that a reorganization plan may not rename an existing executive department or create an independent agency."
