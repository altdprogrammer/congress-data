Requires the hearing officer to allow the Administrator to file revised rates, upon the Administrator's request, provided that there is an adequate opportunity for cross-examination and rebuttal with respect to such revised rates. Requires that persons who have participated in such a hearing be allowed to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the proposed rates after the hearing record has been closed. Provides that the hearing officer shall publish an initial decision on such rates as expeditiously as practicable after receiving such findings and conclusions. Prohibits ex parte communications relevant to the merits of such a hearing. Permits participants at such a hearing to file exceptions to the hearing officer's initial decision with the Administrator. Provides that the rates determined by the hearing officer shall become the final rates unless the Administrator makes a final decision establishing different rates, which shall become the final rates of the Administrator."
