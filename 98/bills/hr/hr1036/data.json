    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #351 (246-178)) Community Renewal Employment Act - Title I: General Purpose and Authority - Declares the purpose of this Act to be the provision of employment opportunities to long-term unemployed individuals in high unemployment areas through payments for labor and related costs associated with the repair, maintenance, or rehabilitation of essential community and educational facilities and for public safety, health, social service, and other activities related to the public welfare. Authorizes appropriations to provide opportunities for unemployed individuals under this Act. Authorizes such appropriations in a specified amount for FY 1984. Limits the authorization of such appropriations in each succeeding fiscal year to an amount equal to the product of $10,000 multiplied by 20 percent of the number of \"long-term unemployed individuals\" (i.e. the average number of individuals in the civilian labor force who, in the first three months of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is to be made, had been unemployed for 15 or more weeks as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on a seasonally adjusted basis). Provides that, if the national average rate of unemployment in the civilian labor force is less than ten percent in the first three months of the calendar year in which begins the fiscal year for which such an appropriation is to be made, the \"20 percent\" in such formula shall be decreased by five percentage points for each full percentage point by which such national average rate of unemployment is less than ten percent. Provides that, for any fiscal year, 80 percent of such appropriations shall be available for purposes of title II (Community Renewal Employment Programs) and 20 percent shall be available for title III (Educational Facility Repair and Renovation Employment Activities). Makes individuals aged 16 or older eligible to participate in such program only if they are unemployed at the time of eligibility determination and for at least 15 of the 20 weeks prior to such determination, with specified exceptions. Limits wages for eligible individuals to 52 weeks in a two-year period. Requires that priority be given to those who have exhausted or are otherwise not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits, particularly: (1) those who have been unemployed for the longest periods immediately preceding selection; and (2) those residing in families in which no other member is employed on a full-time basis. Requires that special consideration in selecting participants for employment under this Act in employment counseling and other services for veterans should be given to veterans who otherwise meet participant eligibility requirements. Allows up to ten percent of eligible participants selected by a recipient for subsidized employment from funds under this Act to be individuals unemployed for less than 15 weeks, if the State employment service agency determines that such individuals: (1) have been employed only intermittently or temporarily during 15 of the 20 weeks preceding certification and have experienced substantial periods of unemployment prior to and during such 15 weeks; (2) do not have established work histories which can be documented to provide verification of 15 weeks unemployment during the 20-week period; (3) are workers with skills necessary to fill nonmanagement positions on a particular project or activity; or (4) have recall rights under a formal agreement with the employer providing the subsidized job position. Makes the State employment service agency, in certifying eligible participants and referring them for employment to recipients under title II or III, responsible for ensuring equal employment opportunities and the full participation of traditionally underrepresented groups, including women and racial and ethnic minorities. Makes each recipient of funds under title II or III responsible for ensuring such opportunities and full participation in the selection of eligible participants for such employment. Requires that not less than 75 percent of title II and III funds be used to provide wages and employment benefits to eligible participants for work which the recipient certifies has been performed in one or more authorized activities. Permits up to 15 percent of funds provided in a title II or III recipient to be used for the cost of administration and up to ten percent for the acquisition of supplies, tools, equipment, and other materials. Permits payment of such costs from non-Federal sources or Federal sources other than this Act. Requires recipients, to the extent feasible, to ensure that supplies, tools, equipment, or other materials purchased or procured have been manufactured, mined, or produced in the United States. Permits title II funds to be used for costs associated with training and related support for a number of participants, if: (1) employers are committed to fill an equal number of unsubsidized jobs with participants who have successfully completed such training; (2) the recipient has an agreement with a qualified public or private nonprofit provider of such training services; and (3) costs of training and support do not exceed, on a weekly basis, the maximum wage payable with funds under this Act. Limits the rate of salaries or wages paid to administrative or supervisory employees from funds available for administrative costs. Establishes a career preparation demonstration program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1987 for such program. Directs the Secretary of Labor, utilizing the Office of the Job Corps, to establish in each of the Federal regions four career preparation demonstration centers (equitably distributed between rural and urban areas) for combined written, audiovisual, and computer-based materials within the basic instructional format of the Job Corps to train eligible participants, primarily under provisions for high technology training centers and for youth trainee activities. Requires that such Centers: (1) be nonresidential; (2) provide specified types of training leading to employment or a high school diploma or its equivalent; (3) use materials, curricula, and methodologies developed successfully through Job Corps program experience; (4) establish easily accessible outreach training sites; and (5) use, to the extent feasible, facilities and expertise of existing Job Corps centers (including Civilian Conservation Centers) or contractors operating such centers. Provides that up to five of the Centers shall be designated high technology training centers for training combined with subsidized internship in the private sector for career preparation in high technology occupations including robotics, health technology, and computer operations.

Provides that larger units of local government shall not qualify as the eligible entity to serve any smaller unit which is, or is part of, an eligible entity which has filed a statement on use of funds. Sets forth provisions for allotment of title II funds (exclusive of the amount available for part C). Directs the Secretary to reserve two percent of such funds for allotment among Native American eligible entities.

Directs the Governor to use the same formula in making available the amount allotted to a State as an eligible entity to each jurisdiction within the area for which the State is an eligible entity (but requires that no amount less than $25,000 shall be made available to any such jurisdiction and that any unallocated amounts be reallocated among other jurisdictions which meet the $25,000 minimum requirement).
