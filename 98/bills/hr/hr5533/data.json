    "text": "Fair and Simple Tax Act of 1984 - Title I: Reduction of Individual and Corporate Tax Rates - Subtitle A: Reduction of Rates - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise individual tax rates. Imposes a tax rate of 25 percent on the taxable income of every individual. Imposes a tax rate of 15 percent on corporate income which does not exceed $50,000 and a tax rate of 30 percent on corporate income exceeding $50,000. Subtitle B: Increase in Amount of Personal Exemption and Zero Bracket Amount - Increases the amount of the personal exemption to $2,000. Increases the \"zero bracket amount\" to $2,700 for single taxpayers and $3,500 for a joint return or surviving spouse. Provides for an annual adjustment in the \"zero bracket amount\" by a cost-of-living adjustment based on the Consumer Price Index. Subtitle C: Employment Income Exclusion Established - Allows an individual taxpayer to exclude 20 percent of the amount received during the taxable year by such individual as employment income. Provides that the exclusion is phased out when the individual's wages and salaries exceed the Federal Insurance Contributions Act maximum wage base for the calendar year. Excludes all of an individual's employment income where the employment income for the taxable year is $10,000 or less ($20,000 or less in the case of a joint return). Subtitle D: Repeals Related to Reduction in Rates - Repeals provisions relating to: (1) tax tables for individuals; (2) personal service corporations; (3) special averaging rules for lump-sum distributions; (4) accumulated corporate surplus; (5) personal holding companies; (6) income averaging; and (7) graduated corporate tax rates. Applies the trust throwback rules only to amounts distributed from a foreign trust.

Reduces the maximum amount of the earned income credit from $5,000 to $4,000. Treats as taxable income: (1) unemployment compensation; (2) the annual increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies; and (3) interest on industrial development bonds and mortgage subsidy bonds. Provides that the transfer of a corporation's stock in satisfaction of indebtedness will be treated as having satisfied the indebtedness with money equal to the fair market value of the stock. Provides a limited exclusion from income for scholarships and fellowships. Amends the Merchant Marine Act to repeal the tax exemption for deposits into, and withdrawals from, a capital construction fund. Subtitle C: Deductions - Repeals the tax deductions for: (1) the additional exemption for the elderly and the blind; (2) unused investment credits; (3) two-earner married couples; and (4) adoption expenses. Provides that the deduction for losses shall be limited to capital losses. Increases the floor on the deduction for medical and dental expenses from five to 10 percent. Subtitle D: Adjustment to Basis; Changes in Certain Special Capital Gains Treatment Provisions - Allows an inflation adjustment, based on the gross national product deflator, to the adjusted basis of capital assets which have been held for more than one year at the time of sale or exchange solely for the purpose of determining gain or loss on such assets. Excludes from such treatment: (1) creditor's interest; (2) options; (3) net lease property in the case of the lessor; (4) preferred stock with fixed dividends; and (5) stock in small business corporations and certain foreign corporations. Allows the Secretary of the Treasury to disallow all or part of an adjustment where there was a transfer to increase the inflation adjustment or depreciation allowance. Reduces the alternative tax rate for corporations from 28 to 20 percent. Repeals the deduction for individuals for capital gains. Repeals the limitation on the deduction of capital losses by individuals. Permits the carryover of the excess of capital losses over gross income by individuals.
