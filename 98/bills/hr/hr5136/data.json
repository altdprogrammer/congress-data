    "text": "Generalized System of Preferences Revision Act of 1984 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the President, in providing duty-free treatment for imports from beneficiary developing countries, to have due regard for the effect such action will have on extending internationally recognized worker rights to workers in developing countries. Defines internationally recognized worker rights. Prohibits the President from designating a country a beneficiary developing country: (1) if such country has not adopted laws that extend internationally recognized worker rights to its workers or is not satisfactorily enforcing such laws; or (2) for any calendar year occurring after a related per capita standard year in which such country had a per capita gross national product (GNP) of $5,000 or more. Requires the President, in determining whether to designate a country a beneficiary developing country, to take into account whether or not the country has adopted and is enforcing laws that extend internationally recognized worker rights to its workers. Requires that parties interested in the implementation and protection of internationally recognized workers rights shall be granted the same privilege of giving advice on the formulation of the general system of tariff preferences as parties with significant economic interest in the formulation of the system. Prohibits any article from being an eligible article for tariff preference purposes for any period during which such article is produced or processed in a designated zone in a beneficiary country in which conditions prevail that are treated as exceptions to and are less strigent than the otherwise applicable conditions relating to internationally recognized worker rights. Requires the President, annually after 1984, to identify each beneficiary developing country that has a per capita GNP for the related per capita standard year of: (1) between $400 and $1,399; or (2) between $1,400 and $4,999. Directs the President to determine whether a beneficiary developing country: (1) which has the lower per capita GNP, exported to the United States a specified quantity of an eligible article or more than half of the total U.S. imports of that article during one year; or (2) which has the higher per capita GNP, exported to the United States either a specified quantity of an eligible article or more than one-fourth of the total U.S. imports of that article during that year. Prohibits a country which the President has found to have exported such quantities of a certain article from being treated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to that article. Requires such prohibition to become effective within 60 days after the President's determination unless the President makes specified findings with respect to that country. Permits such a country to be redesignated a beneficiary developing country if the imports of the article from that country did not exceed the specified limitations during the preceding three years. Extends the generalized system of preferences until six years after the enactment of this Act. Requires the President to report to Congress on the operation of the system of preferences three years after enactment of this Act. Requires the Secretary of State and the U.S. Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, to prepare reports on the status of internationally recognized worker rights within beneficiary developing countries. Requires the appropriate U.S. agencies to help beneficiary developing countries to ensure that the agricultural sectors of their economies are not directed to export markets to the detriment of the reduction of foodstuffs for their citizenry."
