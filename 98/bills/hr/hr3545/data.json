    "text": "Child Support Enforcement Act of 1983 - Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of title IV of the Social Security Act to state that the purpose of part D is to assure that all children in the United States who are in need of assistance in securing financial support from their parents will receive such assistance regardless of the economic status of their parents and that parents will prevent their children from becoming a burden on taxpayers by fulfilling to the best of their ability their financial obligations on behalf of their children. Revises provisions relating to incentive payments under part D. Provides that incentives will be computed and paid quarterly beginning in FY 1986. Provides generally that as the amount of support collected increases, the incentive payment will increase. Repeals the present incentive system as of October 1, 1985, but assures a State of receiving at least 80 percent in FY 1986, 60 percent in FY 1987, and 40 in FY 1988, of what the State would have received under the repealed incentive system. Provides for the collection of past-due support from Federal tax refunds in non-Aid to Families With Dependent Children (part A of title IV) cases. (Currently, this is done for AFDC cases.) Requires a State under part D to implement procedures providing for: (1) the withholding of child support from wages if a support order has been entered by a State; (2) quasi-judicial or administrative procedures for entering child support orders which have the same force and effect as orders entered by a court; (3) the collection of past-due support from State tax refunds; (4) placing liens on real property for amounts of past-due support; (5) the sharing of information regarding amounts of past-due support owed by absent parents with consumer credit bureau organizations; and (6) seeking employment-related health care or health insurance from the absent parent for children for whom the State is seeking financial support when such care or insurance would be available at a reasonable cost and such care or insurance could not be provided by the custodial parent. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to States to assist in the development or improvement of clearinghouses and other information management systems to aid in the enforcement of support by facilitating the collection and exchange, both within a State or locality and among States and localities, of child support information. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose for FY 1984 through FY 1989. Requires that there be filed annually with the Secretary, the designee of the Secretary, data showing the number of cases by State filed on behalf of children seeking support in which all support owed was fully paid in each of the preceding 12 months, the number of such cases in which at least 80 percent of the support owed was paid in each of the preceding 12 months, the number of such cases in which less than half the support owed was paid, and the number of such cases in which no support was paid. Amends title III (Grants to States for Unemployment Compensation Administration) of the Act to require the reporting (at least quarterly) of the name, address, and wages paid to each individual with respect to whom an unemployment contribution has been made. Requires a State unemployment compensation agency to disclose to any State or local child support enforcement agency and to any State agency administering a State AFDC plan any information it has regarding an individual's: (1) wages; (2) unemployment compensation; (3) address; and (4) employment opportunities. Makes conforming amendments to sections of the Internal Revenue Code, Wagner-Peyser Act, and Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976."
