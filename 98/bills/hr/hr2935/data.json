    "text": "Health Planning Block Grant Act of 1983 - Replaces title XV (National Health Planning and Development) of the Public Health Service Act with State health planning block grants. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 and 1985. Sets forth a schedule for the issuance of regulations, the approval or disapproval of State applications, and the obligation of funds. Denies funding to any State which does not revise its certificate of need laws to accord with this Act. Bases State allotments on population. Provides that any unallocated funds shall be returned to the Treasury. Provides with regard to State allotments that: (1) unobligated funds shall be available to the State for the next fiscal year; and (2) payments may be reduced by the value of furnished supplies or certain travel costs. Requires States to use their allotments to develop a certificate of need program and a State health plan. Prohibits a State from receiving funds unless its application has been approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Requires such application to include a report on intended expenditures. Requires States to prepare activity reports and to audit expenditures at least every two years. Prohibits discrimination on the basis of age, handicap, sex, religion, race, color, or national origin in the administration of any programs or activities funded under this Act. Prescribes compliance and enforcement measures. Requires States to determine that there is a need for a new institutional health service and capital expenditure before offering such services or obligating funds. Exempts health maintenance organization (HMO) services and inpatient health care facilities controlled by an HMO or group of HMOs from certificate of need requirements, upon approval of application for such exemption. Permits the approval of a certificate of need for an HMO in certain circumstances, especially for the acquisition of major medical equipment. Requires that certificates of need for capital expenditures state a maximum spendable amount. Authorizes the State agency, after a hearing, to withdraw a certificate of need for applicant noncompliance. Requires the State agency to review a certificate of need application on the basis of the State Health Plan. Sets forth procedural requirements respecting a State certificate of need program. Prescribes the general contents of a State health plan. Requires a biennial revision of such plan. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to States for the regional health planning agencies. Sets forth a formula for the allocation of grant funds. Conditions such grants on the designation of intrastate or interstate health planning areas established according to specified criteria. Requires a regional health planning agency for each such area. Limits the sources of non-Federal contributions to such agencies. Describes the functions of such agencies. Authorizes FY 1984 and 1985 appropriations. Directs the Secretary by grants or contracts to assist public or private nonprofit entities in meeting the operating costs of a center for multidisciplinary health planning methods development and technical assistance. Repeals the health planning block grant program effective September 30 of the third complete successive fiscal year after enactment of this Act. States that such repeal will not affect any suits or other proceedings begun before such effective date."
