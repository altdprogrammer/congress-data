Directs the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to make monthly payments equivalent to the child's insurance benefit under the Social Security Act before the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to children of such deceased veterans between the ages of 18 and 22 attending institutions of higher learning. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide the Administrator with any information necessary."
