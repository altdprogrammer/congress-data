    "text": "Uniform Single Audit Act of 1983 - Amends title 31 of the United States Code to add a new chapter 75 - Requirements for Single Financial Audits. Establishes uniform single financial audit requirements for State and local governments and nonprofit organizations that receive Federal assistance. Directs the President to prescribe policies, procedures, and regulations to implement this chapter. Permits the President to delegate the authority to prescribe policies and procedures to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the responsibility to prescribe regulations to the appropriate executive agencies. Requires the Director of OMB and the appropriate executive agencies to consult with the Comptroller General of the United States in the preparation of such policies, procedures, and regulations. Requires the Director within one year to establish a plan of action to assure that single financial audits are conducted within three years from the enactment of this Act, and thereafter. Requires any entity receiving at least $100,000 in Federal assistance for a fiscal year to conduct at least biennially a single financial audit covering all of its funds. Requires such audits to be conducted by independent auditors in accordance with accepted Government auditing standards. Declares that the total amounts of Federal, State, local, and other assistance, respectively, received from all sources by the entity shall be used in a single financial audit for testing compliance with the financial requirements of such assistance programs. Requires the materiality level selected in the audit for testing to be based on the professional judgment of the independent auditor, except in the case of an individual grant, program, or project that exceeds $30,000,000 (or does not exceed $30,000,000 but does exceed $500,000 or three percent of the entity's total Federal expenditures,) in which case the auditor must apply tests in accordance with this Act. Requires the Comptroller General, for every five year period, to report to specified Congressional committees as to whether such thresholds should be increased. Requires each entity receiving Federal assistance and subsequently making a portion of it available to another entity to ascertain whether a single financial audit has been conducted of the recipient. Permits the use of Federal assistance to pay for such audits. Permits the Director of OMB to arrange an audit of any entity that has failed to comply with the requirements of this Act. States that small business concerns and business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals shall have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in the performance of audits under this Act. Declares that single financial audits conducted in accordance with this Act shall fulfill any other financial audit requirement imposed by the Federal government. Requires the Comptroller General to monitor all reported bills of the House and the Senate and review any audit provisions."
