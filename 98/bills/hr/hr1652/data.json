Provides that, with respect to additional funds authorized by this Act, costs shall be reimbursed where they are incurred in the modification of structures because of new hydrologic or seismic data or changes in state-of-the-art criteria deemed necessary for dam safety. Provides that 15 percent of such costs shall be allocated to the authorized purposes of the structure, except that in the case of Jackson Lake Dam, Minidoka Project, Idaho-Wyoming, such costs shall be allocated in accordance with the allocation of operation and maintenance charges. Requires that costs allocated to irrigation water service and capable of being repaid by the irrigation water users be reimbursed within 50 years of the year in which the work is substantially complete. Provides that costs allocated to irrigation water service which are beyond the water users' ability to pay shall be reimbursed in accordance with existing law. Requires that costs allocated to recreation and wildlife enhancement be reimbursed in accordance with the Federal Water Project Recreation Act. Requires that costs allocated to the purpose of municipal, industrial, and miscellaneous water service, commercial power, and the portion of recreation and fish and wildlife enhancement costs reimbursable under the Federal Water Project Recreation Act be repaid within 50 years with interest. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to negotiate appropriate contracts with project beneficiaries providing for the return of reimbursable costs under such Act. Amends the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978 to authorize additional appropriations to preserve the structural safety of Federal dams. Includes within the scope of such Act: Fish Lake, Four Mile, Ochoco, Savage Rapids Diversion, and Warm Springs Dams, Oregon; Como Dam, Montana; Little Wood River Dam, Idaho; and Coolidge Dam, San Carlos Irrigation Project, Arizona. Requires that certain costs for work planned or underway at Twin Buttes, Texas, and Foss Dam, Oklahoma, be nonreimbursable and nonreturnable under Federal reclamation law.
