    "text": "Older Americans Volunteer Programs Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 to remove gender-based distinctions with respect to the Director of the ACTION agency. Provides that agencies responsible for foster grandparent projects need not consider the interest of such grandparents providing services to a mentally retarded child when determining whether such child can continue in the project after the chronological age of 21. Increases the stipend or allowance for volunteers in such projects from $2 to $2.20. Revises the definition of \"low income person\", \"person of low income\" and \"community action agency\" to conform such terms to provisions of the Community Services Block Grant Act. Authorizes appropriations for the National Older Americans Volunteer Programs for FY 1984 through 1986. Amends the Community Services Block Grant Act to provide that the term \"poverty line\" under such Act means the official poverty line defined by the Office of Management and Budget based on Bureau of the Census data. Requires the use of the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers when revising the poverty line. Amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to require the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to appoint a Deputy Administrator to supervise and direct the National Institute for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. (Currently the Attorney General makes such appointments.) Directs the Speaker of the House of Representatives to make appointments or fill vacancies on the National Advisory Committee for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, if the President does not fill such vacancies within 90 days of their occurrence."
