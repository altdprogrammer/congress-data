    "text": "Methanol Policy Act of 1984 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to require that 1,000 of the total number of passenger automobiles acquired by executive agencies during FY 1985 be methanol-powered vehicles. Requires the Secretary of Energy to demonstrate the performance of methanol-powered vehicles so acquired and to conduct studies with respect to the operation and maintenance of such vehicles. Provides that methanol shall be offered for sale to the public through September 30, 1987, at locations where it is supplied to vehicles acquired by executive agencies. Sets forth reporting requirements which apply to the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for this program. Provides that the following percentages of all automobiles acquired by executive agencies shall be methanol- powered vehicles: (1) ten percent of the automobiles acquired in FY 1988; (2) 20 percent of the automobiles acquired in FY 1989; and (3) 35 percent of the automobiles acquired in each of the fiscal years thereafter. Requires the Secretary to promulgate rules to implement such requirements unless there is evidence of substantial operating and maintenance problems, increases in tailpipe emissions, or increases in operation and maintenance costs with respect to methanol-powered vehicles. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to purchase at least five methanol-powered buses during FY 1985 and to use them in urban settings for emissions and fuel economy testing. Sets forth reporting requirements which apply to the Administrator. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for this program. Provides that buses purchased by State or local governments with Federal funds after September 30, 1987, must be methanol-powered. Requires the Secretary to provide supplemental grants equal to 100 percent of the amount by which the purchase, operation, and maintenance of such methanol-powered buses exceeds the costs of comparable diesel-powered buses. Requires the Secretary to promulgate rules to implement this program unless there is evidence of substantial operating and maintenance problems, increases in tailpipe emissions, or increases in operation and maintenance costs with respect to methanol-powered buses. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990 for this program. Requires the Administrator to administer a program to study and conduct demonstration projects with respect to the use of methanol in stationary turbines and boilers. Sets forth reporting requirements which apply to the Administrator. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for this program. Establishes the Interagency Commission on Methanol to coordinate efforts to promote methanol usage. Requires the Commission to: (1) perform various studies with respect to the production, use, and promotion of methanol as a fuel; (2) develop a plan for the commercialization of methanol; (3) develop a public-awareness program on the use of methanol as a fuel; and (4) coordinate all Federal efforts with respect to methanol. Requires the Chairman of the Commission to establish a private sector advisory panel to inform the Commission about methanol-related matters. Sets forth reporting requirements which apply to the Commission. Terminates the Commission and the advisory panel on September 30, 1989. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1989 for this program. Requires the Administrator to: (1) publish test procedures for emissions testing of new methanol-powered vehicles and engines; and (2) promulgate a rule for determining the quantity of methanol which is equivalent to one gallon of gasoline. Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to include methanol in the definition of \"fuel\" for purposes of such Act."
