    "text": "Makes supplemental appropriations to the Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, for the current fiscal year for: (1) advances to the Unemployment Trust Fund and other funds (to remain available through FY 1984); and (2) grants to States for unemployment insurance and employment services which may be expended from the Employment Security Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund (to remain available for the current fiscal year only). Provides that a specified amount of such appropriations for grants to States shall be available only to the extent necessary to meet increased costs (which cannot be provided for by normal budgetary adjustments): (1) of administration resulting from changes in a State law or increases in the number of unemployment insurance claims filed and claims paid; or (2) of salaries resulting from changes in State salary compensation plans embracing employees of the State generally over those upon which the State's basic grant was based."
