    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-01-03", 
    "text": "Organized Crime Act of 1983 - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties for persons who commit or commission a contract murder, attempted murder, or assault. Provides that a direct or indirect contact between two or more persons involving an offer, agreement, or solicitation to commit a contract murder shall constitute prima facie evidence that the act was commissioned for \"anything of value.\" Applies the penalties for contract murder to whoever uses actual or threatened force to coerce another to commit a murder, attempted murder, or assault in violation of State law. Directs the Attorney General to designate criteria for Federal involvement in the prosecution of contract murders. States that this Act does not preempt State law in this area. Makes it a Federal offense to kill any attorney, agent, or employee of the U.S. Government employed to investigate or prosecute violations of Federal criminal statutes or any employee of the Intelligence Community. Establishes a new offense of assaulting, kidnapping, murdering, or threatening the relative of any Federal employee covered by the current assault statute, with intent to interfere with such employee's official duties. Amends the obstruction of justice statute to expand the class of persons protected from coercion to include potential witnesses and informants (current law protects actual witnesses). Amends the Freedom of Information Act to expand the exception relating to informants to limit disclosure of information which \"tends to disclose\" an informant's identity. Amends the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to permit a court to reduce a sentence of a cooperating defendant upon application of a U.S. Attorney. Authorizes a court to impose additional penalties where a crime is carried out by use of, or threatened use of, violence, or a dangerous weapon or destructive device. Amends the wiretap statute to require a judge to review in camera any information as to previous wiretap applications which might compromise a current or pending case or investigation. Amends the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to permit disclosure of Federal grand jury information to a State or local law enforcement official who is assisting a U.S. Attorney in the enforcement of Federal criminal law. Amends the Bail Reform Act of 1966 to authorize a judicial officer, in making a determination of whether a person charged with a noncapital offense should be released on bail, to consider the safety of any person or the community (in addition to assurance of appearance as currently provided)."
