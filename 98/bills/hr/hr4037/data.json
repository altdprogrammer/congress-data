    "date": "1983-09-29", 
    "text": "Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (\"the Act\") (also known as the Clean Water Act) to provide for State nonpoint source control reports and plans and grants to States for implementation of such plans. Directs the Governor of each State, within 270 days after the enactment of this Act, to prepare and submit for the approval of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency a report on: (1) those portions of the navigable waters within a State that, as a result of pollution from nonpoint sources in whole or in part, are not meeting applicable water quality standards or are not attaining a water quality which ensures protection of public health, use and value for water supply, agricultural, industrial, and other purposes, and propagation of a balanced indigenous population of shellfish, fish, wildlife, and plants and which allows recreational activities in and on the water; (2) those categories and subcategories of nonpoint sources which add significant pollutant loadings to each portion of such waters in amounts which contribute to nonattainment of such water quality or standards; (3) State and local programs for controlling pollutant loadings added from nonpoint sources to such waters, including but not limited to programs receiving Federal assistance under this Act; and (4) the process, including intergovernmental coordination and public participation, for identifying best management practices and measures to control such categories and subcategories of nonpoint sources and to reduce, to the maximum extent practicable, the level of pollution resulting from such categories and subcategories. Requires annual written updates of such reports. Requires that such reports and updates be based on available information. Permits such reports or updates to include all or part of an approved existing water quality management program. Directs the Governor of each State, within 270 days after the enactment of this Act, to prepare and submit for the approval of the Administrator: (1) a plan, developed in cooperation with local agencies and organizations with expertise in control of nonpoint sources of pollution, which the State proposes to implement in the four-fiscal-year period beginning after the date of submission of the report for controlling pollutant loadings added from nonpoint sources to navigable waters within the State; and (2) a report identifying each Federal department, agency, or instrumentality which will be engaging in, supporting, or providing financial assistance for any activity or program within the State during such four-fiscal-year period and which would be inconsistent with plan implementation, and recommending appropriate administrative modification of such program or activity. Requires that such plans include: (1) a list of those waters in the order in which the State plans to begin control during such period, and of those categories and subcategories for which control measures are to be implemented; (2) a description of proposed best management practices to be implemented in each fiscal year of such period; (3) a schedule requiring each category and subcategory to implement such practices as expeditiously as possible, indicating estimated dates for such implementation; (4) an identification of methods to encourage, assist, or require such implementation; (5) an identification, description, and estimated cost of practices and measures to be implemented with Federal assistance under this Act in each such year; (6) an identification of other sources of Federal and other assistance available in each such year for supporting such proposed State programs and a description of the purposes for which such assistance will be used; and (7) a certification by the State attorney general or the head attorney of the State water pollution control agency that State laws provide adequate authority to carry out such programs or a list of any additional authority needed. Requires annual updates of the information on sources of assistance. Requires each State to report annually to the Administrator on activities and programs carried out under the plan in the preceding fiscal year and the progress made in meeting the schedule. Directs the Administrator to consolidate and submit recommendations for modifications of Federal activities and programs submitted by the States to the appropriate Federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalites. Directs such entities to carry out their activities and programs in a manner consistent with the approved State plan and helpful to its implementation. Requires States to utilize local agencies and organizations with expertise in nonpoint source pollution control, to the maximum extent practicable, in identifying and implementing best management practices and measures. Sets forth procedures and deadlines for approval, disapproval, or revision of reports, plans, and updates. Directs the Administrator to provide technical assistance to local agencies or organizations in developing plans, whenever a State fails to submit or the Administrator does not approve a plan. Makes such local agencies or organizations eligible to receive implementation assistance after development of such plan. Directs the Administrator, upon State request, to provide technical assistance to a State in developing a plan. Sets forth requirements for State petitions, interstate management conferences and agreements, and State plans for reduction of interstate water pollution from nonpoint sources. Directs the Administrator, upon State application, to make grants to each State for which a report, or update, and a plan is approved for any fiscal year. Provides that such grants shall be made to carry out in any fiscal year such plan for controlling nonpoint source pollution of navigable waters. Makes the Federal share equal to 50 percent of the cost of each plan. Limits administrative costs (except costs of implementing enforcement and regulatory activities, education, training, technical assistance, or technology transfer programs) to ten percent of the grant amount. Sets forth maintenance of effort requirements for such grants. Limits to 15 percent of the amount appropriated for such grants the amount which may be used to make grants to any one State, including any grants to any local agency or organization with authority to control pollution from nonpoint sources in any area in such State. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for FY 1984 through 1988. Directs the Administrator, by January 1, 1985, and each January 1 thereafter, to report to specified congressional committees on the activities carried out under this Act for the preceding fiscal year and the progress made in reducing nonpoint source pollution in the navigable waters. Directs the Administrator, by January 1, 1988, to transmit a final report to Congress on the activities carried out under this Act, with specified analyses and recommendations. Directs the Administrator to maintain personnel levels at the Environmental Protection Agency which are adequate to carry out this Act. Includes plans approved under this Act under provisions of the Act for agreements with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Army, and the Interior to provide maximum utilization of programs to achieve and maintain water quality. Extends through FY 1988 the authorization of appropriations for transfers of funds relating to such agreements."
