Authorizes the use of up to 300,000 metric tons from the Food Security Wheat Reserve if CCC wheat stocks are inadequate for such distribution program. Requires: (1) such wheat to be replenished by December 31, 1984; and (2) CCC funds to be used to replenish such Reserve if CCC wheat stocks are inadequate. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to publish in the Federal Register, beginning with FY 1984, an annual estimate of available commodities and an estimate of CCC stocks and their anticipated dispositions other than for such program. States that commodities shall be distributed according to recipient request, and that the Secretary shall not limit such distribution on the basis of types of recipients. Provides for State distribution of such commodities. Declares that the Secretary shall distribute commodities directly in those States where State agencies are prohibited from so doing. Gives priority to emergency organizations. Directs the CCC to pay initial processing, packaging, and delivery costs. Permits such payments to be made \"in-kind\" (except for Reserve wheat) as long as no commercial sales are displaced. Directs the CCC to pay up to $50,000,000 of State agency expenses. Gives priority to emergency organizations. States that the remaining funds will be used equitably between emergency and nonemergency organizations. Makes a technical amendment regarding the authorization of such program's administrative expenses. Prohibits States from charging recipient agencies for any program costs. Directs the CCC to encourage commodity use by distributing commodities to private companies for processing into food products for recipient agencies. States that such agencies shall bear processing costs, except that the CCC shall make up to $10,000,000 available annually to cover emergency organization expenses. Directs the Secretary to: (1) inform State agencies about such program by August 1, 1983; and (2) begin commodity distributions and issue implementing regulations by October 1, 1983. States that: (1) such program shall supplement, and not supplant, other Federal, State, or local nutrition programs; and (2) commodities shall not be considered income under Federal, State, or local law. Permits program distributions to be carried out in areas where the food stamp plan is operating. Prohibits program commodities from being sold or commercially disposed of in any form. Terminates such program at the end of FY 1985. Extends specified criminal provisions concerning misuse of donated commodities under the Agriculture and Consumer Act of 1973 to such program. Directs the Secretary to continue: (1) maintaining the Department of Agriculture nutrient data base; (2) periodic nutrition surveillance of certain assisted subgroups; and (3) report annually to the appropriate congressional committees."
