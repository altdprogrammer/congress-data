Declares that such volunteers shall be considered to be Federal employees only under provisions concerning tort claims and worker's compensation. Directs agencies to provide such volunteers and nonprofit organizations funds to pay necessary expenses for performing any such activity. Prohibits the dismissal of any agency employee or the impairment of any service contract as a result of an agency utilizing volunteer services. Authorizes agencies to give preference to grant applicants who use volunteer services most extensively. Authorizes each agency to use one percent of the funds appropriated to it for general administrative and operating expenses each fiscal year to carry out this Act. Directs the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to report to Congress biennially on the volunteer services and savings resulting from implementation of this Act."
