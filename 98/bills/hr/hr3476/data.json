    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-06-30", 
    "text": "Amends the Clean Air Act to repeal the new motor vehicle emission standards in certain States with respect to model years beginning after enactment of this Act. Repeals the requirement that new motor vehicles shall be sold with a production warranty and parts certification with respect to model years beginning after enactment of this Act. Requires the manufacture's performance warranty to cover the vehicle's first two years or first 24,000 miles, whichever occurs first. (Currently the warranty covers the useful life of the vehicle.) Deletes the provision which declares that no such warranty shall be invalid on the basis of any part used in the maintenance or repair of a vehicle or engine if such part was certified. Deletes the provision which defines emission control device or system for purposes of such warranty. Deletes the requirement that the maintenance instruction which the manufacturer must furnish with each new motor vehicle shall correspond to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. Requires that the maintenance instructions provide notice that maintenance, replacement, or repair of the emission control devices and systems may be performed by any automobile automotive repair establishment or individual using any automotive part of the establishment's or individual's choosing. Deletes the waiver of the prohibition against the instructions including a condition that the purchaser must use a component or service identified by brand name or distinguishing between service performed by establishments affiliated with the manufacturer and independent establishments. Eliminates the prohibition against causing specified prohibited acts relating to the provision, use, maintenance, or inspection of emission control devices. Prohibits specified persons from knowingly removing or rendering inoperative any part or component placed in or on a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine solely to control emissions in compliance with EPA regulations, except in connection with routine maintenance."
