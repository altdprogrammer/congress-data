Requires the program to include the following activities: (1) the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of certain facilities; (2) the establishment of a procedure to monitor the effectiveness of the rehabilitation; and (3) such other activities as the Secretary determines to be necessary. Directs the Secretary to use a specified fish and wildlife management program that has already been developed for the Basin as a basis for the management program. Establishes the Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Task force to assist the Secretary in establishing the management program. Authorizes appropriations for: (1) design and construction; and (2) operations, maintenance, and monitoring. Prohibits the expenditure of any monies so appropriated and the expenditure of any monies for carrying out Grass Valley Creek activities until the Secretary receives assurances that: (1) the State of California and the counties of Humboldt and Trinity will pay the Federal government annually 15 percent of such expenditures; and (2) the direct purchasers of water and power from the Trinity river division of the Central Valley Project will pay the Federal government 50 percent of the total expenditures made under this Act. Prohibits the expenditure of any funds for Trinity River construction activities below the confluence of Grass Valley Creek and the Trinity River until the construction of the Grass Valley debris dam is completed."
