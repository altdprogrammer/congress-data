    "text": "Native American Programs Act Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Native American Programs Act of 1974 to state that decisions to grant financial assistance shall not consider whether such aid accrues to the benefit of Indians who are not members of a federally recognized tribe. Prohibits the rejection of financial assistance solely on the grounds that the request serves Indians or an Indian organization in a nonreservation area. Requires that programs under this Act be administered within the Department of Health and Human Services. (Currently they may be delegated to other Federal departments and agencies.) Prohibits any transfer of such administration outside of the Department. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to continue the administration of grants through the Administration for Native Americans (the Administration). Requires the Commission of such Administration to delegate all functions within the Administration. Restricts the delegation and redelegation of functions by the Secretary to personnel within the Department. Permits interagency funding agreements between the Administration and other Federal agencies. Specifies the percentage of appropriated funds which shall be used for financial assistance under this Act."
