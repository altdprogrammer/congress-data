    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1984-09-20", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 1984 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation, within 60 days of enactment of this Act, to issue a final rule or regulation to ensure the prevention of alcohol and drug use in railroad operations. Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 to direct the Secretary, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, to issue such rules, regulations, orders, and standards as necessary to: (1) ensure the safe maintenance, inspection, and testing of signal systems at rail-highway crossings; and (2) define qualification standards for employees who conduct railroad power brake and freight car inspections. Prohibits the closing or moving of a maintenance shop at Bristol, Pennsylvania, and support facilities at Cornwells Heights, Pennsylvania, for a period of six months after enactment of this Act. Directs the Board of Directors of Amtrak (the National Railroad Passenger Corporation) to report to Congress by March 1, 1985, on any plans to close or move such shop and the potential impact of such closing on safety operations between New York and Baltimore. Requires the National Railroad Adjustment Board to resolve any dispute, grievance, or claim within 180 days after its filing with such Board. Authorizes the Board to award an aggrieved employee compensation equivalent to one year's pay, if the violation is a certain form of discrimination. Authorizes a railroad employee to commence a civil action to compel the Secretary to perform an act related to enforcement under the Federal railroad safety laws, if such act is not discretionary, and if the failure to perform such act creates a danger of serious injury or death to such employee. Requires such action to be brought in the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia, or the U.S. district court for the judicial district where the alleged violation occurred. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 and 1986 for: (1) Federal railroad safety provisions; (2) State safety programs; (3) research and development activities; and (4) rail planning for Toledo, Ohio. Directs the Secretary to evaluate the employee assistance program related to drug and alcohol abuse operated by the Consolidated Rail Corporation and report to Congress on its effectiveness. Directs the Secretary to encourage the establishment of a private, nonprofit corporation, financially supported by individual railroad employees and companies, to support and promote specified items relating to alcohol and drug abuse assistance. Directs the Secretary, within 180 days of enactment, to: (1) issue rules, regulations, orders, and standards as necessary to insure safe rail operations, giving special consideration to track inspections, weather information, and passenger car crashworthiness; and (2) report to Congress on an inquiry into whether training standards are necessary for train dispatchers. Requires that all sections of the mainline of the Northeast Corridor between Boston, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C., be equipped with automatic block signals with cab signalling before December 31, 1985, in accordance with a specified plan. Authorizes the Secretary to recommend that Congress provide funding for the relocation (or other remedial measure) of facilities which may create a hazard to Amtrak passengers, employees, or property. Provides for the sale of Consolidated Rail Corporation property in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Washington, D.C. Requires Amtrak to reinstitute rail passenger service between Tampa and Saint Petersburg, Florida, within 30 days of enactment of this Act. Requires the Secretary, within 180 days of enactment, to report to Congress on a study comparing railroad industry investments in track and roadbed maintenance and modernization before and after the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. Amends the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act to extend the deadline of certain employee protections from April 1, 1984, to April 1, 1985."
