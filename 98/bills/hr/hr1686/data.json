Provides that the maximum lawful price, per million Btu's, under this Act shall be: (1) in the case of any contract entered into on or before such effective date, the price applicable under the contract for deliveries on January 1, 1983; and (2) in the case of any contract entered into after such effective date, the maximum lawful price determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be applicable under the wellhead pricing provisions for deliveries of the category of natural gas involved which occurred on January 1, 1983, or in the case of high-cost natural gas the maximum lawful price which would have been applicable if such natural gas were not decontrolled. Authorizes the purchaser under a market-out clause, subject to stated limitations, without obligation to pay, to exercise a right not to accept delivery of any portion of the volumes of natural gas the purchaser has contracted to accept if the purchaser has determined that the total volume of natural gas contract for cannot be marketed."
