    "text": "Anti-Arson Act of 1983 - Establishes an Interagency Committee on Arson Prevention and Control to coordinate Federal anti-arson programs and to provide assistance to State and local governments for the prevention and control of arson. Requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to to develop and prepare a special statistical report on arson in cooperation with the National Fire Data Center. Directs the Administrator of the United States Fire Administration to: (1) conduct a research program for the development of techniques and equipment for use by State and local fire fighting and law enforcement personnel for arson prediction, prevention, and control; (2) establish anti-arson educational and training programs for State and local government; (3) develop materials for community awareness programs; and (4) provide information relative to the prevention, prediction, occurrence, and control of arson. Authorizes appropriations for such purposes. Amends the National Housing Act to provide that fair access to insurance requirements plans shall require policies to be issued only after insurers obtain information from a prospective policyholder with respect to arson. Entitles insurers to request information from a State insurance authority about a prospective policyholder whose property the insurer has reason to believe has suffered possible arson destruction within the previous ten years. Allows an insurer, subject to State insurance authority approval, to set procedures for cancelling any policy where the insurer has found that continuing coverage runs a demonstrable risk of arson."
