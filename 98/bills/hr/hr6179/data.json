Permits a waiver of such restriction by a two-thirds vote of the Members voting. Permits a Member to require a recorded vote to proceed to consider any bill, resolution, or amendment which breaches an allocation or subdivision made by a committee. Permits each congressional committee, at any time, to revise the subdivisions made by it."
