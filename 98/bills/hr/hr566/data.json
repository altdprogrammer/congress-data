Sets forth factors for dividing such funds among the States. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to appoint a forest resources council. Requires such council to report annually to the Secretary on the status of regional and national planning of forestry research by Federal and State agencies, forestry schools, and the forest industries. Authorizes: (1) grants for doctorate forestry programs; and (2) appropriations beginning with FY 1984. Amends the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 to permit the Secretary to make cooperative extension grants for innovative forestry and rangeland projects. Directs the Secretary to establish a peer review system to evaluate proposed projects. Authorizes appropriations beginning with FY 1985."
