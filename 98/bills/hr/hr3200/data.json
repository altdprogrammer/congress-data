    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1983-06-02", 
    "text": "Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1983 - Title I: Public Water Systems - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate recommended maximum contaminant levels and revised national primary drinking water regulations within specified time periods for: (1) each of 14 contaminants listed in 47 Federal Register 9352; (2) toxic water pollutants which are found in drinking water; and (3) other substances which may have an adverse effect on the health of persons. Sets forth requirements with respect to such contaminant levels and drinking water regulations. Requires the Administrator to list a contaminant and promulgate a revised drinking water regulation for such contaminant which requires the use of treatment techniques if such contaminant cannot be accurately enough measured in water to establish a maximum contaminant level. Authorizes the Administrator to enter into arrangements with independent scientific organizations to assist in the establishment of recommended maximum contaminant levels. Requires the Administrator to establish a program which shall require a representative sample of various public water systems to monitor for unregulated contaminants. Directs the Administrator to require the owner or operator of a public water system to give notice to persons served by it of contaminant levels of any unregulated contaminants required to be monitored. Requires the Administrator to enforce compliance with national primary drinking water regulations through civil actions or administrative orders with respect to public water systems, unless there is in effect a variance or an exemption. Revises the compliance schedules in the case of public water systems which have been granted an exemption from compliance with interim or revised national primary drinking water regulations. Permits extensions of such exemptions in certain cases. Sets forth procedural requirements with respect to administrative orders issued to enforce compliance with regulations, schedules, or other requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Directs the Administrator to seek an injunction or to recover a civil penalty; or both, with respect to any person who fails to comply with such an administrative order. Prohibits any action by the Administrator, by a State, or by a court which would delay or make less stringent any requirement of a primary national drinking water standard. Permits the Administrator to commence a civil action or to issue an administrative order to enforce compliance in the case of a public water system which fails to comply with a national primary drinking water regulation beyond the thirtieth day after the date of a notice of noncompliance by the Administrator to the State having primary enforcement responsibility over such public water system. Authorizes the Administrator to provide technical assistance to small public water systems to enable them to achieve and maintain compliance with national drinking water regulations. Authorizes appropriations for such assistance for FY 1984 through 1987. Authorizes the Administrator to require, as a condition of a State exercising primary enforcement responsibility with respect to national drinking water regulations, that the State carry out technical assistance programs for small public water systems which are substantially similar to the Federal program. Provides that, in requiring a public water system to keep records with respect to the compliance with national primary drinking water regulations, the Administrator shall take into account the system size and the contaminants which are likely to be found in the system's drinking water. Sets forth criminal penalties for tampering with a public water system. Provides that notice by the owner or operator of a public water system which fails to comply with national primary drinking water regulations to the persons served by such system shall provide an explanation of such failure, the steps being taken to correct such failure, and the groups which should seek alternative water supplies until such failure is corrected. Requires each owner or operator of a public water system to also give annual notice to the persons served by it of the availability to the public of records and reports kept by such system with respect to compliance with the national primary drinking water regulations. Permits civil actions by public water systems and any other persons against any persons who are causing or contributing to the presence of a contaminant in the drinking water used by such systems or other persons if such contamination results in the water supply not meeting national primary drinking water regulations. Title II: Protection of Underground Sources of Drinking Water - Prohibits the disposal of hazardous waste by underground injection above, into, or under a formation which contains a drinking water source, unless it is established that such injection will not cause the hazardous waste to migrate into or otherwise endanger drinking water sources. Requires State underground injection programs to prohibit the disposal of brine brought to the surface in connection with oil by any means other than underground injection in compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act. Defines the term \"drinking water source\" as underground water which supplies a public water system, is capable of supplying a public water system, or could supply a public water system if the system used technologically advanced treatment. Requires the Administrator to publish notice in the Federal Register if an area has an aquifer which furnishes or may furnish in the future a substantial part of the drinking water supply for any public water system and which would create a significant hazard to the public health if contaminated. Permits Federal financial assistance for projects which are designed not to contaminate such an aquifer. Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations for State programs to prevent surface impoundments which are not subject to regulation under the Solid Waste Disposal Act from endangering drinking water sources. Permits States to apply to exercise primary enforcement responsibility. Requires the Administrator to prescribe a program for a State if no State program is approved. Permits States to submit to the Administrator plans to protect underground drinking water sources. Authorizes the Administrator to provide technical assistance and to make grants to the States to assist them in the development of such plans. Requires that Federal actions with respect to underground drinking water sources in a State be coordinated with the State protection program. Authorizes the Administrator to issue an administrative order to enforce compliance with underground injection control program requirements. Sets forth procedural requirements with respect to such administrative orders. Directs the Administrator to seek an injunction or to recover a civil penalty, or both, with respect to any person who fails to comply with such an administrative order. Prohibits any action by the Administrator, by a State, or by a court which would delay or make less stringent any requirement of an underground injection control program. Permits the Administrator to commence a civil action or to issue an administrative order to enforce compliance in the case of any person who fails to comply with underground injection control program requirements beyond the thirtieth day after the date of a notice of noncompliance by the Administrator to the State having primary enforcement responsibility for underground water sources. Title III: Authorization of Appropriations - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1989 for: (1) the provision of research, technical assistance, information, and training of personnel to the States and municipalities to implement the Safe Drinking Water Act; and (2) grants to States for public water system supervision programs and underground water source protection programs. Extends indefinitely the authority of the Administrator to issue certifications of need and orders for the provision of chemicals necessary for the treatment of water."
