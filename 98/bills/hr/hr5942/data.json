Requires a consumer reporting agency that records and retains any information regarding an adverse rental action to make a clear and accurate disclosure to the consumer involved. Sets forth information which a consumer reporting agency must disclose to a consumer when the agency furnishes a report to a person in connection with the consumer's rental of any property as a principal place of residence. Requires the user of a consumer report that results in an adverse rental action to inform the consumer of the name and address of the consumer reporting agency making the report."
