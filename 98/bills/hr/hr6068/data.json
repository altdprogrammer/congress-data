Requires State law to cover railroad workers for purposes of receiving certification by the Secretary of Labor each October 31. Establishes rules for determining the State in which an employee will be covered for unemployment insurance. Sets forth transitional rules for implementing these provisions. Provides that States shall be entitled to reimbursement for benefits which they are required to pay which are based on wages and services previously covered under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. Provides for payment to States to assist with the administrative costs of administering the transitional provisions. Title II: Railroad Sickness Insurance - Grants the Railroad Retirement Board authority to enter into an agreement to administer a sickness benefits plan for employees under certain conditions."
