    "text": "Nuclear Explosives Control Act of 1983 - Amends the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 to prohibit the export of any major critical component of any facility for, and any sensitive nuclear technology or other assistance important to, isotopic separation of special nuclear material, nuclear fuel reprocessing, or heavy water production. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to authorize the Secretary of Energy to grant approval under an international agreement for the reprocessing, use, or retransfer of separated plutonium which is produced from U.S. exports, only if: (1) the separated plutonium is intended for research and development in operational facilities located in a nuclear-weapon state or a state which meets other specified criteria; (2) there are already existing stocks of separated plutonium reasonably available for the end use requested; (3) in the case of requests for reprocessing, the reprocessing will take place in a nuclear-weapon state or in a state which meets specified criteria and only in a facility in operation or under construction as of the date of enactment of this Act; and (4) adequate security measures will be maintained. Requires these conditions to remain in effect unless and until Congress finds that: (1) effective international safeguards will be applied with respect to the reprocessing of special nuclear material and to separated plutonium; and (2) effective international sanctions against violations of non- proliferation commitments have been established to deter nonnuclear weapon states from diverting special nuclear material or separated plutonium to build nuclear explosive devices. Authorizes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to issue export licenses for highly enriched uranium for nuclear reactors, only if: (1) there is no alternative nuclear reactor fuel available; (2) the proposed recipient of the uranium has indicated that it will use an alternative nuclear reactor fuel when one becomes available; and (3) the executive branch is developing an alternative nuclear reactor fuel. Requires the NRC to determine a kilogram limit on the amount of highly enriched uranium of U.S. origin that will be allowed at any one time in each foreign country and at each reactor site in each such country. Directs the President to submit to Congress, within three months of enactment of this Act, a plan for the development and use of alternative nuclear reactor fuels. Declares that the objective of the plan shall be to convert to alternative nuclear reactor fuels all reactors which are operated with highly enriched uranium exported from the United States. Lists information that shall be included in the plan. Prohibits the Secretary from entering into arrangements for the retransfer of any exported nuclear material to a third country for reprocessing, for the reprocessing of any such material, or for the subsequent retransfer of plutonium in quantities greater than 500 grams resulting from reprocessing such material, unless the nation requesting such arrangements agrees to specified conditions. Amends the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 to require the Secretary of State to enter into agreements with other nations under which, if such nations agree not to obtain or use any facility for nuclear fuel reprocessing or uranium enrichment and not to seek or use separated plutonium or plutonium-based fuels, the United States will: (1) provide, at a discounted price, the fuel for all power reactors in such nations; (2) provide an additional discount for the enrichment of uranium which such nations agree to use in improved power reactor fuel; (3) authorize the export of a lifetime supply of low-enriched fuel under a single export license subject to specified conditions; and (4) enter into a technical assistance program aimed at increasing uranium fuel efficiency, resolving spent fuel storage problems, and developing nonnuclear energy resources. Requires the Secretary of Energy to submit, within three months of enactment of this Act, a plan for implementing the fuel assurance and energy assistance program. Lists information to be included in the plan. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes appropriations for technical assistance to nonnuclear weapons states for spent fuel storage and disposal under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. Amends the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 to authorize appropriations for energy assistance to developing countries. Requires the NRC and the executive branch to support efforts to improve security arrangements for nuclear exports. Authorizes appropriations to carry out U.S. initiatives to strengthen the international safeguards system. Requires the President to include in the annual report to Congress on efforts to prevent proliferation a description of the progress made in negotiating fuel assurance and technical assistance agreements. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to prohibit the production of special nuclear material outside the United States unless, in addition to other requirements, there is in effect an agreement for cooperation made pursuant to such Act with the country in which the production will take place and the production is authorized by the Secretary of Energy. Requires such authorizations by the Secretary of Energy to be published in the Federal Register. Lists information to be included in the President's annual report to Congress on efforts to prevent proliferation. Sets forth the method for making the authorization of the Secretary of Energy effective with respect to nonnuclear weapon States. Requires that the Secretary of Defense find that a proposed international cooperation agreement or a subsequent arrangement will not be inimical to the common defense and security of the United States before the proposed agreement or arrangement is submitted to the President. Authorizes the Secretary of State to notify the NRC of the judgment of the executive branch on a proposed export license for nuclear material only if the Secretary has received from the Secretary of Defense a written statement that the Secretary of Defense agrees with that judgment. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to enter into an arrangement for reprocessing or retransferring exported nuclear material only if the Secretary has received from the Secretary of Defense a statement to the effect that the proposed reprocessing or retransfer will not result in a significant increase of the risk of proliferation. Prohibits the Secretary of Commerce from issuing a validated export license for the export to a nonnuclear-weapon state of goods or technology which are to be used in a production or utilization facility or which are likely to be used in connection with such a facility unless the Secretary of Energy determines that the United States has an agreement for cooperation with such state and the state adheres to specified criteria. Prohibits the export of components of certain nuclear production or utilization facilities unless the NRC issues a general or specific export license based on a reasonable judgment that the nation to which the components will be exported has an agreement for cooperation with the United States and adheres to specified criteria and the NRC has determined that the issuance of the license will not be inimical to the common defense and security. Authorizes the transfer or retransfer outside the United States of any nuclear material, production or utilization facility, sensitive nuclear technology, or component only if authorized under an agreement for cooperation and licensed by the NRC. Requires such transfers or retransfers to be considered to be exports for the purposes of specified sections of the Atomic Energy Act. Prohibits the issuance of validated export licenses for exports of goods or technology to be used in nuclear production or utilization facilities in countries whose conduct prevents the export of nuclear materials and equipment or sensitive nuclear technology. Requires that Congress adopt a concurrent resolution favoring the determination to halt such exports or the issuance of such validated licenses before such decision becomes effective."
