    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1984-06-27", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Title I: Amends the Marine Protection Act of 1972 to require the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to obtain documentation from foreign nations wishing to import yellowfin tuna into the United States that such foreign tuna fishing operations are conducted: (1) under a regulatory program for governing the incidental taking of marine mammals which is comparable to the U.S. program; and (2) with an average rate of incidental taking which is also comparable to the U.S. program. Extends the marine mammal permit held by the American Tunaboat Association. Subjects such extension to specified conditions. Requires the Secretary to carry out a program of research on marine mammal populations to monitor the effect yellowfin tuna fishing is having on them. Directs the Secretary to take appropriate action upon a determination that such populations are being adversely affected due to incidental taking during such yellowfin tuna fishing. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress annually on the results of such research program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1988 for such program. Requires the President to make selections for membership on the Marine Mammal Commission from a list submitted by the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality and unanimously agreed upon by the heads of specified agencies. Requires the Commission to be staffed at a level no fewer than 11 employees. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1988 to the Departments of Commerce and Interior for activities under title I of the Act and to the Marine Mammal Commission for activities under title II of the Act. Amends the Fishery Conservation Zone Transition Act to extend international fishery agreements with the Soviet Union, Poland, and the European Economic Community. Title II: Provides for the establishment of a National Coastal Resources Research and Development Institute (Institute) to be administered by the Oregon State Marine Science Center. Provides for a Director and a Board of Governors for the Institute and for an Advisory Council for such Board. Authorizes appropriations for the Institute. Delays the finality of specified flood evaluation determinations made by the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency with respect to a specified parish in Louisiana. Title III: Amends the Fisherman's Protective Act of 1967 to extend the authorization for the voluntary insurance program designed to compensate U.S. fishing vessel owners and crews who suffer financial losses due to seizure of their vessels by foreign governments on the basis of jurisdictional claims not recognized by the United States. Consolidates in the Secretary of State the determination and certification of payments due a vessel owner to cover any fine or direct charge paid in order to secure release of a vessel or crew. Authorizes the Secretary of State to take certain actions on behalf of the owners and crews of U.S. vessels seized by foreign governments if the seizure was based on claims to jurisdiction recognized by the United States but exercised in a way inconsistent with U.S. recognized international law. Title IV: Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Act - Amends Federal law relating to shipping in order to: (1) add the definitions of \"fish\", \"fishing vessel\", \"fish processing vessel\", and \"fish tender vessel\"; and (2) revise the definition of \"passenger\" to include, with certain exceptions, individuals on such vessels. Adds, with certain exceptions, fish processing and fish tender vessels to the list of vessels subject to inspection. Requires the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating (the Secretary) to consult with the private sector before prescribing rules for fish processing or fish tender vessels. Adds a new chapter to such Federal law directing the Secretary to prescribe certain safety regulations for uninspected fish processing vessels. Authorizes compliance equivalency for such vessels, and sets forth civil penalties for noncompliance. Allows oral examinations for licenses to serve on a fish, fish processing, or fish tender vessel which is not required to be inspected. Creates an \"able seaman - fishing industry\" category of able seamen. Sets forth qualifications and requirements for such category. Requires a specified number of watches on certain fish processing vessels. Allows certain fish, fish processing, or fish tender vessels to transport cargo to or from a place in Alaska not receiving weekly transportation service from a U.S. port."
