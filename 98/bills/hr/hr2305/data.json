    "text": "Clean Water Compliance Date Extension Act - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act) to extend the compliance dates for specified point source effluent limitations involving: (1) best available technology for toxic and conventional pollutants; (2) best practicable technology, in guidelines promulgated after January 1, 1982; or (3) permits issued after January 1, 1982, based on best engineering judgment for pollutants for which guidelines have not been established. Allows such deadlines to be extended to the later of July 1, 1986, or 36 months after the establishment of such effluent limitation or permit issuance. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or the State to extend such compliance until an appropriate time no later than the later of December 31, 1986, or the last day of the 42-month period beginning on the date of such establishment, upon satisfactory showings by point source owners or operators that they will be unable to comply with deadlines under this Act due to circumstances beyond their control and despite their good faith efforts."
