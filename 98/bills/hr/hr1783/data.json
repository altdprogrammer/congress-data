Applies this crime to dealers whose business affects commerce, who purchase precious items from the public, but excludes purchase from wholesalers. Includes as prohibited transactions: (1) purchasing a precious item from a person under the age of 18 or from a person who fails to present identification; (2) failing to keep records or refusing access to records to law enforcement officers; (3) making payment other than by check or other draft; (4) failing to retain the item for seven days; or (5) purchasing an item from a person who is intoxicated or under the influence of a controlled substance. Makes a dealer who commits a violation of this Act, knowing that the item was stolen, embezzled, or converted, civilly liable to the victim of such crime."
