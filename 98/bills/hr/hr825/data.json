Requires that at least six percent of the total amounts appropriated for State vocational education programs be reserved to carry out vocational guidance activities. Revises provisions for State allotments to allot specified funds as follows: (1) 42 percent on the basis of population age 11 to 17; (2) 28 percent on the basis of population age 18 to 34; and (3) 15 percent on the basis of population age 35 or older. Includes vocational guidance requirements in provisions for: (1) State and local advisory councils; (2) State applications; (3) five-year State plans; (4) Federal and State evaluations; (5) basic grant uses; (6) cooperative vocational education programs; (7) residential vocational schools; (8) research programs; (9) exemplary and innovative programs; (10) curriculum development; and (11) personnel training. Sets forth required components of vocational guidance and counseling programs under the basic grant program. (Makes all activities listed in current vocational guidance and counseling provisions of such Act required activities under the basic grant program.) Requires, insofar as practicable, that vocational guidance and counseling programs include additional activities in which individuals from various occupations come to the schools and in which students and counselors have work-site experiences."
