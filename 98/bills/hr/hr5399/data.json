Prohibits reprogramming or fund transfers except in restricted circumstances. Authorizes appropriations for the design and construction of a new building at the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters compound. Authorizes additional sums for the conduct of counter terrorist activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence to employ civilian personnel in excess of the ceiling for such personnel when necessary to the performance of important intelligence functions. Requires notice to the appropriate congressional committees whenever such authority is exercised. Title II: Intelligence Community Staff - Authorizes appropriations for Intelligence Community Staff for FY 1985.

Title III: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund. Title IV: Administrative Provisions Relating to Intelligence Agencies - Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1946 to allow the Director to appoint security personnel at agency installations. Title V: Defense Intelligence Agency Personnel Management Improvements - Revises certain management policies regarding civilian personnel within the Defense Intelligence Agency (including hiring and compensation). Exempts the Defense Intelligence Agency from civil service laws. Permits the Defense Intelligence Agency to withhold disclosure of information on its organization, function or personnel except for information required by the National Security Act of 1947.

Title VI: Counterintelligence and Official Representation - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the numbers, status, privileges and immunities within the United States of official representatives of any foreign government engaged in intelligence activities harmful to U.S. security should not exceed the respective numbers, status, privileges and immunities within such country of official representatives of the United States.

Requires either the Deputy Director or the Director of the Office of Foreign Missions to have served in the Foreign Service, while the other has served in the United States Intelligence Community.
