Permits the Federal Trade Commission, on or after the date the Commission issues a complaint with respect to a sale, distribution, or production of counterfeit goods, to proceed against the counterfeit goods by process of libel for their seizure and condemnation in any district court within the jurisdiction of which such goods are found. Permits the Commission to order counterfeit goods detained for a certain period. Defines \"counterfeit goods or services\" with respect to trademark, patent, and copyright law. Title II: Amendments to the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act and the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939 - Amends the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act and the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939 to require a textile fiber or wool product processed or manufactured in the United States to be so identified. Requires the product, as well as the package in which it is contained, to be labeled as to country origin. Provides that this Act shall not be construed as requiring such labeling on each hosiery product contained in a package that is so labeled. Requires catalog sales descriptions and other advertisements for textile and wool products to contain country of origin information. Requires that the identification label or imported textile and wool products be affixed to the most conspicuous place on the inner side of the product."
