Requires yearly one percent increases until the percentage carried on U.S.-flag ships reaches 20 percent. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to prepare annual estimates of current and projected costs of U.S.-flag bulk ship operation and shipbuilding. Requires anyone engaged in importing or exporting bulk commodities in U.S. foreign commerce whose business volume exceeds $1,000,000 annually to report to the Secretary of Commerce on the percentage of such person's exports and imports carried on U.S.-flag ships. Requires that such importer or exporter use U.S.-flag ships for the percentage of shipping required under this Act or be subject to specified penalties. Sets forth procedures for the investigation and prosecution of violations of this Act."
