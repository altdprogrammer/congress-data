Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish procedures to: (1) ensure compliance with such requirement; and (2) ensure that the provision of such assistance to families and persons who are not very low-income families and persons is not delayed because of such requirement. Directs the Secretary to give a priority to processing assistance applications submitted by very low-income families and persons. Repeals a requirement that at least 30 percent of the dwelling units financed with such assistance in each State be made available only to very low-income persons. Authorizes the Secretary to adjust income levels for \"low-income\" and \"very low-income\" persons and families for purposes of assistance eligibility when necessary because of prevailing levels of construction costs, unusually high or low family incomes, or other factors."
