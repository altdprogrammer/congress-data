Sets forth application requirements. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress by December 30, 1985, and December 30, 1987, regarding such programs' effectiveness. Makes Indian tribes eligible for such grants. Authorizes FY 1985 through 1987 appropriations. Authorizes FY 1985 through 1987 appropriations for preventive health services: (1) to immunize against vaccine-preventable diseases; and (2) for tuberculosis.
