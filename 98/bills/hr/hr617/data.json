Requires, under such procedure, the Secretary of the Interior to determine whether or not a foreign country permits U.S. citizens mineral leasing rights similar to those provided by the United States to foreign citizens. Directs the Secretary to submit such determination to Congress. Provides that such determination shall be effective only if neither House of Congress passes a resolution, within 90 days of receiving such determination, disapproving such determination."
