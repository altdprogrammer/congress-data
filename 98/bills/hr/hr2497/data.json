Directs the Secretary of Transportation to grant such exemption for safety considerations and highway structural integrity. Sets forth the procedure for States to obtain such exemption. Prohibits States from imposing a vehicle length limitation of less than 28 feet on semitrailers or trailers of double bottom trucks operating on exempted highways. Directs the Secretary to provide for a study of the effects of double bottom trucks on the Interstate Highway System. (Currently the Secretary monitors such effects). Requires a report to the Secretary and Congress on the results of such study not later than January 31, 1985."
