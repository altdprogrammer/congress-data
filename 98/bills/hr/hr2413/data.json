Directs the President to adjust such additional duty based upon the environmental costs of production in the United States and in foreign countries. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to determine such costs. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe a procedure by which interested parties may propose an adjustment in such duties. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to prohibit the President from designating the copper articles subject to the additional duty as eligible for duty-free treatment."
