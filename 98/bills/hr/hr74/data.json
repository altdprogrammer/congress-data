Authorizes appropriations for such assistance. Requires such assistance to be administered by the Administrator of the Agency for International Development, in consultation with an advisory board appointed by the President after consultation with Congress. Permits the obligation of funds for such assistance only if Congress does not adopt a concurrent resolution disapproving the proposed use of the funds."
