    "text": "Nuclear Energy Reappraisal Act of 1983 - Prohibits the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from granting licenses or construction authorizations for nuclear powerplants pending the outcome of a comprehensive study by the Office of Technology Assessment. Continues such prohibition until Congress determines that safety and environmental hazards have been adequately studied and that nuclear powerplants are acceptable in comparison to other energy sources. Authorizes a resumption of licensing under limited conditions specified by Congress. Requires a five-year independent study of the nuclear fuel cycle by the Office of Technology Assessment. Empowers the Office to compel delivery of any information necessary for conducting such study. Directs all Government agencies to cooperate fully with the Office. Requires the preparation of a final report with recommendations at the end of five years and annual progress reports. Requires the following specific issues to be considered in the final report: (1) safety and environmental hazards, including an analysis of reported malfunctions; (2) genetic effects of low-level radiation; (3) economic implications of a commitment to nuclear powerplants; (4) storage of high-level radioactive wastes; (5) proliferation dangers; (6) economical and technical capabilities of utilities; and (7) licensing procedures of past regulatory agencies. Requires that existing nuclear powerplants operate at less than licensed core power level and be derated annually should Congress fail to determine that the licensing of nuclear powerplants may continue after conclusion of the study. Requires the Government, to the maximum extent possible, to spend funds for employment creation programs in areas where unemployment has been caused by the implementation of this Act. Authorizes appropriations for each of the five fiscal years following the enactment of this Act."
