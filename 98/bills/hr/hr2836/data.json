    "text": "Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine Act of 1983 - Authorizes the establishment of the Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, a nonprofit corporation, to: (1) carry out medical research and education projects under cooperative arrangements with the Uniformed Services University of Health Science (University); (2) serve as a focus for the interchange between military and civilian medical personnel; and (3) encourage the participation of medical, dental, nursing, veterinary, and other biomedical sciences in the work of the Foundation for the mutual benefit of military and civilian medicine. States that the Foundation shall not for any purpose be an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government. Directs the Council of Directors of the Foundation to report to the President annually on the operations of the Foundation. Authorizes the Board of Regents of the University to contract with the Foundation for cooperative enterprises in medical research, consultation and education, subject to specified restrictions. Requires the Board to notify the Armed Services Committees at least 15 days before it enters into agreements for certain facilities or services. Prohibits the Board from contracting with the Foundation if the contract would obligate the University to make outlays before enactment of appropriate budget authority. Deems any Foundation scholar or other person providing volunteer services to the University a Federal employee for purposes of workers' compensation or tort claims."
