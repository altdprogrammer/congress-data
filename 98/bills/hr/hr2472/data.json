    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow individual taxpayers who have attained the age of 18 an income tax deduction for contributions (cash or readily tradeable securities) to a savings account established for the exclusive purpose of financing the taxpayer's first principal residence. Limits the maximum annual deduction to the greater of 15 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income or $1,500 ($3,000 if married and filing jointly), with annual inflation adjustments. Provides for a $15,000 maximum lifetime deduction ($30,000 for joint returns), with annual inflation adjustments. Limits to ten years the period during which deductible contributions may be made to housing savings accounts. Prohibits any individual from being a beneficiary of more than one account. Excludes distributions from a housing savings account from the gross income of its beneficiary if such distributions are used exclusively for the purchase of a principal residence. Exempts a housing savings account from taxation. Provides for the forfeiture of such exemption where the taxpayer uses the account for certain prohibited purposes. Imposes a penalty on distributions from an account which are used for a prohibited purpose. Requires the trustee of a housing savings account to file a report on the maintenance of the account. Imposes a penalty for the failure to file any required report."
