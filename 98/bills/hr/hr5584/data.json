Authorizes the Administrator to solicit gifts or bequests of money or other property for a depository. Requires the proceeds of such gifts or bequests to be deposited into an account in the National Archives Trust Fund and expended for the same purposes and objects for which appropriations for operating, maintaining, protecting, or improving such depository might be expended. Directs the Administrator to provide for the establishment in such Trust Fund of separate endowments for the maintenance of depository land, buildings, and equipment to which shall be credited any gift or bequest offered for that purpose. Restricts the use of the income of such endowments to the payment of the cost of building operations. Prohibits the Administrator from taking title to, or making an agreement to use, any land, building, or equipment for a depository unless there is available, by gift bequest, for deposit into an endowment for such depository an amount equal to at least 20 percent of the sum of: (1) the cost of acquiring or constructing such building and of acquiring and installing such equipment; and (2) the cost of acquiring such land to which the United States will hold title; or (3) the cost to the donor of making improvements to such land to which the United States will not hold title. Authorizes the National Archives Trust Fund Board to solicit gifts or bequests to benefit the national archival and records activities administered by the General Services Administration."
