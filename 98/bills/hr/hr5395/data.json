Title II: General Provisions - Prohibits the use of funds authorized under this Act: (1) where the costs of the program exceed 105 percent of the program authorization or the costs exceed by more than $10,000,000 the amount authorized by this Act, whichever is the lesser; and (2) for programs which have not been presented to or requested of Congress, unless the Secretary of the Energy transmits to the appropriate committees a full and complete statement of the action proposed. Authorizes the Secretary to start any general plant project only if the maximum estimated cost of such project does not exceed $1,200,000. Sets forth procedures for approval of projects that exceed the 25 percent estimated cost provision, and exempts from such procedures any project which has an estimated cost of less than $5,000,000. Allows the transfer of funds from specified projects to other Government agencies for the performance of work for which the appropriation is made. Authorizes the Secretary to perform construction design services for construction projects in support of national security programs as appropriated under this Act. Directs the Secretary to notify the appropriate committees of Congress within 30 days of planning and design costs in excess of $1,000,000. Authorizes funds for emergency construction design and pay increases. Permits funds to remain available until expended if so specified in an appropriation Act. States that the provisions of Executive Order 12344, February 1, 1982, pertaining to the naval nuclear propulsion program shall remain in force until changed by law. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a Committee to review the activities of the Defense Inertial Confinement Fusion Program.
