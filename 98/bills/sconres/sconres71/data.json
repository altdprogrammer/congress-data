Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) steps should be taken to achieve an independent investigation of the Aquino assassination and to bring to justice those responsible for his death; and (2) the President should not visit the Philippines until there has been an accounting of the assassination and until the President's security can be guaranteed. States that it should be U.S. policy to: (1) support fair elections to the National Assembly in May 1984; and (2) urge the Philippine Government to take steps to secure the full participation of the opposition parties in those elections, including the reconstitution of an impartial electoral commission and the restoration of freedom of the press. Urges the United States in conducting its relations with the Philippine government to take into account the investigation and the fairness of the 1984 National Assembly elections."
