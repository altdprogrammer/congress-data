Directs the Federal Reserve Board to include in its reports to Congress an analysis of the effects in current and prospective years on credit markets and the economy: (1) of the Federal budgets deficits or surpluses projected for the next three fiscal years in certain presidential and congressional documents; and (2) of alternative deficits or surpluses."
