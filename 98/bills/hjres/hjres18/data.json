Requires the persons voting for President and Vice President to have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature. Requires each candidate for the office of President to be paired with a candidate for the office of Vice President. Prohibits any candidate from being paired with more than one other person. Requires each voter to cast a single vote for two persons who are paired as candidates for the offices of President and Vice President. Requires the popular votes cast in such election to be tabulated in accordance with procedures which the Congress shall establish by law. Directs the chief election officials to make and transmit to Congress a list of the pairs of candidates voted for President and Vice President in each State and the number of votes cast for each pair. Requires each State to establish by law a number of districts equal to the number of Representatives to which each State is entitled. Declares that for each district established, the pair of candidates receiving the higher number of popular votes in that district shall receive one electoral vote. Declares that for each State and the District of Columbia the pair of candidates receiving the higher number of popular votes shall receive two electoral votes. States that the pair of candidates receiving the majority of the electoral votes shall become President and Vice President. Directs Congress to assemble in special session if after any such election no Presidential candidacy receives a majority of the vote. Requires the Senate and the House of Representatives sitting in joint session to choose, from the three pairs of persons joined as candidates who received the highest number of electoral votes cast in the election, one such pair by ballot. Requires Congress to provide for the case of death, disability, or withdrawal of any candidate on or before the date of the election."
