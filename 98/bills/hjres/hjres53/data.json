Prohibits Congress, whenever expenditures exceed receipts for any two-year period, from passing any bill or other measure appropriating any moneys out of the general fund of the Treasury until such time as provisions of law have come into effect which will provide, within the following 12 months, additional revenue in an amount not less than the amount by which such expenditures exceed such receipts. Suspends such requirements during a war or other national emergency upon the recommendation of the President and the approval of Congress."
