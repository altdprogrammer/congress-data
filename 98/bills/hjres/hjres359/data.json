Urges the President to negotiate an agreement with its Western allies which would: (1) require all parties to the agreement to consult with each other before any one party imposes economic sanctions against another country; (2) allow any party to unilaterally impose such sanctions after appropriate consultation with the other parties; and (3) pledge the parties not to coerce one another, through any means, to adopt such unilaterally imposed sanctions. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should reach an agreement with its Western allies which would provide that all parties to such agreement not offer favorable credit terms for the transfer of advanced technology products to Warsaw Pact countries."
