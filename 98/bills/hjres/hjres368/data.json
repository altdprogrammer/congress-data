States that where an activity is included in only one version of an Act as passed by both Houses the pertinent project or activity shall be continued under the appropriation, fund, or authority granted by the one House, but at a rate for operations not more than the current rate or the rate permitted by the one House, whichever is lower. Declares that if an appropriation Act has been reported to a House but not passed by that House as of October 1, 1983, it shall be deemed as having passed that House. Declares that no provision which is included in an appropriation Act enumerated in this Act but which was not included in the applicable appropriations Act of 1983, and which is applicable to more than one appropriation shall be applicable to any appropriation unless such provision shall have been included in identical form in such bill as enacted by both the House and the Senate.

Restricts the use of funds under such Act for the Legal Services Corporation, including limitations on assistance to illegal aliens, on lobbying, on class action suits, and on excessive compensation or reimbursement for Corporation officers. Makes appropriations as necessary for projects or activities which were provided for in H.R. 3415 (the District of Columbia Appropriation Act, 1984) and H.R. 3263 (the Military Construction Appropriation Act, 1984) as such Acts were reported to the House of Representatives on September 22, 1983. Declares that appropriations and funds made available and authority granted pursuant to this joint resolution shall remain available from October 1, 1983, until: (1) enactment of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in this joint resolution; (2) enactment of the applicable appropriation Act by both Houses without any provision for such project or activity; or (3) November 10, 1983, whichever first occurs.

Prohibits the use of appropriated funds to pay more than a specified amount for rental of space and services provided by the General Services Administration. Declares that no provision in any appropriations Act for FY 1984 that makes the availability of any appropriation provided therein dependent upon the enactment of additional authorizing or other legislation shall be effective before November 10, 1983. Appropriates amounts to the Postal Service Fund so that postal rates for preferred-rate mailers shall be continued at the rates in effect on September 1, 1983.
