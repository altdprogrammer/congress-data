Establishes a National Commission on Agricultural Trade and Export Policy (Commission) to conduct a study of the agriculture-related trade and export policies and programs of the United States and the international and domestic factors affecting such policies and programs, including U.S. intergovernmental activities that affect the formulation of policies. Requires the Commission to be composed of ex officio congressional members, plus 23 members appointed by the President. Requires the Commission to submit to the President and the Congress: (1) a report containing its initial findings and recommendations with respect to the agriculture-related trade and export policies and programs of the United States, including ways such policies and programs can be improved by March 31, 1985; (2) additional interim reports on its work as may be requested by the chairmen of specified congressional committees; and (3) a report containing the final results of its study and recommendations by July 1, 1986. Authorizes Federal and public support to the Commission. Limits to a specified percentage of the Commission's total budget the amount that may be contributed by any one person or entity. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to use funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation to pay the Commission's expenses if public contributions are insufficient. Exempts the Commission from specified provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and guidelines relating to the performance appraisals of Federal employees. Terminates the Commission 60 days after the transmission of its final report to the President and the Congress."
