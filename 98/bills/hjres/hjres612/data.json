    "text": "Security and General Nuclear Disarmament Resolution - Directs the President to establish a nuclear war risk reduction center to serve as a major and direct point of communications and consultation between the United States and the Soviet Union and to monitor issues relevant to reducing the risks of nuclear war. Prohibits such center from engaging in covert intelligence-gathering. Urges the President to seek the establishment of a joint U.S.-Soviet nuclear war reduction center. Requests the President to: (1) resubmit to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification specified arms control agreements; and (2) initiate such actions as necessary to achieve the completion of a comprehensive test ban treaty between the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. Prohibits the United States, after the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of this joint resolution, from testing any nuclear device unless the President certifies to the Congress before any such test that the Soviet Union has, after the end of such period, tested a nuclear device. Declares it to be the policy of the United States that it should not be the first nation to use nuclear weapons in a military conflict."
