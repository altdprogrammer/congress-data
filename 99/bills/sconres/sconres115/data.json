Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should: (1) call upon the United Nations and other donors to monitor all resettlement efforts in Ethiopia to ensure that coercion is not used; (2) request the Ethiopian Government to place a moratorium on relocations that may cause suffering or death and on relocations of persons who are sympathetic to anti-Government rebels; (3) request that the Ethiopian Government commit sufficient resources to existing resettlement camps; (4) insist that international observers be given access to all resettlement camps; and (5) ensure that the United States continues to raise this issue in every appropriate international forum, including the United Nations. Requests the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs to transmit, within 30 days, to the Congress a report indicating the number of Ethiopians who have died as a result of the resettlement program and to transmit a copy of this Act to specified individuals."
