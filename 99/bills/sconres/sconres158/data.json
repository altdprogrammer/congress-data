Declares that the Congress: (1) stresses that President Reagan and President de la Madrid should discuss the progress of Mexico in opening up its one-party system to greater democratic freedoms, address the growing drug problem, and discuss the July election in Chihuahua; (2) urges the President of Mexico to achieve \"morally renovated\" elections in upcoming State and municipal elections; and (3) encourages President de la Madrid to nullify the fraudulent elections in Chihuahua and schedule new elections."
