Urges the Secretary of State to: (1) determine if Soviet actions against the Afghan people constitute genocide and, if so, report findings and recommendations to the President and the Congress; and (2) review U.S. policy with respect to its recognition of the Soviet-backed government in Kabul, Afghanistan."
