Calls upon the President to: (1) take every opportunity, including the upcoming meeting with General Secretary Gorbachev, to press the Soviet Union to abide by its international commitments and allow the Meimans to emigrate as well as the resolution of all other outstanding divided family and emigration cases; and (2) instruct the U.S. delegation to the upcoming Vienna Meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to pursue such cases."
