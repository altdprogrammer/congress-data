    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should take appropriate action to: (1) enforce U.S. rights under trade agreements to which Japan is a party; and (2) obtain the elimination of Japanese acts and policies which deny benefits to the United States under such trade agreements and which burden or restrict U.S. commerce. Directs the President, within a specified time, to: (1) report to the Congress and give notice of the actions the President has decided to take to accomplish such objectives; and (2) implement all such actions. Declares that such actions should at least negate the cumulative impact that the elimination or relaxation of the voluntary restraints on Japanese automobile exports to the United States will have on the merchandise balance of trade between Japan and the United States. Declares that action taken to accomplish this objective should be directed against competitive Japanese exports, including automobiles, telecommunication products, and electronic products. Declares action taken to accomplish the major objectives of the resolution should be modified or revoked only if the President determines that such minimum objective has been achieved."
