Requires the House Budget Committee to report a reconciliation bill carrying out such recommendations without any substantive revision.

Terminates such provisions when the Congress completes action on a subsequent concurrent resolution on the budget for FY 1986. Prohibits the House of Representatives from considering any measure providing new budget authority, new entitlement authority, or new credit activity for FY 1986 within the jurisdiction of a committee until such committee makes the allocations or subdivisions required by the Congressional Budget Act.
