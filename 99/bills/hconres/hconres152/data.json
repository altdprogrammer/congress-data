Requires the Budget Committee to report a reconciliation bill carrying out such recommendations without any substantive revision.

Permits the enrollment of any bill or resolution providing new discretionary budget authority or new spending authority for FY 1986 if it would not cause the appropriate allocation for a committee to be exceeded. Makes exceptions for legislation that would cause budget authority and outlays for certain off-budget spending programs to be included in the unified budget. Terminates such provisions when the Congress completes action on a subsequent concurrent resolution on the budget for FY 1986. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Office of Management and Budget should release and apportion to the States the amount appropriated for the Special Supplemental Food Program (WIC program) for FY 1985; (2) the Administration should call for the convening of an international monetary conference this year for the purpose of exploring options to stabilize currency exchange rates, reduce interest rates, promote maximum domestic and world economic growth, and help assure domestic price stability; and (3) budget functional totals should be reduced to reflect a limitation on the amount of social security benefits paid to illegal and nonresident aliens. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that tax reform should be adopted as soon as possible incorporating the following objectives; (1) responsiveness to market conditions; (2) simplicity of structure and lower marginal tax rates; (3) fair and equitable distribution of the tax burden; (4) a broader tax base; and (5) increased incentives for work, saving, and investment. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) each of its standing committees should review, on a continuing basis and when considering public bills or resolutions, those portions of the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control (Grace Commission report) pertaining to such committee's jurisdiction; and (2) each committee report on a public bill or resolution should contain an identification of each recommendation of the Survey to be implemented and the resulting estimated program cost savings or revenue enhancement and a statement setting forth the disposition of each recommendation pertaining to such bill or resolution."
