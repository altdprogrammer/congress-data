Directs the President, within specified times, to: (1) determine whether Japan has taken sufficient action to assure the elimination of such acts and policies; (2) report such determination to specified congressional committees; and (3) if Japan has not taken sufficient action, take action to eliminate such acts and policies by more aggressive use of existing customs laws and other trade laws. Requires the President's action to be sufficient to \"insure that access to the Japanese market is fair and equitable, as measured by increased sales of competitive products from the United States and elsewhere, and verified by affirmation from the United States business community.\" Permits modification or revocation of the President's action only if the President determines that the objectives set forth in this resolution have been achieved."
