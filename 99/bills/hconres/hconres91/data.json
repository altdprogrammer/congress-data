    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) New Zealand ought to reconsider its decision regarding port access for U.S. vessels and should take steps to demonstrate its willingness to engage the United States in a meaningful dialogue on this issue; (2) the President should maintain a dialogue with New Zealand with a view toward achieving a satisfactory solution to the disagreement over port access; (3) the President should be commended for rejecting economic sanctions against New Zealand and encouraged to continue that policy; (4) the maintenance of the Security Treaty Between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States is in the best interest of the parties to the Treaty and should not be placed in irreparable jeopardy by the port access controversy; and (5) one alternative that should be pursued would be the possible endorsement by the United States of the principle of a nuclear-free zone for parts of the South Pacific region on the presumption that countries in the region would support a nuclear-free zone but would also allow port visits of nuclear powered and nuclear armed vessels."
