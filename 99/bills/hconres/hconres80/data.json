Requires examiners to give due consideration to factors such as loan collateral and ultimate repayment ability with respect to agricultural borrowers. Requires the Chairmen of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board and the Comptroller of the Currency to report to the Congress on their actions to implement this Act."
