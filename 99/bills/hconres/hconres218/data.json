    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that, in light of U.S. policy against apartheid, the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution: (1) should not use any Smithsonian funds to make any extension of credit to the Government of South Africa, or investment in any corporation or other business enterprise that is owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by such government; and (2) not later than one year after enactment of this Act, should liquidate any such extension of credit and dispose of any such investment in South Africa. Sets forth an exception for contracts entered into prior to enactment of this Act. Provides for a cessation of the above prohibitions upon a determination by the Board (and submission of such determination to the Congress) that such system of apartheid has been abolished."
