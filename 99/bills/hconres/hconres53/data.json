Declares that the Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health should immediately revise the hazard communication standards: (1) established by regulations issued November 25, 1983, to require the labeling of containers of, and pipes carrying, each hazardous substance as to the chemical identity of the hazardous substance, the health effects of exposure to it, and emergency medical treatment procedures in the event of such exposure; and (2) to extend right-to-know protection to employees in any service or industry that employs hazardous substances. Declares that the Federal right-to-know standards should set only the minimum requirements that the States must follow. Commends the States and local governments that have enacted right-to-know laws to protect employees and members of communities against hazardous substances."
