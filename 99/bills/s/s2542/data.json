Prohibits the sale and redemption of OASDI trust fund assets or the exenditure of OASDI trust fund amounts for purposes other than those specified in title II of the Act. Requires members of such trust funds' Board of Trustees to faithfully execute their duties, but does not impose a fiduciary duty. Requires that, in consideration of the public debt limit, required investments of trust fund amounts occur prior to the issuance of other obligations. Directs that the tax receipts earmarked for the OASDI program be immediately transferred (currently, monthly transfers are made) from the general fund of the Treasury to the OASDI trust funds. Requires the Board of Trustees of the OASDI trust funds to meet at least twice each year. Sets forth provisions requiring reports by the Board of Trustees and the Managing Trustee to the Congress regarding the operation and status of the OASDI trust funds."
