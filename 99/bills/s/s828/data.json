    "date": "1985-04-02", 
    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code with respect to deductions for ordinary and necessary business expenses to provide a special rule for construction workers' travel and transportation expenses. Provides that a job at a site located more than 30 miles from a worker's residence shall be considered: (1) temporary for the first two years of employment at that site; and (2) temporary or not temporary after the first two years based on an examination of all the facts and circumstances. Provides that no deduction shall be disallowed solely because a construction worker's employment at a job site is of indefinite duration. Prohibits the application of the \"one-year\" rule set forth in Revenue Ruling 83-82, which specifies the length of time which automatically or presumptively classifies the job as other than temporary. Defines \"construction worker\" for purposes of this Act as any individual employed as a skilled, semiskilled, or unskilled laborer in the building or construction industry."
