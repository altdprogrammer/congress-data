Requires the quota to be reallocated among the remaining countries on a proportional basis provided that the amounts shall first be reallocated to the Philippines to the extent that country's allocation is less than the percentage allocated to any other country. Grants duty-free treatment to sugar imports from the Philippines during any calendar year in which such imports from any other country are granted duty-free treatment. Prohibits granting sugar imports from any country more favorable treatment than is granted sugar imports from the Philippines."
