    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1986-10-18", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 - Title I: Military Withdrawals - Withdraws the following public lands for use by the military departments: (1) Bravo-20 Bombing Range, Churchill County, Nevada; (2) Nellis Air Force Range, Clark, Nye, and Lincoln Counties, Nevada; (3) Luke Air Force Range, Maricopa, Pima, and Yuma Counties, Arizona; (4) McGregor Range, Otero County, New Mexico; (5) Fort Greely Maneuver Area, Big Delta Area, and Fort Greely Air Drop Zone, Granite Creek Area, Alaska; and (6) Fort Wainwright Maneuver Area, Alaska. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to file a map and legal description of each such area with specified congressional committees. Requires maps and legal descriptions of such areas to be made available to the public. Directs the Secretary to manage the withdrawn lands for grazing, wildlife habitat, control of predatory animals, and the prevention and suppression of brush and range fires resulting from nonmilitary activities. Makes such uses secondary to the military uses. Permits the Secretary to issue leases, easements, rights-of-way, or other authorizations only with the concurrence of the Secretary of the military department concerned. Authorizes the Secretary of the military department concerned to close withdrawn lands to the public to the degree required by public safety or national security. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop a management plan for each area within three years of the Act's enactment. Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to prevent and control fires which result from military activities. Authorizes such Secretary to request assistance from the Bureau of Land Management on a reimbursable basis. Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the military department concerned to enter into a memorandum of understanding to implement the land management plan for each group of withdrawn lands. States that the withdrawal of Nellis and Luke Air Force Ranges does not affect the status of the Desert National Wildlife Range, Nevada, or the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona. Terminates these public land withdrawals after 15 years. Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned to publish a draft environmental impact statement at least three years before such termination if the military department has a continuing need for the withdrawn lands. Directs the Secretaries of the Air Force, Navy, and the Interior to report to the Congress within five years on the effects of the military usage of withdrawn lands on the public health and safety throughout Nevada, including the effects of continued withdrawal. Requires such report to evaluate mitigation measures. Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned to maintain a decontamination program of withdrawn lands during their withdrawal, reporting annually on such program to specified congressional committees. Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned to notify the Secretary of the Interior at least three years before termination if the military department has a continuing need for the withdrawn lands. Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned to notify the Secretary of the intent to relinquish such lands before the termination of their withdrawal. Requires the Secretary of Defense, acting through such departments, to submit with the notice to relinquish a determination of the extent of such lands' contamination. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to refuse to accept withdrawn lands for relinquishment if such lands are contaminated with explosives or hazardous materials and the Secretary of the military department concerned determines that the otherwise mandatory decontamination is not feasible. Requires such Secretary to reevaluate the feasibility of decontaminating unacceptable lands. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to make public any order to accept back jurisdiction of previously withdrawn lands. Requires the Secretary to review withdrawn lands immediately and every five years thereafter to determine which lands can be opened under specified mining and resource laws. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations to assure the unimpeded use of withdrawn lands for military purposes. Empowers the Secretary to close withdrawn lands which have been opened for mining if necessary for national emergency or national security purposes. Sets forth the status of mining claims on withdrawn lands. Redesignates the Luke Air Force Range, Arizona, as the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range. Title II: Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area - Modifies the boundary of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area, Ohio. Permits the Secretary of the Interior to acquire only scenic easements within such Area. Title III: Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Act of 1986 - Amends Federal law regarding competitive leasing of oil and gas for onshore Federal lands to increase from 640 acres to 2,560 acres the units of land open to competitive leasing and up to 5,120 acres in Alaska. Provides for lease sales to be: (1) conducted by oral bidding or by a combination of oral and sealed bidding; and (2) held at least two months in each State (or more frequently at the Secretary's discretion). Requires the Secretary of the Interior to accept the highest bid which is at least $20 or greater per acre without evaluation of the economic or geologic value of the lands proposed for lease. Requires that all bids for less than $20 per acre be rejected. Describes circumstances under which certain lands may be leased without competitive bidding. Authorizes the Secretary to disapprove partial assignments of less than 640 acres outside of Alaska, or of less than 2,560 acres within Alaska. Subjects a lease to cancellation by the Secretary after 30 days'notice for noncompliance with the lease terms unless: (1) the leasehold contains a well capable of production of oil or gas in paying quantities; or (2) the lease is committed to an approved cooperative or unit plan or communitization agreement which contains a well capable of production of unitized substances in paying quantities. Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to make leasing in Alaska consistent with that in the contiguous 48 States. Repeals provisions regarding: (1) determination of favorable petroleum geological provinces; and (2) suspension of noncompetitive leasing. Establishes an interim period during which certain pending lease applications will be processed as they would have been prior to the date of enactment of this Act. Prohibits noncompetitive lease applications for specified lands from being processed until such lands are posted for competitive bidding in accordance with this Act. Requires the Secretary to hold at least one competitive lease sale for tracts which but for this Act would have been posted for the filing of simultaneous oil and gas lease applications. Permits the inclusion in such sale of certain tracts which had over-the-counter noncompetitive oil and gas lease offers. Imposes criminal penalties upon persons who willfully and knowingly misrepresent the value of lands and leases under this Act. Grants to the States concurrent civil and criminal jurisdiction for violations of this Act. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Congress on the acres leased and revenue received."
