Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop educational programs and materials and public service announcements respecting the dangers to human health from the use of smokeless tobacco; (2) make such programs, materials, and announcements available to States, local governments, school systems, and other entities; (3) conduct and support research on the effect of smokeless tobacco on human health; and (4) collect, analyze, and disseminate information and studies on smokeless tobacco and health. Permits the Secretary to provide technical assistance and make grants to States to assist in the development and distribution of educational programs, materials, and public service announcements on the dangers to human health from the use of smokeless tobacco, and to establish 18 as the minimum age for purchasing smokeless tobacco. Requires specified warning labels on all smokeless tobacco products and advertisements. Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to promulgate regulations to implement this Act within 180 days. Requires manufacturers, packagers, and importers of smokeless tobacco products to annually provide the Secretary with a list of the ingredients added to tobacco, and a specification of the quantity of nicotine contained in each product. Provides for confidentiality of such information. Declares that the failure to comply with provisions of this Act shall be a misdemeanor. Grants district courts of the United States jurisdiction and injunctive power to prevent and restrain violations of this Act. Requires each manufacturer, packager, or importer of smokeless tobacco to submit a compliance plan to the FTC. Imposes a ban on smokeless tobacco advertising on any medium of electronic communication subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), effective six months after enactment of this Act. Requires a report to the Congress on January 11, 1987, and biennially thereafter, by the: (1) Secretary concerning smokeless tobacco and health and, as appropriate, on the health effects of ingredients added to smokeless tobacco; and (2) FTC concerning a description of current marketing practices associated with smokeless tobacco products. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to exempt alcohol-containing confectionery from being considered adulterated if it is introduced into interstate commerce for sale in a State which permits its sale.
