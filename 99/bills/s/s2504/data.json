Retains an easement to the United States to operate the Jemez Canyon Dam. Authorizes the University of New Mexico to convey specified lands in New Mexico to the United States to be held in trust for the benefit of the Pueblo of Santa Ana. Dissolves the restriction that such lands shall be used for archeological purposes. Authorizes the Pueblo of Santa Ana to convey specified lands in New Mexico to the University of New Mexico. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to publish in the Federal Register the legal descriptions of such lands.
