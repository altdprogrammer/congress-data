    "text": "Sipsey Wild and Scenic River and Sipsey Wilderness Addition Act of 1986 - Title I: Wild and Scenic River Designation - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate Sipsey Fork, West Fork, Alabama, as a component of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to construct a dam to create a lake for recreational use in either Brushy Creek or Flint Creek watershed, Bankhead National Forest, Alabama. Directs the Secretary to construct a road and recreational facilities adjacent to such lake. Requires the Secretary to protect the water quality of such lake. Title II: Wilderness Designation - Expands the Sipsey Wilderness in the William B. Bankhead National Forest, Alabama. Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Alabama shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Alabama which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Alabama reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Alabama without express congressional authorization. States that the provisions above shall also apply to national forest system roadless lands in Alabama which are less than 5,000 acres in size."
