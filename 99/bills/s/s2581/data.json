    "text": "Increases the obligation limitations for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs for 1986 through 1990 (except for emergency relief projects and national minimum drinking age programs). Prescribes allocation guidelines under which the Secretary of Transportation is directed to distribute the obligation limitation for FY 1987 through 1990. Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide all States with authority sufficient to prevent lapses of sums authorized to be appropriated for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction which have been apportioned or allocated to a State; (2) revise a distribution of the funds made available for FY 1987 through 1990 if a State will not obligate the amount distributed during such fiscal year; (3) redistribute sufficient amounts to those States able to obligate amounts in addition to those previously distributed during such fiscal year (giving priority to those States having large unobligated balances of funds); and (4) not distribute amounts authorized for administrative expenses, Federal lands highways, and the Strategic Highway Research Program. Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to repeal the obligation limitations set therein."
