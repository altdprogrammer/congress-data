Requires such standards to be designed to: (1) limit marketing and agent abuse; (2) assure the dissemination of such information to Medicare beneficiaries as is necessary to permit informed choice; (3) promote policies which provide reasonable economic benefits to such beneficiaries; (4) reduce the purchase of unnecessary duplicative coverage; and (5) improve price competition. Provides that such standards shall apply to long-term health care insurance policies in the same manner as they apply to Medicare supplemental policies. Sets forth reporting requirements."
