    "text": "Alzheimer's Disease Demonstration, Research, Respite, and Assistance Act of 1985 - Establishes the National Council on Alzheimer's Disease (National Council), which shall terminate six years after the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the National Council to develop and encourage partnerships for research in: (1) the etiology, diagnosis, clinical course, treatment, and epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease; (2) the psychological and social functioning of patients with Alzheimer's disease; and (3) methods of raising or sustaining the quality of life for patients with Alzheimer's disease. Directs the National Council to establish a scientific and medical advisory panel on Alzheimer's disease to facilitate such partnerships. Directs the National Center for Health Statistics, in cooperation with the National Institute on Aging, to collect medical information necessary to: (1) diagnose and evaluate individuals with Alzheimer's disease; and (2) develop a national data base concerning Alzheimer's disease. Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health to establish five additional Alzheimer's disease research centers. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987. Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to authorize the development of programs to assist victims of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders in meeting their day-to-day needs. Authorizes the Small Business Administration to make loans to private, nonprofit corporations to finance the development of adult day care centers and respite care programs for Alzheimer patients and their families. Directs the National Council to conduct research in methods of financing systems of providing long-term care to victims of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Requires the National Council to make annual reports to the Congress on the results of such research. Directs the National Council to develop a data base on needs for long-term care, and on costs of alternative funding. Directs the Secretary to conduct demonstration projects under which home care and other support services are provided under Medicare for victims of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders who could otherwise not be cared for at home. Requires the Commissioner of the Administration on Aging to direct area agencies on aging to maintain registries for various medical and community services. Provides that no skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility which receives payments under title XVIII (Medicare) or under a State plan approved under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act may discriminate in the acceptance or refusal of patients on the grounds that such individual is eligible for Medicaid or suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Requires such facilities to include a functional assessment of the Alzheimer's patient in the initial admission evaluation. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Congress with respect to implementation of this section. Directs the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to promulgate national policies for treatment of eligible veterans who have Alzheimer's disease and are at least 55 years of age. Directs the Administrator to conduct a demonstration project to furnish comprehensive community-based care and related services to such individuals and their families in order to delay the need for hospital or nursing home admissions. Requires the Administrator to transmit an annual report to specified congressional committees. Directs the Secretary to establish mechanisms for: (1) the dissemination of information and guidelines relating to Alzheimer's disease; and (2) training for persons involved in the Social Security Administration's disability determination process. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for expenses incurred in the care of certain family members with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. Sets the amount of such credit at 40 percent of the expenses incurred for taxpayers with incomes of $25,000 or less. Reduces the rate of such credit for adjusted gross income in excess of $25,000. Imposes an aggregate limit of $20,000 on the amount of expenses which may be taken into account with a maximum of $10,000 per family member. Directs the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute on Mental Health to develop and disseminate curricula for the training of personnel who provide health services to Alzheimer's disease patients. Directs the National Institute on Aging to develop and implement programs to train providers of clinical care services and families of patients with Alzheimer's disease to care for such patients. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop and implement programs to train personnel who provide long-term care services to patients with Alzheimer's disease; (2) make grants to schools of medicine to train physicians and other health care personnel who provide care to Alzheimer patients who reside in nursing homes; (3) conduct training programs on Alzheimer's disease for safety and transportation personnel; (4) conduct training programs for medical examiners, coroners, and pathologists in the proper conduct of an autopsy to determine whether Alzheimer's disease was a contributing factor to a death; and (5) promulgate regulations to encourage medical examiners, coroners, and pathologists to provide reports concerning the findings of autopsies in which Alzheimer's disease contributed to the death. Authorizes appropriations."
