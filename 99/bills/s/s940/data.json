    "text": "Defense Procurement Program Integrity Act of 1985 - Title I: Unallowable Contract Costs - Revises provisions concerning cost or pricing data given by a contractor or subcontractor in a defense contract. Provides, in an administrative or judicial proceeding to adjust the price of a contract, that it shall be conclusively presumed that the Government relied on all cost and pricing data so furnished by a contractor or subcontractor. Outlines various situations which shall not be a defense to a price adjustment in any such proceeding. Requires interest to be charged in the case of an overpayment by the Government to a contractor or subcontractor due to the submission of inaccurate, incomplete, or non-current cost or pricing data by such contractor or subcontractor. Title II: Renegotiation Act - Renegotiation Act Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Renegotiation Act of 1951 to direct the Renegotiation Board to renegotiate contracts and subcontracts by division and by major product line within a division of the contractor or subcontractor. Sets the minimum amount subject to renegotiation for contracts or subcontracts for a fiscal year ending after the enactment of the Renegotiation Act Amendments of 1985 at $5,000,000. Requires the President, not later than October 1, 1985, to appoint members of the Renegotiation Board created under the Renegotiation Act of 1951. Authorizes appropriations to such Board for FY 1986. Title III: Cost-Accounting Standards Board - Cost-Accounting Standards Board Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to establish a Cost-Accounting Standards Board to promulgate cost-accounting standards to be followed by defense contractors and subcontractors under Federal contracts. States the effective date for the implementation of such standards. Requires such Board to report to the Congress within one year after the enactment of the Cost-Accounting Standards Board Amendments of 1985 and annually thereafter. Title IV: Contractor Profit Studies - Directs the Secretary of Defense, on a regular periodic basis but at least once every four years, to carry out studies of profits made by contractors under Department of Defense contracts to determine whether the level of such profits is reasonable. Outlines information to be included in such study. Requires the Secretary to report the findings of such study to the Congress, the Comptroller General of the United States, and the Renegotiation Board. Title V: Limitation on Contractor Claims - Requires claims submitted by contractors requesting payment in connection with a contract entered into by the Department of Defense to be submitted in a specified manner."
