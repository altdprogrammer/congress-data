Prohibits the distribution or the production of any indecent or profane material by means of radio, television, or cable television. Raises the fine to not more than $50,000. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to revise the provisions prohibiting obscene phone calls. Permits a civil penalty to be imposed of not more than $50,000. Allows a court, upon petition and a proper showing, to issue a preliminary injunction against such communications. Eliminates as a defense to a violation that access to the prohibited communications was restricted to persons 18 years of age or older."
