    "text": "Military Family Act of 1985 - Establishes in the Office of the Secretary of Defense an Office of Family Policy to coordinate programs and activities of the military departments as they relate to military families. Transfers the Military Family Resources Center within the Department of Defense. Makes travel and transportation allowances the same for members of the armed forces as those applicable to civilian employees. Requires temporary lodging expenses to be paid to such military members transferred within the United States or to a duty station outside the United States other than Hawaii or Alaska. Authorizes the payment of a transportation allowance to student dependents of military members assigned a permanent duty station in Alaska or Hawaii. Prohibits such transportation allowance when the dependent child is attending a school in Alaska or Hawaii. Requires the Secretary of Defense to provide a preference in hiring for civilian positions above GS-7 in the Department of Defense to spouses of military members if they are among those best qualified for a position. Outlines conditions for such preference. Requires the Secretary to provide child-care facilities on military installations on a 24-hour-a-day basis when needed. Requires the Secretary, within one year of enactment of this Act, to report to the Congress on ways for spouses of military members to obtain employment at child-care facilities. Requires the Secretary to establish at each military installation a youth sponsorship program to facilitate the adaptation of transferred members' children to new surroundings. Requires the Secretary, within one year of enactment of this Act, to report to the Congress on recommendations to facilitate the smooth transition for dependent children of military members making a permanent change of station between schools with different graduation requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to establish dental benefit plans for spouses and children of military members who are on active duty for more than 30 days. Requires the member to pay a part of the plan's cost, as determined by the Secretary, to be deducted from the member's basic pay. Outlines the dental benefits to be included in such plan."
