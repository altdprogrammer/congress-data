    "text": "Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to study and report to the Congress within three years on the proper minimum altitude which should be maintained by aircraft when flying over units of the national park system. Requires the Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, to provide technical assistance. Sets forth certain units of the park system to be included in such study, such as Yosemite National Park, and certain types of aircraft to be evaluated, including helicopters. Requires the Administrator to review the report and current regulations and make recommendations for necessary changes on the basis of aviation safety. Authorizes appropriations. Prohibits flights below a certain altitude at Yosemite National Park, California, and at Haleakala National Park, Hawaii, during the course of the study. Makes exceptions for emergency situations. Directs the Director to submit to the Administrator a final plan for the management of air traffic over Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, and to implement such plan within a prescribed period. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to report to the Congress within two years of the plan's implementation as to its effectiveness in restoring the natural quiet of the Park. Exempts certain helicopter flights from any prohibitions."
