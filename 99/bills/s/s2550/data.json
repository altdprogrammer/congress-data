    "text": "Amends the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 to include poultry and eggs within the purview of such Act. Gives poultry growers and cash sellers who have not received full payment from specified large poultry dealers or packers a beneficial interest in all poultry products and proceeds from their poultry until full payment has been made by such growers or sellers. States that payment shall not be considered to have been made if the seller or grower receives a payment instrument which is dishonored. Requires the seller or grower in such instance to preserve his interest as provided for by this Act. Requires full payment by the next business day in a cash sale and within seven days following the week of slaughter in a poultry growing arrangement. Permits the parties to modify such payment schedules. Makes a delay in fund collection in order to extend the payment period an unfair practice under such Act. Provides egg producers with similar protections."
