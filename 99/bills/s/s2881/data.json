    "text": "Prohibits the United States from providing any assistance (including loans) in a fiscal year to a country that: (1) during the preceding fiscal year imported goods, services, or products from Cuba; or (2) failed to notify the Secretary of State that during such fiscal year such country did not import any such goods, services, or products. Provides that U.S. loans to any country shall include a requirement that the loan becomes due and payable upon importation into such country of Cuban goods, services, or products. Requires the Secretary of State to certify to the Congress any information about the importation of Cuban goods, services, or products by a country that receives U.S. aid. Excludes international narcotics control assistance, disaster relief assistance, food or medical assistance, or refugee assistance from the definition of U.S. assistance for purposes of this Act. Terminates the provisions of this Act upon the return to Cuba of all undocumented Cubans who: (1) entered the United States from Mariel, Cuba, on or after April 20, 1980; and (2) are excludable or deportable under U.S. immigration laws."
