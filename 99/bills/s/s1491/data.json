Provides, in general, that the system must: (1) effectively and efficiently assist in the administration of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program; and (2) be established and operated in accordance with an initial, and annually updated, advance automatic data processing planning document. Requires the Secretary to continually review the systems and suspend approval of a system where there is substantial noncompliance with system requirements. Directs the Secretary to modify the requirement that the system be statewide in States where the AFDC program is administered through a political subdivision of the State. Places a moratorium on erroneous payment rate sanctions for the first fiscal year during all of which a State has an approved system in effect."
