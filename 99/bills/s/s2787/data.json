Imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of five years' imprisonment (ten years for subsequent offenses) for such violations. Increases the maximum sentence for such violations to 40 years' imprisonment and a fine of $1,000,000. States that any person sentenced for such a violation shall not: (1) be placed on probation or have his or her sentence suspended by the court; or (2) be eligible for parole. Provides that the term of imprisonment for such a violation shall not run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment. (Allows the court, upon a motion by a U.S. Attorney, to reduce or suspend the sentence of an offender who provides certain necessary information.) Imposes minimum fines for simple possession of a controlled substance. Imposes enhanced penalties (a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment and a fine of up to $500,000) for drug trafficking violations which result in a death from the use of an illegal drug."
