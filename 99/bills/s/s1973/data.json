Declares that the Consultative Commission should meet periodically to: (1) negotiate restrictions on sophisticated combat weaponry and the technology of conventional arms production; (2) establish guidelines to regulate the effects of multilateral limitations on arms sales on the national economies of its member countries; and (3) address other areas pertinent to limiting the sale or transfer of arms. Amends the Arms Export Control Act to add new information to be included in the annual report to the Congress on arms sales."
