    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Children's Justice and Assistance Act of 1986 - Title I: Children's Justice - Children's Justice Act - Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (the Act) to authorize a Children's Justice Grant Program. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary), under such program, to make grants to assist States in developing, establishing, and operating programs designed to improve: (1) the handling of child abuse cases (particularly sexual abuse cases) so as to limit additional trauma to the child victim; and (2) the investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases (particularly sexual abuse cases). Requires a State, in order to qualify for such assistance, to: (1) meet specified requirements under the Act; (2) establish (or have established) a multidisciplinary task force on children's justice; and (3) adopt recommendations of such task force in three specified categories. Sets forth the three categories as follows: (1) investigative, administrative, and judicial handling of child abuse cases; (2) experimental, model, and demonstration programs for testing innovative approaches and techniques for enhancing the effectiveness of judicial or administrative action in child abuse cases; and (3) reform of State laws and procedures to provide comprehensive protection from abuse, while ensuring fairness to all affected persons. Allows States to also receive assistance if they adopt an alternative to such recommendations or are making substantial progress toward adopting such recommendations or an alternative. Directs the Secretary to use for such grants the amount authorized under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984. Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to increase the maximum amount which may be deposited in the Crime Victim's Fund. Requires that specified portions of such funds be used for Children's Justice Grants. Sets forth other required allocations of such funds. Directs the Secretary, through the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, to: (1) compile, evaluate, publish, and disseminate to each State materials and information to assist in achieving the objectives of the Children's Justice Grant program; (2) develop and disseminate, to appropriate State and local officials, model personnel training materials on appropriate methods of interacting during investigative, administrative, and judicial proceedings with children subjected to child abuse; and (3) conduct research on the causes, prevention, identification, and treatment of child abuse and neglect, and on appropriate and effective investigative, administrative, and judicial procedures in cases of child abuse. Directs the Secretary, within two years after the first fiscal year for which funds are obligated for the Children's Justice Grant program, to: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of the assisted programs; and (2) report to the appropriate congressional committees on such evaluation and the technical assistance provided to the States through the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect. Requires that specified materials and information be made available to the appropriate State officials within 180 days after enactment of this Act. Sets forth requirements for coordination of Federal programs involving child abuse prevention and treatment. Requires the Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect to meet at least every six months. Requires the Advisory Board to prevent unnecessary duplication of programs, ensure efficient allocation of resources, and assure that programs effectively address all aspects of the child abuse problem. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) acquire from criminal justice agencies statistical data, for 1987 and 1988, about the incidence of child abuse, including sexual abuse; and (2) publish annually a summary of such data. Directs the Attorney General, by January 1, 1989, to modify the uniform crime reporting program in the Federal Bureau of Investigation to include data on the age of the victim of the offense and the relationship, if any, of the victim to the offender, for types of offenses that may involve child abuse, including sexual abuse. Amends the Public Health Service Act to provide that specified prohibitions under such Act do not apply to the reporting under State law of incidents of suspected child abuse and neglect to the appropriate State or local authorities. Title II: Temporary Child Care for Handicapped Children and Crisis Nurseries - Temporary Child Care for Handicapped Children and Crisis Nurseries Act of 1986 - Directs the Secretary to establish a demonstration program of grants to States to assist private and public agencies and organizations to provide in-home or out-of-home temporary non-medical child care for handicapped children and children with chronic or terminal illnesses. Requires that such care be provided on a sliding fee scale with hourly and daily rates. Directs the Secretary to establish a demonstration program of grants to States to assist private and public agencies and organizations to provide nurseries for children who are abused and neglected, at high risk of abuse and neglect, or in families receiving child protective services. Requires that service be provided without fee for a maximum of 30 days in any year. Requires such crisis nurseries to also provide referral to support services. Sets forth administrative provisions for applications, award of such demonstration grants, and evaluations. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 and 1988 to carry out this title."
