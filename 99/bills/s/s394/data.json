Waives repayment if the facility is used as a shelter for at least ten years. Requires 25 percent non-Federal matching funds and a three-year use commitment. Limits payments for any single facility to not more than $200,000. Directs the Secretary to coordinate activities with the Federal Interagency Task Force on Food and Shelter, chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and to identify vacant and surplus Federal facilities for emergency housing conversion. Requires a report to the Congress within three months after the end of FY 1986. Authorizes FY 1986 through 1988 appropriations. Directs the Secretary to constitute an emergency housing and food program national board of volunteer agencies to carry out an emergency housing and food program. States that such board shall distribute program funds to localities (which shall constitute local boards) with the greatest need for emergency food and housing assistance. Requires the local board to submit to the national board an annual local homeless housing assistance plan. Limits administrative costs to not more than two percent of appropriations. Authorizes FY 1986 through 1988 appropriations. Directs the Secretary to make grants for demonstration projects to assist the homeless in the transition to independent living. Limits Federal participation to up to 75 percent of project costs. Requires interim and final reports to the Congress. Authorizes FY 1986 through 1988 appropriations."
