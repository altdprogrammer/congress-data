Provides that following the freeze Medicare will only fund residencies or internships for the lesser of five years or the number of years required for initial board eligibility in a specialty. Prohibits, after July 1, 1986, Medicare funding for any intern or resident who is neither a graduate of a U.S. or Canadian medical school nor a U.S. or Canadian citizen. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study of and report to the Congress with respect to approved educational activities relating to nursing and other health professions for which Medicare reimburses hospitals. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study of and report to the Congress with respect to the difference between the amounts of payments made under Medicare for inpatients treated in a teaching hospital and the amounts of such payments which are made for comparable patients treated in a nonteaching hospital."
