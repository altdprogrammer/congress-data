Makes it a Federal offense for any person to advertise: (1) any product depicting sexually explicit conduct with a minor; or (2) the opportunity to participate in any such conduct with a minor. Establishes guidelines to assist the courts in determining the age of the child appearing in such pornographic materials. Eliminates any requirement that the government must identify the minor in order to obtain a conviction. Amends the Mann Act to include the transportation of males within its coverage and makes other changes so that the offense is sex neutral. Increases the penalty for the transportation of minors. Provides for a fine of not more than $75,000 or imprisonment for not more than 15 years, or both. Increases the fine to not more than $150,000 or imprisonment for a minimum of two years and a maximum of 20 years for a subsequent conviction. Repeals the requirement that the prohibited conduct be considered lewd or be for commercial purposes."
