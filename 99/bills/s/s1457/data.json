Defines \"least system cost plan\" as a plan which provides for meeting demand for electric energy services under which each measure to be implemented is forecast: (1) to be reliable and available within the time it is needed; and (2) to meet or reduce the electric power demand at an estimated incremental system cost no greater than that of the least-cost similarly reliable and available alternative measure or resource."
