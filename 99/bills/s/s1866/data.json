    "text": "Title I: Measures Relating to Exchange Rates - Declares that it is U.S. policy that the United States and the Western industrialized allies should coordinate: (1) monetary and fiscal policies in order to eliminate imbalances in trade and capital flows and to stabilize exchange rates; and (2) the participation by central banks in international currency markets in order to reduce severe currency fluctuations, deter currency speculation, aid in the stabilization of the dollar in international currency markets, and promote orderly exchange rate adjustments. Directs the President, within six months of enactment of this Act, to enter into negotiations with: (1) other G-5 countries (West Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and France) to improve the international monetary system; (2) the other G-5 countries to enhance their role in coordinating fiscal and monetary policy to ensure that their policies converge on money growth, inflation, fiscal policy, interest rates, and other economic factors; and (3) other countries to achieve reciprocal opportunities for investment. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board to accumulate foreign currencies in amounts sufficient to make participation in foreign exchange markets effective and credible. Requires the President to report to the Congress every six months on implementation of this title. Title II: Measures Relating to Developing Country Debtors - Requires the negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to developing country debtors to be to: (1) reduce barriers to U.S. exports; (2) reduce barriers to foreign investment; (3) lessen the burden on U.S. exports and international trade caused by destabilizing debt service and trade and investment barriers maintained by developing countries; (4) lessen the destablizing impact of difficulties in international debt service; (5) encourage developing countries to eliminate structural barriers that limit their efficiency and productivity; and (6) permit the resumption of economic growth of developing countries. Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to authorize the Export-Import Bank to establish for FY 1986 through 1989 the Trade Expansion Loan Guarantee and Insurance program. Requires the program to be available to the Export-Import Bank for the establishment of general facilities consisting of guarantees and insurance in support of U.S. exports to specific developing countries if certain conditions are met. Authorizes the President to enter into negotiations with members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to eliminate official financing or support for new mining or production facilities for commodities in developing countries and to encourage the reduction of commodities from such facilities if the commodity is in oversupply internationally. Authorizes the President to enter into negotiations with members of each multilateral development bank to prohibit aid by each such bank for any new mining or production facility for a commodity that is in oversupply internationally. Authorizes the President to enter into negotiations with the members of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to terminate the Compensatory Financing Facility and transfer the resources and assets of the Facility to the general resources of the IMF. Authorizes the President to enter into negotiations with members of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development for: (1) an agreement to permit increases in loans and guarantees by the Bank up to 200 percent of the Bank's unimpaired subscribed capital, reserves, and surplus; (2) an agreement that new lending by the Bank would be at interest rates based upon an index reflecting economic conditions in the country getting the loan; and (3) an agreement that new loans made by the Bank should be conditioned on the removal of existing trade and investment barriers and on the promotion of development of the private sector. Requires the President to report annually to the Congress on implementation of this title."
