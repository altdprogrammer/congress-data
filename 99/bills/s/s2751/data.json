Authorizes the Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior to exchange specified lands with the Corporation, reserving an access easement through the Portage Pass of the Sulzer Portage Traditional Area. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to redesignate lands in the Tongass Land Management Plan to compensate for timber lands lost in the exchange. Authorizes the Secretaries to exchange the subsurface estate of such lands with the Sealaska Corporation if the surface land exchange with the Haida Corporation is completed. Directs the Secretaries to propose legislation to the Congress for further land exchanges with the Haida Corporation."
