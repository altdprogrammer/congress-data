    "text": "Skilled Enlisted Reserve Training Act - Directs the Secretary of each military department to establish a skilled enlisted reserve training program to obtain adequate numbers of enlisted members with critical technical skills. Permits each Secretary to enter into an agreement with a qualified person under which the Secretary agrees to provide educational assistance in a technical field in exchange for that person's agreement to serve either: (1) on active duty for one month for each month of assistance received; or (2) in the reserves for four months for each month of assistance received. Sets a monthly maximum payment of $300 for such assistance and a maximum length of such assistance at 24 months. Sets forth eligibility requirements. Requires accepted members to complete basic training before beginning technical training. Sets forth penalties for noncompletion of training, including possible reimbursement of educational assistance. Requires the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to approve the courses and educational institution before the Secretary may enter into an agreement with a member. Permits the Veterans Administration to provide educational assistance under this Act. Directs the President to make an annual report to the Congress concerning such program. Authorizes appropriations."
