Requires the Secretary to determine the total quantity of each commodity owned by the CCC each year. Requires the Secretary to make available for export an amount equal to at least 20 percent of the total quantities owned by the CCC the previous year.

Authorizes appropriations for such purposes. Title III: Wheat - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to direct the Secretary to make nonrecourse loans available to producers for each of the 1986 through 1993 crops of wheat at a level of $2.20 per bushel.

Title VII: Dairy - Directs the Secretary to make price support available to the producers of milk at a level of $10.60 per hundredweight for manufacturing grade milk containing 3.67 percent milkfat. Permits the Secretary to raise or lower the price support under specified circumstances. Provides the method for determining the amount of a producer's eligibility for any fiscal year. Establishes the maximum amount of payments which a person may receive as: (1) $20,000 for FY 1986; (2) $18,400 for FY 1987; (3) $16,000 for FY 1988; (4) $13,000 for FY 1989; and (5) $10,000 for FY 1990.

Provides that such acreage shall not be eligible for price supports under such Act. Declares such acreage eligible for the Conservation Acreage Reserve. Title IX: Grain Reserve - Authorizes the Secretary to provide original or extended price support loans for wheat and feed grains. Allows the Secretary to provide for: (1) the repayment of such loans in one to three years; (2) the prohibition of the forfeiture to the CCC of wheat or feed grains pledged as collateral for such loans; (3) the interest rate; (4) payments to producers for storage for the first year of the loan; and (5) payments for storage for the second and third year of such loans if the quantity of wheat or feed gain in the reserve falls below a certain level and the Secretary determines that such payments will not disrupt the market. Provides that interest shall not accrue during the first year of such loans. Allows the Secretary to waive or adjust such interest during the second and third year under specified circumstances. Declares that the Secretary shall not provide such loans during the 1985 and subsequent crop years unless: (1) the quantity of wheat or feed grains falls below a certain level; or (2) the Secretary determines that such levels do not reflect current supply and demand conditions and the quantity of such reserves falls below a certain projected usage.
