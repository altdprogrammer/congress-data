    "text": "Veterans' Chiropractic Services Demonstration Projects Act of 1985 - Directs the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to conduct no less than five demonstration projects in five different geographical regions of the United States during FY 1986 through 1988 to provide chiropractic services to eligible veterans and to evaluate the therapeutic benefits and the cost effectiveness of furnishing chiropractic service to such veterans. Requires the Administrator to enter into cooperative agreements with not less than five chiropractic colleges in five geographic regions to coordinate the provision of chiropractic services to veterans and perform clinical research and data collection regarding the therapeutic benefits and cost-effectiveness of such services. Sets forth conditions under which the Administrator shall reimburse a veteran for chiropractic services furnished under such a demonstration project. Permits the Administrator to pay the chiropractor who furnished such services directly in lieu of reimbursing the veteran. Requires the Administrator to establish a schedule of reasonable charges for such services. Limits the amount an eligible veteran may receive for chiropractic services to $600 in any 12-month period. Allows the Administrator to prescribe a limit on the amount payable to any chiropractic college in any fiscal year under a cooperative agreement. Limits the total expenditures for chiropractic services under a demonstration project to $2,000,000 in any fiscal year. Requires the Administrator to report to the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees on the number of requests for, and the amounts paid for, reimbursement or payments for chiropractic services under the demonstration projects established by this Act."
