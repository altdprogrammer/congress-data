Limits the kinds of computers covered by this Act to those operating in interstate or foreign commerce or operating on behalf of a financial institution. Provides lesser penalties for knowingly and without authorization accessing such computer. Lists factors to be considered in determining whether Federal jurisdiction should be exercised where jurisdiction exists concurrently with a State or local entity. Requires the Attorney General to report annually to the Congress concerning the extent of the exercise of Federal jurisdiction and report on the use of computers in the United States."
