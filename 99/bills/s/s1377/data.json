    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-06-27", 
    "text": "Agency Accountability Act of 1985 - Requires each Federal agency to: (1) prepare a semiannual agenda listing significant rules to be proposed during the next twelve months; and (2) transmit such agenda to the appropriate congressional committee. Directs each agency to forward a copy of each recommended final rule to the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House of Representatives on the same day such rule is sent to the Federal Register for publication. Requires the Secretary and the Clerk to transmit a copy of a recommended final rule to the appropriate committees. Prohibits any such rule from becoming effective within 30 days after it is received by the Secretary and the Clerk. Provides that if before the expiration of such 30 day period, either appropriate committee orders reported or is discharged from consideration of a joint resolution with respect to such rule, such rule may not become effective until the earlier of: (1) the end of the 60 day period beginning on the date of which the committee ordered reported or is discharged from consideration of such joint resolution, except that such rule may not become effective if within such 60 day period a joint resolution with respect to such rule has become law; (2) any time after either House of Congress has rejected a joint resolution with respect to such rule; or (3) the adjournment of Congress sine die at the end of a Congress, except that such rule may not become effective if a period of 30 days has not expired since the date on which the rule was received by the appropriate committees and within such 30 day period a joint resolution with respect to such rule has become law. Permits the requirements of this Act to be waived if the head of an agency, upon written notice to the appropriate committee finds: (1) that to follow the requirements would be contrary to the public interest; (2) the rule is being issued in response to exceptional circumstances requiring immediate agency action in the public interest; or (3) the contents of the rule must be kept confidential prior to the effective date of the rule. Exempts agency compliance from judicial review. Authorizes an agency to issue a recommended final rule which relates to the same acts or practices as a disapproved rule. Requires such rule to be transmitted to the Secretary and the Clerk in the same manner as required for other rules under this Act. Amends the Administrative Procedure Act to require the rulemaking procedures of such Act to be followed in the case of an interpretive rule, a general statement of policy, or a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice, if such rule or statement has general applicability and substantially alters or creates rights or obligations of persons outside the agency."
