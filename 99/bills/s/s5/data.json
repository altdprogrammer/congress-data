    "text": "Pay Equity Act of 1983 - Requires the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, after consultation with the Secretary of Labor, to publish in the Federal Register guidelines for identifying and eliminating discriminatory wage-setting practices and discriminatory wage differentials. Requires the guidelines to include recommendations for utilization of job-evaluation techniques to establish rates of compensation for employees. Requires the Commission to submit annually to the President and the Congress a detailed report of the activities of the Commission in carrying out the purposes of this Act. Authorizes the Commission to have a study conducted by a private consultant on the wage-setting practices and wage differentials within and between the Federal Government's position classification system and the job grading system. Directs the Commission to submit a report on the findings to the President, the Congress, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management. Requires the Secretary of Labor to publish guidelines and submit an annual report to the President and the Congress for the purpose of requiring all contractors of the United States to identify and eliminate discriminatory wage-setting practices and wage differentials. Requires each Federal agency responsible for submitting an equal employment opportunity plan under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include a review and identification of any discriminatory wage-setting practices and wage differentials with respect to its labor force and a plan to eliminate such practices. Requires the Commission to submit to the President and the Congress a detailed report of its enforcement activities relating to the Equal Pay Act."
