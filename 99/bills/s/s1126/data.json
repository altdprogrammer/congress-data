Treats any tangible property used in space as five-year depreciable property for purposes of the accelerated cost recovery system (ACRS). Allows an income tax credit for increasing research activities for research conducted in space. Treats income derived from commercial activity in space aboard a qualified spacecraft as income derived from sources within the United States."
