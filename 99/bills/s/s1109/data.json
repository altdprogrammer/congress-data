Declares that the purpose of such program is to apply data design methods developed by the Department of Energy (and other international research organizations) to the development of a 200 kilowatt integrated open cycle ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) experimental system at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990. Provides for such authorizations to be matched dollar for dollar by the State of Hawaii, the private sector, and other partners."
