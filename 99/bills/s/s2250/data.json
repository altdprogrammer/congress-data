Prohibits the payment of kickbacks, the acceptance of kickbacks, the solicitation of kickbacks, attempted kickbacks, and the inclusion of kickback costs in contract expenses ultimately borne by the United States. Increases criminal and civil penalties for such conduct. Authorizes the recovery of kickback costs through administrative offsets. Requires prime contractors to report kickback violations to appropriate agency officials or the Department of Justice. Authorizes the contracting agency to inspect the facilities and audit the records and books of the prime contractor. (Currently, only the General Accounting Office has such authority.) Requires each prime contract to contain requirements that the prime contractor: (1) follow reasonable procedures designed to prevent and detect kickback violations; and (2) cooperate with any Federal investigation of a kickback violation."
