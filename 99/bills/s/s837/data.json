Entitles any individual or entity excluded from participation to a hearing. Directs the Secretary to promptly notify each appropriate State agency administering or supervising the administration of a State health care program of the fact and circumstances of each exclusion.

Requires a State, as a condition of Medicaid plan approval, to provide for the following: (1) a system of reporting any type of adverse action concluded against any health care practitioner or entity by the State or a local licensing authority; and (2) such access to documents as may be necessary by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to provide suitable safeguards for the confidentiality of such information. Requires any health care provider providing health care services for which payment may be made under the Act to assure that services or items furnished: (1) will be provided economically and only when, and to the extent, medically necessary; (2) will be quality services which meet professionally recognized standards of health care; and (3) will be supported by evidence of medical necessity and quality in such form and fashion and at such time as may reasonably be required by a reviewing peer review organization in the exercise of its duties and responsibilities. Permits a State to exclude from Medicaid participation any individual or entity excluded under Medicare pursuant to the patient and program protection provisions. Requires a State in order to receive Federal payments with respect to a health maintenance organization (HMO) to exclude any HMO that: (1) could be excluded because of the conviction of the owners or managers of certain crimes; or (2) contracts with any individual or entity convicted of such crimes. Prohibits Federal payments with respect to any amount expended for items or services furnished with respect to any individual or entity excluded from Medicaid participation because of the patient and program protection provisions. Prohibits a State under title V from making payments to any individual or entity excluded from participation pursuant to the patient and program protection provisions. Revises disclosure requirements under part A of title XI. Revises Medicare provisions concerning agreements with providers. Sets forth effective date provisions. Amends the Controlled Substances Act and part A (General Provisions) of title XI to authorize the Attorney General to suspend or revoke a registration to manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlled substance upon a finding that the registrant has been excluded from participation under the Medicare program."
