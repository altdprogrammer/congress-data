Requires that such fee awards be based on rates prevailing in the community in which the action or proceeding arose for the kind and quality of the services furnished. Prohibits use of a bonus or multiplier in calculating such fee awards. Prohibits such awards for services performed subsequent to the time of a written offer of settlement to a parent or guardian, if specified conditions exist, unless the rejection of the settlement order is substantially justified. Provides for reduction of awards for unreasonable fees under specified circumstances.
