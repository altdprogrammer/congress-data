States that such funds may be used for: (1) maternal and child health services; (2) preventive health and health services; (3) alcohol and drug abuse and mental health services; and (4) any program of preventive health which the Secretary of Health and Human Services has approved. Prohibits the use of such funds for: (1) inpatient services (with specified exceptions); (2) cash payments to intended recipients of health services; (3) the purchase or improvement of land, buildings, or other facilities; (4) the purchase of major medical equipment; or (5) satisfying any requirement for the expenditure of non-Federal funds. Sets forth the grant application procedure. Requires each State to submit an annual report to the Secretary.
