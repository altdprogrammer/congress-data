    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to treat as long-term capital gain amounts actually paid to a taxpayer with respect to a small business participating debenture which constitute the distribution of a share of earnings of the issuer. Defines \"small business participating debenture\" (SBPD) as a written debt instrument issued by a qualified small business which: (1) is a general obligation of such business; (2) bears interest at a rate not less than specified by the Secretary of the Treasury; (3) has a fixed maturity; (4) grants no voting or conversion rights in the business to the purchaser; and (5) provides for the payment of a share of the issuer's total earnings. Defines \"qualified small business\" as one: (1) whose paid-in capital does not exceed $1,000,000 immediately before the small business participating debenture is issued; (2) the face value of whose outstanding SBPD's does not exceed $1,000,000; (3) which has no securities outstanding subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission; (4) which derived more than 50 percent of its aggregate gross receipts from sources other than royalties, rents, dividends, interest, annuities, sales and exchanges of stocks or securities, and transactions in real estate; and (5) which is not under foreign control. Allows an interest expense deduction for interest and share-of-earnings payments made on such debentures. Treats losses on small business participating debentures as ordinary loss."
