    "text": "Amends the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 to revise restrictions on certain imported vehicles that do not conform to Federal standards. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to exempt certain motor vehicles or equipment from such restrictions for purposes of research, investigation, study, demonstration, training, national security, or completion in the United States of an incomplete foreign-built vehicle or equipment item. Authorizes the Secretaries of Transportation and of the Treasury to promulgate joint regulations which authorize the importation of non-conforming vehicles if an individual has never imported such a vehicle before and seeks to do so for personal use to meet unforeseen cases of extreme hardship or extraordinary circumstances. Permits such regulations to require the vehicles, as a condition of importation, to be brought into conformity with prescribed safety standards."
