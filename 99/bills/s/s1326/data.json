Specifies the law enforcement duties of such Air Marshals. Requires the Administrator to continually review foreign airport security programs and to publish in the Federal Register those airports which the Administrator has determined to have an effective security program. Requires the President to take action as if he had determined a foreign nation was acting in a manner inconsistent with the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft whenever a foreign nation impedes United States Air Marshals from fulfilling their functions as unidentified armed passengers. Authorizes appropriations."
