Directs the President to publish and to report to the Congress the actions the President intends to take. Requires the President to implement such actions within 90 days of enactment of this Act. Requires such actions to be calculated to offset the cumulative impact of relaxing voluntary restraints on Japanese automobile exports to the United States on the U.S.-Japanese balance of trade. Requires such actions to be aimed against competitive Japanese exports. Permits such actions to be modified or revoked only if the President determines that: (1) such modification or revocation is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Act; or (2) the objectives of this Act have been achieved."
