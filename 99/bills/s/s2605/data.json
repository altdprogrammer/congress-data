Requires countries receiving cash transfers under the Economic Support Fund to use such transfers, whenever practicable, to pay for U.S. goods or for services performed by a U.S. national. Requires the Comptroller General to monitor and audit the cash expenditures transferred through the Economic Support Fund."
