Directs OCTA to prepare for publication an Executive Branch Report on Critical Trends and Alternative Futures every four years beginning in 1990. Lists the contents of such report, including: (1) an identification and analysis of critical trends and alternative futures for the next 20 years; and (2) an evaluation of the effects of Government policies on such trends. Requires the Director of OCTA to make draft copies of the report available to interested persons for review and comment. Directs the President to submit such report to the Congress. Requires that such report be made available as a public document. Makes OCTA responsible for advising the President of the potential effects of Government policies on critical trends and alternative futures. Requires OCTA to: (1) insure that the Government agencies responsible for areas of policy being considered are provided an opportunity to comment on such effects; and (2) include such comments in any reports provided to the President. Directs OCTA to establish an Advisory Commission on Critical Trends Analysis to advise OCTA and to promote the public discussion of critical trends and the use of analyses of such trends to create alternative futures. Requires the Joint Economic Committee, by the end of 1989 and each second year thereafter, to prepare for publication a Legislative Branch Report on Critical Trends and Alternative Futures. Directs certain legislative agencies to provide any necessary information. Requires that such report: (1) be submitted to each House of the Congress after being approved by the Committee; and (2) be made available as a public document."
