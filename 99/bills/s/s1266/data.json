Revises the part E Federal funding limitations and the formula for determining a State's allotment. Provides for Medicaid (title XIX of the Act) eligibility for children eligible for adoption assistance payments. Makes permanent certain temporary provisions of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 which provide for Federal payments for certain dependent children voluntarily placed in foster care. Repeals a related reporting requirement."
