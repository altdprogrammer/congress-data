Authorizes States to submit alternative mileage disclosure requirements for the approval of the Secretary of Transportation. Provides that auction companies selling motor vehicles must maintain records showing: (1) the name of the most recent owner; (2) the vehicle identification number; and (3) the odometer reading on the date the auction company took possession of the vehicle. Requires such mileage information to be disclosed by the lessee to the lessor of a leased motor vehicle when the lessor transfers ownership of the vehicle. Increases the civil penalty for violations of the odometer requirements from $1,000 to $2,000, and increases the criminal penalty for such violations from one to three years maximum imprisonment."
