    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-07-17", 
    "text": "Trade Emergency and Export Promotion Act - Declares that actions by the President, the International Trade Commission (ITC), the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) pursuant to this Act shall not be reviewable by any court, except for abuse of discretion. Title I: International Trade Actions and Agreements - Declares that a national emergency exists because of distortions and imbalances in trade and instability in exchange rates and that such emergency requires extraordinary measures, including action to: (1) restore the value of the dollar; and (2) either eliminate foreign unfair trade barriers or prohibit countries which employ such barriers from enjoying trade surpluses with the United States or increasing shares of world export markets. Authorizes the President to negotiate and enter into with any foreign country or entity agreements limiting the export from such country or entity, and the importation into the United States of any article. Directs the USTR to initiate proceedings against Japan before appropriate international bodies in order to obtain authorization to take trade actions against Japan on the grounds that: (1) Japan has failed to comply with trade agreements entered into with the United States; and (2) Japan has adopted numerous domestic policies and practices that impair and violate such trade agreements and impede achievement of their objectives. Directs the USTR, with the cooperation of the Secretary of Agriculture, to initiate actions under all international trade agreements to which the United States is a party in order to take appropriate countermeasures against agricultural export subsidies provided by the European Communities and other countries which will be used to prevent: (1) injury to U.S. agricultural producers; (2) nullification or impairment of such trade agreements; and (3) serious prejudice to the United States. Authorizes the USTR to initiate actions against each foreign country (except Japan and the European Communities) or entity that was an excess worldwide trade surplus country or an excess bilateral trade surplus country for 1984 under all applicable U.S. laws and international agreements in order to: (1) enforce the rights of the United States under such international agreements; and (2) obtain the elimination of certain trade acts, policies, and practices of such countries or entities. Directs the USTR to explain in proceedings initiated under this title that the United States finds it necessary to take the actions provided in title II of this Act as interim measures pending the outcome of such proceedings in order to protect vital U.S. interests. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a plan to reduce fluctuations between currencies on foreign currency exchange markets. Sets forth characteristics of such plan. Title II: Interim Domestic Trade Actions to Respond to the Trade Emergency - Subtitle A: Stand-by Duties - Directs the ITC to determine annually each major exporting country's: (1) worldwide nonpetroleum export percentage; (2) bilateral nonpetroleum export percentage; (3) worldwide nonpetroleum trade surplus; (4) bilateral nonpetroleum trade surplus; (5) worldwide trade surplus limitation; and (6) bilateral trade surplus limitation. Requires the ITC to report annually to the President on: (1) the determinations on the trade of such major exporting countries; (2) the identity of each foreign country which was an excess worldwide trade surplus country or excess bilateral trade surplus country during the preceding year; and (3) whether or not standby duties should be imposed on imports from such countries. Requires the President within 15 days of receiving such report to determine, with respect to each country identified as an excess worldwide trade surplus country or excess bilateral trade surplus country: (1) whether such country unfairly restricts or limits the access of imports to its markets; and (2) if the President determines that such country does restrict access to its markets, whether such restriction contributes to that country's trade surplus. Requires the President, if both such determinations are positive, to impose stand-by duties on all imports from such countries. Prohibits making such determinations or imposing such duties if the U.S. trade deficit divided by the U.S. gross national product is less than one and one-half percent. Requires the President to report to the Congress, within 15 days of receiving the reports on worldwide and bilateral trade, on the determinations made with respect to imposing stand-by duties. Declares that the rate of a stand-by duty shall be 25 percent ad valorem and that such duty shall be in addition to any other duties. Provides for the implementation of such duties. Requires all revenues from such stand-by duties to be allocated to the Public Debt Reduction Account in the Treasury. Expresses the sense of the Congress that all funds in such Account be used only to reduce the Federal debt. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to the Congress on the revenue derived from such stand-by duties. Prohibits imposing stand-by duties on articles imported after April 30, 1992. Prohibits requiring reports and determinations on trade surpluses after April 1991. Subtitle B: Agricultural Export Subsidies - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to formulate and carry out a program under which farm commodities are provided for free to U.S. exporters and users and foreign purchasers to encourage the development, maintenance, and expansion of export markets for U.S. farm commodities. Directs the USTR to: (1) investigate the existence and status of export subsidies or other export enhancing techniques; (2) identify and give priority to markets in which U.S. export subsidies can be used most efficiently and will have the greatest impact in offsetting the benefits of foreign export subsidies that harm U.S. exports, are inconsistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), nullify or impair benefits accruing to the United States under international agreements, or cause serious prejudice to U.S. interests; and (3) press for action by the GATT Committee on Trade and Agriculture to institute an effective set of rules eliminating export subsidies. Directs the USTR to report to the Congress and the Secretary of Agriculture on a quarterly basis on: (1) the existence and status of export subsidies and other export enhancing techniques; and (2) the identification and assignment of priority to certain markets. Provides for implementing the farm commodity export program. Subtitle C: Reports - Directs the President to report annually to specified congressional committees on the operation of such Act. Title III: Trade Law Reform - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to transfer to the USTR from the President the authority to order import relief and the authority to extend tariff preferences. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to transfer to the USTR from the President the authority to approve or disapprove ITC actions to prevent unfair practices in import trade."
