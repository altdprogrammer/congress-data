    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-02-27", 
    "text": "Water Project Amendments of 1985 - Requires any single landowner whose land value is projected to benefit by a certain amount from a flood control project to repay 50 percent of the project's cost allocated to that owner's benefit. Limits this requirement to situations where more than ten percent of projected flood control benefits can be attributed to an increase in anticipated land values to a single landowner. Allows a non-Federal sponsor of such project to pay 100 percent of the costs associated with the landowner's windfall benefits wherever the Secretary of the Army fails to reach an agreement with the landowner. Requires the Secretary to include in any subsequent general investigation survey information on the likelihood of such situations. Prescribes contents of certain reports to specified congressional committees, including: (1) the possibility of facility failure due to geologic or design factors; and (2) the impact of the proposed project on existing recreational facilities. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to identify the impact of the proposed project on the usage and economic viability of competing modes of transportation. Deauthorizes projects or project elements under the responsibility of the Secretary of the Army not commenced within ten years unless proper notification to the Congress is given and the appropriate congressional committees adopt resolutions directing continued authorization. Directs the Secretary of the Army to provide Congress with a list of all surveys and studies which have an inactive or deferred status. Allows the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works or the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation to deauthorize all such surveys. Deauthorizes any general investigation survey if no funds have been expended within four full years after its approval. Directs the Secretary of the Army to perform a cost effectiveness review where the costs of a proposed water resources project exceeds $10,000,000. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring civil works construction project contractors to perform recordkeeping that is the Secretary's responsibility. Requires that: (1) any project with an anticipated Federal cost exceeding $10,000,000 be authorized by an Act of Congress; and (2) such projects contain benefits directly related to agriculture that account for at least 20 percent of total benefits. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Administrator of the Soil Conservation Service, to report by April 1, 1987, to the appropriate congressional committees on the feasibility and desirability of requiring full public access to federally constructed water impoundments with recreation potential. Modifies the flood control project for the Rio Grande Floodway, Truth or Consequences Unit, New Mexico, to authorize the Secretary of the Army to construct a flood control dam on Cuchillo Negro Creek in lieu of the authorized floodway. Authorizes the construction of a set of emergency gates in the conduit of the Abiquiu Dam, New Mexico. Directs the Secretary of the Army to transfer responsibility for those portions of New Mexico currently under the Corps of Engineer district engineers in Sacramento and Los Angeles to the district engineer in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Authorizes the following flood control projects: (1) Middle Rio Grande flood protection, Bernalillo to Belen, New Mexico; and (2) Puerco River and tributaries, Gallup, New Mexico."
