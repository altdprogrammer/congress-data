    "text": "Federal Food Irradiation Development and Control Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to delete \"sources of radiation\" from the definition of \"food additive\". Defines \"food irradiation treatment\" as a food process. Applies specified food additive regulatory provisions to food irradiation treatments. Declares it to be the express intent of the Congress to require national uniformity in the regulation of food irradiation treatment. Prohibits States or their political subdivisions from establishing food irradiation requirements different from, or in addition to, Federal requirements. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to state that the Department of Energy may lease at fair market rates nuclear byproduct material for commercial food irradiation purposes. Establishes within the Department of Agriculture the Joint Operating Commission for Food Irradiation Treatment. Includes within such Commission's functions: (1) research and information exchange coordination; (2) encouragement of private enterprise in the development of food irradiation treatment; and (3) an annual report to the Congress. Authorizes appropriations."
