Authorizes the Commission to transfer funds to any Federal agency for the purpose of promoting the commemoration of the bicentennial. Declares that it is not the purpose of this Act or the law which established the Commission to preempt any other government entity from celebrating the bicentennial under its own authority. Authorizes the Commission to authorize the use of the bicentennial logo for noncommercial, educational purposes without charge when such use is essentially a public service. Sets forth terms and conditions for the Commission to grant commercial licenses for the use of such logo and penalties for violations of such terms. Authorizes appropriations."
