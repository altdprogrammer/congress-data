    "text": "Amends title IX (Graduate Programs) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish a child abuse professional clinical experience program. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to enter into grants or contracts with graduate schools for paying up to 90 percent of the costs of establishing or expanding graduate student clinical training programs for identifying, intervening, treating, and preventing sexual exploitation of children, child abduction, and other forms of child abuse and neglect. Sets forth requirements for such programs, including the use of an interdisciplinary approach. Includes under the definition of such programs: (1) programs involving the placement of students in social service agencies, health care facilities, law enforcement and criminal justice agencies, courts, and elementary and secondary schools; and (2) other programs which provide services to abused, neglected, abducted, or exploited children and their families. Limits the amount a graduate school may receive under this Act for any fiscal year and its use of such funds to pay indirect costs or charges. Sets forth application requirements. Directs the Secretary to allocate such grants or contracts so as to provide an equitable distribution throughout the United States among graduate schools which show promise of being able to use such funds effectively. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990."
