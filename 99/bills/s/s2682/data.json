Amends the United States Grain Standards Act to require the Administrator of the Federal Grain Inspection Service to: (1) require a sublot of grain to meet the standards and procedures of a lot of grain; and (2) require the separate measurement of the quantity of dockage and foreign material in grain shipped in interstate or foreign commerce and the deduction of the sum of the two quantities from the gross weight of the grain. Prohibits the export of grain that has been recombined or combined with any dockage or foreign material. Requires an official certificate issued for a lot of grain to include a statement of: (1) with respect to corn, the separate quantities of broken corn and foreign material; and (2) with respect to wheat, the quantity of dockage and the protein content of the wheat."
