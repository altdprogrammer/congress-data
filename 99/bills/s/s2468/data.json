    "text": "Antiterrorism and Air Security Act of 1986 - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (the Administrator) to require the pre-employment investigation (including fingerprinting, if the Administrator determines it is necessary) of any employee with authorized access to: (1) air carriers or foreign air carrier aircraft; or (2) secured areas of U.S. airports serving such air carriers. Requires that any fingerprinting ordered by the Administrator in a criminal history records check shall be submitted to the Attorney General for identification and such a records check. Directs the Administrator to prescribe regulations to implement the pre-employment investigation requirement. Prohibits, with certain exceptions, air carriers or airport operators from employing persons: (1) without the pre-employment investigation; or (2) if such an investigation indicates the existence of a factor which the Administrator determines warrants exclusion from access to aircraft or secured areas. Establishes criminal penalties (including a fine and imprisonment) for the willful violation of the security program relating to secured airport areas or aircraft. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should: (1) undertake discussions regarding air transportation security measures with any nation serviced by U.S. air travel; and (2) discourage U.S. air carriers from servicing any nation not cooperating in increasing air transportation security."
