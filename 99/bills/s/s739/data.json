States the purposes of the Endowment to be to: (1) provide shelter, food, and supportive services for the homeless; (2) promote greater cooperation between the public and private sectors in providing services for the homeless; and (3) provide funds for innovative local programs for the homeless. States that the Endowment may only fund programs undertaken by nonprofit organizations and units of local government, and that such assistance shall be in addition to, rather than a substitute for, financial support otherwise available for the homeless. Sets forth grant distribution and operating provisions. Establishes within the Endowment a National Council of Shelter, Food, and Service Providers. Requires an annual report to the President for transmittal to the Congress. Authorizes FY 1986 through 1988 appropriations, including additional matching amounts."
