    "text": "Vietnam Veterans' Delayed Reentry and Psychological Readjustment and Vocational Rehabilitation Assistance Act of 1985 - Provides Vietnam veterans who are suffering from psychological readjustment problems related to their military service or readjustment therefrom with priority treatment within the mainstream Veterans Administration (VA) medical health resources. Gives service connected disability status, at a noncompensable level, to Vietnam and other eligible veterans who experience mental health problems which are determined by a VA psychiatrist or psychologist to require mental health services to facilitate successful readjustment to civilian life. Requires VA psychiatrists and psychologists to determine if a Vietnam veteran's psychological problems were incurred or aggravated in the service or constitute a post-traumatic stress disorder, thus warranting a service connection for a disability. Directs the VA to institute a comprehensive research and training program for professional, paraprofessional, and lay personnel dealing with Vietnam veterans to assure that they have the ability to counsel, screen, and test Vietnam veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and provide effective therapy, readjustment, and rehabilitation for their unique medical and psychosocial readjustment problems. Authorizes veterans whose serious mental health problems are related to their military service or readjustment therefrom, but do not warrant permanent disability compensation, to participate in the VA's vocational rehabilitation program."
