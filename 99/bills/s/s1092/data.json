Prescribes penalties to be imposed on anyone who, except under the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury, controls or possesses a device similar to any distinctive counterfeit deterrent device adopted by the United States for its securities or other obligations. Includes any electronic means of counterfeiting as counterfeiting apparatus for purposes of counterfeiting prohibitions. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, after apprising the Secretary of State, to engrave and print currency and other security documents or engage in related research and development for a foreign country on a reimbursable basis, provided that such activity does not interfere with the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's domestic production. Provides that the Secretary of the Treasury shall not be required to reissue U.S. currency notes upon redemption. Establishes the Treasurer of the United States as an Executive Schedule level IV position."
