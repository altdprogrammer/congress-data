    "date": "1986-07-23", 
    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation with amendment, S. Rept. 99-338) Title I - National Science Foundation Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987 - Authorizes appropriations to the National Science Foundation (NSF) for FY 1987. Lists categories for which 1987 funds may be made available. Limits amounts of FY 1987 funds which may be used for official consultation, representation, or other extraordinary expenses, and for NSF expenses incurred outside the United States. Prohibits the transfer of funds among the listed categories from exceeding ten percent unless: (1) written notice is given to the Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate, and the appropriate authorizing committees; and (2) 30 days have passed after such notice. Requires the Director of NSF to allocate additional funds for specified activities. Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to remove from the list of responsibilities of the NSF the requirement to maintain a current register of scientific and technical personnel. Removes provisions for Assistant Directors of NSF. Removes the limitation that requires the NSF to only award scholarships and graduate fellowships for scientific study or work within the limits of funds made available specifically for such purposes pursuant to appropriations under such Act. Establishes a task force on women, minorities, and the handicapped in science, engineering, and technology in the Federal Government and in federally assisted research programs. Directs the task force to report to the President, the Congress, and each participating Federal agency by December 31, 1989. Terminates the task force on January 31, 1990. Repeals title IX (Science Information Service) of the National Defense Education Act of 1959. Directs the President to report to the Congress by August 1, 1987, on any action taken or proposed to be taken with respect to the establishment of an International Year of the Greenhouse Effect to occur in 1991. Title II - Supercomputer Network Study Act of 1986 - Directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy (the Office) to study critical problems and current and future options regarding communications networks for supercomputers at universities and Federal research facilities in the United States. Sets forth required analyses in such study. Requires the Office to report to the Congress on such study within one year after enactment of this title. Sets forth administrative provisions."
