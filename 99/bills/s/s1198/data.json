Requires that such program be designed to: (1) gather data and information on all aspects of indoor air quality in order to contribute to the understanding of health problems associated with the existence of air pollutants in the indoor environment; and (2) coordinate Federal, State, local and private research, development, and demonstration efforts relating to the improvement of indoor air quality. Authorizes the Administrator to establish committees of representatives of appropriate Federal agencies and advisory groups of representatives of the scientific community, industry, and public interest organizations as may be necessary to assist in carrying out such indoor air quality research program. Directs the Administrator to consult and coordinate with State and local officials and other interested parties having concerns related to such program. Directs the Administrator to submit to the Congress an indoor air quality research implementation plan within 90 days after enactment of this Act and a final report, after consultation with the National Academy of Sciences, within two years of such enactment. Requires such report to assess the risks to human health associated with indoor pollution including the known or potential effects of radon and other naturally occurring chemical elements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 and 1987."
