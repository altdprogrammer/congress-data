    "text": "Child Abuse Reporting and Clearinghouse Improvements Act of 1985 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to clarify the intent of certain confidentiality provisions to provide that such provisions do not supersede any State or local reporting requirements of suspected child abuse. Modifies the classification system used by the Identification Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to include a category for statistics for offenses involving child abuse (including sexual abuse). Requires the Attorney General to report to the Congress within 90 days on whether such modification has been made and, if not, when it will be made. Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to require the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect in coordination with the Department of Justice to compile, analyze, publish, and disseminate to each State information on effective programs in the prosecution of child sexual abuse cases. Directs the Center to develop model training materials for law enforcement, legal, judicial, and child welfare personnel to deal with child sexual abuse victims and to support research projects to identify improvements in the investigation and prosecution of child sexual abuse cases."
