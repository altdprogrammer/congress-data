Rept. 99-287) Amends the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act to include the District of Columbia and the Potomac River Fisheries Commission as coastal States and the waters within their jurisdiction as coastal waters for purposes of the Act. Directs the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (the Commission), during December of FY 1987 and each fiscal year thereafter, to monitor each coastal State's adoption and enforcement of such Commission's Striped Bass Plan. Requires the Commission to immediately notify the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior of any State's nonenforcement of such Plan. Requires the Commission to notify each of the Secretaries that a coastal State has taken appropriate remedial action with respect to those things that caused the moratorium to be declared. Extends the authorization of appropriations under, and effective date of, such Act through FY 1988. Extends the funding of certain striped bass population studies under the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act through FY 1988."
