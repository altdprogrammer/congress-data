Authorizes the Secretary to make exceptions to such prohibition in emergencies. Declares that it is U.S. policy to encourage all U.S. firms in South Africa to adhere to fair labor principles. Prohibits any Federal agency from interceding with any foreign government regarding the export marketing activity in any country of a U.S. national who employs more than 25 individuals in South Africa and does not adhere to the fair labor principles specified in this Act. Sets forth such principles. Expresses the sense of the Congress that such U.S. nationals should take reasonable measures to extend the scope of their influence on activities outside the workplace. Requires the Secretary of State and the head of any other Federal agency carrying out activities in South Africa to: (1) take the necessary steps to ensure that such fair labor practices are applied to their South African employees; and (2) try, in procuring goods or services in South Africa, to assist businesses that are more than 50 percent owned by South Africans disadvantaged by the apartheid system. Prohibits importing into the United States South African arms, ammunition, or military vehicles or any manufacturing data for such articles. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to earmark specified amounts of the funds in the Economic Support Fund for FY 1987 and the following fiscal years for assistance to disadvantaged South Africans. Requires such assistance to be provided for activities aimed at ending apartheid and establishing a society based on non-racial principles. Requires a specified amount of such aid to be used to protect human rights in South Africa, including providing legal aid to political prisoners. Imposes a limit on the amount of each grant. Requires a specified amount to be available each fiscal year for matching grants to certain organizations. Imposes a limit on the amount of each matching grant. Prohibits using such Economic Support Fund assistance to support organizations controlled by South Africa. Requires priority to be given to working with and through South African non-governmental organizations which are community-based and whose leadership and structure represent and have the support of the disadvantaged communities.

Permits exports to other South African entities of computers, computer software, and goods or technology intended to service computers only if a system of end use verification is in effect. Provides for enforcement of this Act. Sets forth penalties for violations of this Act. Directs the President to review existing stockpile and contingency plans for ferrochrome, ferromanganese, platinum, and vanadium. Requires the President to report annually to the Congress on the value of American military technology transferred to South Africa, including any such technology transferred through third countries. Prohibits importing into the United States any South African krugerrand or any other South African gold coin. Provides for consultations among the various Federal departments in carrying out this Act. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should discuss with the African \"frontline\" states the effects on them of disruptions in economic links through South Africa and of means of reducing those effects. Terminates the prohibitions on investments in South Africa, landing rights, imports of military articles, nuclear trade, exports of computers to South Africa, and imports of South African gold coins if the President certifies to the Congress that South Africa has: (1) freed Nelson Mandela and all political prisoners and has entered into good faith negotiations with truly representative leaders of the black majority for a new political system; or (2) totally dismantled the apartheid system."
