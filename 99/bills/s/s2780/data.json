    "text": "Pipeline Safety Act of 1986 - Amends the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act to direct the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) to promulgate regulations establishing Federal hazardous liquid pipeline safety standards, including requirements for release detection, prevention, and correction, for the transportation of hazardous liquids and for pipeline facilities. Sets forth the factors which the Secretary may consider when promulgating such regulations. Permits the States to adopt standards or requirements that are more stringent than Federal standards or requirements. Makes the Federal standards and requirements applicable to both interstate and intrastate pipelines. (Currently such requirements apply only to interstate facilities.) Increases from $1,000 to $25,000 the civil penalty imposed for violations of this Act. Increases from $25,000 to $250,000 the criminal penalty imposed for violations of this Act. Amends the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 to include within its coverage pipelines and pipeline facilities whether or not the liquids in such facilities have been included under such Act's coverage. Authorizes the commencement of citizens' civil action suits against the Secretary for failure to perform a duty under this Act. Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to increase from $3,000,000 to $40,000,000 the fees assessed against hazardous liquids transported by pipelines. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1991."
