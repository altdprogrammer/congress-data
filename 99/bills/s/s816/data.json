Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Nebraska shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Nebraska which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Nebraska reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Nebraska without express congressional authorization. Title II: Pine Ridge National Recreation Area - Designates the Pine Ridge National Recreation Area in the Nebraska National Forest to be managed so as to preserve primitive and semiprimitive recreational use in a natural setting as well as other resource conservation values. Requires the Secretary to report a management plan to specified congressional committees within 18 months of enactment."
