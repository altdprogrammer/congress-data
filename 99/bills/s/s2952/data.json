    "text": "Native American Cultural Preservation Act - Establishes the Native American Museum Advisory Board. Identifies the functions of the Board to be: (1) the resolution of certain disputes (regarding sacred artifacts or remains) between any museum and an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization; (2) the provision of advice to the Native American Center of the Smithsonian Institution; and (3) the provision of advice to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation with respect to Native American cultural and historical preservation. Authorizes appropriations. Permits the governing body of an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization or museum administrator to file a petition with the Board requesting the mediation of disputes between a museum and an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization relating to: (1) the skeletal remains of a Native American or a Native Hawaiian; or (2) sacred artifacts of such tribe or Native Hawaiian organization. Sets forth specified requirements with respect to such petition and Board determinations. Requires the Board to publish such determinations in the Federal Register and provide written notice of such determinations to the head of each Federal agency which such Board believes to be providing Federal funds to: (1) a museum, Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization that is the subject of such determination; or (2) program which provides benefits to such entities. Provides that Board determinations are final and not reviewable in any court. Establishes, within the Library of Congress, the Native American Center. Identifies the functions of the Center to be: (1) the preparation, and coordination with museums, of a provenance of all Native American skeletal remains, sacred artifacts, and other artifacts relating to Native American history or culture, that have been collected through Federal funds; (2) the sale of educational materials on the collections of the Smithsonian that relate to Native American culture; and (3) the provision of advice and technical assistance to Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations in the establishment of model museums and the historical preservation of Native American skeletal remains and sacred artifacts. Sets forth specified requirements with respect to the administration of the Center. Directs the President to include with his budget a separate statement which specifies the amount of funds requested for the Center for each fiscal year. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 to make conforming amendments."
