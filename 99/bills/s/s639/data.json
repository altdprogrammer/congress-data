Defines \"qualified personal use\" as the personal use of such a vehicle by an employee: (1) if the employer requires the employee to commute to and from work for business reasons; or (2) if the employee is required to use such vehicle as an integral part of the performance of the trade or business, including the use of the vehicle to make calls on customers or clients, to make deliveries, or to visit job sites. Requires that 70 percent or more of the total use of such a vehicle for the taxable year be for a qualified business use. Treats the use of such a vehicle for nonbusiness purposes as a tax-free de minimis fringe benefit."
