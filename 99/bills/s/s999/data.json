Rept. 99-63) Federal Communications Commission Authorization Act of 1985 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize appropriations for the Federal Communications Commission for FY 1986 and 1987. Extends the effectiveness of provisions concerning the reimbursement of travel expenses of Commission officers or employees through FY 1987. Changes the deadline for the Commission's annual report to the Congress from January 31 to March 31. Sets forth a schedule of charges to be implemented and assessed by the Commission for specified administrative services. Directs the Commission to review and adjust such charges (in certain increments) every two years to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. Exempts from such charges specified radio public services. Permits the Commission to: (1) dismiss any application or other filing for failure to pay any charge in a timely manner; and (2) waive or defer payment of a charge to promote the public interest."
