Leaves to each State's discretion the decision as to whether a resource standard shall be applied in determining the eligibility of such women and children. Prohibits States which provide coverage pursuant to this Act from reducing Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) payment levels after enactment of this Act."
