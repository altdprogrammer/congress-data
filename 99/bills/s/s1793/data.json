Rept. 99-306) Alternatives to Hospitalization for Medical Technology Dependent Children Act of 1986 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish a grant program to provide safe and effective systems of caring for medical technology dependent children in the home. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Director of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment to appoint a task force to develop model provisions of home care for medical technology dependent children under employee health benefit plans. Requires the task force to submit a report to the Director and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Prescribes the mandatory inclusion of certain requirements in all employee health benefit plans by a certain date if: (1) no model provisions are developed; or (2) less than 80 percent of the health benefit plans meet or exceed the model provision coverage. Defines \"home care for medical technology dependent children\" for the purposes of this Act and lists the services which may be provided for such care. Allows the Secretary to terminate certain payments to States and political subdivisions, and impose civil penalties on any private employer for certain violations of this Act. Provides that no employer may be required to pay more for health benefits as a result of the application of this Act."
