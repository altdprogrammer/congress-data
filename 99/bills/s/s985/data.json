    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Child Abuse Victims' Rights Act of 1986 - Amends the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute to extend its coverage to the sexual exploitation of children. Allows any minor who is a victim of such a RICO violation to bring a civil action in an appropriate district court and recover treble damages. Provides a six-year statute of limitations for such actions. Increases the penalties for offenses involving the sexual exploitation of children. Increases from two years to five years the mandatory minimum sentence for repeat offenders. Requires the Attorney General, within one year, to report to the Congress, recommending possible changes in the Federal Rules of Evidence, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and other Federal courtroom, prosecutorial, and investigative procedures which would facilitate the participation of child witnesses in cases involving child abuse and sexual exploitation. Specifies a list of considerations, including: (1) the use of closed circuit cameras, two-way mirrors, and other out-of-court statements; (2) the use of judicial discretion to circumscribe the use of harassment and confusing questioning; (3) the use of videotape in investigations; (4) the possibility of streamlining investigative procedures; and (5) improved training of prosecutorial and investigative staff in the special problem of child witnesses."
