    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-02-05", 
    "text": "Interstate Highway Funding Act of 1985 - Approves the interstate highway cost estimate for FY 1985 and 1986 and the interstate substitute cost estimate for highway and urban mass transit projects for FY 1984, 1985, and 1986. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to adjust and reallocate the minimum allocation made on March 9, 1984, to reflect the apportionment made under this Act. Directs the Secretary to apportion specified funds for FY 1987 and 1988, using certain apportionment factors. Revises the procedures for releasing interstate construction funds and interstate substitute funds to direct the Secretary to release such funds if the Congress has not approved either the interstate cost estimate or substitute cost estimate by October 1 of the year of apportionment. Extends until September 30, 1986, the availability period for the expenditure and obligation of certain sums earmarked for: (1) the Interstate system; (2) public mass transit projects; or (3) highway assistance projects. Decreases the Federal share payable for emergency relief funds for repair projects on the Federal-aid highway system and the Interstate System, unless such emergency repairs are to minimize damage, protect facilities, or restore essential traffic and are accomplished within 30 days after the occurrence. Provides for the funding of certain highway projects with interstate discretionary funds. Requires that a specified percentage of State withdrawal funds be available to the Secretary for State highway research and planning. Authorizes Federal matching funds for bridge replacement and rehabilitation for specified bridges not on the Federal-aid highway system. Amends the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 to include small business concerns owned and controlled by women among such concerns that are eligible for a specified percentage of expenditures under such Act. Amends the General Bridge Act of 1906, the General Bridge Act of 1946, the International Bridge Act of 1972, the Department of Transportation Act, and various other Acts to repeal provisions which regulate toll facilities. Requires toll increases on such facilities to be just and reasonable. Declares that no report, list, schedule, or survey compiled by a State concerning the evaluation of hazardous roadway conditions or rail-highway crossings in order to plan and prioritize safety projects shall be required to be admitted into evidence or used for any other purpose in a Federal or State court. Requires toll authorities to certify to the State Governor that such facilities are adequately maintained and that funding is available for the replacement or repair of such facilities. Provides that if funds from the Highway Trust Fund are used for such repairs, then such State's apportionment for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by such amount. Exempts international toll facilities and such facilities on the Federal-aid system from such requirement. Provides for: (1) crediting the fair market value of right-of-way donations for highway projects to the State matching share when such donations are made to the State; and (2) revesting such property to the donor if it is not required after environmental assessments. States that the fair market value of lands donated to the State of California for a State Route 73 relocation and construction project in Orange County shall first be credited toward payment of the non-Federal share of such project cost. Directs the Secretary to reserve amounts expended for right-of-way for a route withdrawal until the right-of-way disposition decision has been made. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of the Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program. Sets forth the following items for inclusion in such study: (1) an analysis of the progress made toward replacing and rehabilitating inadequate bridges on or off the Federal-aid system; (2) a review of the bridge inspection program; (3) an analysis of the effectiveness of the bridge discretionary program; and (4) a review of the bridge program's effect on the rehabilitation of historic bridges. Requires the Transportation Research Board of the National Research Council to carry out a study of the bridge formula with respect to vehicle weights and the life span of bridges. Makes costs incurred to mitigate harm to historic bridges as a result of Federal-aid projects eligible for Federal-aid highway funds. Permits States to use demolition funds for preservation of historic bridges. Requires (currently, authorizes) States to inventory bridges on the Federal-aid system for historic significance. Directs the Secretary to require the planting of native wildflowers for landscaping and scenic enhancement of Federal-aid highways. Makes the repair or reconstruction of a Federal-aid primary route in the vicinity of Horseshoe Bend, Idaho, which has experienced slide damage eligible for emergency relief funds. Requires an annual minimum allocation of 85 percent of estimated tax payments attributable to States in the Highway Trust Fund. Specifies the programs applicable to such requirement. States that the Secretary may not preclude any State from receiving additional funds for FY 1986 if the Congress has approved such extensions. Permits an interstate transfer project in Maryland to be completed in increments. Requires the Secretary to assist the District of Columbia and Virginia in carrying out a demonstration project on Interstates 95 and 395 which restricts the use of express lanes during certain rush hours after the District of Columbia completes reconstruction of a specified bridge. (Currently, the Secretary is required to carry out such demonstration project after the District of Columbia begins actual reconstruction.) Makes \"Buy American\" provisions applicable to projects whose costs exceed $500,000. Authorizes appropriations for the upgrading of certain highways in New Mexico for the transportation of nuclear waste generated during defense-related activities. Sets forth obligation limitations for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs for FY 1986. Makes sums apportioned or allocated for highway substitute projects available for constructing bicycle facilities. Authorizes States to adjust their interstate substitution programs which were approved in concept by the Secretary on or before September 30, 1983. Authorizes States to add and delete projects without altering the existing entitlement. Amends the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970 to release the requirement imposed upon the Secretaries of the Interior and of Transportation to convey to the State of Maryland a specified section of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress regarding the impact of state prison industries upon competing private industries which furnish the same materials for Federal-aid highway use. Requires that when allocating discretionary interstate substitute highway funds, the Secretary give consideration to States with certain reduced allocations. Authorizes States to use funds apportioned for FY 1985 and subsequent years for the construction of bridges to replace specified ferries. Extends from FY 1985 to FY 1986 the Secretary's authority to provide certain supplemental Federal assistance to State highway projects which use asphalt additives or recycled materials. Permits ocean transport containers of certain weight to be hauled by motor vehicles on Interstate highways during a period of five years after enactment of this Act if such motor vehicles have specified tandem axle distances."
