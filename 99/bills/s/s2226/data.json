Permits such commitments to provide for the temporary use of unfair trade concessions requirements by certain developing countries. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to define \"unfair trade concessions requirements\" to mean any practice or policy of a foreign government that requires, as a condition for allowing U.S. imports into such country or for carrying on businesses in such country, that: (1) substantial investment be made in such country; (2) intellectual property be licensed to such country; or (3) other collateral concession be made. Makes countries that impose unfair trade concessions requirements on U.S. products covered by bilateral trade agreements ineligible for designation as beneficiary developing countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act and under the Generalized System of Preferences of the Trade Act of 1974."
