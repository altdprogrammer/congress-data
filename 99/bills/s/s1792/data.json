    "text": "Animals in Laboratories Protection Act of 1985-Amends the Animal Welfare Act to require the Secretary of Agriculture to include the promotion of psychological well-being among the standards for the humane handling of laboratory animals. Requires that animal pain and distress be minimized through drugs, euthanasia, or the selection, where possible, of alternate procedures. Limits the use of an animal to one major operative experiment, except as specified. Requires facilities using laboratory animals to include details of pain-causing procedures in their annual reports. Requires each research facility, including Federal facilities, to establish at least one Institutional Animal Committee to assess animal care and experimental practices on a semiannual basis. Requires the Committee report to be available for Federal inspection. Grants a facility time to cure any discovered deficiences or deviations in acceptable practices. Requires each facility to provide annual training in the humane practice of animal experimentation. Directs the Secretary to establish an information service at the National Agricultural Library for training and animal experimentation information. Requires a Federal agency to revoke funding for a research facility in violation of these standards. Prohibits the release of trade secret information in this context. Increases and sets forth additional penalties for violations of such Act's requirements."
