    "text": "Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to modify the leasing of Outer Continental Shelf lands within three miles of a State's coastal boundary to require the Secretary of the Interior to provide updates to the appropriate Governor on any ecological or geological information regarding lands offered for lease, including an identification of any potentially hydrocarbon-bearing area. Requires the Secretary to transfer 27 percent of the revenues received from such a lease to the affected coastal State. Requires such distribution from the Federal share even when a State and the Federal Government have an agreement for distribution of revenues from any hydrocarbon-bearing area which underlies the Federal and State boundary. Requires the Secretary to distribute amounts accrued under these requirements from October 1, 1985, to the date of distribution by the start of 1986. Sets forth a distribution formula for funds placed in a separate account because of boundary disputes for the following States: (1) Louisiana; (2) Texas; (3) California; (4) Alabama; (5) Alaska; (6) Mississippi; and (7) Florida. States that boundaries determined by a final decree of the Supreme Court remain immobilized. Requires a distribution of revenues derived between September 18, 1978, and the end of FY 1985 according to the 27-percent rule, minus monies received for FY 1986 by the start of 1986. Directs the Secretary to deposit ten percent of Federal leasing revenues in the disputed boundaries account as of FY 1986."
