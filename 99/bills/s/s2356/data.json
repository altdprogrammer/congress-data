    "text": "Coal Trade Equalization Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to investigate and report to the Congress on the relationship between coal imports and: (1) the management of the Federal coal leasing program; and (2) the economic condition of the U.S. coal industry. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to include in such report appropriate legislative recommendations if the Secretary of the Interior finds that coal imports are adversely affecting the management of the Federal coal leasing program and the economic condition of one or more sectors of the U.S. coal industry. Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to grant duty-free treatment to coal from any country that has historically imported more coal from the United States than it has exported to the United States. Imposes a duty on coal from other countries. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to add coal subject to such duty to the list of articles which cannot be designated as eligible articles for the Generalized System of Tariff Preferences."
