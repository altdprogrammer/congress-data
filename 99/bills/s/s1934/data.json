    "text": "Export Trading Company Amendments Act of 1985 - Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to declare that a company shall be deemed to be organized and operated principally for purposes of exporting U.S. goods or services or for purposes of providing export trade services to facilitate the export of U.S. goods or services by unaffiliated persons if its revenues from exporting U.S. goods or services or from providing export trade services exceed its revenues from importing goods or services produced outside the United States. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to exempt from restrictions on loans and other transactions with affiliates any transaction with an affiliate which is an export trading company. Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to prohibit the Federal Reserve Board from disapproving a proposed investment solely on the basis of the proposed assets to equity ratio of an export trading company unless the proposed annual average ratio is greater than 25 to one. Prohibits the Federal Reserve Board from imposing a dollar limit on the amount of goods which export trading companies may maintain in inventory. Authorizes the Board, however, to impose a dollar limit on the amount of goods which an export trading company may maintain in inventory if on a case by case basis the Board finds that such limit is necessary to prevent risks that would affect the financial or managerial resources of an investor bank holding company."
