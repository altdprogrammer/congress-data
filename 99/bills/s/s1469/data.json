    "text": "Nuclear Waste Policy Act - Title I: Findings and Purposes - States congressional findings and purposes of this Act. Title II: Definitions - Defines technical terms of this Act. Title III: Interim Storage of Spent Fuel From Civilian Nuclear Powerplants - Directs the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) to enter into contracts with owners of civilian nuclear powerplants. Requires such contracts to provide that the Federal Government will: (1) take title to spent fuel from the powerplants; (2) transport the spent fuel to and store it in federally owned and operated interim away-from-reactor storage facilities; and (3) dispose of waste products associated with such spent fuel. Requires the Secretary to: (1) publish notices of intent to enter into such contracts in the Federal Register; (2) construct or acquire at least one away-from-reactor facility for the interim storage of spent fuel from civilian nuclear powerplants; (3) use private industry for the transportation of spent fuel; (4) take possession of spent fuel which is under contract and transport it to a designated storage facility; and (5) keep informed the Governor and legislature of any State in which a potential storage site or facility is located regarding Federal work on that site. Sets guidelines for the suspension of Federal work on such a site upon the written objection of the State Governor. Title IV: Disposal of High-level Radioactive Waste Resulting from Civilian Nuclear Activities - Requires the Secretary to: (1) submit a proposal to the Congress for the construction of safe repositories for the permanent disposal of high-level radioactive waste; (2) make annual impact aid payments to the appropriate local government regarding such repositories; (3) accelerate a research and development program regarding alternative means and technologies for the permanent disposal of high-level radioactive wastes from civilian and Federal nuclear activities; and (4) submit as part of the Secretary's annual report to the Congress the status of such research and development program. Title V: Financial Arrangements - Establishes a separate account in the Treasury for: (1) the construction and operation of Federal away-from-reactor interim storage facilities for spent fuel; (2) the disposal of spent fuel or high-level radioactive waste from civilian nuclear activities; and (3) the handling and transportation of such spent fuel or waste. Authorizes appropriations. Title VI: State Role in Nuclear Waste Repository Siting - Sets guidelines under which the Secretary shall enter into cooperative agreements with the States and Indian tribes regarding the construction and operation of a repository for the disposal of high-level or transuranic wastes. Makes such agreements inapplicable to spent fuel or radioactive waste produced from Federal atomic energy defense activities."
