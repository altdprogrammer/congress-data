    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation with amendment, S. Rept. 99-69) Professional Sports Community Protection Act of 1985 - States that it is lawful for a professional sports league or its clubs to enforce rules or agreements that: (1) decide that a member club may not relocate; (2) divide revenues to promote economic opportunities for member clubs; and (3) establish procedures and standards for the selection and termination of club ownership, if such selection or termination requires approval by at least three-fourths of the member clubs. Permits the relevant league to bring a civil action in an appropriate U.S. district court to enjoin any owner who violates this Act. Prescribes a notice requirement for clubs seeking relocation. Lists factors for consideration in determining whether a league will permit a club to relocate, which include: (1) the adequacy of the existing stadium and facilities; (2) the operating revenues or losses during the preceding three years; and (3) any offers to purchase the club at fair market value which would keep such club in its home territory. Provides that judicial review of the league's determination may be sought in a civil action brought in a district court of the United States by: (1) the club seeking relocation; (2) the stadium owner or operator; or (3) the local government. Prohibits the bringing of such action in a district court within the club's home or proposed territory. Allows the district court in which the motion is filed to transfer the suit to another district court for the convenience of the parties, or in the interest of justice. Allows the district court to require the league to hold additional hearings to give additional interested parties the opportunity to present testimony. Allows the district court to review a league's decision to terminate the ownership of a member club. Requires leagues to file with the Secretary of Commerce their rules regarding: (1) team relocation; (2) division of revenues; and (3) selection and termination of club ownership. States that the provisions of this Act do not affect the applicability of the antitrust laws (as defined in the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act), labor and employment laws, or Federal and State laws regarding broadcasting or telecasting. Preempts State and local laws inconsistent with this Act. Applies the provisions of this Act to any major league football, basketball, hockey, or soccer team."
