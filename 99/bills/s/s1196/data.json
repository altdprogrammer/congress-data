Requires rental payments (of up to 20 percent of family income) during such occupancy period. Permits such farmers and ranchers to participate on a limited basis in any conservation set-aside programs. Requires payments received to be applied to reducing outstanding indebtedness. Provides for Federal guarantees (of at least 70 percent) of privately-held agricultural loans under a similar occupancy framework."
