Requires the President and the Secretary to consider, in determining whether imports threaten national security, the impact on national security of: (1) not only short-term supply disruptions of articles needed for national security but also long-term U.S. dependence on imports of such articles; and (2) the loss of a viable domestic industry producing articles needed for national security. Requires the President to issue a proclamation on the date of enactment of this Act that implements the recommendations of the Secretary in such report if: (1) the President did not by November 30, 1985, make a specified determination with respect to such report that was received before the date of enactment of this Act."
