    "date": "1986-08-01", 
    "text": "Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to prohibit the registration or licensing of motor vehicles when the ownership is transferred in interstate commerce unless: (1) the application for a new certificate of title is accompanied by the prior owner's most recent registration card and title; and (2) the new certificate of title is printed in a specified manner and includes the odometer mileage. Prohibits State issuance of a registration card for a motor vehicle used in interstate commerce unless the application indicates the mileage of the motor vehicle on the application date. Authorizes States to submit alternative mileage disclosure requirements for the approval of the Secretary of Transportation. Provides that a motor vehicle auction company must maintain records showing: (1) the name of the most recent owner; (2) vehicle identification number; and (3) the odometer reading on the date the auction company took possession of the vehicle. Increases the civil penalty for violations of the odometer requirements from $1,000 to $2,000, and imposes a civil penalty in increments of $5,000 for subsequent violations. Increases the criminal penalty for such violations from one to three years maximum imprisonment, and provides for a mandatory imprisonment sentence of three years for second and subsequent convictions. Prohibits the probation, parole, or suspension of a sentence of a person convicted of a second or subsequent violation."
