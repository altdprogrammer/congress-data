Requires all gross receipts (including, but not limited to, bonuses, rents, and royalties) that are derived by the United States with respect to such lands to be administered in accordance with the laws relating to trust property. Exempts such receipts from: (1) Federal, State, and local taxation; and (2) being considered income or resources to recipients for purposes of taxation or income or resources with respect to eligibility for assistance (including under the Social Security Act). Requires all applications for mineral leases involving such lands pending on the date of enactment of this Act to be rejected and advance payments returned to the applicants. Provides that nothing in this Act shall: (1) deprive any person (other than the United States) of any lease, right-of-way, mining claim, grazing permit, water right, or other interest in such lands before enactment of this Act; (2) affect a specified right-of-way; or (3) affect specified mineral leases."
