Requires the Secretary of Defense to use polygraph examinations to assist in determining the initial eligibility of persons to have access to sensitive compartmented information and the continued access to such information. Permits the Secretary to use polygraph examinations to assist in determining the initial eligibility of persons to have access to classified information other than sensitive compartmented information and the continued access to such information. Prohibits the use of the polygraph examination as the sole basis for denying eligibility for clearance or access to any classified information. Permits the refusal of clearance or access to classified information of individuals who refuse to submit to polygraph examinations. Requires a report to the Congress on plans to implement the polygraph examination requirements. Restricts the death penalty for an act of espionage to cases involving the Soviet Union or any other Communist country and the documents or information involved is classified. Imposes a mandatory life term of imprisonment for espionage involving the Soviet Union or any other Communist country. Prohibits any probation or suspension of sentence for individuals convicted of espionage involving the Soviet Union or other Communist country, and denies such individuals any opportunity for parole."
