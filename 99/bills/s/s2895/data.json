Requires the Secretary to determine, within 120 days of enactment of this Act, whether any such producer has, at any time during the most recent 12 month period, sold potassium chloride at less than its foreign market value. Requires the Secretary to impose an antidumping duty on imports of potassium chloride from such producers if the Secretary determines that sales at less than foreign market value have taken place. Requires the Secretary to: (1) initiate antidumping investigations with respect to potassium chloride produced by other producers; and (2) provide notice of such investigations to the International Trade Commission. Provides for suspension or termination of such reviews, investigations, and orders."
