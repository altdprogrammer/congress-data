    "text": "Computer Education Assistance Act of 1985 - Title I; Acquisition of Computer Resources - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to States to pay the Federal share of the costs of strengthening computer education in the elementary and secondary schools. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose for FY 1986 through 1990. Sets forth provisions for allotments to States and for allocation of allotments within States. Provides that two percent of the appropriations for this Act be reserved for specified territories and possessions of the United States. Provides for allotment to States on the basis of school-age population and on the basis of a formula for distribution of aid for disadvantaged school children under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Directs the State education agency (SEA) to allocate the State allotment to local educational agencies (LEAs) on the basis of similar factors. Prohibits making any grant under this title to a State unless the SEA and LEAs within the State carry out planning activities designed to facilitate the use of Federal financial assistance under this title for the expansion of computer resources in the elementary and secondary schools within the State. Requires such planning activities to include: (1) development of goals for computer education; (2) revising basic curricula; (3) placing the computers, and making them generally available, in the elementary and secondary schools; (4) developing hardware and software selection criteria; (5) providing security; and (6) developing evaluation standards. Allows grants under this Act to be used to pay the Federal share of: (1) acquisition of computers and other equipment for computer education; (2) teacher training programs; and (3) computer software acquisition. Sets forth requirements for State applications for grants under this Act. Sets forth requirements for local applications for payments under this Act. Makes specified provisions of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 relating to participation of children enrolled in private schools applicable to the financial assistance made available under this Act. Directs the Secretary to pay each State, from the amount allotted, the Federal share (75 percent) of the cost of the program assisted under this Act. Permits non-Federal contributions to be in cash or in kind, including plant, equipment, and services. Title II: Teacher Training Institutes - Directs the National Science Foundation (NSF) to make grants to and contracts with specified entities to develop and operate short-term or regular session study institutes to improve the qualifications of individuals engaged or preparing to engage in the teaching, or supervising or training of teachers, of the use of computers for computer education instruction and other education programs in elementary and secondary schools. Provides that special consideration be given to grant or contract applicants who will train teachers, or supervisors or trainers of teachers, serving or preparing to serve in elementary and secondary schools that enroll substantial numbers of disadvantaged youth or in programs for children of limited English language proficiency. Provides for weekly stipends for individuals who attend such institutes. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title for FY 1986 through 1989. Title III: Information Dissemination and Evaluation - Directs the Secretary, through the National Institute of Education (NIE) and the NSF, to provide advice and technical assistance to SEAs and LEAs on the expenditure of funds under title I of this Act and on the acquisition of computer software through an interagency agreement to: (1) evaluate available computer hardware and software, in terms of it usefulness in the classroom; (2) disseminate the results of such evaluation; and (3) develop model computer educational software, and make such model software (and its design premises) available to computer software producers and distributors, teachers, and school administrators. Authorizes the Secretary and the NSF to make grants and contracts to carry out such functions. Authorizes appropriations for such purposes for FY 1986 through 1989. Directs the NSF, through grants to or contracts with specified entities, to conduct, assist, and foster research and experimentation on, and dissemination of, models of instruction in the operation and use of computers. Gives priority to proposals prepared with active and broad community involvement of such groups as parents, teachers, school boards and administrators, and local business. Permits funds available under such grants and contracts to be used for the acquisition of computer hardware and software. Requires the Director of the NSF to: (1) report annually to the Congress on the results of such research and experimentation; and (2) in conjunction with the NIE, disseminate information concerning such results to LEAs. Authorizes appropriations for such purposes for FY 1986 through 1989."
