    "text": "Ogallala Aquifer Research and Development Act of 1985 - Amends the Water Resources Research Act to establish a High Plains Study Council to: (1) review the water supply and conservation research being performed by each State committee (established under this Act); and (2) coordinate such research to avoid duplication. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish within each State of the High Plains Region (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas) an Ogallala Aquifer technical advisory committee (the State committee). Directs each State Committee to: (1) review existing State laws and institutions concerning water management and recommend appropriate changes; (2) establish State priorities for water resources research and demonstration projects; and (3) provide information and technical assistance concerning the need for water conservation and management. Directs the Secretary to allocate annually funds to States of the High Plains Region for university research in water-use efficiency, cultural methods, irrigation technologies, water-efficient crops, and water and soil conservation. Directs the Secretary to divide funds among the States of the High Plains Region for university research into precipitation management, weather modification, aquifer recharge opportunities, saline water use, desalinization technologies, salt tolerant crops, and ground water recovery. Directs the Secretary to allocate annually funds to the High Plains Region States for grants to farmers for demonstration projects in: (1) water-efficient irrigation technologies and practices; (2) soil and water conservation management systems; and (3) the growth and marketing of more water-efficient crops. Directs the Secretary to monitor the levels of the Ogallala Aquifer and to report annually to Congress. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990."
