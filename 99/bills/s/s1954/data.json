Amends Federal provisions concerning the military basic allowance for quarters (BAQ) to authorize the Secretary concerned to pay a BAQ to dependents of a deceased member of the armed forces who are either not occupying military family housing or are occupying such housing on a rental basis at the time of the member's death. Terminates such payment 60 days after the date of the member's death."
