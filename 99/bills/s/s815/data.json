    "text": "Prohibits any former officer or employee of the United States Government or former member of the uniformed services from accepting employment from a nongovernmental entity if during the previous two years that person as a Federal officer or employee participated personally and substantially in the performance of a procurement function relating to a contract awarded by the Government to the nongovernmental entity. Requires any Federal officer or employee or member of the uniformed services who intends to accept, during such two-year period, employment with a nongovernment entity with which the individual had direct or indirect contact while performing Government duties to file a written report of such intention with the designated official of the agency involved. Requires such a report to certify that the individual did not personally and substantially participate in Government procurement functions with the nongovernmental entity during the critical two-year period. Requires agency heads to include a provision in procurement contracts that prohibits contractors from employing former Federal officers or employees or members of the armed services who are covered by this Act. Provides a penalty of $10,000 or less for any individual who violates the prohibitions of this Act. Provides a penalty of $50,000 or less for a contractor who violates the above contractual provision. Sets forth procedures for an agency head to follow in determining whether the prohibitions in this Act have been violated. Requires the designated agency ethics official to compile the reports and certifications of employees who intend to accept nongovernment employment covered by this Act and transmit them to the Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). Requires the Director of OGE to conduct an annual random survey of the reports to check for violations of this Act and report annually to named congressional committees on: (1) the number of reports filed with agency officials; (2) the number of reports reviewed by the Director; and (3) the Director's conclusion and actions resulting from such review. Requires the Director to notify the appropriate Secretary if in the performance of his or her duties a violation of this Act is found."
