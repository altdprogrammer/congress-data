Defines \"greenmail profits\" as any gain realized by a four-percent shareholder of any stock in a corporation if: (1) the shareholder held such stock for a period of less than two years; and (2) during the two-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange of such stock there was a public tender offer for such stock. Requires that a hostile stock purchase in a corporate takeover attempt be treated as an asset acquisition by the purchasing corporation. Disallows an income tax deduction for any interest paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred to acquire stock in a corporation pursuant to a hostile offer."
