    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 5073 passed in lieu) Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act of 1986 - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations for asbestos hazard abatement in the schools, including requiring warning labels on friable asbestos-containing material left in schools. Requires local educational agencies to respond to asbestos according to EPA's most current guidance documents if the Administrator fails to promulgate regulations within the prescribed period. Directs the Administrator to develop a model accreditation plan for States to give accreditation to individuals who inspect, manage, abate and analyze asbestos problems. Makes the use of accredited personnel a condition for receiving financial assistance under the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Act of 1984. Requires each State Governor to establish administrative procedures for the certification of school asbestos inspection and abatement programs and for asbestos management plans, all to be carried forward by the local educational agency. Authorizes the Administrator or the appropriate State Governor to take necessary response measures where asbestos in a school building may be hazardous and adequate local measures have not been taken. Prohibits discrimination by a State or local educational agency against a whistle-blower. Sets forth the relationship of pollution liability insurance risk retention groups to State law, including securities law. Requires the Administrator to consider the seriousness of the violation and the culpability and ability of the violator when assessing civil penalties against a local education agency. Provides that State law is not preempted from imposing additional liability or more stringent requirements with respect to asbestos in schools. Directs the Secretary of Defense to manage asbestos at overseas schools for dependents to the extent feasible. Establishes the Asbestos Trust Fund in the Treasury to carry out the Asbestos Hazards Abatement Assistance Program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1990. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to the Congress on the financial condition of the Fund which shall consist of amounts repayed of loans made under the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Act of 1984. Reserves certain funds available for such loans for grants to States and local educational agencies to help them carry out their asbestos abatement programs."
