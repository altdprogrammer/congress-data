    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-03-28", 
    "text": "School-Based Child Care Act - Amends the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 to add new chapter 3 provisions for school-based child care and early childhood education demonstration projects. (Redesignates the current chapter 3 provisions as chapter 4.) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990 for such projects in the public schools to increase the availability of child care and early childhood education services for children aged four and five, particularly those from low-income families. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to pay the Federal share of the cost of establishing and supplementing child care services and early childhood education for four- and five-year-old children in the elementary and secondary schools of such LEAs. Permits such child care services and early childhood education to include: (1) the extension of half-day kindergarten to meet the needs of working parents; (2) services for four-year-old children which shall be available for the full working day throughout the calendar year using public elementary or secondary school facilities; and (3) arrangements to furnish part-day care for children to complement half-day school-based kindergarten or early childhood education programs furnished in elementary schools. Allows LEAs receiving such assistance to enter into contracts for such services with public agencies and nonprofit private organizations which: (1) represent significant portions of the community to be served; and (2) have experience furnishing child care services. Sets forth provisions for grant applications and approval. Requires LEA applications to be reviewed by the appropriate State educational agency (SEA) before submission to the Secretary. Requires assurances that project participants will receive the services free of charge for children from families with incomes less than 150 percent of the poverty level. Requires a sliding scale of fees dependent upon the family's income for other participants. Requires a description of measures which the LEA will take to encourage the equitable participation of handicapped and severely handicapped children in such projects. Requires projects to meet specified minimum standards and to encourage parent involvement in project design and operation. Requires specified assurances as to the non-Federal share of such project costs. Requires establishment of community advisory panels. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish objective criteria for application approval; (2) ensure adequate distribution of such grants; and (3) give preference to applications which propose projects serving a significant portion of children from low-income families and projects furnishing services for the entire workday. Allows such grants to be made for a period of five fiscal years, but requires annual reevaluation to ensure that project goals and objectives have been met. Directs the Secretary, upon finding that an LEA is not making progress toward meeting its project goals and objectives, to discontinue its grant, after notice and opportunity for a hearing. Limits the maximum Federal share of project costs to: (1) 75 percent in the first year; (2) 60 percent in the second year; and (3) 40 percent in the third, fourth, and fifth years. Sets forth annual reporting requirements for LEAs receiving such project grants. Directs the Secretary, by September 30, 1989, to report to the Congress and the President on the basis of such annual LEA reports and an independent evaluation of such projects. Limits the amount of funds which may be used for such evaluation."
