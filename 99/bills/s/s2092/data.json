    "text": "National Park System Resources Act of 1986 - Title I: Prohibits the expenditure of new Federal funds within congressionally authorized boundaries of any unit of the National Park System or any contiguous federally managed area without the Secretary of the Interior's determination that such expenditures will not degrade or destroy the natural or cultural resources within any unit of the System. Authorizes the Secretary to designate park resource protection areas which would thereby exclude such areas from the funding limitation. Exempts essential military, emergency, and certain resource protection projects from such restriction. Requires interagency cooperation and review of existing programs. Requires the Secretary to report biennially to the Congress on the condition of National Park System units. Directs the Secretary to submit, within the year, to the Congress a National Park Service Program, detailing personnel and scientific projects within the System. Authorizes the Secretary to provided technical assistance to governmental units managing lands within or adjacent to System units. Directs the Secretary to establish a scientific research program or division within the Service. Grants priority attention to units of the System designated Biosphere Reserves or World Heritage Sites. Requires the Secretary to repor to the Congress within the year on such units. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes citizen suits to enforce this Act. Title II: Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to authorize the charging of entrance or admission fees at certain units within the National Park System and an increase of fees at other units, such fees to provide additional revenue for services and programs of the System."
