Sets forth specified exceptions to such disallowance. Treats as ordinary income, rather than as capital gains, a specified portion of gain realized on the sale or disposition of highly erodible land or wetland cultivated by the taxpayer for the purpose of converting such land or wetland into cropland. Sets forth specified exceptions to such treatment."
