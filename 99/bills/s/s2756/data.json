    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1986-08-14", 
    "text": "Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1986 - Requires Federal agencies to enter into written agreements with other agencies or non-Federal entities before disclosing records for use in computer matching programs or front-end verification programs. Specifies areas to be addressed in such agreements, including justification for matching, notifying individuals whose records are to be matched, destroying data after matching, and prohibitions on disclosure of records and the compilation of data. Defines \"computer matching program\" as the comparison of two or more systems to identify individuals common to such systems or unique to one of the systems. Defines \"front-end verification program\" as the matching of systems to certify the accuracy of information supplied by an applicant for Federal financial assistance. Requires agencies to publish in the Federal Register notice of the establishment or the revision of such programs. Requires agencies to provide notice to the Congress and the Office of Management and Budget of any proposal to establish or alter such programs. Requires each agency to establish a Data Integrity Board to oversee and coordinate the implementation of this Act. Prohibits an agency from denying, terminating, suspending, or reducing financial assistance to any individual, or to take any other adverse action against such individual, as a result of information produced by the programs until the agency has verified such information. Provides individuals an opportunity to refute such information."
