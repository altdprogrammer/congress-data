    "text": "Finds the recommendations of the Garrison Diversion Unit Commission to be in substantial conformance with the authorized plans for the Unit. States that the Garrison Diversion Unit reflects the entitlement of North Dakota to a federally funded water treatment program as compensation for North Dakota's contribution to the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program. Makes nonreimbursable: (1) any investment related to the full design capacity of features no longer employed pursuant to Commission recommendations; and (2) the costs of the Sheyenne River release feature and treatment plant. Permits repayment for Lucky Mound, Upper Six Mile Creek, and Fort Yates irrigation units as a part of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program, provided the Secretary of the Interior finds the land irrigable. Requires municipal, rural, and industrial systems constructed as part of the Garrison Diversion Unit to utilize power at a rate equivalent to that paid by preference customers. Requires the provision of repayment assistance for the capital cost of municipal, rural, and industrial water systems. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to construct water systems for the Garrison Diversion Unit which satisfy the needs of the Fort Berthold, Standing Rock, and Fort Totten Indian Reservations. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into negotiations with the Government of Canada to explore the establishment of a Binational Resource Development Program. States that such Program should study ways to exchange resources, including water, power, minerals, and markets to meet mutual needs. States that Program officials, before the delivery of treated Missouri River water into the Hudson Bay drainage basin, should request a comprehensive inventory of fish species and pathogens present in Manitoban waters."
