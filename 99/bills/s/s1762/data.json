    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Labor and Human Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 99-229) Health Maintenance Organization Amendments of 1985 - Amends title XIII (Health Maintenance Organizations) of the Public Health Service Act to repeal provisions authorizing assistance for feasibility surveys, planning, and initial development of health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Limits initial operating loan assistance to entities with existing loan eligibility as of October 1, 1985. Eliminates loans and loan guarantees for the acquisition and construction of ambulatory care facilities. Limits the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to borrow from the Treasury to cover defaults on Federal loan guarantees to obligations made before October 1, 1986. Repeals the requirements for: (1) health system agency review; (2) periodic demonstration of compliance; and (3) certain financial reports. Requires updates of the digest of State HMO laws to be made annually (presently required quarterly). Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1989 to meet the obligations of the loan fund. Includes organ transplants as part of the basic coverage if such transplants were required to be included in the basic health services on April 15, 1985. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study on the operation and impact of the provisions of title XIII of such Act. Directs the Secretary to transmit a report to the Congress on the findings of such study. Includes the services of psychologists among those which federally assisted HMOs may provide. Declares that this Act does not authorize appropriations for FY 1986."
