Requires that the interests in the financial instruments represented by the pass-through securities be established prior to the initial issuance of the pass-through securities and, pursuant to the terms of the pass-through securities, such interests may not be changed. Requires that the pool of assets in which the holders of pass-through securities own an interest must be fixed prior to the date of the first payment to security holders, except for a certain two-year period. Sets forth various definitions."
