Urges the President to: (1) raise the issue of reform in South Africa during the May 1985 economic summit; and (2) establish with the other industrialized democracies an Inter-Allied Working Group on South Africa to monitor reforms and, if necessary, develop multilateral economic sanctions against South Africa. Directs the President to submit to the Congress a report by March 1, 1987, on the extent to which significant progress has been made toward ending apartheid. Sets forth information to be included in such report including: (1) an assessment of the progress made by South Africa in specified areas; (2) a statement of any conclusions drawn by the Inter-Allied Working Group on South Africa; (3) a determination by the President as to whether significant progress has been made in specified areas; and (4) if the President determines that significant progress has not been made, a recommendation as to what sanctions should be imposed. Provides for expedited consideration in the Congress of any joint resolution that would enact such sanctions."
