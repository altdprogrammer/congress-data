    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H. R. 5299 passed in lieu) Omnibus Veterans' Benefits Improvement and Health Care Authorization Act of 1986 - Title I: Compensation and Other Benefit Programs - Part A: Benefits - Requires the Administrator of Veterans Affairs (the Administrator) to provide for increases in the rates of and limitations on Veterans Administration disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation to the same extent that benefit amounts payable under title II of the Social Security Act are increased effective December 1, 1986. Establishes a presumption of service-connection for disability purposes for former prisoners of war suffering from the following conditions, manifest to a degree of ten percent or more after active service: (1) organic residuals of frostbite; (2) arthritis resulting from trauma; or (3) irritable bowel syndrome if the veteran is suffering from a service-connected compensable psychiatric disability. Extends through FY 1989 the pilot program of providing independent living services and assistance to certain eligible veterans. Requires the Administrator to report to the congressional Veterans' Affairs Committees by February 1, 1989, on veterans' participation in such program during FY 1987 and 1988. Amend veterans' benefits provisions to extend from September 30, 1986, to September 30, 1988, the period of time during which veterans readjustment appointments (noncompetitive civil service position appointments) may be made for Vietnam veterans. Part B: Benefit Program Administration - Amends Federal law relating to foreclosure of veterans' home loans to prohibit the Administrator from accepting conveyance of a property from the holder of a defaulted loan unless the Administrator is likely to be able to sell such property within one year for a price which would be economically advantageous to the United States.

Gives priorities for selecting veterans to such program. Outlines certain administrative actions to be taken in order to provide such services, including the providing of case management services by the VA for each veteran furnished such services. Authorizes the Administrator to furnish in-kind assistance to facilities furnishing services to veterans under these provisions. Prohibits the total cost of conducting the pilot program from exceeding 60 percent of the cost incurred by the VA if the VA had instead furnished such services. Requires the Administrator to report on the operation of the program during its first 36 months, to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees no later than April 1, 1990. Includes as a veterans' medical benefit medical services necessary to overcome a service-connected disability which impairs the veterans' procreative ability, if the veteran applies for such services before October 1, 1989. Requires the Administrator to report to the Veterans' Affairs Committees by February 1, 1989, in the provision of such services.

Requires the Administrator's report to the Veterans Affairs Committees on the effectiveness of such program to give particular attention to whatever information is available from a specified study on Vietnam veterans' post-war psychological problems. Requires such report to include the Administrator's analysis and recommendations as to whether World War II or Korean veterans could benefit from services provided under the Vietnam Veterans' Readjustment Counseling Program. Requires the Administrator's report on plans to carry out such program to include the results of the study on Vietnam veterans' post-war psychological problems, (or if such study is incomplete, whatever information from it is then available). Requires the Administrator, by February 1, 1989, to report to the Veterans Affairs Committees on: (1) the way the transition from providing readjustment counseling primarily in non-VA facilities to providing such services primarily at VA facilities was carried out before September 30, 1988; (2) based on that evaluation, the results of the study on Vietnam veterans' post-war psychological problems (or whatever information is available from such study); and (3) the Administrator's opinion as to the extent of the need to provide such services at non-VA facilities. Amends the Veterans' Health Care Amendments of 1983 to extend the deadline for the Administrator's study of Vietnam veterans post-war psychological problems until October 1, 1987.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the Congress periodically on the number of hospitals that have terminated or failed to renew a health care provider agreement because of the additional conditions imposed by this Act. Requires the Administrator to report to the Veterans' Affairs Committees by April 1, 1987, on the implementation of the requirement established in this paragraph. Requires the Administrator to notify such committees if a hospital terminates or fails to renew a health care provider agreement because of such requirement. Revises the provisions relating to the organization of the Office of the Chief Medical Director (the Office) of the VA Department of Medicine and Surgery to require that all individuals appointed to positions in the Office shall be qualified in the administration of health services. Provides that there shall be two Associate Deputy Chief Medical Directors, both of whom shall be persons with specified qualification, relating to business and administrative experience.

Authorizes appropriations for the construction, operation, and maintenance of such parking facilities. Requires such authorized appropriations and any parking fees collected to be placed in a revolving fund. Prohibits, with specified exceptions, funds other than funds from the revolving fund from being used to construct, alter, or acquire a parking facility at a medical facility after September 30, 1986. Requires the Administrator to include in any prospectus proposing the construction of a facility the consideration that was given to sharing health-care resources with the Department of Defense as an alternative to the construction, purchase, or lease of such facility.
