    "text": "Papago-Gila Bend Settlement Act - Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to pay $30,000,000 plus interest to the authorized governing body of the Papago Tribe of Arizona if such Tribe assigns to the United States all right, title, and interest in 9,888 acres of land within the Gila Bend Indian Reservation which has been rendered unsuitable for use due to the operation of the Painted Rock Dam. Reserves hunting, fishing, and gathering rights in such land to the Tribe. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Tribe to invest such sums in interest bearing deposits and securities. Allows the governing body of the Tribe to spend the principal, interest, and dividends for land and water acquisition and economic development in the San Lucy District. Authorizes the Tribe to acquire a specified amount of private lands. Requires the Secretary to hold in trust for the benefit of the Tribe private lands acquired by the Tribe. Deems such trust lands to be a Federal Indian Reservation. Requires the Secretary to establish a water management plan with respect to such acquired lands. Requires the Secretary to make payments in lieu of real property taxes to the State of Arizona with respect to such acquired lands. Authorizes the Secretary to satisfy such taxes by transferring public lands (including lands within the Gila Bend Indian Reservation) to the State of Arizona. Requires the Secretary, upon the request of the Tribe, to deliver water (at no cost to the United States) through the main project works of the Central Arizona Project to such acquired lands. Requires the Secretary to carry out the obligations under this Act if within a specified time the Papago Tribe executes a waiver of all claims for injuries to land or water rights (including both surface and ground water rights) with respect to the lands of the Gila Bend Indian Reservation. Requires the Secretary to construct: (1) a water treatment facility to provide water to San Lucy village; and (2) sewage disposal facilities to serve such village."
