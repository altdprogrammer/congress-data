Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should: (1) consider the feasibility of appointing a Special Coordinator for U.S. programs for the Philippines; (2) consider the feasibility of suspending the collection of interest and principal payments on U.S. loans to the Philippines until official debt rescheduling agreements have been negotiated; (3) consider the implications of negotiating a debt rescheduling agreement on the amounts coming due in 1986 and 1987; and (4) make every effort to ensure that other creditors are encouraged to make comparable concessions to the Philippines. Amends the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 to repeal certain limits on aid to the Philippines."
