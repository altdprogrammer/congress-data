Requires such study to give particular attention to: (1) the extent to which current and proposed campaign financing practices and financial disclosure requirements affected the availability of candidates for congressional elections; and (2) the extent to which such practices and requirements affect the integrity of the legislative process or undermine public confidence in the Government. Directs the Commission to consider the following aspects of congressional campaign financing and financial disclosure: (1) increasing or decreasing allowable contributions; (2) increasing, decreasing, or eliminating the income tax credit for congressional contributions; (3) making free or subsidized broadcasting time available to candidates; (4) the constitutional right of individuals, particularly wealthy individuals, to contribute their own funds to their campaigns; (5) the role of independent expenditures; (6) financial and other assistance given by national banks, corporations, or labor organizations; (7) existing or alternative financial disclosure requirements; and (8) any other measure which the Commission deems appropriate. Directs the Commission to make reasonable efforts to achieve the broadest bipartisan consensus in arriving at recommendations. Requires the Commission, not later than 12 months after enactment of this Act, to submit to the Congress its final report. Terminates the Commission 90 days after submission of such report. Requires the Director of the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress and the Chairman of the Federal Election Commission, not later than two months after enactment of this Act, to transmit to the Bipartisan Commission briefing papers which catalog and synthesize pertinent reports, analyses, and recommendations. Authorizes appropriations."
