Defines \"contraband gasoline\" as: (1) 2,000 gallons or more of gasoline that is in the possession of any person who does not have a license for such possession required by the State law where the gasoline is found; (2) 2,000 gallons or more of gasoline that is in the possession of any person, if a tax on the gasoline is not collected or paid as required by State law; or (3) a quantity of less than 2,000 gallons of gasoline described in this Act, which is later transferred to another person. Makes it a Federal offense for any person to knowingly ship, receive, possess, sell, distribute, or purchase contraband gasoline. Provides for a fine of not more than $250,000 or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both. Prohibits any one from knowingly: (1) making false statements with respect to certain records required by Federal law; or (2) violating regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
