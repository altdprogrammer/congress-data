Includes among such services and assistance: (1) training for such providers; (2) resource centers to make developmentally appropriate curriculum materials; (3) systems of substitute caregivers; (4) technical assistance in understanding local regulations and relevant tax and other policies; and (5) subgrants to providers for the purchase of small equipment. Requires that grant recipients furnish, or propose to furnish, such support primarily to providers serving low-income families. Directs the Secretary to establish a National Resource Center on Family Day Care, to be operated on a regional basis, either directly or through grant or contract. Includes among Center functions: (1) training individuals involved in training family day care providers; (2) serving as a clearinghouse for resource materials on family day care; and (3) providing technical assistance to family day care sponsors, providers, and trainers of providers with respect to relevant laws and regulations. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 and succeeding fiscal years for: (1) the National Resource Center on Family Day Care; and (2) payments to States under this Act, with such payments to be allocated among States in the same ratio as payments under title XX (Grants to States for Services) of the Social Security Act."
