Directs the head of a Federal criminal justice agency to make such information available: (1) upon request of the Secretary concerned or the head of another Federal department or agency; and (2) after written consent from the person concerned. Prohibits the Secretary concerned or the head of any other Federal department or agency from requesting a criminal history record on any person unless such Secretary or department or agency head has first obtained the person's written consent for the release of such information."
