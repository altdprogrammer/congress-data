Requires credits earned by a student who has not obtained a high school degree (or equivalent) to be counted toward the computation of an Indian student count if the institution at which the student is in attendance has established criteria for the admission of such student. Prohibits credits earned by a student for purposes of obtaining a high school degree from being counted toward the computation of the Indian student count. Increases the amount used by the Secretary of the Interior to determine the amount of grant assistance to be allocated to tribally controlled community colleges for FY 1986. Provides that no tribally controlled community college receiving funds under the Snyder Act may be denied a contract, including contract support funding, pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Requires the Secretary of the Interior (currently, the Administrator of General Services) to: (1) conduct a study of facilities available for use by tribally controlled community colleges and to submit a report of the results of such study to the Congress; and (2) initiate a program to conduct necessary renovations, alterations, repairs, and reconstruction of facilities identified in the study. Amends the Navajo Community College Act to extend, through 1990, the authorization of funds for construction grants to the Navajo Community College."
