    "text": "Requires Government procurement contracts to include provisions under which the contractor is prohibited from employing Government employees or members of the uniformed services who had significant responsibilities for any procurement function with respect to such contracts. Declares such prohibition period to be five years from the termination of the contract or, if the contract term exceeds the individual's separation date, the five-year period beginning on the date of the individual's separation from Government service. Sets forth the method of determining the liquidated damages to be paid by any contractor who violates such prohibition. Requires each contractor to send an annual report listing each former Government employee hired by that contractor within the previous five years to the agency by which each employee was last employed. Directs the Inspector General of each such agency to review the report to identify any violation of this Act. Requires the Director of the Office of Government Ethics to: (1) conduct an annual random survey of the reports to check for violations of this Act; and (2) report to the Congress annually on the operation of this Act. Makes this Act inapplicable to contracts for amounts less than $25,000."
