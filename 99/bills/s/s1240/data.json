Revises the enforcement provisions of such Act to direct the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, upon receiving a complaint or as a result of investigations, to: (1) attempt to eliminate any alleged discriminatory actions; and (2) effect voluntary compliance with the requirements of such Act through informal methods of conciliation, conference, and persuasion. Permits any individual claiming to be aggrieved by an act prohibited under such Act, or the Commission, to bring a civil action for equitable relief. Eliminates the upper age limitation of 70 under such Act."
