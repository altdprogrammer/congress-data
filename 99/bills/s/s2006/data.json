    "text": "Contract Disputes Amendments of 1986 - Amends the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 to require contractors to submit claims against the Government to contracting officers not later than 18 months after the dates on which the claims accrue. Grants contractors 90 days (currently, 12 months) from the date of receipt of the contracting officer's decision to file an action on such claim in the U.S. Claims Court. Sets forth provisions for the collection of claims against contractors. Authorizes the Government to file an action in an appropriate district court to recover amounts owed or compel the required performance. Authorizes such district courts to grant the Government provisional relief against a contractor upon the petition of the Attorney General, and if there is a likelihood that the contractor will hinder, delay, or frustrate the contracting officer's decision. Declares that administrative offset provisions do not apply to claims subject to the Contract Disputes Act 1978."
