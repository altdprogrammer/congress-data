    "text": "Fragile Lands Conservation and Wetlands Protection Act of 1985 - Title I: Highly Erodible Land Conservation - Makes a person who produces an agricultural commodity on highly erodible land ineligible for five years (with respect to all commodities) for agricultural price supports, storage facility loans, crop insurance, disaster payments, and other Farmers Home Administration loans. Provides exceptions for: (1) crops produced using approved conservation methods; and (2) certain previously cultivated land (1981 through 1985). Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to complete specified soil capability class surveys. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Wetlands Conservation - Makes a person who produces an agricultural commodity on converted wetlands ineligible for five years (with respect to all commodities) for agricultural price supports, storage facility loans, crop insurance, disaster payments, and other Farmers Home Administration loans. Provides exceptions for: (1) wetlands converted before enactment of this Act; and (2) production that is possible as a result of natural conditions such as drought, and not harmful to natural wetland characteristics. Directs the Secretary to administer the program in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Conservation Reserve Program - Directs the Secretary to establish a conservation reserve program to assist producers in conserving soil and water resources on highly erodible land or other erosion-problem land. Directs the Secretary, for FY 1986 through 1988, to enter into ten-year contracts under which the Secretary shall pay an annual fee, share conservation costs, and provide technical assistance in return for converting such cropland to less erosion-prone uses. Limits annual payments to any one person to $50,000. Limits total fiscal year payments to specified amounts. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out such program through the Commodity Credit Corporation. Requires the Secretary to complete a soil erosion study and report to the Congress within 18 months. Authorizes appropriations."
