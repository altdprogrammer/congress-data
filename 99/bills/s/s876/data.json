Authorizes the expenditure of funds from the working reserve of the VA's construction, major projects, account, for medical facilities construction at specified locations in specified amounts. Part C: Alternatives to and for Construction - Directs the Administrator, in considering needed medical facilities, to determine whether: (1) construction of a new facility; (2) leasing of an existing facility; or (3) purchase of an existing facility is the most feasible approach.
