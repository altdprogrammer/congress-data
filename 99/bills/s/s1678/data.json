Makes it unlawful to knowingly and willfully without authorization damage, destroy, or attempt to damage or destroy such a computer or any computer programs or data contained in such a computer. Makes it a misdemeanor to intentionally without any authorization obtain access to such a computer. Provides that anyone who violates any provision of this Act shall forfeit to the United States any interest in any computer and computer program which has been used to commit the violation. Specifies that this Act does not prohibit any lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activity of a State or Federal law enforcement agency, or of an intelligence agency of the United States."
