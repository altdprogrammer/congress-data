    "date": "1985-01-03", 
    "text": "Older Americans Employment Opportunities Act of 1985 - Title I: Amendments to Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 - Amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to eliminate the upper age limitation (70 years of age) of the class of persons to whom such Act applies. Repeals specified provisions allowing mandatory retirement at age 65 in certain professions. Prohibits any employee benefit plan from requiring or permitting the suspension of an employee's benefit accrual because of age before accruing the maximum normal retirement benefit. Title II: Pension Accrual for Older Workers - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit specified types of plans under such Acts from suspending or reducing the rate of an employee's benefit accrual or employer contributions to the employee's account solely because of age. Revises ERISA to prohibit an employer from withholding plan benefits because of any increase in the income of the participant due to employment for less than 1,000 hours during a calendar year. Title III: Further Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include low-income older workers (who are members of economically disadvantaged families and who are at least 65 years of age) as members of targeted groups for purposes of the tax credit for employment of certain new employees. Reduces the rates of the employment (FICA) taxes on employees and on employers by one-half in the case of workers 65 years of age or older. Makes similar reductions in the case of older workers in the rates of Railroad Retirement Act taxes on employees, employee representatives, and employers. Title IV: Amendments to the National Apprenticeship Act - Amends the National Apprenticeship Act to direct the Secretary of Labor to ensure that no program of apprenticeship discriminates because of age against any individual in admission or employment."
