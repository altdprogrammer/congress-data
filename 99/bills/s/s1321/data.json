    "text": "Airport and Air Carrier Security Improvement Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to assess the efficacy of security measures at foreign airports which serve United States carriers or from which foreign air carriers serve the United States. Requires the Secretary to: (1) make such assessments by employing the criteria used to assess the security of United States airports; (2) use criteria based on certain international standards; (3) report to the Congress regarding such assessments; (4) notify the appropriate authorities if a foreign airport does not administer effective security measures; (5) publish in the Federal Register the names of all foreign airports which have failed to bring their security measures up to an acceptable level of effectiveness; and (6) prominently display at all United States airports regularly serving scheduled air carrier operations the names of foreign airports whose security measures have not reached an acceptable level of effectiveness. Authorizes the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of State, to withhold or impose conditions on the operating authority of any carrier to engage in foreign air transportation utilizing foreign airports with lax security measures. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance concerning aviation security to foreign governments. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986, 1987 and 1988. Urges the President to seek international agreements to assure more effective international cooperation regarding airport and air carrier security."
