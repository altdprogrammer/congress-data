    "text": "International Education Reauthorization Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to revise and reauthorize programs under title VI (International Education Programs) of HEA. Revises part A (International and Foreign Language Studies) provisions of title VI. Eliminates contract provisions, but retains grant provisions, for language and area centers and programs under part A. Sets forth separate provisions for the graduate and undergraduate aspects of such centers and programs. Adds provisions focusing on: (1) the foreign language aspects of professional and other fields of study; and (2) instruction and research on issues in world affairs. Authorizes the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to: (1) make grants to institutions of higher education or combinations of such institutions to pay stipends for individuals undergoing advanced training in approved centers or programs for language, area studies, and international education under part A; and (2) award, on the basis of a national competition, stipends to students beginning their third year of graduate training in a specialty language with multidisciplinary area training. Replaces provisions relating to international studies centers with provisions for language resource centers. Requires such centers to serve as resources to improve the capacity to teach and learn foreign languages effectively. Sets forth some authorized activities for such centers. Revises provisions for undergraduate international studies and foreign language programs. Adds provisions for model program grants to improve and expand foreign language studies. Bases institutional eligibility for such grants on certain foreign language requirements. Adds provisions for intensive summer language institutes. Includes among the types of research and studies which may be assisted under part A the application of proficiency tests and standards across all areas of instruction and classroom use. Revises provisions for equitable distribution of funds for language and area centers to require the Secretary to employ separate but equally rigorous criteria for undergraduate and graduate programs. Extends through FY 1991 the authorization of appropriations for part A (International and Foreign Language Studies) and for part B (Business and International Education). Restructures the membership and duties of the Advisory Board which advises the Secretary on the conduct of programs under title VI. Directs the Advisory Board to advise the Secretary and the Congress on adequate budget levels for parts A and B of title VI."
