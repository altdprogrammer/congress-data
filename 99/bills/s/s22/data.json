    "text": "First Amendment Clarification Act of 1985 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to provide that the term \"public interest, convenience, and necessity\" shall not be construed to give the Federal Communications Commission jurisdiction to require the provision of broadcast time to any person for the expression of any viewpoint. Repeals the authority of the Commission to revoke a station license or construction permit for willful or repeated failure of a station to grant or sell broadcast time to a candidate for Federal office. Repeals the requirement that a licensee grant equal opportunities to all political candidates who use the licensee's broadcasting station. Repeals provisions that prohibit noncommercial educational broadcasting stations from editorializing or supporting or opposing political candidates."
