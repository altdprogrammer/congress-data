    "text": "Medicaid Maternal and Infant Health Care Enhancement Act of 1986 - Title I: Medicaid - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require States to cover comprehensive services provided to women with high risk pregnancies. Defines such a woman as one who is eligible for Medicaid benefits and meets at least two of the following conditions: (1) she is under age 18 or over age 35; (2) she left school prior to high school graduation; (3) she is dependent upon cigarettes, alcohol, or drugs; (4) her family income is below the Federal poverty level; or (5) she has had a previous poor birth outcome. Lists the comprehensive services to be provided to such women. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to appoint an Advisory Group on High-Risk Pregnancies to advise the Secretary regarding other items and services meriting inclusion on such list. Requires States to cover pregnancy-related services provided to eligible women without limiting the amount, duration, or scope of such services. Requires that the determination regarding an individual's eligibility for pregnancy-related services be made within ten days of her application for such services. Provides full Medicaid reimbursement to title V (Maternal and Child Health of the Act) health clinics for outpatient services furnished to Medicaid-eligible pregnant women. Title II: Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant - Amends title V of the Act to require States to submit annual reports to the Secretary relating to: (1) women and children in the State, including information regarding the availability of pregnancy-related and pediatric services; and (2) children with special health care needs in the State and the services provided to such children."
