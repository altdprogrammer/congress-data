Prohibits any public building construction, renovation, repair, or alteration unless an appropriation for the estimated costs of such construction has been authorized in the same fiscal year. Prohibits entering into any lease, beginning in FY 1988, unless the authority to enter into contracts has first been made for the maximum cost of such lease. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 for the real property management and related activities of the Public Buildings Service of the General Services Administration, including: (1) construction and acquisition; (2) renovations, alterations, and repairs; (3) design and construction services; (4) leasing; (5) real property operations; (6) program direction; and (7) purchase contracts. Requires that ten percent of the funds made available for renovation, alteration, and repair of public buildings and for payment of leases on buildings, shall be available for repair or alteration projects and leases, respectively, not otherwise authorized by this Act, if the Administrator of General Services certifies such to be the result of emergency building conditions or changing or additional programs of Federal agencies. Prohibits the obligation of funds for such projects until 30 days after submission by the Administrator of an explanatory statement to specified congressional committees which includes the reasons why such project or lease cannot be deferred for authorization until the next succeeding fiscal year."
