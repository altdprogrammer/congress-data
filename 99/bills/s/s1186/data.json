    "text": "Juvenile Incarceration Protection Act of 1985 - Prohibits any juvenile (except those charged and convicted as adults) from being detained or confined in any jail or lockup for adults. Requires the Attorney General to promulgate regulations that: (1) recognize the special needs of low population areas with respect to the detention of juveniles; and (2) shall permit the temporary detention in adult facilities of juveniles charged with serious crimes against persons where there is no alternative and where the juvenile will have no regular contact with adults incarcerated. Establishes an exception where a juvenile adjudicated a delinquent may pose a significant likelihood of harm to other juveniles detained in a juvenile facility. Authorizes any person aggrieved by a violation of this Act to bring a civil action for damages and equitable relief."
