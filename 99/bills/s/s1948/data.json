Specifies the duties of the Bureau which include: (1) overseeing the certification process for residential facilities furnishing services to developmentally disabled or mentally ill individuals; (2) reviewing the findings and recommendations of State survey agencies established by this Act; (3) conducting independent validation surveys of such facilities; (4) developing, with certain other Federal officials, standards for such facilities, and survey procedures and a training curriculum (which the Bureau shall oversee) for State surveyors of those facilities; and (5) advising the Secretary regarding policies implemented under Medicaid or Medicare which may affect developmentally disabled or mentally ill individuals. Title II: Quality Services for Developmentally Disabled Individuals - Requires the Secretary to establish, with certain other Federal officials: (1) standards for residential facilities furnishing Medicaid services to developmentally disabled individuals; and (2) a standard training curriculum, survey procedures and regional training centers for State personnel surveying residential facilities and providers of home and community-based services to developmentally disabled individuals. Requires the inclusion, in each State Medicaid plan, of home and community-based services for developmentally disabled individuals. Title III: Quality Services For Mentally Ill Individuals - Requires the Secretary to establish, with certain other Federal officials: (1) standards for residential facilities furnishing Medicare or Medicaid services to mentally ill individuals; and (2) a standard training curriculum, survey procedures and regional training centers for State personnel surveying residential facilities and providers of home and community-based services to mentally ill individuals. Authorizes the inclusion, in each State Medicaid plan, of home and community-based services for mentally ill individuals. Title IV: State Surveys and Certifications - Requires each State to designate a State survey agency whose duties include: (1) conducting annual residential facilities and providers of home and community-based services in the State which receive payments under Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished to developmentally disabled or mentally ill individuals; and (2) making recommendations to the Secretary on the basis of surveys and other findings as to whether any facility or other provider surveyed should be certified or decertified under Medicare and Medicaid. Title V: Miscellaneous Provisions - Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amends the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act to require residential programs for developmentally disabled individuals to meet Medicaid standards. Provides that a hospital's accreditation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals shall not be enough for it to meet the health and safety standards required for certification as a psychiatric hospital under the Medicare program."
