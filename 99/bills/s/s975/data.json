Defines \"takeover securities\" as certain low-rated or unrated bonds or preferred stock, other debt instruments subordinated in right of payment to the payment of any substantial amount of unsecured indebtedness, or equity or quasi-equity instruments other than common or preferred stock. Prohibits any insured bank or institution from purchasing non-investment grade securities. Directs the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to prevent insured institutions from carrying non-investment grade securities as loans."
