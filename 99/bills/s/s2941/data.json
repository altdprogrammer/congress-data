Makes participation in such a project by an enrollee voluntary. Authorizes such projects to include: (1) binding arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution procedures; (2) contractual modifications of existing substantive rules governing tort claims; or (3) compensation for specified injuries or illness on a no-fault basis. Specifies considerations required before a project may be approved. Requires the Comptroller General of the United States to report to the Congress by December 31, 1991, any recommendations regarding implementation of alternatives to the tort liability system in Federal health benefit plans. Authorizes appropriations for such projects for FY 1988 through 1992."
