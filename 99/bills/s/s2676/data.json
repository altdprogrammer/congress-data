    "text": "San Luis Rey Indian Water Rights Settlement Act - Provides for the settlement of water rights claims between the United States and the La Jolla, Rincon, San Pasqual, Pauma, and Pala Bands of Mission Indians (California). Requires the Secretary of the Interior, upon the settlement of all water rights claims, to deliver water to the Indian Water Authority in the vicinity of the Bands' Reservations. Requires the Indian Water Authority to reimburse the United States for operational and maintenance costs (except construction costs) incurred in the delivery of such water. Requires the Indian Water Authority to pay costs associated with the conveyance of such water through non-Federal facilities. Prohibits the Secretary from being obligated to deliver such water if: (1) such delivery would require the construction of new Federal facilities; (2) consent is denied for the use of non-Federal facilities; or (3) necessary contracts have not been executed. Requires the Secretary to take the necessary steps to ensure that the delivery of such water will not result in added costs for Central Valley Project customers. Requires the Secretary to use power from the Central Valley Project to deliver water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to the Indian Water Authority. Requires the Indian Water Authority to reimburse the United States at the project use rate for irrigation water for the operation and maintenance costs incurred in providing power for the delivery of water. Sets forth limitations on the costs of providing such power. Establishes the San Luis Rey Indian Water Authority. Provides that the Authority, upon the approval of the Secretary, may lease, sell, and manage any water or power resource on or off the Reservations of the Bands. Authorizes the Secretary to lease, grant rights-of-way across, or transfer title to any Indian tribal or allotted land which is used to divert, convey, and store the waters of the San Luis Rey River for the local entities, including the Rincon and Bear Valley powerplants."
