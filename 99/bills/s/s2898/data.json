    "text": "Atomic Veterans Relief Act of 1986 - Amends Federal law relating to veterans' wartime disability to provide disability compensation to veterans who participated in atomic tests or the occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki after World War II and who suffer from illnesses or diseases related to ionizing radiation, including leukemia and various forms of cancer. Makes identical changes under veterans' peacetime disability provisions. Authorizes the above-described veterans to bring suit against the United States for property damage, injury, or death related to the atomic weapons testing program. Outlines administrative provisions concerning such civil actions. Prohibits any plaintiff's attorney from receiving in excess of 25 percent of the judgment awarded as attorney's fees, providing civil and criminal penalties for the violation of such prohibition. Extends the statute of limitations for such actions to one year after the enactment of this Act. Empowers the appropriate district court with exclusive jurisdiction to hear such cases. Amends the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1985 to bring into conformity with this Act a provision relating to contractor liability arising out of atomic weapons testing programs."
