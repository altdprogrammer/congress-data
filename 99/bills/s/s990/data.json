    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Program Support Authorization Act - Title I: Program Support - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 and 1987 to the Department of Commerce for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to carry out: (1) executive direction and administration; (2) marine services; (3) aircraft services; (4) duties under the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere Act of 1977; and (5) salary, pay, and employee benefits for NOAA employees. Title II: Selected Ocean and Coastal Programs - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 and 1987 to the Department of Commerce for the purpose of enabling NOAA to carry out its duties: (1) in ocean dumping research; (2) under the National Ocean Pollution Planning Act of 1978; (3) in nonliving marine resources; (4) in ocean research; (5) in ocean services; and (6) in mapping, charting, and geodesy. Revises provisions concerning the sale of charts published by NOAA to provide for price increases of such charts in order to meet rising publishing costs. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, three years after the date of enactment of this Act and triennially thereafter, to report to the Congress on the effect of imposing or maintaining such increased prices. Requires the Secretary to adjust such prices as necessary to avoid any adverse impact on air and marine safety. Provides for the distribution of such charts to foreign governments, international, organizations, and departments and offices in the United States."
