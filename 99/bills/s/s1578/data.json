    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Environment and Public Works with amendment (without written report)) Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 - Amends the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act to confer responsibility upon: (1) each State for the disposal of specified low-level radioactive waste either by itself or in cooperation with other States; and (2) the Federal Government for ensuring the safe disposal of specified high-level and low-level radioactive waste materials. Directs the Secretary of Energy to submit to the Congress a comprehensive report on the safe disposal of certain radioactive waste. Authorizes the States to enter into regional compacts to establish and operate regional low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities. Declares such compacts and regional activities inapplicable to: (1) the transportation, management or disposal of low-level radioactive waste owned by or generated as a result of activities of the Secretary or from atomic weapons research, testing, development or production; and (2) low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities operated exclusively for federally produced waste. Subjects low-level radioactive waste generated by the Federal Government to the same conditions as any such waste which is not generated by Federal activities. Requires such compacts to provide that the Congress may by law withdraw its consent every five years. Requires each State in which a regional disposal facility is located to make disposal capacity available for low-level radioactive waste generated by certain commercial nuclear power reactors. Provides that low-level radioactive waste generated within a sited compact region during a specified seven-year period shall be accorded priority in the allocation of available disposal capacity at regional disposal facilities located within the region, and at facilities located in: Barnwell, South Carolina; Beatty, Nevada; and at Richland, Washington. Sets guidelines under which such States may prohibit the disposal at their respective facilities of low-level radioactive waste generated outside of the compact region. Authorizes such States to limit low-level radioactive waste volumes accepted for disposal at their regional facilities during a specified seven-year period. Sets allocation guidelines for low-level radioactive waste disposal capacity for certain commercial nuclear power reactors during: (1) a four-year transition period; and (2) a three-year licensing and construction period. Sets guidelines for the assignment of disposal capacity allocations among eligible commercial nuclear power reactors. Directs the States of South Carolina, Washington, and Nevada to make available additional disposal capacity among commercial nuclear power reactors whose allocations have been inadequate for specified reasons. Authorizes the State in which a regional disposal facility is located to impose an additional surcharge upon low-level radioactive waste disposal. Provides that surcharges shall be placed in an escrow account and be repaid to those non-sited compact regions and non-member States which meet specified deadline requirements for the establishment of low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities within their respective borders. Sets penalties for failure to meet such deadlines, including the imposition of additional surcharges and the denial of access to regional disposal facilities. Sets forth conditions under which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission may grant emergency disposal facility access to a non-complying State if an imminent threat exists to the public safety or common defense. Prescribes guidelines under which any compact region or non-member compact State shall be entitled to reciprocal emergency access to disposal facilities. Requires the Secretary to furnish technical and financial assistance to compact regions and to States seeking assistance under this Act. Directs the Commission within a specified time frame to: (1) publish the technical information and guidance needed by States and compact regions to establish low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities that use alternatives to shallow land burial and that meet the Commission's licensing requirements; (2) expedite the licensing review procedure for new low level radioactive waste disposal facilities; (3) develop standards, procedures and expertise to exempt from Commission regulations waste streams whose radioactive waste is below regulatory concern; and (4) publish in the Federal Register (in conjunction with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency) certain substances listed as hazardous waste under the Solid Waste Disposal Act and subject to its regulation that are low-level radioactive waste as specified under this Act. Sets forth the actions to be taken by the Commission and the Administrator regarding the treatment and disposal of hazardous waste for the protection of human health and the environment."
