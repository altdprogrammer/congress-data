    "text": "Processed Products Inspection Improvement Act of 1986 - Amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act to redescribe the manner and frequency of inspection of meat food products to include the requirement that the Secretary of Agriculture take into account for each establishment: (1) the nature and frequency of processing operations; (2) the adequacy and reliability of processing controls and sanitary procedures; and (3) the history of inspection compliance. Changes the requirement that condemned meat food products be destroyed for \"food purposes,\" to a requirement that they be destroyed for \"human food purposes.\" Authorizes a court, upon the Secretary of Agriculture's request, to issue a temporary order forbidding operational control of a facility subject to Federal inspection by any person convicted of a felony involving intentional adulteration of food, extortion, or bribery, if control by such person would pose a threat to public health or safety or a clear likelihood of significant economic harm to consumers. Authorizes the Secretary to commence civil actions for inspection suspensions in cases of: (1) repeated offenses; and (2) assaults or threats of assault on inspectors. Provides for judicial review of such suspension in courts of appeal. Provides that amendments made by this Act shall not be construed to authorize the Secretary to refuse to provide inspection solely because an establishment does not participate in a total plant quality-control program. Expresses the sense of the Congress that it should evaluate the effects of this Act eight years after its enactment."
