Requires, as a condition of the award of such grants, that an application be submitted to the Secretary. Applies specified requirements of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 to such projects unless such requirements cannot legally be met in the State (as determined by the State educational agency of the State in which the applicant for funds is located). Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1989."
