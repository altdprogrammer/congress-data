    "text": "Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 - Prohibits U.S. persons from: (1) making loans to South Africa or any organization owned or controlled by South Africa; (2) making any investment in South Africa; (3) contributing technology or technological services to the exploration for, or the research, development, or production of, energy sources in or for South Africa; or (4) making deposits in a foreign bank which is organized under South African law or owned or controlled by South Africans or a branch bank located in South Africa. Prohibits foreign banks organized under South African law or owned or controlled by South Africans from establishing or operating branches in the United States. Excludes from such prohibitions those loans, investments, and technology contracts entered into before May 21, 1986. Prohibits importing uranium ore, uranium oxide, coal, and steel from South Africa. Prohibits: (1) U.S. persons from making or holding any investment in South Africa in a business that sells computers, computer software, or computer services; and (2) exporting computers, computer software, or computer services to South Africa. Provides that such computer investment and export prohibitions shall not apply if, within 12 months of enactment of this Act: (1) the President certifies to the Congress that South Africa has freed Nelson Mandela and all political prisoners and has entered into good faith negotiations with truly representative leaders of the black majority for a new political system or has totally dismantled the apartheid system; and (2) a joint resolution is enacted approving such certification. Provides for expedited consideration of such resolution. Authorizes using additional funds for aid for South Africa under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962. Earmarks such funds for refugee assistance programs and community development projects. Requires the President to give quarterly reports to specified congressional committees on the assistance provided with such funds. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to prohibit the takeoff and landing in the United States of aircraft owned by South Africa or South African nationals except in emergencies. Provides for the enforcement of this Act and for penalties for violations of this Act. Requires the President to try, through negotiations, to persuade other countries to adopt restrictions on activities with respect to South Africa consistent with this Act. Requires the President to report annually to the Congress on the status of such negotiations. Sets forth information to be included in such reports. Requires the President, during June of 1988, to report to the Congress on whether South Africa has: (1) freed Nelson Mandela and all political prisoners and has entered into good faith negotiations with truly representative leaders of the black majority for a new political system; or (2) has totally dismantled the apartheid system. Requires the President, if such conditions have not been met, to include in such report recommendations on whether U.S. persons should be required to divest themselves of their South African investments. Terminates all the provisions of this Act upon enactment of a joint resolution approving a presidential determination that such conditions have been met."
