Requires the Director to certify interpreters for any language after identifying a need for certified interpreters in that language. Requires the Director to establish criteria for the selection of otherwise qualified interpreters: (1) in languages for which no interpreters have been certified; and (2) where no certified interpreter is reasonably available. Requires a presiding judicial official to utilize the services of any reasonably available certified interpreter. Allows the services of an otherwise qualified interpreter to be utilized when no certified interpreter is reasonably available. Allows an individual who waives the right to a certified interpreter to retain the services of a noncertified interpreter of his or her own choice. Establishes the Federal Court Interpreters Advisory Board to: (1) review the quality of court interpreting in the Federal Courts and Grand Jury proceedings; and (2) make recommendations and advise the Director with respect to language in which interpreters are to be certified. Authorizes appropriations to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts."
