    "text": "Postsecondary Continuing Education Act of 1985 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to revise title I provisions for postsecondary continuing education. Retitles title I (currently \"Continuing Postsecondary Education Program and Planning\") as \"Postsecondary Continuing Education.\" Retitles and replaces part A (currently \"Commission on National Development in Postsecondary Education\") with new provisions for \"Postsecondary Continuing Education Innovation and Outreach Grants.\" Provides that such grants will assist institutions of higher education in: (1) demonstration programs for adult learners; (2) cooperative arrangements with private sector employees; and (3) outreach programs, particularly those that adapt telecommunications and other technologies to reach new or isolated adult learners. Includes among individuals whom a part A program may serve: (1) certain potential new entrants to the workforce, especially disadvantaged and minority individuals; (2) those seeking reentry to the workforce after prolonged absences, particularly women; (3) certain dislocated workers; (4) those who need counseling and remedial instruction to benefit from postsecondary education; (5) those isolated from educational resources by geographic location or impaired or restricted mobility; (6) certain employees of small- and medium-sized businesses; and (7) those in fields of special concern to the national interest, such as teaching, counseling, nursing, and library and learning center administration. Directs the Secretary of Education to carry out a part A program to assist eligible institutions of higher education to establish programs enhancing adult educational opportunities. Sets forth the following provisions relating to such part A grants: (1) competitive applications for such assistance; (2) institutional eligibility; (3) uses of such funds; (4) size and duration of such grants; (5) Federal share (from an 80 percent maximum in the first year down to a 20 percent maximum in the fifth year); and (6) cost sharing (the applicant institution may provide the non-Federal share directly or through other sources). Permits certain institutions to apply for waivers of such matching requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a part A program to assist State higher education agencies to enhance adult educational opportunities and to provide for regional or statewide adult postsecondary continuing education information and guidance services. Allows such part A grants to be used for program planning, development, and operation, which may include: (1) development and implementation of such regional or statewide services; and (2) contracting with one or more institutions of higher education or other organizations to provide such a system and services. Retitles and replaces part B (currently \"Education Outreach Programs\") with new provisions for \"Postsecondary Continuing Education Research and Demonstration Grants.\" Provides that such grants will assist institutions of higher education to have the sustained capacity to: (1) undertake substantial ongoing research and demonstration activities in postsecondary education; and (2) provide leadership, advice, and technical assistance to other institutions of higher education and to public agencies and private organizations on the use and allocation of resources to serve national, regional, State, and local adult learning priorities. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to and contracts with institutions of higher education or combinations of such institutions to carry out part B by providing assistance to such institutions. Sets forth the following provisions relating to such part B grants and contracts: (1) uses of such funds; (2) competitive applications for such assistance; (3) size and duration of grant or contract; (4) Federal share of each such grant (from an 80 percent maximum in the first year down to a 20 percent maximum in the fifth year); and (5) cost sharing (the applicant institution may provide the non-Federal share directly or through other sources). Revises provisions relating to the National Advisory Council on Continuing Education (and places such provisions under a new part C \"the National Advisory Council on Continuing Education\"). Provides that the Advisory Council shall elect its own Chairmen from among members who are not Federal employees. Requires the Advisory Council to meet at least four times a year (currently twice a year). Authorizes the Advisory Council to conduct studies, hearings, and other activities to: (1) identify the continuing education needs and goals of the Nation, and report on these to the President, the Congress, and the Secretary; and (2) collect, analyze, and disseminate information regarding postsecondary continuing education programs under HEA and other Federal continuing education and training programs. Revises provisions for Advisory Council annual reports. Sets forth a new part D \"General Provisions\" which includes a definition of \"adult learner\" for purposes of postsecondary continuing education programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1991. Requires that a specified portion of such funds be used to carry out part B provisions. Authorizes the Secretary to reserve a specified portion of part A funds for grants to State higher education agencies."
