Excludes owners and operators of methane recovery equipment at hazardous waste disposal sites unless such owners or operators also own or operate the site. Excludes response action contractors from liability under CERCLA except as specified. Includes within removal costs the costs of permanent relocation of residents, business debt installments during the evacuation period, and assistance for lost wages. Includes within remedial action the off-site transport and treatment and storage of hazardous substances and associated contaminated materials. Includes household water supplies within the scope of alternative water supplies for replacement purposes. Treats an ocean incineration vessel as a facility for purposes of CERCLA. Requires additional evidence of financial responsibility for such vessels.

Requires the President to consider long-term as well as short-term costs and to stress permanent solutions to waste contamination when selecting cost-effective remedial responses. Establishes a general cleanup standard for remedial actions which at least provides for the protection of human health and the environment. States that on-site cleanup must comply with this standard but permits are not required under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Requires site specific solutions where needed. Makes the cleanup of contaminated ground and surface water at NPL sites a remedial action requiring State and Federal participation. Limits such designation and Federal involvement to five years or until the general protection standard is met.
