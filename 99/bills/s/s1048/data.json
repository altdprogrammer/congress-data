    "text": "Anti-Fraudulent Adoption Practices Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal criminal code to make it a Federal offense for any person to knowingly make any false statement or use any false document or conceal any material fact in connection with any interstate or foreign adoption. Makes it unlawful, except in specified circumstances, for any person to solicit or receive money for arranging for an adoption. Provides for imprisonment for not more than five years or a fine of not more than $250,000, or both. Makes it a Federal offense for any person to use force or threats to cause any other individual to travel in foreign commerce in connection with an adoption or placement of a child in a home for permanent free care. Provides for imprisonment for not more than ten years and/or a fine of not more than $250,000. Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978 to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) review model adoption legislation and procedures and propose necessary changes to insure against fraudulent practices; (2) coordinate with national, State, and volunteer organizations to improve State adoption legislation; and (3) assist States in the development of improved procedures for controlling illegal adoption practices. Imposes a deadline of January 1, 1987, for the Secretary to establish a national adoption data-gathering and analysis system. Provides that the Secretary's study of unlicensed or unregulated adoption placements shall be ongoing and that the Secretary shall issue biannual reports on the findings of the study. Grants the Federal district courts jurisdiction to hear any civil action involving fraudulent adoption practices regardless of the amount in controversy. Authorizes the Attorney General to institute proceedings to prevent and restrain violations of this Act."
