    "text": "Foreign Motor Carrier Registration Act of 1985 - Amends the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 to exempt commercial motor vehicles owned or operated by foreign carriers providing interstate transportation of property from Federal regulations regarding: (1) certain Federal safety standards; (2) safety equipment inspection; and (3) safety fitness certification. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations regarding the safety roadworthiness of commercial motor vehicles owned or operated by foreign motor carriers and foreign motor private carriers providing interstate transportation of property (trucks). Requires such standards to differentiate among various categories of commercial motor vehicles and among various cross-border entry levels. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 for the Department of Transportation and the Interstate Commerce Commission (the Commission) to investigate the safety roadworthiness of such vehicles. States that foreign motor carriers and foreign motor private carriers providing interstate transportation of property shall be subject only to the safety roadworthiness rules adopted under this Act. Declares that commercial motor vehicles owned or operated by a foreign motor carrier or foreign motor private carrier providing interstate transportation of property may be required to pass safety roadworthiness inspections if the Department of Transportation and the Commission deem such an inspection to be in the national interest. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish procedures to determine safety roadworthiness. Directs the Commission to find an applicant unfit to operate under a foreign motor carrier registration certificate if the applicant does not meet the safety roadworthiness requirements. Prohibits a foreign motor private carrier from providing interstate transportation of property without an appropriate certificate of registration. States that the requirement that certificated foreign carriers be fit, willing, and able means safety roadworthiness and proof of minimum financial responsibility. Declares that the procedures to require proof of minimum financial responsibility shall differentiate among various categories of commercial vehicles and among various cross-border entry levels. Denies entry into the United States to any commercial motor vehicle providing transportation under a certificate of foreign motor carrier registration if a copy of such certificate is not in the vehicle. Requires the Commission to issue certificates of foreign motor carrier registration during a certain moratorium period only for the purpose of transporting property in a designated United States port adjacent to the foreign country in which the motor carrier or its owners are domiciled."
