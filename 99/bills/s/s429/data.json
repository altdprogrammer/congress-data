Provides that with respect to the enforcement of the U.S. customs laws the disclosure of grand jury proceedings, otherwise prohibited under Federal law, may be made to the Government upon a showing by the Government that: (1) a prepayment penalty notice has been issued; and (2) the evidence sought may be relevant to the enforcement of penalties for fraud."
