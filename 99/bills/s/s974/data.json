Rept. 99-576) Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986 - Title I: Protection and Advocacy Systems - Part A: Establishment of Systems - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make allotments for establishing and administering State systems designed to protect and advocate the rights of the mentally ill. Sets forth the authorities such a system shall have. Requires such a system to include the establishment of an advisory board. Directs a State system to report to the Secretary on the activities, accomplishments, and expenditures of such systems annually. Establishes a procedure for determining whether information from an individual's mental health records may be disclosed to him or her. Requires such systems to exhaust all administrative remedies before initiating legal action on behalf of a mentally ill individual. Part B: Administrative Provisions - Directs the Secretary to prescribe a formula for making such allotments. Requires the Secretary to provide technical assistance to such systems. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988. Title II: Restatement of Bill of Rights for Mental Health Patients - Expresses the sense of the Congress that each State should review and revise, if necessary, its laws to ensure that mental health patients receive the protection and services they require. Advises the States to consider the recommendations of the President's Commission on Mental Health. Title III: Construction - States that this Act shall not be construed as establishing any new rights for the mentally ill. Title IV: Other Programs - Amends title III (General Powers and Duties) of the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary to promote family support groups for Alzheimer's disease patients and their families, and establish a nationwide network to coordinate such groups. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress within one year on such activities.
