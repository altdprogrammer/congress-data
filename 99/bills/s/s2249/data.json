Permits the court to appoint one or more standing trustees or a U.S. trustee to serve in a judicial district if warranted by the number of family farm reorganization cases. Sets forth duties and compensation of such trustees. Grants a debtor in possession in a family farm reorganization case the powers, functions, and duties, with specified exceptions, of a debtor in possession in a regular reorganization case. Authorizes the debtor in possession or the trustee to operate the debtor's farming and other businesses, unless the court orders otherwise. Requires the court or an appointed U.S. trustee to order the appointment of a committee of three unsecured creditors. Sets forth the powers and duties of such committee in a family farm reorganization case.

Permits the debtor to convert a family farm reorganization case to a liquidation case at any time. Prohibits the court from converting a family farm reorganization case to a liquidation case if the debtor is: (1) a family farmer; or (2) a farmer or a corporation which is not a moneyed business or commercial corporation. Specifies grounds for dismissal of a case by the court. Allows any party in interest to file a family farm reorganization plan only if: (1) the debtor is not a debtor in possession; or (2) the debtor has not filed a plan or had a plan confirmed within specified periods. Sets forth required contents of a plan proposed by the debtor. Specifies restrictions on plan modifications. Sets forth conditions for court confirmation of a plan proposed by the debtor which allow deferred cash payments over up to six years on certain unsecured claims of governmental units.

Authorizes adequate protection to be provided in a family farm reorganization case by the debtor paying to the trustee reasonable rent for the use of farmland.

Provides for the filing and allowance of property claims and interest. Permits the court in a family farm reorganization case to authorize the obtaining of credit for emergency care of the debtor's stock without notice or a hearing if: (1) irreparable loss or damage will result if such authorization is delayed; and (2) such authorization is in the best interests of the estate.
