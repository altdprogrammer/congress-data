    "text": "Whistleblower Protection Act of 1986 - Separates the Office of Special Counsel from the Merit Systems Protection Board. Empowers the Special Counsel to represent and act as legal counsel on behalf of employees alleging prohibited personnel practices, especially whistleblowers. Revises current law with respect to the Special Counsel to reflect its advocate status. Authorizes the Special Counsel to file a petition to the Board against an official for: (1) committing prohibited personnel practices; (2) violating a law within the jurisdiction of the Special Counsel; or (3) failing to comply with an order of the Board. Sets forth disciplinary actions for such officials. Requires the Special Counsel to report annually to the Congress on its activities. Authorizes employees who have been adversely affected by a prohibited personnel practice to bring an action before the Board (instead of or in addition to taking such action to the Special Counsel). Authorizes such employees to obtain judicial review of the Board's decision in the appropriate U.S. district court. Authorizes appropriations for the Merit Systems Protection Board for FY 1987 through 1991 and for the Office of Special Counsel for FY 1987 through 1989."
