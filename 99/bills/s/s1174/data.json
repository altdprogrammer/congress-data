Limits the grants to 50 percent of the costs of establishing and operating the Clearinghouse. Provides that no State shall be entitled to a grant in excess of $75,000. Requires any State Clearinghouse to: (1) work in conjunction with the National Crime Information Center by requiring local law enforcement agencies to enter information on a missing child into the information systems of such center promptly and expunging such information when the child is found or reaches the age of majority; (2) educate parents, children, and community agencies; (3) provide public information to assist in locating missing children; (4) publish a directory of organizations that provide assistance in locating missing children; (5) establish an in-State toll-free line for reporting missing children; (6) work with other public and private organizations; and (7) work with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Allows the Administrator to prescribe rules necessary to carry out this Act. Grants the Comptroller General of the United States access to any books, documents, or records of any State receiving assistance for the purpose of audit. Authorizes allocations."
