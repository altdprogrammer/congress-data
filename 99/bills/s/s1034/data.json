Provides that as of May 1, 1987: (1) any State statute restricting bank acquisitions by out-of-State bank holding company companies on the basis of the location of the other States involved shall be null and void; and (2) a State may not amend or repeal a statute permitting acquisitions by out-of-State bank holding companies in order to limit the ability of such a company to qualify in an equal manner for such an acquisition if any acquisition qualifying under such statute has been approved by the Federal Reserve Board."
