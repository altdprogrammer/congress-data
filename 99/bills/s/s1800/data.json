    "text": "Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities Employees' Civil Service Retirement Credit Act of 1985 - Includes as creditable service for purposes of civil service retirement any service performed after June 18, 1952, as an employee paid from nonappropriated funds of the military if such service involved conducting an arts and crafts, drama, music, library, service club, youth activities, sports, or recreation program for armed forces personnel. Directs the Office of Personnel Management to accept the certification of the Secretary of the appropriate military department concerning such service. Requires each nonappropriated fund instrumentality that employed an individual who qualifies for such creditable service to pay to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund the amount that would have been deducted from the pay of such individual, plus interest. Provides for a redetermination of civil service annuities based on amendments made by this Act."
