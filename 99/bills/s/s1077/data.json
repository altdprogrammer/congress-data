    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, in lieu of H.R. 3456) Consumer Product Safety Amendments of 1985 - Title I: Authorization of Appropriations - Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1987. Title II: Consumer Product Safety Commission - Requires the Commission to employ no fewer than the full-time equivalent of 568 officers and employees. Title III: General Provisions Respecting Commission Activities - Repeals the Cellulose Insulation Safety Standards. Repeals the safety standard for swimming pool slides issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Requires Commission rules to be submitted to the Congress for review. Provides that Congress may disapprove such a rule by enacting a joint resolution within 90 days. Requires the Commission to establish an agenda and priorities for Commission actions at least 30 days before the beginning of each fiscal year. Amends the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 to extend the deadline for the submission of the Interagency Committee's report to the Congress. Title IV: Amusement Park Rides - Applies provisions of such Act to amusement rides which are not permanently fixed to a site. Declares that an amusement ride which is permanently fixed is not a consumer product for the purposes of promulgating safety standards or bans regarding such rides. Permits the Commission to release information from which the public can readily ascertain the identity of the amusement ride manufacturer or owner-operator. Requires immediate notification of the Commission if any amusement ride operator obtains information which reasonably supports the conclusion that the amusement ride the operator owns contains a defect and a death or serious injury occurred on such ride. Authorizes the Commission to order the repair, replacement, or refund of purchase price if it determines that an amusement ride presents a substantial product hazard and the corrective action is in the public interest. Permits the Commission to make inspections with respect to amusement rides which: (1) are not permanently fixed to a site; (2) are permanently fixed to a site if the State in which the inspection would occur does not require periodic inspection; or (3) are involved in an accident resulting in a fatality or personal injury requiring hospitalization. Requires that such inspection be commenced and completed with reasonable promptness. Title V: Study - Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study on the capability of the Consumer Product Safety Commission to effectively carry out its functions. Requires the Comptroller General to submit a report on the results of such study to specified congressional committees by January 1, 1987. Title VI: Construction - States that nothing in this Act shall be construed as superceding any of the balanced budget provisions set forth in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as amended by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act)."
