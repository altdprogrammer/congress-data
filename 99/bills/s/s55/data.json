    "text": "Ocean and Coastal Resources Management and Development Block Grant Act - Establishes within the Treasury an Ocean and Coastal Resources Management and Development Fund. Limits the total amount payable into the Fund during any fiscal year. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to provide national ocean and coastal resources management and development block grants to each State. Requires States to report grant allocation and project information and provide opportunity for public comment before receiving such grants. Prohibits a State from receiving such a grant until it has established a trust fund for the grant. Sets forth a grant allocation formula based on: (1) actual and future outer continental shelf lease sales, including oil and gas; (2) coastal related energy activities; (3) shoreline mileage; and (4) coastal population. Establishes a minimum grant of 1.62 percent of authorized funds for coastal States having approved coastal management programs. Specifies activities authorized by the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (and coastal energy impact program) and living marine and natural resource management projects as the only eligible uses of block grants. Requires each State receiving a block grant to take means to coordinate and allocate grant funds with their respective local governments. Directs the Secretary to establish a National Coastal Resources Research and Development Institute to carry out educational and demonstration projects toward the development of ocean and coastal resources, including Arctic resources. Requires the Secretary to conduct an ongoing evaluation of the activities of the Institute. Requires the Institute to report to the Secretary within two years after enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations, beginning with FY 1986. Requires each State receiving such grant to submit a financial audit of its grant trust fund. Requires the Secretary to evaluate such audits and take appropriate action, if necessary."
