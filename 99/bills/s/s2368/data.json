    "text": "Medicare Physician Payment Reform Act of 1986 - Amends part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to set forth factors which must be considered by carriers in determining reasonable charges for physicians' services. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, when faced with a charge the Secretary believes is not inherently reasonable, to propose a reasonable charge or methodology for arriving at such a charge and, after giving the public and the Physician Payment Review Commission an opportunity to comment on such proposal, make a final determination regarding the charge or methodology. Requires the Secretary, in making recommendations regarding the relative value scale for physicians' services, to establish an index which considers justifiable geographic differences in the costs of practice without exacerbating the geographic maldistribution of physicians. Directs the Secretary to simplify the HCFA (Health Care Financing Administration) Common Procedure Coding System by July 1, 1987, to minimize the possibility that such system overstates the intensity or volume of services provided. Requires hospitals to adopt such system to code the part B services they perform."
