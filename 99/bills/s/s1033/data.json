Revises eligibility requirements for participation in a job training program to provide that a veteran must be a Korean conflict or Vietnam-era veteran: (1) whose employment has been terminated or who has been laid off from employment, is eligible for unemployment compensation, and is unlikely to return to work in the same occupation; (2) whose employment has been terminated due to permanent closure of a plant or facility; (3) who is unemployed in the same occupation or area in which the veteran resides; (4) who in underemployed and has a service-connected disability; (5) who served in Indochina and is underemployed and whose personal income is below the lower living standard income level; or (6) whose income and employment status is significantly below the level that would be reasonably expected of such a veteran. Revises requirements for employment counseling services and other assistance. Requires the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to provide such resources and personnel as may be necessary to carry out the counseling assessment and jobs matching functions authorized under the veterans' job bank and job matching program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988. Authorizes not more than ten percent of the funds appropriated for FY 1986 and not more than five percent of the funds appropriated for FY 1987 and 1988 to be used by the Administrator to provide counseling, job matching, or supportive services or to pay outreach or necessary and appropriate administrative expenses directly related to the implementation of this Act. Authorizes the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment to establish and carry out a nationwide computerized job bank and job matching program. Sets forth requirements for such job bank program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 to carry out such program. Increases to GS-11 the level to which veterans may be appointed for veterans readjustment appointments and career-conditional appointments (currently to GS-9). Eliminates the disability requirement as a condition for appointments of Vietnam-era veterans."
