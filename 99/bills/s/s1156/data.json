Makes a State eligible for assistance if such State has enacted statutes with respect to the investigation and adjudication of child abuse which: (1) minimize the additional trauma to the child victim; and (2) improve the chances of successful criminal prosecution or legal action. Requires that such assistance be used to implement these statutes. Establishes a formula based on State population to determine the amount of the States allotment. Requires the Attorney General to use up to $10,000,000 from the Crime Victims Fund each fiscal year for this purpose. Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to increase the level of the Crime Victims Fund."
