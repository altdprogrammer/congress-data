    "text": "Alternative Dispute Resolution Promotion Act of 1986 - Amends the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to require each attorney representing a party in an action to advise that party of the existence and availability of alternative dispute resolution options, including mediation, arbitration, and summary jury trial proceedings. Requires such attorneys to file notice with the court certifying that their clients were so advised and indicating whether the parties will agree to any such option. States that neither the acceptance nor rejection of any such offer shall be admissible as evidence in any further proceedings in such action. Establishes procedures by which any party may serve upon any other party offers to: (1) settle claims; or (2) engage in alternative dispute resolution techniques. Allows the court to impose sanctions upon an offeree who unreasonably rejects such an offer. Provides that such requirements shall not apply to class or derivative actions."
