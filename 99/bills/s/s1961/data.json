Title III: Transition and Repealer - Repeals provisions that would repeal specified provisions providing for the appointment, compensation, staff, and termination of U.S. trustees as of September 30, 1986. Sets forth technical amendments providing for transition to the United States trustee system established by this Act. Requires the Director of the Executive Office for United States Trustees to award a contract for a demonstration project of an electronic case management system in three judicial districts for use by the bankruptcy courts and U.S. trustees. Directs the Congress to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the project in comparison to case management in districts which do not have electronic systems and in districts which participate in electronic case management systems maintained by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
