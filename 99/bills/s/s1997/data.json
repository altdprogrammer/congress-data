Exempts from such tax: (1) crude oil or refined petroleum products purchased for export; and (2) process fuels, liquid natural gas, heating oil for household use or residual fuel oil and topped crude oil imported for further refining. Sets the rate of such tax as the difference between $22 per barrel and the average world price of crude oil per barrel."
