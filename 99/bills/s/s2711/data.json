    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1986-08-01", 
    "text": "Ball and Roller Bearing Import Relief Act of 1986 - Prohibits the Department of Defense from procuring ball or roller bearings which have been manufactured outside the United States (including Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and U.S. territories and possessions). Allows such a procurement, however, if the Secretary of Defense certifies to the Secretary of Commerce that the kind of ball or roller bearings needed: (1) are not manufactured in the United States; or (2) are manufactured in the United States but are not available in sufficient quantities. Disallows such exception to the prohibition on procurement of foreign bearings if the Secretary of Commerce disagrees with the findings of the Secretary of Defense as set out in the certification. Provides that such prohibition shall apply to procurement solicitations issued by the Department of Defense during the five-year period beginning on January 1, 1987. Amends the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to require the President and the Secretary of Commerce to expedite applications with respect to the importation of ball or roller bearings. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to provide notice to the Secretary of Labor with respect to determinations that such imports threaten to impair U.S. national security. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the Secretary of Labor to give expedited consideration to petitions filed for trade adjustment assistance by firms that produce ball or roller bearings if the Secretary of Labor makes a determination that imports of such bearings threaten to impair national security."
