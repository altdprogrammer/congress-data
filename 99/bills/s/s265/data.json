Revises regulatory authority to: (1) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to prescribe quality control regulations (under current law such prescription is discretionary); and (2) require regular independent audits and predistribution testing of each batch of formula. Requires the application notifying the Secretary of changes in formulation or processing to be made before distribution (rather than before processing as provided under current law) and to include full testing reports and records. Requires a manufacturer to notify the Secretary of nutritional inadequacy, adulteration, or misbranding of formula whether or not such discrepancies present a risk to human health and to immediately start a recall."
