    "text": "Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to authorize appropriations for FY 1986 for the International Trade Commission. Amends the Customs Procedural Reform and Simplification Act of 1978 to authorize appropriations for FY 1986 for the U.S. Customs Service. Directs the Commissioner of Customs to use any savings resulting from administrative consolidations to strengthen the commercial operations of the Customs Service by increasing the number of inspector, import specialist, patrol officer, and other line operational positions. Amends the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 to increase the number of airports where user fees can be charged for customs services. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to use funds resulting from such fees to pay the expenses incurred by the Federal Government in providing customs services at such an airport. Prohibits using such funds for any other purpose. Extends until September 30, 1986, the requirement that the Commissioner of Customs must notify the Congress 90 days before initiating a certain reorganization or consolidation actions. Requires such notification to include: (1) a statement which sets forth in detail the factors taken into account in making the decision to take such action; and (2) an analysis of the community impact of such action. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to eliminate a statute of limitation on bringing certain negligence actions under such Act. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize appropriations for the Office of the United States Trade Representative for FY 1986."
