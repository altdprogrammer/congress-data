    "text": "Nuclear Powerplant Licensing and Standardization Act of 1985 - Title I: Siting and Licensing - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require that construction licenses for the construction or modification of production or utilization facilities for nuclear material be initially granted after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has provided an opportunity for a public hearing and if the permit application is otherwise acceptable. Requires the NRC to issue an operating license to an applicant upon completion of the construction or modification (after the application has been updated, if appropriate) and upon a finding that the facility authorized will operate according to the application and NRC regulations. Directs the NRC to issue a combined construction permit and operating license for a thermal neutron power generation facility after an opportunity for a hearing has been provided. Requires the NRC, prior to the start of operation of such facility, to publish notice of intended operation and to provide a 30-day period during which a written objection to such operation may be filed, accompanied by a request for a hearing. Sets forth conditions under which such hearing may be held. Prohibits the NRC from modifying a final determination on an issue made in a permit or license proceeding unless it determines, based on significant new information, that a modification is required to protect and enhance the public safety or common defense and security. Authorizes the NRC to issue, for a ten-year term, a site permit for approval of a site for one or more production or utilization facilities prior to the filing of an application for a construction permit or a combined construction permit and operating license for such facilities. Permits a renewal of a site permit upon application by the holder. Directs the NRC to establish procedures permitting the approval of standardized facility designs for thermal neutron power generation facilities prior to the filing of an application for a construction permit or a combined construction permit and operating license for such facilities. Provides that no application filing or issuance fees shall be required for a design approval or an amendment or renewal of a design approval. Requires the NRC to issue a design approval if it is not inimical to the common defense and security or to the public health and safety. Allows a renewal of an approval upon application by the holder. Requires the NRC to approve amendments to a design approval if they comply with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and NRC regulations. Permits the inclusion of a request for a variance from one or more elements of a design approval in any application for a construction permit, an operating license, or a combined construction permit and operating license. Requires the NRC to grant such a variance if it complies with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and NRC regulations. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Defines the terms, \"thermal neutron power generation facility\" and \"standardized design\" for purposes of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Requires the NRC to establish procedures and criteria to implement this Act. Title III: Conforming Amendments - Sets forth conforming amendments. Title IV: Effective Date - Makes this Act effective upon the date of enactment."
