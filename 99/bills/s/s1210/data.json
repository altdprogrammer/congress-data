    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Labor and Human Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 99-117) Public Health Service Act Medical Education Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a registry of teaching hospitals. Provides that such hospitals shall be required to comply with regulations establishing: (1) a minimum percentage of graduate medical education positions in primary care specialties; and (2) the maximum number of graduate medical education positions to be filled by graduates of foreign medical schools. Directs the Council on Graduate Medical Education (established by this Act) to recommend to the Secretary a national target for primary care specialties for a four-fiscal-year period. Requires the Secretary to establish by regulation the minimum percentage recommended by the Council, or remand such recommendations to the Council. Requires the establishment of such minimum percentages every four years. Specifies the types of positions which are considered primary care specialties. Excludes specified positions from being considered graduate medical education positions. Permits the Secretary to waive the applicability of such minimum percentages if the State department of health applies for such a waiver. Requires that at least 75 percent of all graduate medical education positions in each specialty area of a registered hospital be held by graduates of: (1) schools of medicine accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education; or (2) schools of osteopathy accredited by the Committee on Postdoctoral Training of the American Osteopathic Association. Sets conditions for positions for U.S. or alien graduates of foreign medical schools. Establishes a Council on Graduate Medical Education to advise the Secretary on current and future needs for physicians to practice in primary care specialties."
