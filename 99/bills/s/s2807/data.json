    "text": "Independent Safety Board Act Amendments of 1986 - Amends the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to repeal the requirement that the National Transportation Safety Board publish notice of the issuance and availability of its accident reports in the Federal Register. Authorizes the Board to require payment from governmental entities for the reasonable cost of goods and services supplied, and to apply the funds received to the Board's appropriations. Empowers the Board to conduct schools for the training of Board employees, and to authorize attendance at such schools by U.S. and foreign government personnel as well as transportation industry personnel. Prohibits the Board, except in specified circumstances, from disclosing records or information relating to its participation in foreign aircraft accident investigations. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1989. Authorizes an emergency fund for use by the Board to cover necessary expenses (not otherwise provided for) for accident investigations. Amends the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 to allow airports that receive funds under a certain airport improvement program to use a portion of such funds in FY 1987 for liability insurance premium payments that are attributable solely to airport development and air navigation facilities. Sets guidelines for the obligation of such funds."
