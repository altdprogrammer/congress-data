    "text": "Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the United States to receive and determine the validity of claims of U.S. nationals against Romania for losses sustained because of the failure or refusal of Romania to allow such nationals to exercise their valid inheritance rights in or to property located in Romania, to transfer such property from Romania, or to compensate such nationals for the nationalization, expropriation, or other taking of such inherited property. Sets forth the requirements for the Commission to use in determining the validity and amount of any such claim. Provides for publication of the necessity of filing claims. Requires the Commission to adjudicate a claim within 180 days of the date of its filing. Requires the Secretary of State to deliver copies of such decisions to Romania. Requires the Commission to file an interim report (by July 15, 1986) and a final report (within 30 days of certification of all awards to the Secretary of State) with the President and specified congressional committees concerning the claims and awards against Romania. Authorizes appropriations."
