    "text": "Water Resources Development Act of 1985 - Title I - Directs the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to obligate no sums in excess of those specified in this title for the combined purpose of the \"Construction General\" account and the \"Flood Control, Mississippi River and Tributaries\" account. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990. Title II: General Provisions - Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements with landowners who are benefitted by local flood control projects to assure that such owners will contribute 50 percent of that project's cost. Limits the commencement period for any such flood control project to ten years from the date of authorization of such project unless the Secretary shows that such project remains needed and justified. Allows for the submission of Federal projects with a cost of up to $10,000,000 provided, however, that any project with a cost exceeding $10,000,000 must be authorized by Act of Congress. Provides further that each such project must contain benefits directly related to agriculture that account for at least 20 percent of the total benefits of the project. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to study and report to the appropriate congressional committees on the feasibility of requiring full public access to all water impoundment facilities that have recreation-related potential.

Provides that the Secretary shall not require non-Federal interests to assume operation of any federally-run facility as a condition to the construction of new recreational facilities. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with area Federal Project Repayment Districts for the recovery of appropriate shares of project costs. Requires the Secretary to determine that revenues derived from such contracts will be sufficient to meet cost recovery requirements under Federal law. Expresses the sense of the Congress that all parties to various lawsuits concerning the issuance of Federal permits necessary for the construction of a coal slurry pipeline development which would use Missouri River water should work to resolve such issues in an expeditious and reasonable manner. Prohibits the Secretary from initiating construction of any water resources project if such project has been modified to increase any of the following project parameters by more than 25 percent: (1) acreage of land acquisition; (2) linear miles of stream channel innundated; (3) width or depth of any navigation channel; (4) displacement of dwelling units; (5) hydroelectric generating capacity; or (6) linear miles of stream channelization. Directs the Secretary to submit to the Congress, within 180 days of proposal, a report on any such project modification together with his recommendations thereon. Amends the Water Resources Research Act to establish the High Plains Study Council to: (1) review research work conducted by State advisory committees; and (2) coordinate such research to avoid duplication of efforts by States of the High Plains. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish within each State of the High Plains region an Ogallala Aquifer technical advisory committee (the State Committee). Directs such State Committee to: (1) review existing State laws concerning water management and recommend appropriate changes; (2) establish State priorities for water resources research and demonstration projects; and (3) provide information and technical assistance concerning the need for water conservation and management. Directs the Secretary to allocate annually funds to States of the High Plains region for research in water-use efficiency, cultural methods, irrigation technologies, water-efficient crops, and water and soil conservation. Directs that such funds shall be distributed to State institutions of higher learning on the basis of merit. Directs the Secretary to divide funds among the States of the High Plains region for research into: (1) precipitation management; (2) weather modification; (3) aquifer recharge opportunities; (4) saline water uses; (5) desalinization technologies; (6) salt-tolerant crops; and (7) local water-transfer opportunities. Directs the Secretary to allocate annually funds to High Plains region States for grants to farmers for demonstration projects in: (1) water-efficient irrigation technologies and practices; (2) soil and water conservation management systems; and (3) the growth and marketing of more water-efficient crops. Provides that such grants to farmers shall be made on the basis of merit. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to study the feasibility of water transfers into the High Plains Region, and report annually to the Congress. Authorizes the Secretary to monitor the levels of the Ogallala Aquifer, and to report annually to the Congress. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to make grants to States for programs in water conservation and nonstructural flood control alternatives. Outlines the qualifications for States receiving such grants. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on this program by October 1, 1988. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a study of shoreline protection and beach erosion control policy in view of the prospect for long-term increases in the level of the ocean. Requires the Secretary, within three years of the date of enactment of this Act, to transmit the study together with recommendations to the appropriate congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to require a review of the cost effectiveness of design of each water resources project which has a cost in excess of $10,000,000. Requires the Secretary to prepare a feasibility report for each such project being reviewed, after conducting a reconnaissance of the water resources problems, in order to identify potential solutions. Requires such reconnaissance to be limited to 18 months. Requires non-Federal interests to contribute 50 percent of the cost of any such study. Requires the mitigation of fish and wildlife losses to be undertaken before construction on the project involved begins. Authorizes the Secretary to mitigate damages to fish and wildlife to the extent that such mitigation costs do not exceed $7,500,000 per project. Requires a report to the Congress when mitigation costs are expected to exceed $7,500,000 per project. Requires the Secretary to submit with each proposal for the authorization of a water resources project, either: (1) a recommendation with a specific plan to mitigate fish and wildlife losses; or (2) a determination that such project will have negligible adverse impact on fish and wildlife. Directs that when the Secretary recommends activities to enhance fish and wildlife resources, the cost of such enhancement shall be a Federal cost when its benefits are determined to be national in character. Authorizes the Secretary to plan, design, and construct streambank erosion control projects not specifically authorized by Congress when such work is economically feasible and environmentally acceptable. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years beginning with FY 1985. Prohibits the cost of any single project in this section from exceeding $2,000,000. Title III: Project Provisions - Directs the Secretary to undertake the following flood control improvement projects: (1) Warrior River, Mound State Park, Moundville, Alabama; (2) Fort Toulouse National Historic Landmark and Taskigi Indian Mound, Alabama; and (3) Tangier Island, Virginia.
