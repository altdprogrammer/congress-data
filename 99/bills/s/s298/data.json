States that any civil action under the antitrust laws to challenge a league decision permitting a team to relocate may not be brought in a Federal district court in the district where the team is located or where it proposes to relocate. States that nothing contained in this Act shall apply to any: (1) labor-management or collective bargaining matter; (2) pay television or other broadcasting issue; (3) agreement to fix admission prices; or (4) any conduct with respect to a competing sports league. Prohibits any State or political subdivision from imposing any limitation on professional team sports leagues or their clubs which is otherwise authorized by this Act."
