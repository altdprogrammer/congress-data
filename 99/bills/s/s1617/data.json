Rept. 99-508) Amends provisions regarding actions to quiet title in real property to which the United States claims an interest to prohibit the use of preliminary injunctions. Establishes a 12-year statute of limitations for State claims against lands being used or required by the United States for national defense purposes or upon which the United States or its lessee has made substantial improvements or conducted substantial activities according to a management plan. States that if a State's title prevails in an action brought after more than 12 years involving submerged or tide lands where the United States or its lessee has made substantial improvements, then the State's title is subject to existing leases, easements, or rights-of-way. Requires States to provide 180 days' notice to the appropriate Federal agency before a suit is filed under these provisions."
