Requires the foreign market value of merchandise to be the trade-weighted average price at which the merchandise or similar merchandise produced by eligible market economy producers is sold in the United States if: (1) the merchandise under investigation is exported from a nonmarket economy country; and (2) the administering authority finds that the foreign market value of the merchandise cannot be accurately determined under the usual method because information provided by such country is not verifiable or is insufficient. Requires the foreign market value, if a trade-weighted average price is not available, to be the price at which the merchandise or similar merchandise produced by an eligible market economy producers is sold in the United States. Requires the foreign market value, if there are no eligible market economy producers, to be the constructed value of the merchandise or similar merchandise produced in any country other than a nonmarket economy country. Defines \"nonmarket economy country\" generally to be a country which appears on a list prepared annually by the administering authority who designates such countries. Defines an \"eligible market economy producer\" to be a foreign producer who: (1) produces merchandise that is the subject of a dumping investigation or any similar merchandise in a country that is not a nonmarket economy country; (2) exports the merchandise or similar merchandise to the United States; and (3) is not subject to an antidumping or countervailing duty order against the merchandise or similar merchandise."
