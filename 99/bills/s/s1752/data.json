Requires the Secretary to acquire the gold for such coins by purchase only from natural deposits in the United States or a U.S. territory or possession or from U.S. reserves. Repeals a provision prohibiting the Government from delivering any gold coin. Requires any profit from the sale of such coins to be deposited in the Treasury and applied toward reducing the national debt. Directs the Secretary to ensure that the issuance of such coins results in no net cost to the Government. Title II: Gold Medals - Authorizes the President, on behalf of the Congress, to present gold medals to Jan Scruggs, Robert Doubek, and Jack Wheeler in recognition of their efforts to give the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to the Nation. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to provide for the sale of bronze duplicates of the medal."
