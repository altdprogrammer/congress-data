    "text": "Dependent Care Development Reauthorization Act of 1986 - Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (the Act) to extend through FY 1989 the authorization of appropriations for grants to States for planning and development of dependent care programs. Makes the inclusion of specified types of information in dependent care resource and referral systems optional rather than mandatory. Requires States to assure that: (1) no such information will be provided with respect to any dependent care services which do not comply with State and local laws; and (2) the information will be the latest available and kept up to date. Provides that certain funds may be used for school-age child care services before and after school in community centers whether or not school facilities are available for such purpose. Redefines \"school-age children\" to include those younger than five in States where such children are provided a free public education. Entitles such dependent care program provisions of the Act as the \"State Dependent Care Grants Act.\""
