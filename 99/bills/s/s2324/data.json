    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 4116 passed in lieu) Domestic Volunteer Service Act Amendments of 1986 - Amends the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (the Act) to set forth a volunteerism policy for ACTION, the Federal domestic volunteer agency. Establishes a VISTA Literacy Corps to expand efforts to address the problem of illiteracy. Provides for assignment of volunteers to projects and programs that provide assistance to functionally illiterate and illiterate individuals who are unserved or underserved by existing literacy education programs, with special emphasis upon disadvantaged individuals having the highest risk of illiteracy, and individuals with the lowest reading and educational level of competence. Sets forth priorities for such programs and projects. Provides that the Literacy Corps shall consist of all VISTA volunteers who are working on literacy projects and programs. Revises provisions for Foster Grandparent Programs and for the Senior Companion Program to allow individuals who are not low-income persons to serve as nonstipend volunteers in such programs under specified conditions. Authorizes the ACTION Director (the Director) to: (1) accept in the name of ACTION funds received through solicitation of profit and nonprofit entities; and (2) employ or dispose of such funds for purposes of the Act. Requires that all such funds become part of the gift fund account of ACTION. Requires the Director to assure that a majority of the aggregate amount in each fiscal year of all unrestricted gifts to ACTION will be spent to support volunteer projects at the community level. Establishes in ACTION a National Voluntary Service Advisory Council to: (1) advise the Director with respect to policy matters arising in the administration of the Act; and (2) at the Director's request, review the effectiveness and operation of programs under the Act and make appropriate recommendations. Requires that each program under the Act be evaluated at least once every four years. Requires the ACTION Director to evaluate and report to the Congress by December 31, 1989, on the impact of ACTION Agency programs relating to services that assist families caring for frail and disabled adult family members. Extends through FY 1989 the authorization of appropriations for the following National Volunteer Antipoverty Programs: (1) Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) (with a separate authorization of appropriations for the VISTA Literacy Corps); (2) service-learning programs; and (3) special volunteer programs. Requires that, from national volunteer antipoverty program funding for FY 1987 through 1989, amounts be first made available as are necessary to provide specified minimum amounts of VISTA volunteer service years. Extends through FY 1989 the authorization of appropriations for the following National Older American Volunteer Programs: (1) Retired Senior Volunteer Program; (2) Foster Grandparent Program; and (3) Senior Companion Program. Extends through FY 1989 the authorization of appropriations for administration and coordination under the Act."
