    "text": "Antiterrorism Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish a new Federal offense of terrorism. Defines terrorism as activity that involves violent or dangerous acts in violation of any criminal law with the intent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence a government by intimidation or coercion, or affect the conduct of a government by assassination or kidnapping. Makes it a criminal offense to commit, attempt, or threaten to commit an act of terrorism. Increases the penalties for a second or subsequent conviction under this section. Imposes the death penalty if a death of any person results from the act of terrorism and certain sentencing procedures are met. Urges the Federal Bureau of Investigation to defer the investigations of violations of this Act to the appropriate Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency, unless requested by such agency to assume full responsibility for directing the investigation. Requires the Bureau to assume direction of the investigation if so requested."
