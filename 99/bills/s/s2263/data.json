    "text": "International Communication and Travel Act of 1986 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to repeal the provisions excluding aliens from U.S. entry on speech- or politics-related grounds. Prohibits deportation, visa or passport denial, or the placing of restrictions on a visa based on activities that would be protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution if otherwise conducted by a U.S. citizen. Permits a U.S. citizen to go to court if denied the opportunity to communicate with an alien visitor because of such speech-based restrictions. Amends the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 to repeal the provision prohibiting the issuance of passports to members of Communist organizations. Amends the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to state that the President's international emergency authority does not include regulatory authority over: (1) transactions ordinarily incident to foreign travel, including the payment of living expenses; or (2) transactions ordinarily incident to the importation of foreign informational material. Makes similar amendments to the Trading with the Enemy Act. Amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 to replace the term \"political propaganda\" with the term \"advocacy material.\" Reduces specified related reporting requirements. Amends the Arms Export Control Act to state that decisions on issuing export licenses for defense articles shall take into account the policy of the United States to sustain scientific enterprise and scholarly exchanges. Amends Federal law to state that in implementing the Agreement for Facilitating the International Circulation of Visual and Auditory Materials of an Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Character, material shall not fail to qualify (for such program) simply because it advocates a particular position or viewpoint."
