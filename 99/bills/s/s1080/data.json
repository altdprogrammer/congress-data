    "as": "Passed House amended",

    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 1985 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation, within 30 days of enactment of this Act, to issue a final rule or regulation to ensure the prevention of alcohol and drug use in railroad operations. Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 to direct the Secretary, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, to issue such rules, regulations, orders, and standards as necessary to: (1) ensure the safe maintenance, inspection, and testing of signal systems at rail-highway crossings; and (2) define qualification standards for employees who conduct railroad power brake and freight car inspections. Requires an inquiry into whether training standards are necessary for train dispatchers, with a report to the Congress, along with recommendations, if any. Requires the National Railroad Adjustment Board to resolve any dispute, grievance, or claim within 180 days after its filing with such Board. Authorizes the Board to award an aggrieved employee compensation equivalent to one year's pay, if the violation is a certain form of discrimination. Prohibits the Secretary from disclosing the name of any railroad employee who has provided information regarding alleged violations of railroad safety law. Exempts from this proscription disclosures made to the Attorney General for enforcement purposes. Authorizes a railroad employee to commence a civil action to compel the Secretary to perform an act related to enforcement under the Federal railroad safety laws, if such act is not discretionary, and if the failure to perform such act creates a danger of serious injury or death to such employee. Requires such action to be brought in the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia, or the U.S. district court for the judicial district where the alleged violation occurred. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 and 1987 for: (1) Federal railroad safety provisions; (2) State safety programs; (3) research and development activities; and (4) rail planning for Toledo, Ohio. Directs the Secretary to evaluate the employee assistance program related to drug and alcohol abuse operated by the Consolidated Rail Corporation and report to the Congress on its effectiveness. Directs the Secretary to encourage the establishment of a private, nonprofit corporation, financially supported by individual railroad employees and companies, to support and promote specified items relating to alcohol and drug abuse assistance. Authorizes the Secretary to provide certain materials and office space if such corporation is established within 90 days after enactment of this Act. Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 to authorize the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) or any facility owner to petition the Secretary for assistance to eliminate dangers posed by unsafe facilities to the property, passengers or employees or Amtrak. Defines conditions under which the Secretary must recommend that the Congress authorize funding for relocation or other remedial measures concerning such unsafe facilities. Requires the Secretary to continue financial assistance for facilities rehabilitation and improvement under specified law until September 30, 1987."
