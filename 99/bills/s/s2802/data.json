Sets forth the type of governmental actions that would be considered to be adequate steps to prevent the laundering of drug-related monies. Requires the annual report to the Congress on efforts to reduce drug trafficking to identify countries that are centers of drug-money laundering operations and contain plans and timetables for preventing and punishing such activities and a discussion of the adequacy of the measures taken in accordance with such plans."
