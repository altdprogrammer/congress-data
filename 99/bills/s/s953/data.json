Rept. 99-662 (Part I)) Amends the Federal Power Act to prohibit the assessment of any charges for the use of any Federal dam or structure by a power plant licensee if such licensee entered into a Federal contract before January 1, 1985, which meets the following requirements: (1) the contract covers one or more projects for which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a license before January 1, 1985; (2) the contract specifically provides that the licensee may build a power plant using federally constructed irrigation facilities; (3) the contract specifically provides that the licensee retains exclusive control, possession and ownership of the power plant; and (4) the contract specifically provides that all revenues from the power plant and disposition of electric energy from such plant remain the property of the licensee. Applies this prohibition against assessment only to projects covered by the contract and only during the term of such contract."
