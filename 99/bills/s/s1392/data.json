    "text": "Judicial Survivors' Annuities Reform Act of 1985 - Amends the Judicial Code to increase the amount that a judicial official has withheld from his or her salary for purposes of the Judicial Survivors' Annuities Fund. Requires that there shall also be deposited in the fund amounts required to maintain the actuarial balance of the program as such amounts are actuarially determined on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950. Increases the amount of the annuity received by a surviving widow or widower with children. Increases the amount of the annuity received by the surviving children of a judicial official leaving no widow or widower. Revises the formula used to determine the amount of the annuity given a widow or widower of a judicial official. Makes a widow or widower eligible for survivors benefits unless they remarry prior to age 60. Makes the benefits conferred by this Act immediately available to any eligible person. Provides that nothing shall be interpreted to cancel, abrogate, or diminish any rights to which an individual or his or her survivors may be entitled by virtue of such individual's having contributed to the judicial survivors annuity fund before the effective date of this Act. Permits a judicial officer who has participated in the present annuity program to withdraw, in writing, according to specified procedures. Allows such officer to subsequently join the judicial survivors annuities program created by this Act."
