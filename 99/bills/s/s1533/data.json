Grants the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) the responsibility for investigating, upon request, the effects of imports on national security. Requires the USTR to take certain actions if the Secretary finds that such imports threaten national security and the Secretary of Defense concurs in such finding. Requires the Secretary's report to the President on such investigation to include a statement by the Secretary of Defense concurring or disagreeing with the Secretary's findings and explaining such concurrence or disagreement. Requires the report to be published unless publication would clearly be detrimental to the national security. Requires the USTR to decide whether or not to take action based on such report within 90 days of receiving it. Sets forth the actions the USTR may take to limit such imports. Requires the USTR to explain the decision to take action or not to take action on the report submitted to the President by the Secretary."
