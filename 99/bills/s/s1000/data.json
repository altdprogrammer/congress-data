    "text": "Agricultural Resource Conservation Act of 1985 - Title I: Conservation Policy and Definitions - States that the Congress reaffirms U.S. policy to promote soil and water conservation, to improve water quality, and to preserve and protect natural resources through the use of effective conservation and pollution abatement programs. Title II: Conservation Acreage Reserve Program - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish during the 1986 through 1996 crop years a long-term conservation acreage reserve program to convert erosion-prone cropland to less intensive uses. Provides with regard to such program: (1) that the Secretary shall control program acreage so as not to adversely affect local communities; (2) the farmer or rancher shall establish approved vegetative cover on such land; (3) individual annual payments shall not exceed $50,000; (4) the Secretary shall make an annual payment and a conservation payment to participants based on bids; (5) at least ten percent of program funds shall be used for farmers and ranchers who agree to plant trees as the required vegetative cover; and (6) that the Secretary may modify a contract after providing the appropriate congressional committees with 90-day notice. Title III: Highly Erodible Land Conservation - Makes any person who cultivates crops on highly erodible land ineligible for: (1) price supports or payments; (2) farm storage facility loans; (3) crop insurance; (4) disaster payments; or (5) specified other agricultural loans. Exempts crops planted: (1) on land cultivated from 1973 through 1985; (2) before enactment of this Act; (3) under specified conservation systems; or (4) in reliance on a Soil Conservation Service determination that such land was not highly erodible. Requires anyone cultivating wheat, feed grains, rice, or cotton on highly erodible land to use appropriate conservation practices in order to qualify for price support payments. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Secretary to issue regulations to assure that acreage set aside for conservation uses is adequately protected from wind and water erosion. Authorizes appropriations as necessary for Commodity Credit Corporation reimbursement."
