Directs the President to establish de minimis levels for such substances. Requires the owners or operators of facilities with sufficient quantities of such substances to pose a threat if released to notify the Governor of the facility's State of such fact. Requires the Governor to designate emergency planning districts with emergency planning committees to evaluate the resources necessary to an emergency plan which identifies such facilities, substance transportation routes, emergency notification procedures and personnel and a response and evacuation plan. Requires local official and facility representation at such planning process. Directs the National Response Team to publish guidelines for emergency plans. Directs Regional Response Teams to review plans at the request of the emergency planning committee. Establishes civil penalties for violations of such requirements by facility owners or operators. Requires such owners or operators to immediately provide notice of a threatening release to the appropriate emergency official in a potentially affected area, including all pertinent information about the nature and extent of the release and possible hazards posed, updating such information as necessary. Establishes criminal penalties for violations of such requirements. Requires each covered owner or operator to file a material safety data sheet for each hazardous chemical with the emergency planning committee in the facility's area. Requires that such information be updated and made available to the public. Permits State or local governments to require additional or more stringent information reporting. Establishes civil penalties for violations."
