    "date": "1986-08-09", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended (Inserted Text of Division C of S. 2638 as passed Senate)) National Security Programs Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987 - Title I: National Security Programs - Authorizes appropriations for the Department of Energy (DOE) for FY 1987 for plant and capital equipment and operating expenses in carrying out national security programs in the following areas: (1) weapons activities; (2) materials production; (3) defense waste and byproducts management; (4) verification and control technology; (5) nuclear safeguards and security; (6) security investigations; and (7) naval reactors development. Limits the total amount authorized to be appropriated to DOE in this Act for national security programs. Requires the Secretary of Energy to reduce the amounts of the above projects in order to achieve a specified reduction. Limits to a specified sum the amount of appropriated funds available for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program. Earmarks certain funds for research on conventional munitions. Title II: General Provisions - Part A: Recurring General Provisions - Prohibits the use of funds authorized under this Act where the costs of the program exceed 105 percent of the program authorization or the costs exceed by more than $10,000,000 the amount authorized by this Act, whichever is the lesser. Prohibits the use of funds for any program which has not been presented to or requested of the Congress, unless the Secretary of Energy transmits to the appropriate committees a full and complete statement of the action proposed and 30 days have passed since receipt of such statement. Limits the funds available for general plant construction projects under this Act. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress if the revised cost of any such project exceeds $1,200,000. Provides that when the cost of any project in support of national security programs under this or any previous Act exceeds by more than 25 percent the authorized amount or the total estimated cost of such project, construction may not begin on such project until 30 days have passed since the Secretary has provided the appropriate committees of the Congress a full and complete statement concerning such cost increase. Exempts from such requirement those projects having a current estimated cost of less than $5,000,000. Authorizes the transfer of funds between agencies for the performance of similar functions. Authorizes the Secretary, in appropriate cases, to perform construction planning and design using funds available for any DOE national security program construction project. Allows funds available for management and support activities and for general plant projects to be made available in connection with all DOE national security programs. Authorizes funds appropriated for operating expenses or for plant and capital equipment to remain available until expended. Part B: Miscellaneous Provision - Prohibits funds appropriated in this or any other Act from being used for the payment of any fines or penalties for any failure by DOE to comply with any environmental requirement in connection with any defense activity or defense-related facility in excess of amounts specifically appropriated to DOE to comply with such requirements. Amends general military law to establish in the Department of Defense a Joint Nuclear Weapons Council (the Council). Outlines responsibilities of the Council relating to the design, research, and development of nuclear weapons. Directs the Council, no later than March 1, 1987, to report to the Senate and House Committees on Armed Services and on Appropriations on actions taken by the Department of Defense and DOE to implement the recommendations of the President's Blue Ribbon Task Group on Nuclear Weapons Program Management. Requires the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to serve on the Council if there is no Vice Chairman of JCS to so serve. Repeals Federal law which established the Military Liaison Committee. Directs the Secretary of Energy to report to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees concerning the construction of containment facilities for nuclear reactors of DOE. Extends through June 30, 1996, the authority of the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to enter into certain governmental assistance contracts with the Los Alamos, New Mexico, School Board."
