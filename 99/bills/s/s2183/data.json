    "text": "Alzheimer's Disease Research and Assistance Act of 1986 - Directs the National Institute on Aging to develop and encourage partnerships for research in: (1) the etiology, diagnosis, clinical course, treatment, and epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease; (2) the psychological and social functioning of patients with Alzheimer's disease; and (3) methods of raising or sustaining the quality of life for patients with Alzheimer's disease. Directs the National Institute on Aging to establish a scientific and medical advisory panel on Alzheimer's disease to facilitate such partnerships. Directs the National Center for Health Statistics, in cooperation with the National Institute on Aging, to collect medical information necessary to: (1) diagnose and evaluate individuals with Alzheimer's disease; and (2) develop a national data base concerning Alzheimer's disease. Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health to establish five additional Alzheimer's disease research centers. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987. Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to authorize the development of programs to assist victims of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders in meeting their day-to-day needs. Directs the National Institute on Aging to conduct research in methods of financing systems of providing long-term care to victims of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Requires the National Institute on Aging to report to the Congress on the results of such research. Directs the National Institute on Aging to develop a data base on needs for long-term care, and on costs of alternative funding. Requires the Commissioner of the Administration on Aging to direct area agencies on aging to maintain registries for various medical and community services. Provides that no skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility which receives payments under title XVIII (Medicare) or under a State plan approved under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act may discriminate in the acceptance or refusal of patients on the grounds that an individual is eligible for Medicaid or suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Requires such facilities to include a functional assessment of the Alzheimer's patient in the initial admission evaluation. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Congress with respect to implementation of this section. Directs the Secretary to establish mechanisms for: (1) the dissemination of information and guidelines relating to Alzheimer's disease; and (2) training for persons involved in the Social Security Administration's disability determination process. Directs the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute on Mental Health to develop and disseminate curricula for the training of personnel who provide health services to Alzheimer's disease patients. Directs the National Institute on Aging to develop and implement programs to train providers of clinical care services and families of patients with Alzheimer's disease to care for such patients. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop and implement programs to train personnel who provide long-term care services to patients with Alzheimer's disease; (2) make grants to schools of medicine to train physicians and other health care personnel who provide care to Alzheimer patients who reside in nursing homes; (3) conduct training programs on Alzheimer's disease for safety and transportation personnel; (4) conduct training programs for medical examiners, coroners, and pathologists in the proper conduct of an autopsy to determine whether Alzheimer's disease was a factor contributing to a death; and (5) promulgate regulations to encourage medical examiners, coroners, and pathologists to provide reports concerning the findings of autopsies in which Alzheimer's disease contributed to the death. Authorizes appropriations."
