    "text": "Raw Sewage Abatement Act of 1985 - Imposes a cap on raw sewage discharges from the drainage areas of the North River plant, Manhattan, New York, and the Red Hood Plant, Brooklyn, New York, into navigable waters (the Hudson-Raritan Estuary) if New York City fails to meet the deadlines for achieving advanced preliminary treatment contained in the consent decree of December 30, 1982 (August 1, 1986, for the North River plant; August 1, 1987, for the Red Hook plant). Permits the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to raise such cap for seasonal variation or so-called acts of God. States that violations of this Act shall be considered violations of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the Clean Water Act) as well as of the consent decree. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Administrator should not agree to any further modification of the advanced preliminary treatment schedule in the consent decree. Directs the Administrator to work with New York City, implement monitoring activities for both plants, and commence enforcement actions in the event of unexcused violations."
