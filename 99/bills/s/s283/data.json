    "text": "Acid Deposition Control Act - Amends the Clean Air Act to establish an interstate transport and acid precursor reduction program. Designates an acid deposition impact region comprising a long-range transport corridor of 31 States east of the Mississippi and the District of Columbia. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to report to the Congress within two years on a study of long-range transport of pollutants problems in the remaining States. Prohibits the increase of emissions of sulfur dioxide and of oxides of nitrogen from stationary sources in the acid deposition impact region over total actual emissions there as of January 1, 1981. Sets forth sulfur dioxide emmission reduction standards for the acid deposition impact region of ten million tons below 1980 levels by the beginning of 1994. Requires each impact region State to reduce its emissions proportionately to its share of the region's total excess emissions, permitting States to reallot reductions among themselves so long as the total reductions of the States invovled meet the required standards. Requires each State to adopt enforceable emission reduction measures for sulfur dioxide, including compliance schedules, within two years. Requires the Administrator's approval and the other Governors' perusal of such measures. Requires each major stationary source subject to an emission limitation to notify the Governor of the State, and in turn, the Administrator, within four years of its intended method of compliance. Requires sources choosing fuel substitution to be in compliance with applicable emission limitations within six years. Requires those sources complying through the installation of a technological system of continuous emission reduction or the replacement of facilities to have entered into binding contracts for such system or replacement facilities within six years. Requires owners of major stationary sources of sulfur dioxide emissions to submit to the Administrator a compliance plan and schedule if their State has not done so. Provides that failure to do so constitutes a violation of emission limitations under the Clean Air Act. Permits the use of the following measures to reduce emissions in addition to enforceable continuous emission reduction measures if such measures are enforceable by entities and persons other than the State in which the emissions occur: (1) least emissions dispatch to meet electric generating demand at existing generating capacity; (2) retirement of major stationary sources at an earlier than provided for date; (3) investments in energy conservation where emission reductions can be identified with such investments; (4) trading of emission reduction requirements and actual reductions through emission reduction banks or brokerage institutions; and (5) precombustion cleaning of fuels. Permits a State or the owner or operator of a source required to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions to substitute oxides of nitrogen reductions at a rate of two for one out measure by weight. Makes it a violation of the Clear Air Act to emit an air pollutant which adversely affects the public health or welfare of another State or foreign country."
