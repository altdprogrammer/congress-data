    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation with amendment, S. Rept. 99-501) National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, 1987 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for specified activities relating to: (1) research and development; (2) space flight, control and data communications; (3) construction of facilities; and (4) research and program management. Permits appropriations for research and development and for space flight, control and data communications, to be used: (1) for any items of a capital nature (other than acquisition of land) which may be required at locations other than NASA installations for the performance of research and development contracts; and (2) for grants to nonprofit institutions of higher education, or to nonprofit organizations whose primary purpose is the conduct of scientific research, for purchase or construction of additional research facilities. Requires the Administrator of NASA (the Administrator) to notify specified congressional officers and committees whenever the cost of a facility exceeds a specified amount. Permits funds appropriated for research and development, for space flight, control and data communications, or for construction of facilities to remain available without fiscal year limitation. Permits appropriations for research and program management to be used for scientific consultations or extraordinary expenses upon the approval of the Administrator. Limits to not more than $100,000 per project (including collateral equipment) the amount that may be used for construction of new facilities and additions to existing facilities, and for repair, rehabilitation, or modification of facilities, from funds appropriated for research and development, for space flight, control and data communications, and for research and program management. Limits to not more than $500,000 per project (including collateral equipment) the amount that may be used for any of the foregoing for unforeseen programmatic needs, from funds appropriated for research and development and for space flight, control and data communications. Permits the funds for construction of any of specified facilities: (1) in the discretion of the Administrator, to be varied upward ten percent; or (2) following a report by the Administrator to specified congressional committees, to be varied upward 25 percent to meet unusual cost variations. Permits one-half of one percent of the funds appropriated for research and development or for space flight, control and data communications, to be transferred to the appropriation for construction of facilities. Authorizes the expenditure of such transferred funds, together with a specified amount of the funds appropriated for construction of facilities, to construct, expand, or modify laboratories and other installations. Requires the Administrator, 30 days before expending such funds, to notify specified congressional officers and committees of the nature, cost, and necessity of such construction. Prohibits, until 30 days pass after congressional receipt of a full explanation by the Administrator, the use of funds appropriated pursuant to this Act for any program: (1) deleted by the Congress; (2) in excess of the amount actually authorized for the particular program under provisions for research and development, space flight, control and data communications, and research and program management; or (3) which has not been presented to either of the specified congressional committees. Prohibits any civil space station authorized under this Act from being used to: (1) carry or place in orbit any nuclear weapon or any other weapon of mass destruction; (2) install any such weapon on any celestial body; or (3) station any such weapon in space in any other manner. Requires that such civil space station be used only for peaceful purposes. Declares that it is the sense of the Congress that it is in the national interest that consideration be given to geographical distribution of Federal research funds whenever feasible, and that NASA should explore ways of doing so. Amends the Commercial Space Launch Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1987 to the Secretary of Transportation to carry out such Act (which provides for licensing and liability insurance requirements for commercial space launches). Directs the Administrator to: (1) review the proposed space agenda submitted by the National Commission on Space; and (2) recommend by March 1, 1987, to the appropriate congressional committees a long-range plan to implement such agenda, including a specific agenda for the five-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes NASA to undertake construction of a fourth space shuttle orbiter in FY 1987 if: (1) the President determines that such construction is in the national interest; and (2) sums are appropriated for such construction which are in addition to sums made available pursuant to this Act. Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to revise provisions relating to the National Aeronautics and Space Council. Adds the Secretary of Commerce as a member of such Council. Directs NASA to include as a separate line item in its annual budget submitted by the President the estimated expenditures and proposed appropriations necessary to carry out its functions relating to quality assurance, reliability, and safety. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Senate not consider any bill, resolution, or amendment which would have the effect of depleting the cash balance retained by Conrail after the sale of the interest of the United States in Conrail common stock until the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reviews such bill, resolution, or amendment to determine if it would adversely affect U.S. ability to effectuate such sale or reduce U.S. proceeds from such sale."
