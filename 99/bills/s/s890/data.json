    "text": "Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to authorize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to require that applicants for or holders of a production facility license or a utilization facility license implement a fingerprinting program for individuals who are allowed unescorted access to designated areas of such facilities. Requires such fingerprints to be submitted to the Attorney General of the United States. States that such license holders or applicants may receive from the Attorney General the results of the fingerprint investigation except for arrest data more than one year old and not accompanied by dispositions. Authorizes the Commission to prescribe by regulation the conditions under which the information received from the Attorney General may be used, and to limit the redissemination of such information."
