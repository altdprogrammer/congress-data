Requires the Secretary to conduct a referendum of wheat producers by August 1, 1987 (currently August 1, 1986). Limits eligibility to producers with at least a 40-acre base. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949, effective for the 1986 through 1990 wheat crops, to set loans and purchases at the higher of 70 percent of parity or $4.65 per bushel."
