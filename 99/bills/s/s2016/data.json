Sets forth formulas for the determination of the amount of money to which a candidate is entitled. Sets spending limits for candidates receiving payments under this Act.

Authorizes the Federal Election Commission to institute repayment actions in U.S. district courts. Specifies the administrative authority of the Commission in carrying out this Act. Requires the Commission to make certain reports to the Senate. Directs the Commission to conduct thorough audits after each Federal election of all candidates receiving payments under the Act.
