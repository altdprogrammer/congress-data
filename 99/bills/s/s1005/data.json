Requires that such determination be based on a weighted average if the same wage is not paid to at least 50 percent of such corresponding class. Increases from $2,000 to $1,000,000 the threshold dollar amount subjecting certain contracts to such Act and requiring them to specify the minimum wages to be paid to laborers, mechanics, and helpers. Establishes a separate classification for helpers of laborers or mechanics, for purposes of such Act."
