    "text": "Tennessee Wilderness Act of 1986 - Designates the following lands in the Cherokee National Forest, Tennessee, as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) Pond Mountain Wilderness; (2) Big Laurel Branch Wilderness; (3) Unaka Mountain Wilderness; (4) Sampson Mountain Wilderness; (5) Little Frog Mountain Wilderness; and (6) Big Frog Extension Wilderness. Requires such lands to be administered in accordance with the Wilderness Act, permitting certain kinds of signs and construction on the wilderness areas comprising the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in specified counties in Tennessee shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in specified counties in Tennessee which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in specified counties in Tennessee reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. States that the provisions above shall also apply to national forest system roadless lands in specified counties in Tennessee which are less than 5,000 acres in size. Terminates specified wilderness studies made unnecessary by this Act's designations."
