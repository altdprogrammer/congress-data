    "text": "American Conservation Corps Act of 1985 - Establishes an American Conservation Corps within the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture. Directs the Secretaries of both departments to establish and administer a conservation and rehabilitation program on Federal public and Indian lands. Directs the Secretary of the Interior alone to establish and administer such a program on non-Federal public lands. Directs the Secretaries to assist program agencies (any Federal, State, or Indian agency responsible for the management of public lands) in establishing and operating residential and nonresidential American Conservation Corps Centers. Describes the types of projects which will receive program preference. Limits program projects to those on public lands or Indian lands, except where projects on nonpublic lands provide documented public benefits. Sets forth requirements for establishing conservation centers and eligibility criteria for enrollees in the program. Requires that preference be given to economically, socially, physically, and educationally disadvantaged youth and youth residing in areas having substantial unemployment. Requires program agencies to provide services, facilities, supplies, and equipment for conservation centers as the Secretary deems necessary. States under what conditions and for what purposes an enrollee/volunteer shall be deemed a Federal or State employee. Permits the Tennessee Valley Authority to utilize such volunteers. Sets forth compensation and reimbursement provisions for volunteers and their upkeep. Directs the Secretaries to assist program agencies in securing certification or academic credit for skills acquired by volunteers during their participation and to conduct cost-benefit analysis and evaluations of the program. Permits the Secretaries to conduct pilot programs for alternative approaches. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to report to the Congress within the year on a study of Civilian Conservation Corps sites suitable for a commemoration of such Corps. Sets forth study opportunities and limitations for program volunteers, including a requirement that program agencies provide job guidance and placement assistance. Directs the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to report at least annually to the President and the Congress. Directs the Secretary of Labor to make available appropriate labor market information. Sets forth employee appeal rights for workers displaced by American Conservation Corps volunteers. Sets forth funding limitations. Requires participating program agencies to certify that their programs will not displace workers. Sets forth procedures whereby State shares go to local governments when no State program agency exists. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 and 1986."
