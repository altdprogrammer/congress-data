Limits the amount of such credit based on the uninsured individual's taxable income. Disallows such credit for individuals with a taxable income over $30,000 per year. Allows an income tax deduction for the amounts paid for health insurance premiums by self-employed individuals who own the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or business."
