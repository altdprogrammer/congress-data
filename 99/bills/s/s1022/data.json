    "text": "Intergenerational Education Volunteer Network Act of 1985 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to local educational agencies (LEAs), or to public agencies and private nonprofit organizations applying jointly with one or more LEAs, to establish and operate intergenerational volunteer network programs, using senior citizen volunteers to help educationally disadvantaged children. Provides that such volunteers will tutor such children in their elementary and secondary schools and homes and will serve as liaisons between their schools and families. Provides that such funds may also be used to: (1) train volunteers, teachers, and other school personnel involved in such programs; (2) develop curricula materials; and (3) assist volunteers to pay for program-related expenses. Requires that each such grant shall be made to provide 90 percent of the cost of establishing and operating the program involved for a period of two to three years. Requires the remaining cost of such program to be provided from non-Federal sources. Provides that at least 90 percent of the amount appropriated to carry out this Act in any fiscal year may be used to make such grants. Limits to ten percent of such appropriations the amount which may be used by the Secretary for: (1) administrative costs; (2) the preparation of a biennial report to the Congress on such programs; (3) leadership training for project directors and other designated project personnel; and (4) ongoing technical assistance for such programs. Limits to ten percent that portion of such a grant which may be used by the grantee for administrative costs. Prohibits any part of such a grant from being used to: (1) pay the cost of any program established before the enactment of this Act; or (2) supplant any funds that would be available to the grantee in the absence of such grant. Requires that eligible applicants submit grant applications which describe the program and which provide assurances that: (1) local senior citizen groups and parent groups, and State agencies on education and on aging, are involved in program design; (2) local senior citizen groups and parent groups are involved in program operation; (3) good faith efforts will be made to locate for program participation senior citizen volunteers through programs under the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973; and (4) only elementary and secondary schools and families eligible for assistance under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 may receive assistance under this Act. Directs the Secretary, before approving any such application, to transmit a copy of it to the Director of the Action Agency for review or recommendation. Prohibits the Secretary from approving such application until: (1) receipt of the Director's recommendation; or (2) 30 days after such application is so transmitted. Directs the Secretary, in approving such applications, to assure equitable distribution of such grants among the States. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990."
