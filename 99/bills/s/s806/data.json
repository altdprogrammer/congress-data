    "text": "Dependent Care Grants Act Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to revise provisions added by subchapter D (State Grants for Dependent Care Planning and Development of Dependent Care Programs and for Other Purposes) of the Human Services Reauthorization Act. Raises the amount of appropriations authorized for FY 1986 for such grants to States for planning and development of dependent care programs. Extends the authorization of appropriations for such grants through FY 1989. Adds provisions relating to reallotment of such grants program funds among States. Requires that resource and referral systems funded through such grants provide information designed to improve the ability of parents and guardians to make an informed selection of available dependent care services. Eliminates prohibitions against State use of such grants to: (1) pay the costs of operation of any resource or referral system or any before or after school child care program established, expanded, or improved through such grants; or (2) subsidize the direct provision of dependent care services, including child care services. Eliminates the prohibition against the Federal share of any project supported under such grants program from exceeding 75 percent. Extends until September 30, 1989, the requirement for revision, as necessary, of the State's description of the intended use of such grants. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to carry out a program of collecting data from recipients of assistance under such grants program designed to provide a national needs assessment for child care services of school-age children, including data on the number of children served, the number awaiting care, the income distribution of families, and the percentage of families requiring reduced or waived fees. Revises reporting requirements. Directs the Secretary to report, within 160 days after the end of each fiscal year, to specified congressional committees on activities under such grants program, together with a needs assessment of the availability of, and need for Federal support of, child care services for school-age children in each State. Entitles the subchapter D grants program the \"Dependent Care Grants Act.\""
