Limits the amount of the additional bad debt reserve for any taxable year to the amount necessary to bring the balance of the tax reserve for bad debts up to 1.5 percent of total loans of the bank. Provides that the amount of the deduction allowed for any taxable year shall not exceed an amount equal to one-half of one percent of the total loans of the bank as of the close of the taxable year. Requires that the difference between the tax reserve for bad debts and the financial statement reserve for bad debts shall be brought into conformity over a period of six years."
