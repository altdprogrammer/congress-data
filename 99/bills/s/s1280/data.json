    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to make it a criminal offense for the unauthorized disclosure of classified secret information for profit to any foreign government (or faction therein) with the intent to injure the United States or for the advantage of a foreign nation. Authorizes the death penalty if such disclosure severely jeopardizes the national security of the United States. Requires a separate sentencing hearing before a jury or the court (upon motion by the defendant) when the defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to such offense, except when the Government stipulates that one or more mitigating factors exist. Requires the jury or the court (if there is no jury) to find that one or more specified mitigating factors exist. States that if such a factor exists the court shall not sentence the defendant to death. Declares that if the death penalty is imposed such sentence shall be carried out by a firing squad. Requires the Attorney General to make a live video and audio coverage of any execution available to the public."
