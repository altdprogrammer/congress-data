Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 to the Department to enable NOAA to carry out its atmospheric and hydrological research duties, including research for developing improved prediction capabilities for atmospheric and hydrological processes. Provides that such authorization shall be in addition to moneys authorized under specified Federal law providing for the reporting of weather modification activities to the Government and under the National Climate Program Act. Title II: Satellite Programs - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 to the Department to enable NOAA to carry out its satellite services duties, including satellite maintenance and operations and data analysis. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 to the Department to enable NOAA to carry out its satellite systems duties, including spacecraft procurement, launch, and associated ground station system changes involving polar orbiting and geostationary meteorological satellites and land remote sensing satellites. Provides that such authorization shall be in addition to moneys authorized under the Land Remote-Sensing Commercialization Act of 1984. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 to the Department to enable NOAA to carry out its data and information services duties, including environmental data and information products and services in the atmospheric, marine, solid earth, and solar-terrestrial sciences. Title III: Other Authorizations - Authorizes appropriations to the Department for FY 1986 to enable NOAA to carry out its study of natural and man-induced climate processes, for purposes of its national climate program information services duties. Amends specified Federal law, which provides for the reporting of weather modification activities to the Government, to authorize appropriations for FY 1986 to carry out such Act. Title IV: Miscellaneous - Prohibits the closing or consolidation of any weather service office or weather service forecast office of the National Weather Service until the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) establishes appropriate standards and procedures relating to any proposed closure or consolidation of such an office. Requires the Secretary, in making decisions to close or consolidate such offices, to consider specified factors, as well as the views expressed by persons served by any affected office. Requires such decisions, along with a written statement of findings and the basis for decision, be made available to such persons. Prohibits the Secretary from taking any action to carry out such a closing or consolidation until 60 days after such decision is made available to such persons. Prohibits NOAA from awarding any contract for the performance of any \"commercial activity\" (as defined in a specified memorandum of the Office of Management and Budget) which is performed by NOAA employees until at least 30 calendar days after the Administrator has presented, in writing, to specified congressional officers and committees a full and complete description of such proposed contract, together with supporting documentation. Requires that such documentation include: (1) a comparison of the cost of such activity as performed by NOAA employees and the cost under the proposed contract; (2) a comparison of the services performed by NOAA employees and the services under the proposed contract; and (3) an assessment of the benefits to the Federal Government of proceeding with the proposed contract."
