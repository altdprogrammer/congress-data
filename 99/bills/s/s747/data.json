    "text": "Marine Fisheries Improvement Act of 1985 - Repeals the provisions of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act which excluded highly migratory species of fish from the exclusive fishery management authority of the United States. Requires any owner and operator of a foreign fishing vessel intending to fish within the fishery conservation zone to submit to the Secretary of Commerce a schedule of fishing for every three months, submitted at least 30 days in advance. Requires immediate notification to the Secretary of any changes or variances from such submitted fishing schedules. Prohibits the Secretary from approving a permit for a foreign vessel to fish if the facilities on such vessels for quartering a U.S. observer are so inadequate or unsafe that the health or safety of the observer would be jeopardized. Requires each regional fishery management council to have a representative number of commercial and recreational fishermen, including at least one practicing commercial fisherman. Requires contents of fishery management plans to be submitted to the Executive Director of that area's fishery management council, along with being submitted to the Secretary. Requires the same confidentiality of the Executive Director with submitted statistics as is required of the Secretary. Requires any fishery management plan submitted to include certain specified information concerning the habitat involved. Allows such information to be excluded from such plans when habitat conservation, restoration, maintenance, and enhancement is not a significant factor in such plan. Requires recommendations concerning habitat conservation or enhancement to be responded to by the Secretary or other appropriate Federal officials within 60 days of receipt. Requires the Secretary to establish and implement a formal regional habitat planning and coordination process which would identify fishery resources of importance and the major habitat threats to such resources. Requires the Secretary, not less than every three years, to publish the result of the regional processes. Requires the establishment, in a fishery zone having limited access in order to achieve optimum yield, of a dislocation compensation program which compensates fishing vessel owners for the loss or reduction of livelihood caused by the limited access. Establishes in the Treasury the Fisheries Dislocation Compensation Fund to be used for payments made by the dislocation compensation program. Prohibits the Secretary from assessing a final civil penalty for violations which is greater than the penalty first assessed by written notice unless a significant change in information or circumstances occurs. Extends the authorization of appropriations under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act through FY 1990."
