    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-05-17", 
    "text": "Prohibits a former officer or employee of the Department of Defense or a former member of the armed forces from accepting compensation from a contractor for the three-year period after separation from service, if during the previous three years such employee was an official (of at least a GS-11 level) who had significant responsibilities in the performance of a procurement function with that contractor. Sets forth penalties of a fine of not more than $10,000, imprisonment of not more than two years, or both, for violations of such prohibition. Requires Department of Defense procurement contracts to include a provision that prohibits the contractor from furnishing compensation to any person if acceptance of such compensation would be a violation of this Act. Requires such contractors to report annually to the Inspector General of the Department of Defense on persons to whom the contractor furnished such compensation during the preceding year. Requires the Inspector General to submit such report to the Congress not later than April 1 of each year. Requires the Inspector General to review such reports to identify any violations of this Act and to report any violations to the Attorney General. Requires the Director of the Office of Government Ethics to review such reports to identify contract violations and report annually to the Congress on any findings. Makes this Act inapplicable to contractors for amounts less than $25,000. Allows any person who is offered compensation that, if accepted, might be in violation of this Act to request advice from the Office of Government Ethics. Sets forth a schedule for responses to such requests. Directs the Secretary of Defense, not later than 180 days after the effective date of this Act, to issue regulations with respect to procurement functions."
