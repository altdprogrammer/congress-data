    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-09-19", 
    "text": "Trade Partnership Act - Authorizes any market-access petitioner and any import-relief petitioner to submit a petition for relief under this Act to the International Trade Commission (ITC). Defines a \"market-access petitioner\" as one who alleges that a foreign country denies the petitioner's U.S. exported products or services access to the markets of such foreign country. Defines an \"import-relief petitioner\" as one who alleges that products of the foreign country imported into the United States are causing substantial injury to such domestic industry. Requires the ITC to transmit a copy of any such petition to the Secretary of Labor and to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). Sets forth information that must be included in such petitions (including allegations of unfair trade practices, estimates of the value of lost exports, specific import relief proposals, and an agreement between the market-access petitioner and the import-relief petitioner providing for the employment by the market-access petitioner of workers in the domestic industry of the import-relief petitioner if specified conditions are met). Requires the ITC to dismiss a petition if: (1) both petitioners are representatives of the same industry; (2) the petitioners are the same person; or (3) the employees of the market-access petitioner and the employees of the import-relief petitioner would be treated as employed by a single employer under the Internal Revenue Code. Requires the ITC, upon request, to assist persons who want to file a petition under this Act in contacting other persons that want to file such a petition. Requires the ITC to investigate such petitions and issue certain determinations on the information contained in the petition within 90 days of the filing of the petition. Requires the USTR, if the ITC makes affirmative determinations on the information contained in a petition, to: (1) notify the affected foreign country that actions are required to be taken against such country under this Act; (2) initiate negotiations for the elimination of the unfair trade practices with respect to which the ITC has made an affirmative determination or, if the negotiations are unsuccessful and the import relief proposal violates the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, initiate negotiations for a compensation agreement under the Trade Act of 1974; and (3) issue an administrative order implementing such import relief proposal within 90 days of the publication of the ITC's determinations. Prohibits the USTR from issuing such an administrative order if the USTR certifies to the Congress that the unfair trade practices have been eliminated. Requires the ITC, within 30 days of the issuance of an administrative order implementing an import relief proposal, to estimate the total value of the adjustment costs for all workers in the domestic industry of the import-relief petitioner who will be totally separated from employment if such order is terminated. Requires the Secretary of Labor, upon termination of such order, to begin monitoring the compliance of the market-access petitioner with the terms of the agreement set forth in the petition. Provides for notification of and action by the Attorney General to enforce compliance with such agreement."
