    "text": "Comprehensive Nuclear Weapons Freeze and Arms Reduction Act of 1985 - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should immediately invite the Soviet Union to enter into negotiations with the United States which seek an agreement on a comprehensive freeze (a bilateral and adequately verifiable halt by the United States and the Soviet Union in all testing, production, and deployment of nuclear weapons systems). Declares that the President should inform the Soviet Union of the U.S. intention to engage in a bilateral halt in the testing, production, and deployment of nuclear weapons systems. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) both during and after negotiations for a comprehensive freeze the President should pursue reductions in nuclear arsenals; and (2) a comprehensive freeze is entirely consistent with, and an essential part of, mutual and bilateral stabilizing reductions in nuclear forces. Requires both the Senate and the House Intelligence Committees to begin oversight hearings on verification procedures for the comprehensive freeze. Sets forth which committees and subcommittees may have members participate in such hearings. Requires the Intelligence Committees to report to their respective Houses within six months of enactment of this Act on the adequacy of U.S. monitoring systems and existing procedures for verifying Soviet compliance with the comprehensive freeze. Requires the reports to include: (1) an assessment of the nature and extent of Soviet activities and installations involved in the testing, production, and deployment of nuclear weapons systems; (2) an assessment of current U.S. capabilities to monitor threatening changes in the status of Soviet nuclear forces under the comprehensive freeze; and (3) an assessment of additional monitoring systems and cooperative procedures that may be needed to increase monitoring confidence of compliance. Requires the Director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency to begin preparing an operational plan for implementation of the comprehensive freeze. Requires the Director to report to the Congress on the plan within nine months of enactment of this Act. Requires the report to specify: (1) procedures for the cessation of activities and closure or conversion of facilities affected by the comprehensive freeze; (2) a program for the retraining and re-employment of Government and defense industry personnel directly affected by the termination of nuclear weapons-related activities; and (3) a program of economic adjustment assistance for adversely affected communities. Directs the President to submit semi-annual reports to the Congress on: (1) the status of U.S. and Soviet negotiation efforts; (2) Soviet military activities relating to the testing, production, and deployment of nuclear weapons systems; and (3) any uncertainties concerning verification of the comprehensive freeze, the status of efforts to reduce those uncertainties, and the national security implications of those uncertainties. Imposes the following restrictions on nuclear testing, deployment and production only if the Soviet Union, within a specified time, informs the President that the Soviet Union will observe a bilateral halt in the testing, production, and deployment of nuclear weapons systems. Prohibits obligating or spending appropriations for testing, producing, or deploying nuclear weapons systems, unless the Congress expressly provides otherwise. Allows the testing and deployment of specified nuclear missiles for a limited time. Sets forth the effective dates of such restrictions. Authorizes the President to request the Congress to remove the funding restrictions on the testing, production, and deployment of nuclear weapons systems only if the President certifies to the Congress that: (1) the Soviet Union has failed to demonstrate a restraint with respect to nuclear weapons systems which corresponds to the restraint being shown by the United States; or (2) continuation of the funding restrictions would cause significant and irreparable damage to U.S. national security. Provides for expedited congressional consideration of such a request by the President."
