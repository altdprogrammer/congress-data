    "text": "Interstate Telecommunications Consumer Protection Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to prevent businesses engaged in providing interstate telephone toll service from using unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive trade practices. Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to promulgate rules requiring such businesses to: (1) notify residential consumers of rate changes or related charges within ten business days before they become effective; (2) provide such notice in writing and include an easily usable schedule of rates before and after the change; (3) maintain a copy of a current rate schedule and related charges; and (4) make such schedule available upon request. Authorizes consumers to file complaints with the FCC concerning failure of a company to comply with the consumer notification requirements. Requires the FCC to investigate the complaints and provide appropriate relief. Requires the FCC to submit annual reports in 1986 through 1990 to the Congress on: (1) competition in the telecommunications industry; (2) rates for telephone toll and exchange services; and (3) the status of universal telephone service. Directs the FTC to report annually to the Congress on actions taken by the FTC pursuant to the amendment made by this Act to the Federal Trade Commission Act."
