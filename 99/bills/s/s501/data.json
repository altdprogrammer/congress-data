Amends the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, to require the U.S. Trade Representative to submit a separate compilation of the analysis and estimate of U.S. agricultural exports to the appropriate congressional committees. Directs the U.S. Trade Representative and the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) to seek to eliminate barriers to U.S. agricultural products. Requires a report to the Congress if negotiations are not proceeding satisfactorily. Directs the President to recommend to the Congress a plan for the reciprocal phasing out of agricultural trade barriers. Directs the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), in making export credit guarantees, to consider a country's credit standing, and whether such guarantees will foster U.S. agricultural exports. Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (Public Law 480) to extend sales and assistance program authority through FY 2000. Directs the Secretary to conduct an agricultural export study and report to the Congress within one year.

Directs the Secretary to establish an acreage reduction program for the 1986 through 1988 wheat crops. Requires planted acreage for such years to be reduced by 15 percent, ten percent, and five percent, respectively.

Title VI: Soybeans - Directs the Secretary to make loans to producers of each of the 1986 and subsequent soybean crops who pledge their crops as loan security. Sets the basic loan rate for each crop at 75 percent of the preceding three years' national average market price. Requires loan repayment within nine months. Title VII: Dairy - Sets the dairy price support level through FY 1987 at $11.60 per hundredweight. Provides for two specified 50-cent per hundredweight price support reductions if purchases exceed specified amounts.
