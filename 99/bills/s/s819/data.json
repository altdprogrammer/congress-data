    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-04-01", 
    "text": "Federal Supplemental Compensation Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Federal Supplemental Compensation Act of 1982 to extend the Federal supplemental unemployment compensation program for 18 months, until September 30, 1986. Revises formulas for State triggers for determination of the number of weeks for which Federal supplemental compensation is payable. Provides that, in the case of any benefit period, the applicable trigger is on for any week if: (1) the triggering long-term rate of insured unemployment (LIUR) for such State falls within a specified applicable range (14 weeks benefits if a 5.5 percent or more LIUR; 12 weeks if 4.5 percent or more; ten weeks if 3.5 percent or more; eight weeks if less than 3.5 percent); (2) in the case of a State for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) compiles data on a month-to-month basis with respect to the seasonally adjusted total civilian rate of unemployment (TUR), the triggering TUR for such State falls within a specified applicable range (14 weeks benefits if a ten percent or more TUR; 12 weeks if nine percent or more; ten weeks if eight percent or more; eight weeks if less than eight percent); or (3) in the case of any other State, the triggering rate of insured unemployment (IUR) for such State falls within a specified applicable range (14 weeks benefits if a six percent or more IUR; 12 weeks if five percent or more; ten weeks if four percent or more; eight weeks if less than four percent). Sets forth formulas for the periods to be used in determining the triggering LIUR, TUR, and IUR. (Bases the triggering LIUR on specified periods beginning on or after January 1, 1983.) Establishes \"O-week benefit periods\" if: (1) the LIUR is less than two and one-half percent; (2) in the case of any State for which the BLS complies a monthly TUR, that TUR is less than seven percent; and (3) in the case of any other State, the IUR is less than three percent. Requires each State in a O-week benefit period to provide for determination of benefit periods on the basis of the applicable triggers and triggering rates of unemployment as in effect for the sub-State area in which the individual was last employed, rather than on a statewide basis. Requires the State to establish sub-State areas for such purposes as soon as feasible after the enactment of this Act. Requires the State to establish ten such sub-State areas, each consisting of contiguous counties or independent areas. Provides that, in the case of any State having a total number of not more than ten counties and independent cities, each county or independent city shall be a sub-State area. Requires that the use of such sub-State triggers remain in effect until the State qualifies for a benefit period other than the O-week benefit period. Requires modification of agreements with States to reflect the amendments made by this Act. Directs the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the States, to conduct a study of: (1) the cost and feasibility of providing Federal supplemental compensation only on the basis of triggers and benefit periods determined for sub-State areas or jurisdictions; and (2) the appropriate sub-State area or jurisdiction and the appropriate trigger for determining such compensation. Directs the Secretary to report the results of such study to the Congress within one year after enactment of this Act."
