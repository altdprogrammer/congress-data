Requires the compulsory licensing of manufacturers and importers of audio recording devices and media. Sets forth procedures for: (1) determining royalty fees to be paid by such manufacturers and importers; and (2) distributing such fees to the owners of copyright of sound recordings included in radio or television transmissions or distributed in the form of phonorecords. Provides for the determination of royalty fees by: (1) voluntary negotiation between importers and manufacturers and representatives of copyright owners; or (2) Copyright Royalty Tribunal proceedings when a voluntary agreement is not reached. Specifies criteria to be considered by the Tribunal in determining royalty fees."
