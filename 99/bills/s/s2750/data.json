Requires the Secretary of the Interior to publish notice of such transfer in the Federal Register and to manage the Houlton Band Tax Fund in accordance with this Act. Requires the Secretary to pay out of the Houlton Band Tax Fund claims for taxes, payments in lieu of property taxes, and fees for which the Band are determined to be liable. Provides for the payment of such taxes from nontrust, income-producing lands owned by the Band if there are insufficient funds in the Houlton Band Tax Fund. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to expend, at the request of the Band, funds from a certain land acquisition fund to purchase land or natural resources, such lands or resources to be held in trust by the United States for such Band. Sets forth specified conditions and requirements with respect to the acquisition and alienation of and the right of the State over such lands and resources."
