Requires that such purchases be made with any dairy price support money saved as a result of dairy cattle marketing under the milk production termination program. Directs the Secretary to: (1) buy meat in each disposal period in relation to the number of marketed dairy cattle; and (2) adjust the number of marketed dairy cattle so as to minimize the adverse effect on U.S. beef, pork, and lamb producers."
