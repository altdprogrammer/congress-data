    "text": "Federal Nuclear Facilities Insurance and Liability Act of 1986 - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct (current law authorizes) the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to enter into indemnification agreements with contractors regarding production or utilization facilities involving activities under the risk of public liability for a substantial nuclear incident. States that such agreements shall not limit the amount indemnified. Requires the Secretary of Energy to: (1) recover from contractors whose gross negligence or willful misconduct contributed to a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation the proportional share of the amount paid by the Federal Government to satisfy the resulting claims; and (2) enter into agreements indemnifying Federal contractors for public liability resulting from a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation while engaged in nuclear waste disposal, storage, or transportation. Extends from three years to five years the period in which a claimant may discover injuries caused by a nuclear occurrence. Eliminates the 20-year statute of limitations period in which to bring a claim for injuries caused by a nuclear incident. Includes within the purview of indemnification agreements the theft or diversion of radioactive material. Directs the Secretary of Energy to compensate public liability claims arising out of theft or diversion."
