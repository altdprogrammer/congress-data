Specifies the related congressional and presidential actions that shall be taken before such controls go into effect. Title II: Bonus Commodity Exports - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to provide Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) surplus stocks at no cost to U.S. exporters, users, and foreign purchasers to offset the adverse effects of foreign subsidies and the high value of the U.S. dollar abroad. Title III: Financing of Sales of Agricultural Commodities - Directs the Secretary, for FY 1986 through 1989, to use CCC funds (under the Export Credit Sales Program) for surplus commodity export credit in any year that carryover stocks exceed specified levels. Title IV: Protection of Highly Erodible Land - Makes any person who cultivates crops on highly erodible land ineligible for: (1) price supports or payments; (2) farm storage facility loans; (3) crop insurance; (4) disaster payments; or (5) specified other agricultural loans. Exempts crops planted: (1) before enactment of this Act; or (2) under specified conservation systems. Title V: Effective Date - Makes the provisions of this Act effective as of October 1, 1985, unless otherwise provided for."
