Defines such recipients and the Corporation as agencies of the United States for the purposes of creating criminal liability for certain violations. Directs the Corporation to issue regulations to provide for the enforcement of such Act. Allows class action suits to be brought against government entities only where: (1) the class relief is sought only for the primary benefit of eligible clients; and (2) the government policy or practice in question is unlikely to change and will continue to adversely affect eligible clients. Prohibits the use of Corporation funds, personnel, or equipment in attempting to affect legislative redistricting or reapportionment. Directs the Board of the Corporation to issue regulations regarding the distribution of attorney's fees awarded by the court in actions where the recipient has participated. Prohibits the use of Corporation funds for lobbying. Requires recipients to devote a substantial amount of funds to provide the opportunity for legal assistance to be furnished to eligible clients by private attorneys. Prohibits the use of Corporation funds for the dissemination of information advocating particular political activities, labor or antilabor activities, boycotts, picketing, strikes, and demonstrations. Requires that an alien be properly admitted as a resident before access to Corporation legal services may be provided. Prohibits the use of Corporation funds to purchase real estate unless the Board approves of the purchase by a two-thirds vote. Revises the requirements regarding the governing bodies of eligible recipients. Prohibits the commingling of Corporation funds with the resources of any other organization providing legal assistance. Requires Corporation approval of all grants and contracts regarding the provision of legal services by recipients. Requires annual reports from all recipients of Corporation funds. Allows the Corporation to deny funding to any recipient who fails to comply with audit requests. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1989. Allows the Corporation to bring an action in an appropriate U.S. district court to compel the specific performance of any agreement between the Corporation and any recipient."
