Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to require hospitals making a request for increased payments to submit an audit of its costs. Entitles the hospital to an evidentiary hearing before an appeals board if the Secretary disapproves the hospital's request. Requires the Secretary to appoint an appeals board composed of specified members of the health care community. Specifies the board's powers and duties of review. Sets deadlines for the publication of, comment on, and finalization of regulations implementing this Act."
