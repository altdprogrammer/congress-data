    "text": "Diplomatic Security Act - Title I: Diplomatic Security - Directs the Secretary of State (the Secretary) to develop and implement policies and programs to: (1) protect all civilian U.S. employees on official duty abroad and their dependents; (2) establish and operate security functions at all civilian U.S. missions abroad; (3) establish and operate security functions at all State Department facilities in the United States; and (4) protect foreign missions, international organizations, foreign officials, and other foreign persons in the United States. Requires other Federal agencies to cooperate with the State Department. Requires an Assistant Secretary of State to head the Bureau of Diplomatic Security of the State Department. Increases the number of Assistant Secretaries of State from 14 to 15. Requires the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service to be headed by a Director designated by the Secretary. Sets forth the qualifications for the Director of the Diplomatic Security Service and for other personnel of the Diplomatic Security Service. Title II: Performance and Accountability - Requires the Secretary to convene an Accountability Review Board whenever there is serious injury, loss of life, or significant destruction of property at or related to a U.S. mission abroad unless there are clearly no security or breach of duty issues involved. Sets forth administrative provisions relating to the Board. Requires the Board to determine whether: (1) there are reasonable grounds to believe the injury, loss of life, or property damage was security-related; and (2) there is reasonable cause to believe that a breach of duty by a U.S. employee contributed to such injury, loss of life, or destruction of property. Directs the Board to make recommendations to the Secretary on programs or operations subject to this Act which the Board has reviewed. Provides for disciplinary proceedings and certain agency actions with respect to U.S. employees who the Board finds reasonable cause to believe contributed to the injury, loss of life, or property destruction because of their breach of duty. Title III: Authorization of Appropriations - Authorizes appropriations to the State Department for FY 1986 and 1987 for the purposes of this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 to the State Department for antiterrorism research and development.
