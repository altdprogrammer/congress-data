    "text": "Fair Trade Act of 1985 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to report annually to the President on the USTR's analysis of foreign trade barriers to U.S. exports. Requires the USTR to keep specified congressional committees informed about trade policy priorities for expanding market opportunities. Requires the President to submit to the Congress within 30 days after a study of foreign trade barriers is submitted to the President: (1) such study; (2) an estimate of the trade distorting impact of practices identified in the study; (3) all feasibile courses of action which would redress imbalances caused by such practices if efforts to end them fail; and (4) a proposed joint resolution which requires the President to take a specific course of action which the President has determined to be the most appropriate. Provides for expedited consideration of such resolution. Directs the President, upon enactment of such resolution, to inform the countries involved that the President will undertake the course of action specified in the joint resolution unless the countries eliminate the offensive practices within 60 days. Adds to the list of unfair trade practices that require presidential action under the Trade Act of 1974 those foreign trade practices that deny to the United States commercial opportunities substantially equivalent to those offered by the United States. Directs the President to take appropriate action to redress any imbalance resulting from such foreign trade practices."
