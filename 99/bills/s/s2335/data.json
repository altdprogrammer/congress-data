    "text": "Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986 - Declares that any person who organizes, attempts, commits, procures, or supports acts of terrorism shall be considered to have committed an act of aggression against the United States and may be pursued with deadly force. Defines terrorism to mean activity directed against U.S. persons which: (1) is committed by a non-U.S. national or permanent resident alien; (2) involves violent or dangerous acts which would be crimes in the United States; and (3) is intended to intimidate a civilian population, to influence government policy, or to affect the conduct of a government by assassination or kidnapping. Authorizes the President, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, to protect U.S. persons from terrorism through the use of all antiterrorism and counterterrorism measures that the President deems necessary. Requires the President's authority to apply: (1) to all terrorists wherever they may be; and (2) until the President determines that no terrorist poses a threat to U.S. persons. Prohibits this Act from being construed as granting any authority to use deadly force within the United States which would not exist in the absence of this Act. Requires the President to report to the Congress within ten days of taking any action under this Act."
