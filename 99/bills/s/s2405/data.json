    "date": "1986-09-24", 
    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H. R. 3129 passed in lieu) Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1986 - Title I: Authorizes appropriations out of the Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account) for FY 1987 through 1990 for: (1) the Federal-aid Interstate-Primary program; (2) the Federal-aid Urban system; (3) the Federal-aid Secondary system; (4) bridge replacement and rehabilitation; (5) the Federal lands highway program; (6) the territorial highway program for the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas; (7) highway safety construction programs; (8) highway construction safety research and development; (9) certain hazards elimination projects; and (10) hazards elimination projects regarding railway-highway crossings. Makes highway construction projects on any public road serving the area of a withdrawn Interstate route eligible as highway substitution projects. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) to approve until September 30, 1986, the withdrawal of any route which was under judicial injunction prohibiting its construction as of November 6, 1978. Makes substitution funds available in a State for two years. Authorizes appropriations for highway substitution projects for FY 1987 through 1990. Authorizes the Secretary to adjust in September of 1986 and every subsequent September the last approved Interstate Substitute Cost Estimate to make apportionments for substitute highway projects and substitute transit projects on October 1 or as soon as practicable thereafter for fiscal years subsequent to FY 1986. Directs the Secretary to reserve in a State's account until a disposition decision has been reached an amount equal to the Federal funds expended to purchase a right-of-way for a withdrawn Interstate route if the State has not disposed of such right-of-way upon the date of enactment of this Act. States that upon repayment by a State of its right-of-way debt, such repayment shall be credited to the unprogrammed fund balance apportioned to such State, and shall then be available for expenditure in accordance with this Act. Directs the Secretary to set aside funds from specified authorizations for the Strategic Highway Research Program. Sets forth apportionment guidelines for FY 1987 through 1990 for: (1) the Federal-aid Interstate-Primary Program; (2) the Federal-aid Secondary System; and (3) the Federal-aid Urban System. Authorizes a State to transfer up to 50 percent of its apportionment between the Urban and Secondary Systems. Requires the approval of the affected local area officials before a State may transfer the allocations for an urbanized area of 200,000 or more population. Authorizes the Secretary to waive competitive bidding on a reconstruction contract in an emergency situation. Makes available for obligation for four years the sums apportioned for: (1) the Interstate Federal-aid Interstate-Primary Program; (2) the Federal-aid Secondary system; (3) the Federal-aid Urban system; and (4) bridge replacement and rehabilitation. Declares that apportioned amounts remaining unobligated at the end of four years shall lapse (except for the bridge rehabilitation apportionments, which shall be allocated by the Secretary as bridge discretionary funds). States that funds made available to the State of Alaska may be expended for access and development roads on a Federal-aid system. Prohibits the Secretary from reducing more than ten percent of a State's apportioned funds for its failure to: (1) adequately maintain the Interstate system; or (2) certify a maintenance program. Prohibits the Federal share payable for the Primary system (other than the Interstate system) from exceeding 75 percent of construction costs. Allows certain Interstate routes to be improved at a 90 percent Federal share. States that the Federal share payable for a highway emergency relief project may be 100 percent for emergency repairs accomplished in the first 30 days after an occurrence. Authorizes Federal funds to reimburse State costs for the relocation of utility facilities necessitated by a highway construction project, or by a State's highway safety improvement program. Authorizes the expenditure of Federal emergency relief funds for: (1) the Virgin Islands; (2) Guam; (3) American Samoa; and (4) the Northern Mariana Islands. Sets a $5,000,000 obligation ceiling upon such funds during any fiscal year. Revises the penalty provisions regarding violations of vehicle weight limitations on the Interstate System to provide that withheld funds will not lapse if they are subsequently released and obligated within the normal four-year availability period. Revises the guidelines under which the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to permit Federal participation in the initial construction of State toll facilities, including ferry-boat facilities. Limits to 35 percent the Federal share payable for such facilities. Requires the appropriate State highway department to agree that toll revenues for such facilities will be used only for the costs of construction, reconstruction, or maintenance. Requires the operators of certain toll facilities on a Federal-aid system in a State to certify biennially to the State Governor that: (1) such facilities are adequately maintained; and (2) such operators can fund the replacement or repair of inadequately maintained facilities without using Federal-aid highway funds. Precludes Federal funding out of the Highway Trust Fund for failure to make such certification. Precludes Federal funding out of the Highway Trust Fund for State toll facilities which have not been certified by State officials as: (1) being adequately maintained; and (2) having an operator able to fund inadequately-maintained facilities without the use of Federal-aid highway funds. Requires each State to survey and identify all highway-railroad crossings needing separation, relocation, or protective devices. Requires that half of all authorized funds for such crossings be made available for installing protective devices. Requires each State to report annually to the Secretary and the Secretary to report annually to specified congressional committees on program progress. Makes certain sums available for obligation for the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP). Authorizes the Secretary to implement the SHRP in cooperation with State highway departments. Directs the Secretary to set standards for the use of funds to conduct research, development, and technology transfer activities determined to be strategically important to the national highway transportation system. Authorizes the Secretary to provide grants to and enter into cooperative agreements with State highway departments or the National Academy of Sciences to conduct such activities. Requires the Secretary to report annually to certain congressional committees regarding the progress and research findings of the SHRP. Makes certain remedies against the United States applicable in any civil action against the National Academy of Sciences for injury or property loss arising from activities in connection with the Strategic Highway Research Program. Credits certain State-financed off-system bridge replacement and rehabilitation projects towards the non-Federal share of the cost of other Federal-aid bridge projects. Permits the States to use certain bridge replacement funds to construct any bridge which: (1) replaces any low-water crossing; (2) replaces any ferry in existence on January 1, 1984; and (3) replaces any bridge destoyed prior to 1960. States that the Federal share of such bridge construction cost shall be 80 percent. Amends Federal law relating to outdoor advertising to authorize the Secretary to reduce Federal-aid highway funds up to five percent of what would otherwise be a State's apportionment if the Secretary determines that the State has not made provisions for the effective control of outdoor advertising along the Interstate and primary system. (Currently, a ten percent reduction of such apportionment is mandated.) Sets guidelines for: (1) the effective control of outdoor advertising by the States; (2) Federal participation in State costs incurred for sign acquisition and removal; and (3) outdoor signs on federally-owned public lands. Repeals provisions for: (1) the Federal compensation of costs incurred in the removal of certain outdoor advertising; and (2) State retention of certain non-conforming directional signs. Directs the Secretary to make a minimum allocation among the States so that a State's percentage of total apportionments shall be at least 85 percent of the percentage of estimated tax payments attributable to highway users in such State paid into the Highway Trust Fund. Adds total allocations as well as apportionments to the calculation of the 85 percent minimum funds. (Currently only apportioned programs are considered in the minimum allocation calculation.) Establishes the Federal-Aid Interstate-Primary Program to bring all elements of the primary system up to certain Federal standards. Declares that such program shall consist of projects for the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, restoration, and resurfacing or improvement of the primary system and the Interstate system.

Directs the lead agency to require that a displacing agency use project funds to provide dwellings for displaced persons in excess of housing replacement assistance ceilings only on a case-by-case basis and for good cause (if the project would be delayed because suitable housing is not otherwise available). Permits a Federal agency to discharge its responsibilities by accepting the certification by a State agency that it will implement State law to carry out the Federal relocation assistance program, provided that the lead agency determines that such State law will accomplish the purpose and effect of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970. Requires the head of such agency, prior to accepting certification, to provide interested parties with an opportunity for public review and comment, and to consult with interested local governments.
