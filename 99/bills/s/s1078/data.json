    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, in lieu of H.R. 2385) Federal Trade Commission Authorization Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to revise the definition of \"unfair act or practice\" to include any act or practice that causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers. Defines \"substantial injury\" as not reasonably avoidable by consumers and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition resulting from the act or practice. Permits the court to review certain cease and desist orders made by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Authorizes the FTC to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to any unfair or deceptive act or practice or false advertisement only if it has issued two or more cease and desist orders or it believes a pattern of unfair and deceptive acts or practices or false advertisements exists. Extends the civil investigative demand procedures to the FTC's antitrust authority. Prohibits the FTC from studying, investigating, and prosecuting agricultural cooperatives for certain conduct. Provides for congressional review and veto of final rules promulgated by the FTC. Makes any such rule effective unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted into law within 90 days of the rule's submission. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988. Prohibits the FTC from intervening in the proceedings of any Federal or State agency without first notifying specified congressional committees at least 60 days in advance, or as soon as practicable. Directs the FTC to investigate the marketing of imitation Native American arts, crafts, and jewelry. Directs the FTC to conduct studies of unfair and deceptive practices in the life care home industry and the nursing home industry. Directs the FTC to report to specified congressional committees on instances in which predatory pricing practices in such industries have been suspected or alleged."
