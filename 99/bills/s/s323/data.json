    "text": "Clean Campaign Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to treat as a contribution to a candidate for the Senate any extension of credit for advertising which exceeds $1,000 and more than 30 days. Prohibits either Senate candidates or their authorized political committees from accepting contributions from non-party multicandidate political committees aggregating more than 30 percent of certain spending limits in any calendar year. Establishes separate formulae for contribution limits for candidates in general and special elections. Deems expenditures made on behalf of any candidate to be expenditures made by such candidate. Provides guidelines limiting expenditures by candidates. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase to $200 ($400 on a joint return) the tax credit for contributions made to candidates for the Senate to defray general election expenses. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to specified congressional committees and the Federal Election Commission on the use of political tax credits. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to establish eligibility criteria entitling Senate candidates to receive campaign payments on a matching basis. Establishes formulae to determine such sums. Limits expenditures of personal funds to $50,000 per election. Waives spending limits for eligible candidates: (1) whose opponents have spent sums exceeding the limit imposed upon such candidates; or (2) whose opponents have refused to agree to spending and contribution limitations. Entitles such candidates to mail campaign matter at postal rates established for nonprofit organizations. Requires any candidate who exceeds spending limitations or whose contributions aggregate more than $75,000, and any person whose independent expenditures exceed $5,000, to report to the Federal Election Commission within specified time periods. Requires the Federal Election Commission to certify the eligibility of candidates. Requires Senate candidates who receive contributions that qualify for the tax credit to maintain and manage such contributions in a separate account. Requires such candidates that do not become eligible for the general election to transfer applicable funds to the Secretary of the Treasury or to a political party committee. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit funds remaining after a qualified candidate has defrayed all campaign expenses in an account to retire the public debt. Directs the Commission to audit campaign accounts. Requires repayment of excess payments and unexpended payments. Penalizes the use of funds for other than campaign purposes. Authorizes the Commission to institute repayment actions in U.S. district courts. Requires the Commission to make certain reports to the Senate. Authorizes appropriations."
