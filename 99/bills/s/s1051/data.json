Title XII: Farm Credit Assistance - Farm Credit Assistance Act of 1985 - Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to authorize the Secretary to release certain borrowers from personal liability and any lien the Secretary may hold on their assets, up to a total of $10,000. Limits such release authority to borrowers with a negative net worth who are facing imminent foreclosure or bankruptcy. Limits the use of such released assets to transition out of farming or ranching. Requires any released borrower to convey the remainder of his or her property to the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States for use in buying down the interest rates charged by commercial or cooperative lenders to limited resource farmers.
