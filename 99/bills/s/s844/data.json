    "text": "Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to authorize the Export-Import Bank (the Bank) to provide a sufficient return to commercial lending institutions or other lenders making loans in support of exports of goods and services when financing at other than market rates is necessary to respond to subsidized financing offered by foreign export credit agencies. Authorizes a director of the Bank whose term has expired to serve until a successor has been appointed. Extends the authority of such Act through FY 1991. Prohibits the Bank from approving any new loans after October 1, 1985, provided this prohibition shall not: (1) prevent the Bank from performing any obligations incurred before such date; or (2) pertain to the Bank's guarantee and insurance activities."
