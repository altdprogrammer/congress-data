    "text": "Copper Environmental Equalization Act of 1985 - Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to add an additional duty to the duties already imposed on copper and copper bearing ores. Directs the President to adjust such additional duty based upon the environmental costs of production in the United States and in foreign countries. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to determine such costs. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe a procedure by which interested parties may propose an adjustment in such duties. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to prohibit the President from designating the copper articles subject to the additional duty as eligible for duty-free treatment."
