    "text": "Displaced Homemakers Opportunity Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers an income tax credit for expenses of occupational training, received either on the job or through a qualified training organization, of displaced homemakers. Defines \"displaced homemaker\" as an individual who: (1) was a homemaker for five years; (2) had no, or insufficient, occupational skills at the time of hiring; (3) entered the work force due to the death or disability of, or divorce from, the wage-earning spouse; and (4) is employed by the taxpayer at the close of the taxable year. Excludes from such definition an individual with respect to whom the taxpayer has been allowed a targeted jobs tax credit. Provides for the recapture of the tax benefit received under this Act in the event the taxpayer discharges a displaced homemaker without reasonable cause."
