Provides that the level shall not be adjusted in FY 1986 and 1987 to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. Increases the authorization of appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987 for the surplus commodities program. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to inform State and area agencies on aging and providers of nutrition services under the Act of the existence of, and procedures for participating in, any Federal commodity processing program in which such agencies and providers may be eligible to participate."
