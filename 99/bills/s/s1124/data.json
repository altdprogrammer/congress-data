    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Surface Freight Forwarder Deregulation Act of 1986 - Amends Federal shipping laws to eliminate Interstate Commerce Commission regulations governing the operations of general commodities surface freight forwarders. Retains Federal regulation of such forwarders with respect to cargo liability and claims settlement procedures. Retains the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission over surface freight forwarders of household goods. Prohibits State and local governments from regulating general commodities freight forwarders deregulated by this Act. Continues the authority of the State of Hawaii to regulate motor carriers other than freight forwarders. Includes freight forwarders within the enforcement purview of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Revises the Commission's general authority to investigate on its own or upon complaint matters relative to its remaining authority over freight forwarders. Declares that the existing regulatory authority of the Department of Transportation (including its safety authority) continues to apply to all freight forwarders whether or not they are regulated by the Commission."
