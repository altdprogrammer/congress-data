    "text": "Grants Federal retirees and 18-month period after their retirement date to elect a survivor annuity for their spouses or to increase such annuity. Declares such election ineffective unless: (1) the spouse is notified in advance of the election; and (2) the necessary amount to cover such election is deposited in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund prior to the expiration of the 18-month period. Declares that a survivor annuity election made under the provisions of this Act voids any previous election. Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to annually inform each employee and Member of his or her right of election, including applicable procedures and deadlines. Directs OPM to: (1) establish a training program for retirement counselors of Federal agencies; and (2) publicize a telephone number for the exclusive use of annuitants with questions relating to retirement benefits. Requires the Director of OPM to assign knowledgeable staff to respond to such calls. Requires the training program to provide comprehensive training on provisions relating to, and the administration of, civil service retirement benefits. Requires that such training be designed to promote fully informed retirement decisions by employees and be revised as necessary to assure that current information is furnished to counselors. Requires the Director to conduct a training session once each quarter-year. Requires each retirement counsel to complete a training session once each year."
