Reduces the U.S. contribution to any such institution by the amount that would be the U.S. proportionate share of any aid provided by that institution to a foreign country to: (1) support the production of such fiber, textile, or article of apparel for export; and (2) subsidize the export to the United States of such items from such countries. Requires using any such withheld funds to reduce the public debt."
