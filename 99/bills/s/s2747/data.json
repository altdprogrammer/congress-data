    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Title I: Amends the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 to extend the Deposit Insurance Flexibility Act until June 30, 1987. Title II: Fair Deposit Availability - Fair Deposit Availability Act of 1986 - Sets forth depository institution disclosure requirements concerning: (1) the availability for withdrawal of funds deposited by check or similar instrument into a deposit account; (2) fees and charges assessed against deposit accounts; and (3) the computation of interest on deposited funds pending the receipt of provisional credit for the check or instrument. Requires the computation of interest on such deposited funds to begin no later than the date the institution receives provisional credit, unless the computation of interest begins at a later date for all deposits, including cash deposits, made to the account. Requires the Federal Reserve Board to publish for comment and implement within three years a regulation to improve the check clearing system used by depository institutions in order to make deposits by a check drawn on: (1) local institutions available for withdrawal after one business day; and (2) other institutions available after three business days. Requires the Board to establish an Expedited Funds Availability Council to advise and consult with the Board in the exercise of its functions under this Act. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to require that funds deposited by a check drawn on the Treasury, which is endorsed for deposit by a customer with an established relationship with the depository institution, be available for withdrawal when the depository institution is given provisional credit for that check. Sets forth provisions governing the civil liability of institutions that fail to comply with this Act. Requires the Board to prepare a study and submit its findings to the Congress on the effect of improvements and changes in the check clearing system. Title III: Bridge Banks - Authorizes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to organize a bridge bank to assume the deposits of, assume the liabilities of, purchase the assets of, and temporarily perform the functions of one or more closed insured banks if the FDIC Board of Directors determines that: (1) the amount necessary to operate the bridge bank will not exceed the cost of liquidating the closed banks; (2) continued operation of the insured banks is essential to the community; or (3) continued operation of the insured banks is in the interest of the depositors of the closed banks and the public. Provides that the bridge bank shall be a national bank, shall have all corporate powers of a national bank, with specified conditions, and shall be insured from the time of its organization. Requires the FDIC, at the direction of its Board of Directors, to: (1) make available sufficient funds for the bridge bank to operate; and (2) cause capital stock to be offered for sale in an amount sufficient to make possible the conduct of business of the bridge bank on a sound basis. Provides for the acquisition of the bridge bank by an out-of-State bank or holding company or by an insured depository institution located in the State where the closed bank was chartered but established by an out-of-State bank or holding company. Directs the FDIC to wind up the affairs of the bridge bank by voluntary dissolution or by the appointment of a receiver, unless the capital stock of the bridge bank is sold or its assets are taken over and its deposits assumed by another insured bank within two years from the date of its organization. Authorizes the FDIC, in order to facilitiate the sale or merger of the bridge bank with another insured depository institution, to: (1) make loans or contributions to, make deposits in, purchase assets or securities of, or assume the liabilities of such bank or the acquiring company; or (2) guarantee the bridge bank or the acquiring company against loss by reason of such sale or merger."
