    "text": "Air Traveler Protection Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to assess the efficacy of security measures at foreign airports which serve U.S. carriers or from which foreign air carriers serve the U.S. Requires the Secretary to: (1) use security criteria equal to or above certain internationally established standards; (2) report to the Congress regarding such assessments; (3) notify the appropriate authorities if a foreign airport does not administer effective security measures; (4) publish in the Federal Register all foreign airports which have failed to bring their security measures up to an acceptable level of effectiveness; and (5) prominently display at all U.S. airports from which air carriers provide foreign air transportation the identity of foreign airports whose security measures have not reached an acceptable level of effectiveness. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) provide technical assistance concerning aviation security to a foreign government; and (2) withhold or impose conditions on the operating authority of any carrier to engage in foreign air transportation utilizing a foreign airport with deficient security measures. Directs the Secretary (with the approval of the Secretary of State) to suspend (without notice or a hearing) the right of an air carrier (or foreign air carrier) to engage in foreign air transportation to or from an airport which the Secretary has determined presents a safety threat to either passengers, aircraft, or the public interest. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress a study of the need for an expanded air marshal program on international flights by United States air carriers. Authorizes the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency to permit air transportation security personnel to carry firearms and to make warrantless arrests if such personnel have reasonable grounds to believe a felony is being committed. Authorizes appropriations from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for research and development of aviation security measures."
