Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to construct, operate and maintain transmission facilities to connect the Minidoka powerplant to existing power transmission systems in order to distribute and market the power generated by the hydroelectric powerplant.

Requires the powerplant rehabilitation to be compatible with existing water rights or water delivery under valid contracts.
