    "text": "Consumer Products Energy Efficiency Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to provide that the labeling rules regarding consumer product energy efficiency standards shall require disclosure of such standards at the point of sale and in any advertising of the product. Directs the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) to: (1) publish and make available comparative guides of the energy efficiency and annual operating cost of certain consumer products; (2) prescribe an energy efficiency standard for certain consumer products; and (3) include in the Secretary's annual report on consumer product energy efficiency standards the percentage of covered products or components which are imported. Requires the Secretary, before determining whether a standard is economically justified, to weigh its effect on domestic production, reduction of unemployment, electric utilities, and the human environment. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe an energy efficiency standard for certain consumer products if it is determined that improvement of 20 percent or more is feasible. Delineates the criteria to be considered by the Secretary in determining whether a performance-related feature justifies the establishment of either a higher or a lower energy efficiency standard. Directs the Secretary to: (1) issue energy efficiency improvement guidelines for each of the following five years if no standard for a covered consumer product is prescribed; (2) monitor the improvements in efficiency; and (3) prescribe an energy efficiency standard whenever a certain type of consumer product type fails for three consecutive years to achieve at least half of the improvement under such guideline."
