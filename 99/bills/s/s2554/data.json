    "text": "Medicare Information Act - Title I: Information for Evaluation of and Maintenance of Quality Under the Prospective Payment System - Requires that the Medicare Automated Data Retrieval System, which is to provide integrated information on beneficiaries' claims under parts A (Hospital Insurance) and B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, include information for all fiscal years following FY 1979. Extends Medicare hospital cost reporting through FY 1993 (currently, required through FY 1988). Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the Congress, within a year of enactment of this Act, recommendations for revising hospital cost reporting so that information is provided which is appropriate for the timely evaluation of the prospective payment system. Makes the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation of the Department of Health and Human Services responsible for coordinating and overseeing the evaluation of the prospective payment system. Requires hospitals, by July 1, 1987, to use the HCFA Common Procedure Coding System to code the procedures performed in their outpatient departments on the bills they submit to Medicare's fiscal intermediaries. Title II: Research on Outcomes of Specific Medical Treatments and Surgical Procedures - Amends the Medicare program to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program providing for research regarding outcomes of selected medical treatments and surgical procedures so as to assess their quality and effectiveness. Places a priority on the selection of procedures and treatments with significant costs, risks, hospitalization periods, and utilization patterns. Authorizes appropriations from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for FY 1987 through 1993 to carry out such research. Requires that at least 90 percent of the funds available in any fiscal year be used to fund grants to, and cooperative agreements with, non-Federal research entities. Directs that the program be administered by the National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (Center). Requires the Center to report to the Congress, within 18 months of enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, on the findings of the project. Title III: National Medical Expenditure Survey - Amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a nationwide survey at least once a decade, beginning in 1987, on the impact Federal health care expenditures have on the health care costs faced by individuals and groups of individuals. Funds the survey from appropriations previously set aside for Department of Health and Human Services evaluation projects."
