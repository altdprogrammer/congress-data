Conditions such relief on State or local interests providing 50 percent of the costs of restoring public beaches, and 100 percent of the costs of restoring certain private beaches. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts to insure the provision of such non-Federal share of costs. Authorizes the Secretary, upon appropriate application, to guarantee up to 90 percent of loan obligations for such restoration. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study on what assistance for beach restoration in the affected area, in addition to this Act, is necessary to restore the beaches to their condition prior to the 1984 storms. Requires that a report on such study be submitted to the appropriate congressional committees not later than December 31, 1985."
