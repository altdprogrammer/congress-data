    "text": "Defense Procurement Improvement Act of 1985 - Requires the Secretary of Defense to prepare an acquisition strategy before the completion of the full scale engineering development of a major defense acquisition program. Requires the establishment and maintenance of two or more production sources as part of such strategy. Allows single production sources only in certain limited circumstances. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress explaining the planned acquisition strategy for each major defense acquisition program not later than the time that a budget request for initial production of the system is made. Requires the Secretary to explain the reasons for the use of a single production source if such is chosen. Requires the Secretary to perform a cost analysis for each major defense acquisition program for which a contract is to be awarded under other than competitive procedures. Provides for the waiver of such cost analysis in certain instances if the congressional Committees on Armed Services are properly notified of such waiver by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary of each military department to issue regulations establishing minimum requirements in education, training, and prior experience for program managers of major defense acquisition programs. Outlines minimum education and experience requirements for such program managers. Requires not less than 20 percent of the total number of military officers selected by the Army, Navy, and Air Force in any calendar year for promotion to the rank of brigadier general or commodore to have been dealing directly with the acquisition, support, and maintenance of weapons systems for six of the ten years prior to selection for promotion. Provides for waiver of such requirement in certain circumstances. Directs the Secretary of each military department to undertake certain training for quality assurance personnel. Amends military procurement provisions to increase the reporting and disclosure requirements for former employees of the Department of Defense concerning duties performed with defense contractors. Requires defense contractors employing such individuals to file a report with the Secretary of Defense with respect to the employment of such individual if such individual, during the two years before the individual became employed with the contractor and while employed with the Department of Defense, performed any duties pertaining to any contract between such contractor and the Department of Defense. Outlines information to be included in such report. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 and 1987 to carry out the procurement technical assistance cooperative agreements programs and certain administrative provisions of this Act."
