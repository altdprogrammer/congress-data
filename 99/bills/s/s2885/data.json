Excludes certain veterans' benefits (death benefits for service-connected disability, and specially-adapted housing, automobiles, and other adaptive equipment) from inclusion in the computation of reductions in any budget accounts required by any law providing for the cancellation of authority to make such payments. Requires the Administrator of Veterans Affairs, during any fiscal year in which the President issues a sequestration order limiting the total amount of VA home loan guaranty commitments allowed during that year, to submit to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees monthly reports on the VA's home loan guaranty program commitment activity to date and estimates of commitment activity for the remainder of that fiscal year."
