    "text": "Ambulatory Care Training Act of 1986 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the Congress by 1990 on the findings of a study into the need for, and the means of financing the costs of, increasing and improving graduate medical education in ambulatory care settings. Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to reimburse the costs of graduate medical education in ambulatory care settings, regardless of the location of such care (currently, to be reimbursed such care must occur at hospital cost centers), to the same extent to which inpatient training costs are reimbursed. Increases funding, up to July 1, 1990, for medical residency training programs which spend greater than 25 percent of the resident's time in an ambulatory care setting. Increases funding, up to July 1, 1990, for geriatric residency or fellowship programs. Requires the Secretary to annually publish data on payments made to hospitals for their medical residency training programs and the number of full-time equivalent residents in such hospitals. Requires, as of June 1, 1987, that foreign medical graduates pass the Foreign Medical Graduate Examinations (FMGEMS) and receive certification from the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates as prerequisites to their employer's receipt of Medicare payments for their direct and indirect graduate medical education costs. Prohibits Medicare coverage of the costs of more than one foreign graduate for each four U.S. graduates in a residency training program or for each six U.S. graduates in a fellowship program. Excludes from the latter ratio, foreign medical graduates in geriatric fellowship programs. Directs the Secretary to waive such ratio requirements for certain resident training programs if the foreign medical graduates in such programs provide medical care for indigent patients which would not otherwise be available to such patients. Requires the Secretary to carry out demonstration projects: (1) authorizing hospitals to utilize graduate medical education funds to employ practicing physicians and other health professionals, rather than nonqualifying foreign residents, in providing care to indigent patients; and (2) testing alternative methods of providing and funding graduate medical education in ambulatory care settings."
