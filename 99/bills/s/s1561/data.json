Excludes from claims for contribution any party which enters into a judicially approved good faith settlement or judgment with a State or the United States. Permits recovery from other potential defendants, either through a claim for contribution filed by a settling or already judged defendant or through direct action by a State or the United States, whenever a partial settlement or judgment has been secured."
