    "text": "New Clean Air Act - Amends the Clean Air Act to limit after 1991 the number of hours a fossil-fuel-burning electric generating facility which is a major stationary source of sulfur dioxide emissions may operate according to its emissions rate. Requires such major sources to attain by 1995 the best degree of emission reduction technically available. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to periodically publish demonstrated levels of emission reduction and to promulgate emission standards for oil shale production and processing facilities, synthetic fuels production facilities, and other categories of major energy-production sources. Sets emission standards for light-duty vehicles and engines for model years after 1989 and for heavy-duty vehicles and engines for model years after 1990. Prohibits the sale of diesel fuel with a sulfur content above a certain level determined by the Administrator. Requires State vehicle inspection programs to require emissions testing or direct inspection of components of vehicle emissions control systems. Provides for the assessment of daily civil penalties for violations of the fuel and fuel additive regulatory requirements. Directs the Administrator to implement a monitoring system for assessing the effects of acid deposition by 1988. Makes it a violation of the Clean Air Act if a State's air pollutant emissions contribute to the violation of another State's water quality standard under the Clean Water Act. Amends the Clean Water Act to state that such emissions endanger health or welfare abroad if they contribute to the violation of such country's water quality standards. Directs the President to negotiate with Canada and Mexico by 1987 to cooperate in reducing air pollution. Directs the President to negotiate treaties or other international agreements to apply uniform standards of performance for the control of air pollutant emissions. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to report to the Congress by 1989 on a system of tariffs on emissions sufficient to encourage reductions."
