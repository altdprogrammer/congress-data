    "text": "Trucking Competition Act of 1986 - Eliminates Interstate Commerce Commission jurisdiction over motor common carriers of property but temporarily retains such jurisdiction over: (1) motor common carriers of household goods; and (2) motor common carriers of property with regard to certification permits and tariffs. Terminates on July 1, 1987, Commission jurisdiction to prescribe rates for certain carriers who violate Commission rate criteria. Provides that all shipments over 100 pounds moved in interstate commerce shall be accompanied by a master shipping document presenting the terms and conditions of the transportation services provided. Directs the Commission to prescribe the minimum requirements of shipping documents. Terminates as of July 1, 1990, the excess tariff charge liability of motor common carriers of property whose rates are set collectively. Establishes in the Department of Transportation the Motor Carrier Administration to be headed by an Administrator (appointed by the President) who shall report directly to the Secretary of Transportation. Creates the position of Deputy Administrator to be appointed by the Secretary. Confers upon the Administrator duties and powers related to motor carriers and motor carrier safety under specified law. States that a decision of the Administrator implementing duties involving notice and hearing requirements is administratively final. Creates within the Motor Carrier Administration an Office of Small Business and Consumer Assistance. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to require motor carriers of property (other than household goods) to file annual business reports. Confers jurisdiction upon the Secretary over safety, insurance, cargo liability, and State rules affecting motor carriers of property and passengers operating in interstate or foreign commerce. Directs the Secretary to consolidate within the Department of Transportation motor carrier research, planning, and safety programs. Eliminates the environmental restoration requirement of the Motor Carrier Act. Preempts State economic regulations regarding interstate or intrastate rates, routes, or services of commercial vehicles transporting property (except household goods) in interstate commerce. Prohibits State imposition of discriminatory or retaliatory taxes against interstate trucking companies. Requires the Secretary to issue uniform standards applicable to State regulation of interstate motor carriers. Prohibits the States from imposing administrative requirements which violate the Federal standards. Amends the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 to expand highway access to large trucks (trailers or semitrailer configurations). Authorizes the Secretary to take action to respond to unfair practices against U.S. motor carriers of property by a contiguous foreign country. Terminates after September 30, 1987, Commission jurisdiction over motor carriers of property (except carriers of household goods and of property which set rates under agreements exempt from antitrust laws). Transfers to the Department of Transportation on October 1, 1987, Commission authority over motor carriers of property (except household goods) regarding safety fitness determination, insurance requirements, cargo liability, certification, and permits. Directs the Secretary to establish safety fitness requirements and to maintain safety compliance records over certain commercial motor vehicles and motor carriers in interstate commerce. Amends the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 to increase amounts authorized for motor carrier safety programs for FY 1987 and 1988. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 and 1990. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to conduct studies regarding: (1) the productivity, safety, and economic condition of owner-operators in the motor carrier industry; and (2) cargo liability requirements applicable to motor carriers of property and freight forwarders. Requires the Secretary to submit a report regarding such studies to the President and to the Congress."
