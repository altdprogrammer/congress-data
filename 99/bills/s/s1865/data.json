    "text": "Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to urge the President to take all appropriate and feasible steps to reduce or eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers to international trade and other distortions of international trade through: (1) the full exercise of U.S. rights under international agreements; and (2) the negotiation of trade agreements. Authorizes the President to enter into trade agreements during the five years following January 3, 1988, to reduce or eliminate trade barriers and distortions if the President finds that: (1) such barriers or distortions unduly restrict U.S. foreign trade or adversely affect the U.S. economy or are likely to result in such a restriction or effect; (2) the purposes of the Trade Act of 1974 will be promoted by the reduction or elimination of such barriers or distortions. Authorizes entering into a trade agreement only if the President, at least 150 days before such agreement is entered into: (1) notifies specified congressional committees of the negotiations of such agreement; (2) consults with each such committee regarding the negotiation; and (3) submits to each such committee a written statement of the specific negotiating objectives that the President anticipates will be achieved by such agreement and its implementing bill, a description of how such objectives will be achieved, and the specific negotiating objectives the President anticipates will not be achieved and the reasons for such failure. Provides that an implementing bill will not receive expedited congressional consideration if such conditions are not met or if a specified congressional committee disapproved the negotiation within 60 days of receiving notice of it. Requires the U.S. Trade Representative to consult with interested congressional committees at least once a year on such negotiations, their progress, and obstacles to the achievement of their objectives. Requires the President to consult with specified congressional committees before entering into any trade agreement. Requires the President, whenever entering into a trade agreement, to submit such agreement, together with a draft implementing bill and statement of proposed implementing administrative action to the Congress. Provides that a trade agreement submitted to the Congress shall enter into force with respect to the United States only if: (1) the President, at least 90 days before entering into such trade agreement, notified the Congress of the intent to enter into it and published notice of such intent; and (2) after entering into the agreement, the President sends the final legal text of the agreement to the Congress along with certain other information. Sets forth certain recommendations the President may make to the Congress to insure that foreign countries which benefit under a trade agreement are subject to obligations under the agreement. Directs the President, upon starting negotiations on a trade agreement to limit trade barriers, to try to obtain an interim agreement under which any country participating in such negotiations shall: (1) decline to impose new trade barriers or trade-distorting devices; and (2) reduce market intervention and allow market forces to govern growth of industries characterized by overcapacity or overproduction. Requires that the U.S. objectives in negotiating trade agreements under the basic authority to negotiate shall be to obtain: (1) more open, fair, and equitable market access; (2) the reduction or elimination of barriers and other trade-distorting practices; and (3) an appropriate overall balance between benefits and concessions within the agricultural, manufacturing, mining, and services sectors. Requires that the principal objectives in negotiating agreements to reduce trade barriers shall be to: (1) obtain, with respect to manufacturing, mining, agriculture, and services and with respect to related investments, equivalent competitive opportunities for U.S. exports; and (2) bring previously made trade agreements into conformity with principles promoting an open, nondiscriminatory, and fair world economic system. Authorizes the President for the five years following January 3, 1988, to: (1) proclaim an increase in an import duty or an imposition of an additional import duty in lieu of any limit on imports of an article; or (2) use import licenses in administering any of such limitations and sell such licenses at public auctions."
