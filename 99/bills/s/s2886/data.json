Exempts from such tax crude oil or refined petroleum products purchased for export. Sets the rate of such tax for crude oil as the difference between $20 per barrel and the average world price of crude oil per barrel. Sets the rate of such tax for refined petroleum products as $3 plus the crude oil tax."
