    "text": "Household Goods Transport Competition Improvements Act of 1986 - Amends Federal law regarding interstate household goods transportation to prohibit specified terms which have anti-competitive effects from appearing in agency contracts between household goods moving firms and motor common carriers of household goods. Declares that such provisions are unenforceable if they appear in contracts entered into before the date of enactment of this Act. Requires the Interstate Commerce Commission to: (1) consider the effects that pooling agreements between a motor common carrier of household goods and its agents may have upon the agent firms and all forms associated with such agent firms by common ownership; and (2) preserve the operational flexibility and competitive potentials of such agents and firms under common ownership with them."
