    "text": "Social Security Trust Funds Safeguard Act of 1986 - Amends titles II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) and XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require that all amounts appropriated to, or deposited in, a trust fund established under one of those programs be immediately and exclusively available for the purposes for which trust fund amounts are specifically made available under such program. Requires the President, in addition to appointing one member of the the public to the Board of Trustees of the social security trust funds (currently two members of the public are chosen), to appoint a Managing Trustee to the Board, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a term of four years. Provides that the Managing Trustee may be removed only for cause, but is prohibited from engaging in any other business, vocation, or employment. Requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide the Managing Trustee with appropriate assistance. Directs the Managing Trustee to invest that portion of the social security trust funds which is not required to meet current withdrawals in accordance with an annual investment plan submitted by the Board. Requires the Board to conduct a continuing study and actuarial analysis of the status of investments made by the Managing Trustee and, by August 1 of each year, formulate and submit to the President and each House of the Congress an investment plan to govern the investments of the social security trust funds during the fiscal year. Requires the annual investment plan to set forth standards governing the investment and disinvestment of the trust funds which ensure, so far as is possible, that the OASDI and Medicare programs fulfill their intended purposes in a fiscally and actuarially sound nonpartisan manner, free from the influence of irrelevant budgetary or fiscal considerations. Directs that such plan be accompanied by any recommendations of the Board regarding investment of the social security trust funds. Directs that the investment plan and recommendations be incorporated in a special message to each House. Sets a minimum and maximum on amounts of the social security trust funds to be invested in obligations which are not obligations of the United States but which are guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. Sets forth effective date and transitional provisions."
