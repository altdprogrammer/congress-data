Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1989. Provides formulae for the allotment of appropriated funds to the States. Establishes a minimum allotment of $50,000 for each State. Enumerates the purposes for which the States may use such allotments. Details the application procedures and grant requirements. Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from prescribing for a State the manner of compliance with such requirements. Allows the Secretary to use appropriated funds to provide immunosuppressive drug therapy to eligible patients residing in States which did not apply for or qualify for an allotment. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on the impact of this Act. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to authorize States to provide immunosuppressive drugs to individuals who have received organ transplants."
