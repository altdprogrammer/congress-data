Includes the following activities within the scope of this provision: (1) use of appropriated funds to counsel or encourage an abortion; (2) use of appropriated funds to reimburse or refer for abortions; (3) use of funds for research with respect to abortion; or (4) contracting for insurance which pays or reimburses for abortion. Prohibits any institution receiving Federal funds from discriminating against any employee, applicant, or student because of such person's opposition to abortion. Prohibits the granting of attorney fees in a civil action involving a law, ordinance, or regulation prohibiting abortion. Provides for Supreme Court review with regard to a law, ordinance, or regulation prohibiting abortion which a lower Federal court declares unconstitutional."
