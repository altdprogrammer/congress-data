Requires a producer wishing to participate in such program to submit a bid to the Secretary for a milk production termination contract. States that no contract shall be offered to a producer who began milk production after March 31, 1985. Subjects a person to civil penalties for false statements made in such a bid. Includes within such contracts provisions regarding: (1) marketing of dairy cattle for slaughter; and (2) limitations on dairy interest acquisitions. States that such program shall be carried out through the Commodity Credit Corporation."
