    "text": "Acid Deposition Control Act - Amends the Clean Air Act to establish an interstate transport and acid precursor reduction program. Designates an acid deposition impact region comprising a long-range transport corridor of 31 States east of the Mississippi and the District of Columbia. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to report to the Congress within two years on a study of long-range transport of pollutants in the remaining States. Sets forth sulfur dioxide emission reduction standards for the acid deposition impact region of ten million tons below 1980 levels within ten years, permitting annual emissions of no more than 1.2 pounds of sulfur dioxide per million British thermal units of heat input. Restricts increases in emissions from major stationary sources of oxides of nitrogen or sulfur dioxide, except as specified. Permits States to reallocate necessary reductions among themselves so long as the total reductions of the States involved meet the required standards. Requires each impact region State to adopt enforceable emission production measures for sulfur dioxide, including compliance schedules. Requires the Administrator's approval and other Governors' perusal of such measures. Requires each major stationary source subject to an emission limitation to notify the Governor of the State, who shall notify the Administrator, within four years of its intended method of compliance. Requires sources choosing fuel substitution to be in compliance with their applicable emission limitations within six years. Requires those sources complying through the installation of a technological system of continuous emission reduction or the replacement of facilities to have entered into binding contracts for the same within six years. Subjects owners of sources in noncompliance with the applicable implementation plans to the established emission limitation schedule and a noncompliance penalty. Permits the use of the following measures to reduce emissions in addition to enforceable continuous emission reduction measures if such measures are enforceable by entities and persons other than the State in which the emissions occur: (1) least emissions dispatch to meet electric generating demand at existing generating capacity; (2) retirement of major stationary sources at an earlier than provided for date; (3) investments in energy conservation where emission reductions can be identified with such investments; (4) trading of emission reduction requirements and actual reductions through emission reduction banks or brokerage institutions; and (5) precombustion cleaning of fuels. Permits sulfur emission reduction compliance by reducing emissions of oxides of nitrogen at a rate of two units by weight of oxides of nitrogen for each unit of sulfur dioxide. Makes it a violation of the Clean Air Act to emit an air pollutant which adversely affects the public health or welfare of another State or foreign country. Repeals primary nonferrous smelter orders which permitted temporary waivers of emissions reduction requirements. Revises motor vehicle emission and fuel standards to establish oxides of nitrogen emissions standards for light-duty vehicles and engines after model year 1989 and increase the useful life of such vehicles and engines. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to revoke or suspend an automobile manufacturer's certificate of compliance with motor vehicle emissions standards if fewer than 90 percent of vehicles or engines tested in any sample or sampling period conform with the requirements being certified. Requires State automobile inspection programs to: (1) require emissions testing or direct inspection of components of vehicle emissions control systems; and (2) the replacement of inoperative parts which control emissions of oxides of nitrogen. Directs the President to negotiate with Canada and Mexico to control air pollution and to enter international agreements to establish uniform standards of air pollution control."
