    "text": "Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to issue, upon request, a mineral exploration permit to the holder of any properly located, recorded, and maintained unperfected mineral claim within a certain area of the Admiralty Island National Monument (Alaska). Sets the term for such permits at five years and grants renewals for periods of five years so long as the applicant submits exploration plans. Terminates all permits by midnight, December 31, 2020. Precludes the Secretary from issuing any permit for a period terminating after December 2, 1985, unless the claim holder relinquishes to the United States all rights to receive a patent to the fee title in any land upon which a claim is located within the monument. Entitles certain claim holders to a patent to the minerals within claims for which: (1) patent rights to fee title are relinquished; or (2) valid discovery has been made."
