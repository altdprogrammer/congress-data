Includes the following as members in the JCS: (1) the Chairman; (2) the Vice Chairman; (3) the Chief of Staff of the Army and of the Air Force; (4) the Chief of Naval Operations; and (5) the Commandant of the Marine Corps. Requires the President, subject to waiver, to assign to JCS only officers who have served in one or more joint duty positions for a substantial period of time. Provides that the Chairman of JCS shall be the principal military adviser to the President, the National Security Council, and the Secretary of Defense. Requires the Chairman of JCS to: (1) convene regular JCS meetings; and (2) consult with and seek the advice of JCS members and commanders of the unified and specified combatant commands. Authorizes a member of JCS to present advice or an opinion in disagreement or in addition to advice provided by the Chairman. Sets forth administrative provisions concerning: (1) the appointment and term of the Chairman; (2) the Chairman's presiding over the JCS; and (3) other functions of the Chairman relating to the planning of military manpower, strategy, and readiness capabilities. Requires the Chairman, not less than once every three years or upon request from the President, to report to the Secretary of Defense concerning recommended changes in the function assignments of the armed forces. Establishes the position of the Vice Chairman of JCS, to exercise such duties as may be delegated by the Chairman with the approval of the Secretary of Defense. Requires the Vice Chairman to act as Chairman of JCS in the event of a vacancy in that position. Establishes in DOD a Joint Staff under the Chairman of JCS, to assist the chairman and other members of JCS in their responsibilities. Requires the Joint Staff to include officers selected by the Chairman in approximately equal numbers from the various military departments. Requires the Chairman, no later than one year after the enactment of this Act, to report to the Secretary of Defense concerning recommendations for changes in the function assignments of Joint Staff members. Adds a new chapter to general military law concerning the operation in the armed forces of combatant commands. Directs the President to establish unified and specified combatant commands to perform military missions, to prescribe the force structure of such commands, to review periodically and revise such missions and force structure, and to notify the Congress before establishing a new combatant command or significantly revising the force structure of an existing command. Requires all combatant forces of the military departments to be assigned to combatant commands.
