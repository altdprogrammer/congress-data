Limits the amount of such a grant to any institution or consortium to an amount equal to not more than $3,000 multiplied by the number of teachers, not to exceed 200, enrolled in such institute. Sets forth grant application requirements. Requires that such grants be made on the basis of excellence of the proposed program, taking into consideration certain elements. Allows funds available to institutions under this Act to be used to cover costs associated with enrollment in an institute. Directs the Secretary to assure equitable distribution of institutes among and within States, requiring at least one institute in each State. Provides that no grant to a single applicant may exceed $600,000 in any fiscal year. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988."
