Requires functions of the Bureau of Reclamation under this Act with respect to lands within the Sells Papago Reservation to be subject to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Act to the same extent as if performed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury, if the Tribe executes a waiver of claims against the United States with regard to the construction of the Tat Momolikot Dam, to pay the authorized governing body of the Tribe the sum of $3,000,000 for the benefit of the Tribe and $100,000 for the benefit of former residents of the Tat Momoli village for their relocation. Authorizes appropriations. Conditions the Secretary of the Interior's obligation to carry out functions under this Act upon tribal waiver of certain claims against the United States and the grant of appropriate rights with respect to the construction of the Tat Momolikot Dam."
