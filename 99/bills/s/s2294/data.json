Sets forth other requirements for continuing eligibility for such grants. Sets forth the minimum components required for a statewide system.

Sets forth State application requirements. Allows States to also use grant funds for: (1) direct services for handicapped infants and toddlers that are not otherwise provided by other sources; and (2) expansion and improvement of services that are otherwise available. Sets forth procedural safeguards required to be included in a statewide system. Prohibits funds under part H from being used to satisfy a financial commitment for services which would have been paid for from another source but for the enactment of part H, except that to prevent delay in the receipt of appropriate early intervention services such funds may be used to pay the provider of services pending reimbursement from the agency with ultimate responsibility.

Conditions eligibility for specified grants which relate exclusively to programs, projects, and activities pertaining to children aged three through five upon the State's eligibility to receive a pre-school grant.

Revises requirements that certain Federal funds supplement and not supplant other funds. Requires State to set forth policies and procedures for developing and implementing interagency agreements between the State educational agency and other appropriate State and local agencies.
