Provides for a term of imprisonment for any term of years or life. Makes it an offense for any person in an act of international terrorism to assault, wound, strike, imprison, endanger, or make any other violent attack upon the person or liberty of any U.S. citizen in any foreign country (or make violent attack on his or her official premises, private accommodation or means of transport). Provides for a fine of not more than $15,000 and/or imprisonment for not more than three years. Increases the fine to $10,000 and/or imprisonment to ten years if a deadly or dangerous weapon is used. Grants the United States jurisdiction over the offense if the alleged offender is present in the United States, irrespective of the place where the offense was committed or the nationality of the victim or the alleged offender. Authorizes the Attorney General to receive assistance of any Federal, State, or local agency (including the military) in enforcing this provision."
