Requires States providing coverage under this Act to provide Medicaid coverage, pursuant to the Medicaid Infant Mortality Amendments of 1986, to pregnant women and infants whose income does not exceed the State maximum income level. Title II: Optional Coverage of Poor Medicare Beneficiaries for Medicare Cost-Sharing Expenses - Authorizes the States to provide Medicaid coverage for Medicare (title XVIII of the Act) premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance payments for which Medicare-eligible individuals whose income does not exceed the State maximum income level would otherwise be accountable."
