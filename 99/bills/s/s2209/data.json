Removes SSI limitations for the first two months of an individual's stay in a health facility if such individual: (1) was eligible for the benefits made permanent by this Act during the month preceding admission to the facility; and (2) is permitted by the facility to retain such benefits. Requires State Medicaid plans to disregard such benefits in determining the recipient's required contribution to the cost of care. Sets forth provisions regarding the timing of medical determinations as to an individual's eligibility for SSI benefits or the benefits made permanent by this Act, including the provision that individuals whose income renders them ineligible for such benefits for less than one year may be reinstated without undergoing a disability determination. Specifies the factors which must be taken into account in determining whether a disabled individual's earnings provide a \"reasonable equivalent\" of SSI and Medicaid benefits and thereby disqualify the individual from Medicaid coverage under the SSI program. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, when any individual receives SSI benefits on the basis of a disability, to notify such individual of his or her potential eligibility for the benefits available to those performing substantial gainful activity despite a severe medical impairment. Provides that when an individual becomes ineligible for SSI benefits upon entitlement to or an increase in child's insurance benefits under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Act, such individual shall be treated for Medicaid purposes as continuing to receive SSI benefits so long as he or she would otherwise be eligible for such benefits. Prohibits States which use more restrictive Medicaid eligibility criteria than those used by the SSI program from terminating the coverage of individuals who would be eligible under the State plan but for their eligibility for the special benefits made permanent by this Act."
