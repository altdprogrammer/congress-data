    "as": "Senate agreed to House amendment with amendment", 
    "date": "1986-10-03", 
    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendments with an amendment) Special Foreign Assistance Act of 1986 - Title I: Promoting Immunization and Oral Rehydration in Developing Countries - Calls upon the President to direct the Agency for International Development (AID) to work in a global effort to provide universal access to childhood immunization by 1990 by: (1) assisting in the delivery, distribution, and use of vaccines; and (2) performing and supporting research and development activities that will be targeted at developing new vaccines and at modifying existing vaccines to make them more appropriate for use in developing countries. Declares that the President should appeal to the public to provide the necessary resources to achieve universal access to childhood immunization by 1990. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to: (1) earmark $50,000,000 for promoting immunization and oral rehydration in developing countries; and (2) increase the authorization of appropriations for FY 1987 for the Child Survival Fund. Title II: Promoting Democracy in Haiti - Earmarks for Haiti specified amounts of FY 1987 funds from the: (1) Economic Support Fund; (2) development assistance funds; (3) Food for Peace programs; and (4) Inter-American Foundation. Provides that assistance from the Economic Support Fund and the development assistance programs may be obligated for assistance for Haiti only if it is determined that the Government of Haiti is meeting specified conditions, including improving its human rights record, continuing to cooperate in halting illegal emigration to the United States, and encouraging private sector development. Permits payment of the Economic Support Fund assistance to Haiti only if such funds are kept in a separate account. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 to increase the FY 1987 authorization for the Inter-American Foundation. Declares that a Foreign Commercial Service officer should be assigned to the U.S. embassy in Haiti in order to assist in the economic development in Haiti. Earmarks for Haiti a specified amount of the total amounts available for FY 1987 for grant military assistance, international military education and training, and foreign military sales assistance. Permits such assistance to be obligated only if the President certifies to the Congress that: (1) Haiti has submitted a formal request to the United States specifying a comprehensive plan for reorganization of Haiti's military; and (2) Haiti is making substantial efforts to prevent the involvement of the Haitian armed forces in human rights abuses, to protect freedom of speech and assembly, to investigate the killings of certain unarmed civilians, to educate the armed forces about respect for the rights essential to democracy, and to require the former members of the Volunteers for National Security to turn in their weapons. Requires the President to report to the Congress every three months on the extent to which Haiti's actions are consistent with such objectives. Permits the military assistance and the international military and education funds to be obligated for Haiti only if specified congressional committees are notified 15 days in advance. Directs the President to use the President's authorities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to assist Haiti in its efforts to recover Haitian assets which Haiti alleges were stolen by Jean Claude Duvalier or his associates. Title III: Protecting Tropical Forests and Biological Diversity in Developing Countries - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to direct the President, in providing assistance to developing countries, to: (1) place a high priority on conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests; and (2) take certain steps to achieve the objectives of this Act (including engaging in dialogues on conserving forest resources and information exchanges with recipient countries, supporting projects and activities which offer alternatives to colonizing forests, supporting related training and research programs, helping to end destructive agricultural practices, and denying any assistance for certain activities harmful to the forests). Directs the President, whenever feasible, to accomplish the objectives of this Act through projects managed by private and voluntary and other nongovernmental organizations. Requires the annual report to the Congress on foreign aid programs to include a report on the implementation of this Act. Requires that each country plan prepared by AID include an analysis of actions necessary to achieve conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests and the extent such actions meet the needs identified. Allocates a specified amount of the development assistance funds to help developing countries protect and maintain wildlife habitats and develop sound wildlife management and plant conservation programs. Requires each country development strategy statement or other country plan prepared by AID to include an analysis of: (1) the actions necessary in that country to achieve conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests; and (2) the extent to which the actions proposed for support by AID meet the needs thus identified. States that, whenever feasible, such protection, maintenance, management, and conservation activities shall be accomplished through projects managed by private and voluntary organizations and other nongovernmental organizations which are active in the project region. Directs the Administrator of AID to take certain steps, including: (1) cooperating with appropriate organizations; (2) looking to the World Conservation Strategy as an overall guide; (3) engaging in dialogues and exchanges of information with recipient countries which stress the importance of conserving biological diversity; (4) supporting training and education which improve the capacity of recipient countries to prevent loss of biological diversity; (5) the denial of any assistance for actions which invade or significantly degrade national parks or similar protected areas; and (6) cooperating with and supporting the relevant efforts of other Federal agencies. Requires the annual report to the Congress on foreign aid programs to include a report on implementation of this Act. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions Relating to Certain Foreign Assistance Programs - Increases the FY 1987 authorization for international narcotics control. Earmarks a specified amount of the FY 1987 operating expenses of AID for the necessary operating expenses of the Office of the Inspector General of AID. Increases the number of members of the Board of Directors of the Inter-American Foundation. Makes offsetting reductions in the FY 1987 authorizations for development assistance health programs and for international organizations and programs in order to provide for the increased FY 1987 authorizations for the Inter-American Foundation, international narcotics control, and the Child Survival Fund."
