    "text": "Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to increase the duty on petroleum and petroleum products imported into the United States by ten dollars per barrel. Authorizes appropriations to the President to provide or increase funding for financial assistance to lower income individuals and families adversely affected by increased energy costs by an amount equal to the increased duty imposed by this Act. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Energy to determine the monetary effect of such duty on such individuals and families. Amends the Social Security Act to transfer the revenues created by such duty to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to reduce, from time to time, the tax rates relating to old-age, survivors, and disability insurance by an amount equal to the net revenues attributable to the duty imposed by this Act. Provides that the residents of no State shall receive a portion of such tax reductions that is disproportionate to the portion received by residents of another State."
