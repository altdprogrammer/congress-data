Directs the President to place special emphasis on grants to international and African non-governmental organizations and to U.S. private and voluntary organizations for such projects. Requires the Director of the Administrator of the Agency for International Development (AID) and the Director of the Peace Corps to: (1) assess the opportunities for their agencies to support such projects in Africa; and (2) place a high priority on providing such support. Sets forth requirements for the use of funds made available for such projects. Requires the annual report to the Congress on foreign aid programs to include a report on the implementation of this Act. Directs the Administrator of AID to study and report to the Congress within five years of enactment of this Act on the projects funded pursuant to this Act and their effectiveness in preventing famine. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 to carry out this Act."
