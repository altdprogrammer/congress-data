    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-01-22", 
    "text": "Trade Expansion Act of 1985 - Title I: Trade Negotiations - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should initiate trade negotiations with U.S. trading partners as soon as possible. Sets forth the principal objectives of such trade negotiations, including establishment of more effective rules governing trade in agriculture and strengthening of the safeguards provision of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Title II: Trade Adjustment Assistance - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to delete the current provision requiring job training or job searches by workers who apply for trade readjustment allowances. Changes the formulas for determining the amount of and the limitation on readjustment allowances. Declares that each adversely affected worker covered by a certification shall be eligible for a job training voucher which shall be in the amount of $4,000 and may be used only to defray the cost of certain training programs. Sets forth certain limitations on the use of such vouchers. Limits the amount of allowable subsistence and travel expenses. Repeals the provisions providing adjustment assistance for firms and communities. Establishes a Trade Adjustment Assistance Trust Fund within the Treasury. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to the Congress on the Trust Fund. Authorizes appropriations to the Trust Fund. Terminates the trade adjustment assistance programs four years after the first day after the date of enactment of this Act on which the GATT permits any country to impose a uniform duty on all imports to fund a trade adjustment assistance program for workers. Directs the President to undertake negotiations to change the GATT so that any country could impose a small uniform duty on all imports to fund a trade adjustment assistance for workers. Imposes such a duty on all imports into the United States. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to tax trade readjustment assistance but not job training vouchers. Title III: Import Relief Amendments to Title II of the Trade Act of 1974 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the International Trade Commission (ITC), in investigating import relief petitions, to estimate the short- and long-term effects of a new or additional duty on private and industrial consumers. Directs the ITC to examine factors other than imports which are a cause of injury or threat of injury to a domestic industry. Requires the President to include in the report to the Congress on a decision to grant import relief a description of all actions which are being taken by workers, firms, and local, State and Federal Governments to combat such injury-causing factors to enable the domestic industry concerned to compete more effectively with imports. Requires the ITC to evaluate and report to the Congress and the President on the effectiveness of import relief after such relief has terminated. Title IV: Countervailing and Antidumping Duties - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require imposition of a countervailing duty if the ITC determines certain injuries occur because of a subsidy. (Current law requires imposition of a countervailing duty if such injuries are caused by imports of subsidized merchandise.) Requires imposition of an antidumping duty if the ITC determines that certain injuries occur because of sales at less than fair value of imports. Prohibits acceptance of any agreement to suspend investigation of subsidized imports or of dumping after the ITC has made a final determination with respect to a countervailing or antidumping duty investigation. Authorizes appeals of antidumping and countervailing duty decisions in the Federal Court of Appeals. Sets forth the precedence of certain cases in the Court of International Trade. Provides for election of expedited procedures for antidumping and countervailing duty investigations. Permits the use of sampling and averaging to determine the U.S. price of imports and the foreign market value of imports."
