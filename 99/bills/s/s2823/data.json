    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1986-09-16", 
    "text": "Satellite Television Security and Fair Marketing Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to subject any person who willfully or maliciously interferes with the operation of any satellite or the transmission of any satellite communication to up to a $250,000 fine and ten years' imprisonment. Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to commence an inquiry into equipment, methods, and systems for detecting and preventing such violations and other satellite communication signal interference. Requires any person who encrypts any satellite cable programming for private viewing: (1) to make such programming available for private viewing by home satellite antenna users; (2) if such person uses cable systems to distribute such programming to home satellite antenna users, to not restrict such systems from selling outside of their franchised areas, to not discriminate in price, terms, or conditions based on whether sale of such programming is for cable subscribers or home satellite antenna users, to establish reasonable financial and character criteria under which noncable distributors may qualify to distribute such programming to home satellite antenna users, and to not discriminate among different distributors offering similar distribution services; and (3) to conduct such encryption according to FCC-approved standards designed to comply with specified criteria. Authorizes aggrieved persons to commence civil actions to enforce this Act. Redefines \"satellite cable programming\" and defines \"home satellite antenna user\" and \"reasonable financial and character criteria\" for purposes of such Act."
