Requires the head of an agency to exclude from consideration for a contract exceeding $100,000 a firm in which a hostile foreign government or covered foreign national owns or controls a significant interest. Directs the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations listing hostile foreign governments. Makes this Act inapplicable to the Coast Guard or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration."
