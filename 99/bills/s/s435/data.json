Establishes aggregate insured and guaranteed loan limits at $500,000. Sets forth application and program provisions. Authorizes the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) to make a separate home loan to a defaulting farmer whose loan was secured by such home. Sets a maximum repayment period of 25 years. States that borrowers shall not be required to provide more collateral than is necessary to secure a consolidated loan. Requires FmHA to hold foreclosed land in a five-year inventory, subject to redemption by the borrower."
