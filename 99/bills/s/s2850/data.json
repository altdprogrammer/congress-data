    "text": "Drug Enforcement Act of 1986 - Title I: White House Initiative Against Drugs - Subtitle A: Drug-Free Federal Workplace Act of 1986 - Drug-Free Federal Workplace Act of 1986 - Amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to provide that any individual who is otherwise handicapped shall not be excluded from the protections of such Act because that individual uses illegal drugs.

Subtitle D: Drug Interdiction and International Cooperation - Part I: Mansfield Amendment - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to permit any U.S. officer or employee to assist foreign law enforcement officers in making arrests or to take direct action in an arrest action in a foreign country to protect the life or safety of U.S. or foreign officers or the public. Part II: Narcotics Traffickers Deportation Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide for the exclusion or deportation of any alien for possession or use of certain controlled substances. Part III: Customs Enforcement - Customs Enforcement Act of 1986 - Subpart A: Tariff Act Amendments - Requires the master of any vessel arriving at any U.S. or Virgin Island port to report such arrival at the nearest customs facility if such vessel is: (1) from a foreign port or place; (2) a foreign vessel from a domestic port; or (3) a U.S. vessel carrying bonded merchandise or foreign merchandise for which entry has not been made. Requires vehicles arriving in the United States to enter only at designated border crossing points. Requires the person in charge of such a vehicle to report the arrival of such vehicle, and present the vehicle and all persons and merchandise on board for inspection to the customs officer.

Increases the penalties for illegal unloading and transshipment. Makes aviation smuggling unlawful. Prohibits the at sea transfer of controlled substances between U.S. owned aircraft and vessels. Prohibits the at sea transfer of prohibited merchandise between aircraft and vessels, regardless of the nationality of either, where the intent is to smuggle the merchandise into the United States. Imposes penalties, including seizure of the aircraft or vessel, for violations of such anti-smuggling provisions. Specifies certain acts that, if engaged in within 250 miles of the U.S. territorial seas, shall be: (1) presumed to indicate intent to smuggle; and (2) deemed prima facia evidence that the aircraft or vessel was used in aiding or facilitating such smuggling. Changes the procedures for the seizure and forfeiture of conveyances used in smuggling to require that a common carrier be seized and forfeited under certain circumstances. Authorizes the issuance of search warrants for places suspected of containing: (1) merchandise brought into the United States unlawfully; (2) property which is subject to forfeiture under the customs laws; or (3) articles which are evidence of a customs violation. Authorizes the seizure and forfeiture of smuggled merchandise. Requires that any deposit made in lieu of forfeiture of property seized under customs laws be treated in the same manner as the proceeds of a sale of any forfeited item. Provides that the expenses of a forfeiture proceeding shall be a priority claim in the same manner as court costs.
