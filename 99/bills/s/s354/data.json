Declares that the Mille Lacs Band shall be known by the official name, Mille Lacs Federation of Chippewas. Declares the Federation to be a self-governing Indian tribe and authorizes it to adopt a constitution and bylaws. Makes the Federation eligible for all Federal services and benefits which are provided to Indians because of their status as Indians. Sets forth partition guidelines for trust lands held in trust for the benefit of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. Substitutes the Federation as a party in pending litigation brought by or on behalf of the Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians. Sets forth guidelines for the award and allocation of judgment funds between the Federation and the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. Amends the Federal criminal code and the judicial code to remove certain Federal jurisdiction over lands under the tribal jurisdiction of the Federation."
