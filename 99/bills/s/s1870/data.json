Delcares that the Secretaries should extend the length of assignment of such personnel in order to ensure greater continuity in promoting U.S. exports. Requires each chief of a U.S. mission to a country that is an important trading partner and which has significant potential for U.S. export sales to report annually to the President and the Congress on: (1) the strategy used by such mission to expand U.S. exports; and (2) the efforts of such mission to assist U.S. industries in expanding export sales and in improving their market position. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) each U.S. Executive Director to a multilateral development bank should take specified actions to promote procurement opportunities for U.S. firms; and (2) a Foreign Commercial Officer should be assigned to each such Director to help promote such opportunities. Requires each Federal agency, before taking any major action that may affect international trade, to prepare and publish a report on the potential impact of such action on U.S. international trade and on the ability of U.S. firms to compete in foreign markets. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, through the International Trade Administration, to develop and maintain an effective system to collect and disseminate information on international trade to U.S. exporters. Sets forth information to be included in such system."
