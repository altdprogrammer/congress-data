Disallows any income tax deduction for: (1) any \"greenmail payment\" made in connection with a corporate takeover; or (2) any interest paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred to acquire stock in a corporation pursuant to a hostile offer. Defines \"greenmail payment\" as any payment made by a corporation in redemption of stock of such corporation which is held by a four-percent shareholder if: (1) such shareholder held such stock for less than two years; and (2) during the two-year period ending on the date of such sale or exchange there was a public tender offer for stock in such corporation."
