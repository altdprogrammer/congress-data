    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require any person who encrypts any satellite cable programming for private viewing: (1) to make such programming available for private viewing by home satellite antenna users; and (2) if such person uses cable systems to distribute such programming to home satellite antenna users, to not restrict such systems from selling outside of their franchise areas, to not discriminate in price, terms, or conditions based on whether sale of such programming is for cable subscribers or home satellite antenna users, to establish reasonable financial and character criteria under which noncable distributors may qualify to distribute such programming to home satellite antenna users, and to not discriminate among different qualified distributors offering similar distribution services. Authorizes aggrieved persons to commence civil actions to enforce this Act."
