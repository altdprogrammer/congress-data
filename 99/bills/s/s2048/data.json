Directs the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to consult with interested nations for the development of international guidelines for research, exploration, and, if appropriate, salvage of the Titanic which: (1) are consistent with its historical and cultural significance; and (2) promote the safety of those involved in such operations. Directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Administrator, to negotiate an international agreement providing for: (1) the designation of the Titanic as an international maritime memorial; and (2) international research, exploration, and, if appropriate, salvage of the Titanic consistent with the international guidelines to be established. Sets forth reporting requirements for the Secretary and the Administrator. Expresses the sense of the Congress that, while limited research and exploration of the site should continue, no person should conduct research or exploration which physically alters, disturbs, or salvages the Titanic pending adoption of international guidelines or an international agreement. Provides that the United States does not, by enactment of this Act, assert sovereignty or exclusive right or jurisdiction over, or ownership of, any marine areas or the Titanic."
