    "text": "Agricultural Trade Enhancement Act of 1985 - Establishes an Agricultural Trade Committee composed of the Secretary of Agriculture, the U.S. Trade Representative, and other persons appointed by the President. Directs the Committee to: (1) identify all major unfair trade practices of foreign countries that adversely affect farm commodities and their products; (2) develop recommendations for eliminating or mitigating such adverse effects; and (3) report its findings and recommendations to the President within six months of enactment of this Act. Terminates the Committee after submission of its report. Directs the President, as soon as practicable after submission of such report, to: (1) use any remedies available under any international agreement to eliminate or mitigate the adverse effects of the unfair practices identified by the Committee; and (2) direct the appropriate agencies to take the necessary steps to eliminate or mitigate such adverse effects. Amends the Food for Peace Act of 1966 to authorize the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to guarantee credits made to finance commercial export sales of agricultural commodities out of private stocks to certain developing countries. Authorizes the CCC to provide intermediate credit financing to promote the export sales of farm commodities. Deletes specified limits on the credit terms for such sales and on the resale or transshipment of such commodities. Directs the Secretary to carry out the CCC export credit sales program including the credit guarantee program using not less than $500,000,000 for each of FY 1985 through 1988. Limits the duration of any restriction imposed on exports of farm commodities or the products of such commodities to 60 days. Prohibits such limitation from applying during a war declared by the Congress."
