    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #376 (56-35)) White Earth Reservation Land Settlement Act of 1985 - Provides procedures for: (1) resolving claims and clearing titles (by statutory ratification) to certain lands on the White Earth Indian Reservation, Minnesota; and (2) compensating for loss of allotments resulting from such ratification. States which categories of allotments are and are not eligible for compensation under this Act. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) determine, and publish a list of, all applicable allotments (allowing, within a specified time, for the submission, determination, and publication of additional applicable allotments); (2) make determinations of heirships to lands subject to applicable allotments; (3) locate and notify allottees or heirs; (4) establish the fair market value of the various types of land subject to applicable allotments for various years, which shall govern the compensation payable under this Act; and (5) distribute such compensation. Provides a formula for fixing such compensation. Allows judicial review of the Secretary's compensation determinations up to a specified period (after which such determinations shall be conclusive). Gives exclusive jurisdiction over such actions to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. Makes this Act conditional on: (1) Minnesota entering into an agreement to transfer 10,000 acres to the United States in trust for the White Earth Band of Chippewa Indians and appropriating $500,000 for assisting the United States with the administration of this Act; and (2) congressional authorization of specified amounts for the economic development of the White Earth Band of Chippewas. Requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register notice that such conditions have been met. Provides, after such publication, for: (1) the ratification of certain allotments and the extinguishment of claims against the United States and Minnesota arising out of transactions involving those allotments; and (2) the prohibition of certain court actions to recover damages or titles to lands covered by those allotments. Prohibits immediately upon enactment of this Act, and if such publication takes place, any action on behalf of the White Earth Band of Chippewa Indians. Permits individual actions to be filed only within a specified time after such publication. Prohibits an individual from receiving compensation under this Act after such an action is filed. States the intention that: (1) no title to lands on the White Earth Reservation shall be rendered unmarketable solely because of the Secretary's determinations under this Act; and (2) that no individual be compensated twice for the same interest in an allotment. Establishes the White Earth Economic Development and Tribal Government Fund for the collective benefit of the White Earth Band of Chippewa Indians (subject to a Band Financial Ordinance and Investment Plan and a waiver of U.S. liability for any loss as a result of the use of such funds). Requires forfeiture into such Fund of any compensation due for which allottees cannot be located. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Secretary to: (1) complete all of the administrative work necessary to accomplish the objectives of this Act within five years; and (2) make various reports to the Congress. Exempts funds or income distributed under this Act from Federal and State income taxes or eligibility determinations with respect to assistance under the Social Security Act or other Federal programs."
