Authorizes the Administrator to request the Secretary of Labor to assign disabled veterans' outreach program specialists to such Centers as appropriate. Requires the Deputy Administrator of Veterans Affairs to administer the pilot program. Directs the Administrator, by April 1, 1987, to report on the pilot program to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House and the Senate. Outlines information to be included in such report. Provides for termination of the pilot program three years after the date it is established."
