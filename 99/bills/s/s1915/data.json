    "text": "Central American Counterterrorism and Law Enforcement Professionalization Act of 1985 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to earmark certain FY 1986 antiterrorism assistance funds for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Terminates such funding if it is used to engage in torture. Permits U.S. personnel to provide advice outside the United States on antiterrorism matters to such countries for up to 90 days. Exempts the aid provided by this Act from the ban on: (1) training outside the United States; (2) the use of State Department personnel for such training; and (3) providing most intelligence gathering services, equipment, and facilities in such antiterrorism aid programs. Permits training to be conducted outside the United States if specified congressional committees are notified 15 days before funds are obligated for such training. Prohibits providing any of the funds made available for such antiterrorism assistance through any U.S. intelligence agency. Prohibits providing such antiterrorism aid to Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras, until the President reports to the Congress that: (1) the security forces of such country are not engaged in systematic human rights violations, and the leadership of such forces are committed to eradicating all human rights violations; (2) the government of such country is making substantial progress in creating effective law enforcement and judicial systems; (3) any aid will achieve the purpose of professionalizing independent law enforcement agencies; and (4) such country has formally requested such aid. Prohibits obligating or spending any such funds for any such country on or after July 1, 1986, unless the President on June 30, 1986, submits another such report to the Congress. Directs the Comptroller General to make periodic reports to the Congress during 1986 which: (1) describe the progress made by each such country receiving aid toward achieving the goals on which the President reports to the Congress; and (2) include a determination on whether any such country receiving such aid has engaged in acts of torture or abuse of prisoners. Prohibits providing any such aid to Guatemala unless in addition to the other requirements of this Act the President certifies to the Congress that: (1) an elected civilian government is in power in Guatemala; and (2) the newly elected government has demonstrated substantial progress in controlling its military and security forces, toward eliminating human rights abuses by such forces, and in respecting the human rights of its indigenous Indian population. Authorizes making certain weapons on the U.S. Munitions list available for FY 1986 for such antiterrorism assistance only if the President notifies the Congress of the proposed transfer 15 days before the articles are made available. Limits the percentage of equipment provided for antiterrorism assistance for such countries that may be lethal equipment. Prohibits making shock batons or similar devices available. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to authorize the Secretary of State to reimburse through the Counterterrorism Protection Fund, persons, agencies, or governments for the protection of those who provide assistance or information relating to terrorist incidents. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 for the Fund and for all antiterrorism assistance programs."
