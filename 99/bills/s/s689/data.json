    "text": "African Famine Relief and Recovery Act of 1985 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to provide assistance for famine relief, rehabilitation, and recovery in Africa. Requires that the funds appropriated for such relief shall be used primarily for grants to private and voluntary organizations and international organizations. Requires that a significant portion of the amount appropriated for such relief be used for emergency health projects. Authorizes transferring a specified portion of the amount appropriated for such relief to the operating expenses of the Agency for International Development. Authorizes supplemental appropriations for FY 1985 for such relief. Authorizes supplemental appropriations for FY 1985 to the Department of State for migration and refugee assistance in Africa. Authorizes making available to the United Nations Office of Emergency Operations in Africa up to 54 percent of such funds to address the needs created by refugees and displaced persons in Africa. Provides that the remainder of such funds shall be used by the Bureau for Refugee Programs of the Department of State for emergency relief and recovery efforts in Africa. Provides for reimbursement of the Department of Defense if the Department of Defense furnishes goods or services for African supplemental famine assistance. Requires that amounts appropriated pursuant to this Act shall be available only for aid in those African countries that have suffered during 1984 and 1985 from exceptional food supply problems due to drought and other calamities. Directs the President to ensure that adequate procedures have been established so that assistance is provided to the famine victims for whom it is intended. Directs the President to report to the Congress by June 30, 1985, on the U.S. contribution to meet emergency needs for African famine assistance. Requires the President to submit to the Congress a final report on this Act by September 30, 1985. Sets forth the information to be included in such report."
