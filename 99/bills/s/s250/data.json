    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-01-22", 
    "text": "Agricultural Price Support Act of 1985 - Title I: Wheat - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to set loan and purchase rates at $3.30 per bushel for the 1986 through 1990 wheat crops. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to reduce such levels, but not by more than ten percent nor below $3.00 per bushel. Limits total loan and purchase amounts available to any one producer. Sets target prices at between $4.48 and $4.18 per bushel depending on the number of bushels. Authorizes the Secretary to adjust such prices. Directs the Secretary to: (1) increase target prices if he adjusts loan and purchase rates in order to provide the same total return; (2) make reduced yield or prevented planting disaster payments as necessary; (3) proclaim a national program acreage by July 1 of each year (for 1986 as soon as practicable after passage of this Act); and (4) determine a program allocation factor (between 100 percent and 80 percent) for each wheat crop. Makes producers who have Federal crop insurance available to them ineligible for disaster payments. Stipulates that the Secretary may make such payments to alleviate an economic emergency or when crop insurance indemnity payments are insufficient. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for either an acreage limitation or a set-aside program. Provides that such land shall be used for conservation purposes, including grazing and growing specified commodities. Authorizes the Secretary to make land diversion payments whether or not an acreage limitation or set-aside program is in effect, in order to adjust the total national acreage. Makes specified certificate requirements and section 107 (wheat price support levels) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 inapplicable to the 1986 through 1990 wheat crops. Suspends specified quota, marketing quota, and producer certificate provisions for such crops. Title II: Feed Grains - Sets loan and purchase rates at $2.55 per bushel for the 1986 through 1990 corn crops. Authorizes the Secretary to reduce such levels, but not by more than ten percent nor below $2.00 per bushel. Directs the Secretary to make loans and purchases for the 1986 through 1990 crops of grain sorghum, barley, oats, and rye in relation to corn. Sets forth target prices based on bushels: (1) for corn at between $3.13 and $2.83 per bushel; (2) for barley at between $2.70 and $2.40 per bushel; and (3) for oats at between $1.70 and $1.40 per bushel. Sets forth provisions parallel to those in title I (wheat) of this Act regarding: (1) individual loan and purchase limits; (2) target price adjustments; (3) disaster payments; (4) national program acreage (November 15 proclamation date); (5) program allocation factor; (6) acreage limitation or set-aside programs; and (7) land diversion payments. Makes section 105 (feed grains) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 inapplicable to the 1986 through 1990 feed grain crops. Title III: Soil Conservation - Makes persons producing agricultural commodities on highly erodible land ineligible for price supports, crop insurance, storage facility construction loans, disaster payments, or other specified agricultural loans. Provides exceptions for: (1) crops produced using approved conservation methods; and (2) certain previously cultivated land. Directs the Secretary to: (1) use the agricultural stabilization and conservation committees to help administer this Act; (2) establish a land classification appeal procedure; and (3) complete specified soil capability class surveys. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts of at least five years to remove acreage from crop production and place such acreage in specified conservation uses, including protective vegetative cover. Directs the Secretary to pay the producer: (1) an annual payment; and (2) a part of the costs in establishing and maintaining such conservation uses. Sets forth contract modification and termination provisions, including judicial review. Provides civil penalties for grazing or harvesting crops from land under such contract. Authorizes appropriations. Title IV: Agricultural Export Promotion - Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President and the Secretary of Agriculture should take specified actions to promote U.S. agricultural exports. Title V: Wool and Mohair - Amends the National Wool Act of 1954 to extend wool and mohair price supports through 1990. Title VI: Payment Limitations for Wheat and Feed Grains - Sets forth payment limitations (including a separate disaster payment limitation) for the 1986 through 1990 wheat and feed grain crops."
