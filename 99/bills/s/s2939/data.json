States that the fuel economy of methanol powered automobiles (or dual fuel automobiles) shall be based on the fuel content of the methanol mixture used to operate such automobiles. Prescribes the content of fuel economy labeling for methanol powered and dual fuel automobiles. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to report annually to the Congress, starting January 1993, regarding the effects of this Act: (1) upon methanol and gasoline consumption on an industrywide and manufacturer-specific basis; and (2) certain fuel economy standards on an industrywide and manufacturer-specific basis."
