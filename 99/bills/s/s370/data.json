    "text": "African Famine Relief and Recovery Act of 1985 - Title I: Authorizations of Appropriations - Authorizes supplemental appropriations for FY 1985 for famine relief in Africa for: (1) agricultural development programs; (2) international disaster assistance programs; (3) development program operating expenses; and (4) the Migration and Refugee Assistance account of the State Department. Title II: Appropriations - Makes supplemental appropriations for FY 1985 to: (1) the Department of Agriculture for Public Law 480; (2) the Agency for International Development for specified agriculture, rural development, and nutrition programs, for international disaster assistance, and for operating expenses; and (3) the Department of State for migration and refugee assistance. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, in order to prevent waste of commodities acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation through price support operations, to make at least 300,000 metric tons of agricultural commodities available for FY 1985, provided that at least one third of such commodities are wheat or wheat products. Declares that funds appropriated for Public Law 480, for agriculture, rural development, and nutrition programs (other than funds for rehabilitation and recovery projects), and for international disaster assistance shall be available only for those African countries which suffer from exceptional food supply problems in 1985 due to drought and other calamities. Permits the use of Public Law 480 funds to reimburse certain ongoing famine relief programs. Permits FY 1985 funds to be carried into FY 1986. Declares that funds for rehabilitation and recovery projects and for migration and refugee assistance shall be available only to those African countries which have suffered in the last two years from exceptional food supply problems due to drought and other calamities."
