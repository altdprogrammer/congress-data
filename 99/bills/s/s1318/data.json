    "text": "Coast Guard User Fee Authorization Act of 1985 - Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to establish a system of fees to be charged to users of Coast Guard services. Prohibits the operating expenses of certain specified Coast Guard programs, including waterways management, from being recovered through such user fees. Outlines factors to be considered by the Secretary in establishing such user fees. Outlines those users of Coast Guard services from whom the Secretary may collect such fees, including owners and operators of vessels or recreational boats, licensees of the Coast Guard, and manufacturers of boating equipment and materials. Requires annual verification by the Secretary that the amounts spent on Coast Guard search and rescue activities are not less than the amounts collected annually for such purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to grant exemptions from such user fees. Provides that the collection of such fees does not alter the duties and liability of the United States in the performance of functions for which such fees are collected. Specifies civil penalties for various users of Coast Guard services who fail to pay the user fee. Requires such penalties to be assessed by the Secretary via written notice. Authorizes the Secretary to refer a penalty matter to the Attorney General for collection in appropriate cases. Authorizes the Secretary to deny entry to a port of the United States to a vessel if any required fees have not been paid."
