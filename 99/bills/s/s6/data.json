    "text": "Veterans' Administration Health-Care Amendments of 1985 - Redefines \"Vietnam era\" for purposes of the determination of Vietnam veterans by the Veterans Administration (VA). Prohibits the Administrator of Veterans Affairs from implementing a grade reduction for VA employees unless he or she first submits to specified congressional committees a report of justification for such reduction. Requires such report to be submitted at least 90 days prior to the implementation of any such reduction. Requires a follow-up report by the Comptroller General of the United States to the same congressional committees. Extends health-care eligibility based on exposure to toxic substances in Vietnam or to nuclear radiation until September 30, 1989. Extends by three years the alcohol and drug abuse treatment program for Vietnam-era veterans. Requires three annual reports by the Administrator to such congressional committees on the operation of such program. Directs the Administrator to conduct a pilot program to evaluate the accessibility of needed health and medical care for eligible veterans in noninstitutional settings. Requires the Administrator, in selecting veterans for participation in the program, to give priority to those with service-connected disabilities. Directs the Administrator, in implementing such program, to: (1) utilize services of appropriate public and private agencies that provide health-related services; and (2) appoint a VA employee to serve as case manager for each veteran participant in order to coordinate the provision of services to such veteran. Requires a report to the Congress by the Administrator concerning such program within 39 months of its implementation. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990. Delays authorization for one year if funds are not available. Directs the Secretaries of Defense and of Health and Human Services and the Administrator, within 180 days after the enactment of this Act, to report jointly to the Congress on the Government's responsibility to provide benefits and services for individuals who incurred disabilities related to their service with voluntary organizations in Vietnam during the Vietnam era."
