Prohibits the detention of juveniles for the following purposes: (1) punishing, treating, or rehabilitating the juvenile; (2) allowing parents to avoid their legal responsibilities; (3) satisfying demands by a victim, the police, or the community; (4) permitting more convenient access to the juvenile; and (5) facilitating further interrogation or investigation."
