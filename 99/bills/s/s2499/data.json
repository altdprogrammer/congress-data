Eliminates the requirement that a parent (or parents) be a dependent (or dependents) of such officer in order to be an alternate beneficiary. Directs the Bureau of Justice Assistance to adjust certain public safety officer death benefits to reflect the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index. Makes the date of death the determining date regarding the death benefit amount payable to beneficiaries. Establishes the Public Safety Officers' Death Benefits Trust Fund in the Treasury. Requires each convicted felon to pay $500 into the court registry for deposit into such Fund."
