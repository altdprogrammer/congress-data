    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Amends the Indian Education Act Amendments of 1978 (the Act) to define \"eligible Indian student\" as a student who: (1) is a member of or at least a one-fourth degree Indian blood descendant of a member of an Indian tribe which is eligible for Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) programs and services because of their status as Indians; and (2) resides on or near an Indian reservation or meets the critieria for attendance at a BIA off-reservation boarding school. Prohibits charging an eligible Indian student for attendance at a BIA or contract school. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to permit the attendance at a BIA school of a student who is not an eligible Indian student if: (1) the Secretary determines that the student's attendance will not adversely affect the school's program for eligible Indian students because of cost, overcrowding, or violation of standards; (2) the school board consents; and (3) either the student is a dependent of a BIA, Indian Health Service, or tribal government employee who lives on or near the school site (in which case no tuition may be charged) or tuition is paid for the student (in which case the tuition may not be more than that charged by the nearest public school district for out-of-district students, and is collected in addition to the school's allocation). Authorizes the school board of a contract school to permit students who are not eligible Indian students to attend its contract school and provides that any tuition collected for those students is in addition to specified funding. Directs the Secretary, for funding purposes under specified provisions of the Act during the 1985-1986 academic year, to count each student attending a BIA or contract school during the count week for that year if the student: (1) was counted for funding purposes under such provisions for the 1984-1985 academic year; and (2) is an eligible Indian student under the amendment made by this Act. Repeals specified sections of Federal law relating to tuition charges to \"white children\" in Indian schools."
