Places a priority on the selection of procedures and treatments with significant costs, risks, hospitalization periods, and utilization patterns. Authorizes appropriations from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for FY 1987 through 1993 to carry out such research. Requires that at least 90 percent of the funds available in any fiscal year be used to fund grants to, and cooperative agreements with, non-Federal research entities. Directs that the program be administered by the National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (Center). Directs the Secretary to appoint a National Advisory Council to advise the Secretary and the Center regarding the program."
