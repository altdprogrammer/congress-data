Provides that such notification requirement does not apply to the reprogramming of less than $25,000 for use under the international narcotics control program or for use under the international military education and training program for a country for which a program under such program for that fiscal year was justified to the Congress. Requires the President to notify the Congress, within 30 days of enactment of any law appropriating funds to carry out the Arms Export Control Act, of each country and organization to which the United States intends to provide any portion of such funds.
