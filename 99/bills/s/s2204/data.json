Rept. 99-509) Requires the Director of the National Park Service to prepare a resources management plan as a component of each general management plan for each unit of the National Park System. Includes natural and cultural resources in such plan. Provides funding for matching grants to organizations for research, monitoring, and management of system resources. Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to charge new fees and increase certain existing fees for admission into units of the National Park System. Exempts urban, outdoor recreation areas from such fees. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the fee proposed for each unit of the System. Requires that all fees collected be expended for National Park System operations, through FY 1991. Provides that beginning FY 1992 such fees shall be credited to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Sets forth the priorities under which such fees shall be distributed. Prohibits the Secretary from charging admission fees at the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, Hawaii."
