    "text": "Pro-Family Preservation and Demonstration Program Act - Authorizes States to elect to operate demonstration programs providing assistance to dependent children of unemployed parents as an alternative to the program providing such assistance under part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of title IV of the Social Security Act. Requires the Governor of a State which desires to operate such a program to submit a State program plan to the Secretary of Health and Human Services which: (1) specifies the agency which will conduct the program; (2) sets forth State objectives; (3) describes the techniques to be used to achieve program objectives; and (4) sets forth the format and frequency of reports regarding program operations. Lists acceptable program techniques which include: (1) providing assistance to dependent children for a limited time rather than on a continuing basis; (2) requiring and rewarding parental participation in training and employment programs; (3) providing child-care benefits for parents actively seeking employment; and (4) providing training and employment programs through cooperative arrangements with the private sector. Deems a State program to have been approved unless the Secretary gives the State written notice of dispproval within 45 days of the State's submission of its plan and an opportunity to resubmit its plan. Provides that such programs shall operate for three years and be extended for such periods as the Secretary deems appropriate. Requires the Secretary to evaluate a State's program after one and after three years of operation."
