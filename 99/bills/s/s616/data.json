    "text": "Agriculture, Food, Trade, and Conservation Act of 1985 - Title I: Agricultural Exports and Public Law 480 - Subtitle A: Commercial Export Programs - Amends the Food for Peace Act of 1966 to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), to guarantee intermediate loans made to finance agricultural export sales. Requires that such guaranteed or financed sales be made to purchasers from countries that: (1) have previously received assistance under title I of Public Law 480; and (2) are unable to use other Department of Agriculture short-term export credit programs. Expands the uses for which export credit financing and guarantees may be made to include agricultural export sales promotion. Requires the CCC to make specified amounts available for intermediate credit purposes for FY 1986 through 1991. Requires the Secretary to: (1) sell through the CCC specified amounts of dairy products for export for FY 1986 through 1988; and (2) report annually to the appropriate congressional committees. Authorizes the Secretary to provide U.S. exporters and users and foreign purchasers with surplus agricultural commodities and products at no cost in order to expand overseas markets. Makes eligible for supplementary commodity distributions those foreign purchasers who use the receipts from the sale of such products to construct or rehabilitate facilities used to market U.S. agricultural imports. Exempts such commodity distributions, blended credit, and emergency food relief activities from cargo preference requirements. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should initiate a new round of multilateral trade negotiations with U.S. trading partners to: (1) strengthen the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT); (2) improve the GATT dispute settlement procedure; and (3) bring agricultural trade issues within the purview of GATT rules and procedures. Directs the Secretary to use specified CCC funds or commodities for FY 1986 through 1988 export assistance for those commodities adversely affected by foreign subsidies or market practices. Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (Public Law 480) to direct the President to: (1) consider the benefits to the United States and the nutritional assistance to recipients from the donation of processed and protein-fortified agricultural products; and (2) take steps to ensure that an appropriate share of commodity donations is in such form. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary fund export market development programs for value-added farm products at higher than FY 1985 levels. Amends the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act to require (current law authorizes) the CCC, to the maximum extent practicable, to barter commodities for strategic and critical materials. States that if the volume of petroleum products in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is less than the level prescribed under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act the CCC shall, with the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and in consultation with the Secretaries of Energy and of State, accept petroleum products in exchange for agricultural commodities and transfer such products without reimbursement to the Reserve.
