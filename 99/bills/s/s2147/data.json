Allows a for-profit small business to file an appeal with the SBA if such small business has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as a result of the proposed award of a Federal contract to such public or private organization. Directs the Administrator of the SBA, after finding that such economic injury would result, to require each procuring agency or department to take action to alleviate such injury or likely injury. Requires each agency having procurement powers to report certain data to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy each time such a contract is entered into. Requires the Office to collect specified data and to report such data to the SBA. Requires the General Accounting Office, not later than September 30, 1990, to prepare a report on the impact that contracts awarded to such organizations have on for-profit small businesses for FY 1987 through 1989. Requires such report to be transmitted to specified congressional committees. Establishes a task force on purchases from the blind and severely handicapped to review the awarding of such contracts and recommend changes deemed appropriate."
