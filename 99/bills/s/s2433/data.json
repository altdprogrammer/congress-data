Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to require agencies, to the maximum extent practicable, to fulfill equipment and supply needs through commercial and commercial-type products. Directs the Administrator to conduct a three-year procurement notice test program. Provides that agencies under such program shall not be required to furnish a notice of solicitation for a contract expected to cost less than $25,000. Requires the Administrator to report to specified congressional committees with findings and conclusions within one year after: (1) the acquisition technique is established; (2) the commercial products policy is implemented; and (3) the procurement notice test program is terminated."
