    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Governmental Affairs with amendment (without written report)) Amends Federal law relating to claims against the Government to authorize (currently, require) the Administrator of General Services (the Administrator) to pay a carrier or freight forwarder for transporting an individual or property of the Government before the Administrator conducts an audit concerning such transportation. Provides for the financing of expenses related to such transportation audits. Requires at least annual transfers of overpayments for such transportation to miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury. Authorizes the Administrator to delegate any of the above authority in appropriate cases. Directs the Administrator, within 60 days after the enactment of this Act, to establish a task force to study the feasibility of an integrated, automated system for use by Federal agencies in managing the transportation of property for the United States. Requires cooperation with such task force from each department, agency, and instrumentality of the Government. Requires the task force, no later than July 1, 1988, to submit to the Congress a final report on the results of its study. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to remove the requirement that foreign excess property may be sold only with the condition that it cannot be imported into the United States without certain determinations being made by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of Commerce. Provides that, after the enactment of this Act, all applications to the above Secretaries requesting to import such foreign excess property shall be returned, since authority to import shall no longer be required due to this Act."
