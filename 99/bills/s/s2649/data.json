    "text": "Children's Health Care Act of 1986 - Title I: Medicaid - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to give States the option of providing Medicaid coverage to children from age one to 18 whose family income does not exceed the higher of the income eligibility threshold under part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of title IV of the Act or the Federal poverty level. Authorizes States to extend Medicaid eligibility to the parents of children rendered eligible pursuant to this Act. Prohibits States which provide coverage pursuant to this Act from establishing more stringent AFDC eligibility tests or reducing AFDC payment levels after enactment of this Act. Requires States which opt to provide such coverage to maintain their income test for AFDC eligibility at no less than 50 percent of the Federal poverty level and provide Medicaid coverage for women and infants in accordance with the Medicaid Maternal and Infant Amendments of 1986. Directs States to refer any individual under age 18 who becomes ineligible for Medicaid to a low or no-cost provider of medical services. Requires States to submit annual reports to the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding the percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries under age 21 who receive periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services. Requires that such services be provided in accordance with recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Title II: Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant - Directs the Secretary to establish demonstration projects testing the effectiveness of using integrated case management services in providing services under title V (Maternal and Infant Welfare) of the Act to children with special health care needs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1989."
