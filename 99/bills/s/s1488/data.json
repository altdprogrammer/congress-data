    "text": "Title I: Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 to authorize appropriations for Interstate System construction purposes for FY 1991. Sets a minimum apportionment per State of one-half of one percent of the total apportionment for the Interstate System for FY 1988 through 1991. Permits the expenditure of Interstate System funds for certain highway purposes if such funds exceed the estimated cost of completing a State's portion of the Interstate System. Directs the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) to apportion: (1) authorized funds for FY 1987 using the apportionment factors from the Interstate Cost Estimate submitted to the Congress in January 1985; and (2) for FY 1986 certain sums previously apportioned for such fiscal year using factors from the Interstate Substitute Cost Estimate for alternative highway and mass transit projects. Sets obligation ceilings for Federal-Aid Highways and Highway Safety Construction Programs for FY 1987 through 1990. Sets distribution guidelines for such obligations. Authorizes appropriations for specified aspects of the Federal-aid system out of the Highway Trust Fund for FY 1987 through 1990. Amends the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 to authorize appropriations for Motor Carrier Safety Grants for FY 1989 and 1990. Amends the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to authorize appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990. Requires that a minimum of ten percent of such appropriated funds be expended with small business concerns owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Sets guidelines under which the Secretary shall use the Federal share of certain adjusted cost estimates in making apportionments for substitute highway and mass transit projects. Sets apportionment guidelines for specified parts of the Federal-aid systems through FY 1991. Permits ten percent of certain Federal-aid systems apportionments to be transferred to apportionments to complete Interstate gaps upon State request. Sets availability guidelines for non-obligated apportioned funds whereby such funds are available for expenditure by a State for Federal-aid primary system projects for a period of three years after the end of the fiscal year for which such funds were authorized. Directs the Secretary to make funds not obligated within such time period available to States that have obligated certain apportioned funds. Authorizes the imposition of State tolls upon roads, bridges, tunnels, and ferries without payback of certain Federal-aid funds if the toll revenues in excess of operating costs will be used by the State for capital transportation projects, and if such highway bridge or tunnel is publicly owned and operated. Amends the Federal highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation program to provide that $200,000,000 of the amounts authorized under this Act each fiscal year for bridge replacement and rehabilitation on the Federal-aid primary and Interstate System shall be obligated at the Secretary's discretion for certain highway bridge rehabilitation projects. Directs the Secretary to present a detailed report to the Congress regarding a study of the future direction of the Federal-Aid Highway Program once the Interstate Construction Program has been substantially completed. Authorizes appropriations for such study. Title II: Highway Safety Act of 1985 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through FY 1990, for certain highway safety programs under the auspices of the Federal Highway Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration."
