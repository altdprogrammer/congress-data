    "text": "Emergency Crack Control Act of 1986 - Title I: Law Enforcement - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to include cocaine freebase as a schedule I substance. Establishes criminal penalties of up to 20 years in prison, or up to $250,000 fine, or both, for manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, or possessing cocaine freebase. Provides increased penalties for employing persons under 21 years of age to distribute controlled substances. Imposes enhanced penalties for the manufacture of a controlled substance in or near an elementary or secondary school. (Current law imposes such enhanced penalties only for the distribution of a controlled substance in or near such schools.) Makes it a Federal criminal offense to open, maintain, manage, or control any facility used for manufacturing, storing, distributing, or using a controlled substance. Title II: Education and Public Awareness - Part A: Emergency Response - Designates October 6, 1986, as National Drug Abuse Education Day. Requires the Secretary of Education to ensure that State educational departments and all schools have timely information on: (1) the scope and nature of the cocaine freebase epidemic; (2) strategies for effective school intervention and community mobilization; and (3) available resources. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse to produce and disseminate two emergency public service announcements on the consequences of cocaine freebase use. Part B: Establishment of Office Within the Department of Education - Amends the Department of Education Organization Act to establish within the Department an Office of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Education and Policy. Provides that such Office shall be administered by the Assistant Secretary for Drug and Alcohol Abuse Education and Prevention (the Assistant Secretary). Sets forth the duties of the Office. Requires the Secretary of Education to report to the Congress within one year after the enactment of this Act on progress in establishing the Office and the long-term strategy of the Office for drug education and prevention. Part C: Student Drug Abuse and Prevention - Student Drug Abuse Education and Prevention Act of 1986 - Directs the Secretary, acting through the Assistant Secretary, to establish a program of grants to States for drug (including alcohol) abuse education in elementary and secondary schools. Lists the State and local educational agency uses of such funds. Restricts the amount States may use for administrative costs. Provides for: (1) the allotment of such grant funds to States; (2) State application for such grant funds; (3) allocations to local educational agencies; and (4) local application to State educational agencies. Provides for the equitable participation of children enrolled in private nonprofit elementary and secondary schools in such program. Requires the Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to: (1) collect and disseminate program-related information to State and local educational agencies; (2) provide technical assistance; and (3) identify research and development priorities. Authorizes appropriations for such activities. Provides that the use of such grant funds is to supplement and not supplant other Federal funds. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1991. Title III: Prevention - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to prepare an emergency report on and feasibility study of intervention by the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute of Drug Abuse to reduce the epidemic of cocaine freebase use."
