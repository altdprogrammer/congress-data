    "text": "Amends the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 to repeal the requirement that the Attorney General approve the transfer of Government-owned lands to State and local governments for public airport purposes. Makes the provisions of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (relating to the disposition of property for public airports) inapplicable to this Act by removing the authority of the Administrator of the General Services Administration to approve transfers of Federal surplus property for airport development purposes. (The Secretary of Transportation is thus left with sole authority to transfer Federal property for airport development purposes whether or not such property has been declared surplus.)"
