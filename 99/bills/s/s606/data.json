Requires such owners or operators to notify such officials as soon as possible in case of any health- or environment-threatening accident involving such substances. Exempts quantities below 100 kilograms from these requirements unless their inclusion is necessary to protect the environment or human health or safety. Establishes criminal penalties for the knowing violation of the emergency notification procedures. Permits States to establish more stringent requirements. Requires the coordination of these provisions with other applicable Federal law."
