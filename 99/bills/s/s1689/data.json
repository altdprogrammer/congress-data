    "text": "Health Services Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to provide care and treatment without charge to any person suffering from Hansen's disease (leprosy). Designates the Public Health Service Facility in Carville, Louisiana, as the Gillis W. Long Hansen's Disease Center. Limits the applicability of the Public Health Service additional pay provisions for physicians. Provides cash awards for commissioned officers of the Public Health Service for suggestions, inventions, and scientific achievements. Provides health insurance conversion coverage for certain involuntarily separated commissioned officers and their dependents. Reduces the minimum percentage of allotments any State must use during FY 1985 for alcohol and drug abuse services for women. Provides that after FY 1985 allotments to States for comprehensive community mental health services for underserved areas or populations and for severely disturbed children and adolescents may also be used for expanding current services. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to request the National Academy of Sciences to apply for a grant to establish a council on health care technology. Describes the qualifications for grant approval. Provides an exception to grade limitations for commissioned officers of the Public Health Service who are assigned to the Department of Defense. Provides for the continuing care of psychiatric patients who were under the care of the National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Research Center when such center ceased operations. Repeals the following obsolete provisions of the Public Health Service Act: (1) allotments for State Mental Health Programs; (2) Formula Grants to States for Preventive Health Service Programs; (3) title IX (Education, Research, Training, and Demonstration in Heart Disease, Cancer, Stroke, and Kidney Disease); (4) Hospital-Affiliated Primary Care Centers; (5) title XII (Emergency Medical Services Systems); and (6) Settlement of Claims."
