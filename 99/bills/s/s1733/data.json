    "text": "Veterans' Job Training Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Emergency Veterans' Job Training Act of 1983 to decrease the amount paid by the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to the employer of a veteran under a job training program to 30 percent of such earned wage beginning with the fourth month of such employment period. (Currently, the Administrator pays 50 percent, regardless of the employment training period). Directs the Administrator and the Secretary of Labor to provide a program of counseling services for veterans participating in a job training program and to make such veterans and their employers aware of the availability of such services. Requires the Administrator to also make such veterans aware of other supportive services such as readjustment counseling. Provides for the appointment of a case manager to each veteran participating in a job training program. Authorizes appropriations under such Act through FY 1986 and extends through 1988 the availability of funds for such job training programs. Provides for payments to employers of veterans participating in job training programs in the event that funds are appropriated for FY 1986. Provides alternate dates for the payment of such assistance in FY 1986. Permits a veteran who is allowed a monthly training assistance allowance under a program of apprenticeship or other on-job training to elect to have such allowance paid to the employer. Requires the Administrator to make all participating veterans aware of the availability of such election. Directs the Administrator, not later than four months prior to the expiration of such provisions, to report to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees on the implementation of this Act."
