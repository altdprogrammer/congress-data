    "text": "Food Stamp and Commodity Distribution Amendments of 1986 - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to deny income exclusion for energy payments that are provided only to households receiving benefits under a public or general assistance program. Repeals the provisions providing for May 1, 1986: (1) increases in the earned income and excess shelter deductions; and (2) separation of the dependent care deduction from the excess shelter deduction. Excludes direct or third-party payments received under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (LIHEAA) from being considered expenses for purposes of the excess shelter deduction. Requires States that have a standard heating and cooling allowance to establish a separate utility allowance for LIHEAA recipients. Repeals the provision for a May 1, 1986, increase in household resource limits. Includes as income all assistance received under the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 for purposes of determining food stamp program eligibility and benefits. Requires all program applicants subject to program work requirements to meet job search requirements. Sets forth uniform performance standards for State employment and training programs. Reduces FY 1987 Federal cost-sharing assistance. Provides for Internal Revenue Service (IRS) access to retail food store program information. Requires participating retailers to provide the Department of Agriculture with their IRS employer identification numbers or social security numbers. States that interest on a claim against a State agency shall begin on the date of billing. Reduces the time period during which a household may choose a method for repaying fraudulent program claims. Includes computer fraud within the scope of program fraud. Establishes 25 percent Federal funding of State administrative costs in excess of 175 percent of median per-recipient costs. Provides for the phased-in elimination of enhanced funding for fraud investigations and data processing costs. Requires States, as of October 1, 1986, to pay the full cost of errors in excess of a five percent error rate. Reduces FY 1987 through 1990 authorizations for Puerto Rico's nutritional assistance program. Authorizes States to operate a low-income nutrition assistance grant program in lieu of the food stamp program. Amends the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 to require that households in the Indian reservation food distribution program and the commodity supplemental food program (CSFP) provide their social security numbers as a condition of eligibility. Amends CSFP provisions to: (1) repeal new pilot project services to the elderly; (2) eliminate donation-based funding from the program's funding formula; (3) prohibit new program sites in areas served by the special supplemental food program for women, infants, and children (WIC); and (4) repeal authority to use excess funds for service to low-income elderly persons. Authorizes commodity processing contract user fees. Amends the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 to repeal the FY 1986 and 1987 authorization of appropriations to assist States with commodity distributions."
