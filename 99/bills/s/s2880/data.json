Rept. 99-950) Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to approve the withdrawal of any route which on the date of enactment of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1978 was under judicial injunction prohibiting its construction, until ten days after the final legislative day of the 99th Congress. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (the Administrator) to make grants to the Metropolitan District Commission, Massachusetts, for an emergency improvement project at the Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant in Boston, Massachusetts. Limits the Federal share of such project to 75 percent of improvement costs. Authorizes appropriations for such project for FY 1987 through FY 1989. Directs the Administrator to make grants to the Massachusetts Water Resource Authority for a water quality improvement and waste water treatment program for Boston Harbor and adjacent waters. Limits the Federal share of such program costs to 75 percent of construction costs. Authorizes appropriation for FY 1987 through FY 1991 in addition to, but not in lieu of, other appropriations under title II of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to preclude any person except an eligible authority from applying for a permit to either dump, or transport for the purpose of dumping, any municipal sludge within the New York Bight Apex ocean waters. Prohibits the Administrator from issuing or renewing any permit which authorizes: (1) the dumping (or transportation for purposes of dumping) municipal sludge within the Apex after the earlier of December 15, 1987, or a day determined by the Administrator to be the first day on which such sludge can reasonably be dumped at a site other than within the Apex; or (2) any person other than an elibile authority to dump, or transport for dumping, municipal sludge within the \"106-Mile Ocean Waste Dump Site.\""
