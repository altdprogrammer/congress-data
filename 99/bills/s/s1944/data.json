Makes this prohibition applicable to certain demonstration projects carried out pursuant to the Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984. Makes this Act applicable to hearings held after April 9, 1985. Provides beneficiaries and applicants with the opportunity for a new hearing if their original hearing occurred after such date and before enactment of this Act, violated the provisions of this Act, and resulted in the denial of benefits."
