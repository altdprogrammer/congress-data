    "text": "National Health Service Corps Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize FY 1986 through 1988 appropriations for the National Health Service Corps Program. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1991 for new and continuing National Health Service Corps scholarships. Imposes a $15,000 per student limit for such scholarships during FY 1986. Provides a method for determining the limit for subsequent fiscal years. Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from removing an area from those determined to be health manpower shortage areas under such Act until interested groups and persons are afforded the opportunity to provide data and information. Provides, with regard to scholarship-obligated service deferrals for advanced clinical training, that the Secretary: (1) shall grant deferrals upon requests for contracts entered into before October 1, 1985; (2) may grant such deferrals for contracts entered into after such date; and (3) shall not count such periods of advanced training toward satisfying the service obligation. Revises special private practice assistance provisions to: (1) limit such assistance to loans (presently grants and loans); (2) extend the minimum obligated service period from one to two years; and (3) apply such provisions to obligated- and unobligated-service National Health Service Corps members. Requires the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees by October 1, 1986, a plan for the recruitment, employment, and retention of personnel for the National Health Service Corps. Authorizes the Secretary to assist States in collecting data related to the designation of health manpower shortage areas. Authorizes appropriations for such purposes through FY 1988."
