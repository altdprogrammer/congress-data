Rept. 99-90) International Air Transportation Protection Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to revoke an air carrier's foreign air transportation certificate if the Secretary establishes that a takeover of such air carrier has occurred on or after May 23, 1985, and that a sale or transfer of such certificate occurred (or was attempted) on or after such date as part of the liquidation of such air carrier (other than in the ordinary course of business). Establishes a rebuttable presumption that the transfer (or attempted transfer) of such a certificate is a part of the liquidation of an air carrier, or other than in the ordinary course of business, if the transfer takes place within three years after a takeover has occurred. States that the Secretary is not precluded from issuing any certificate for foreign air transportation if the Secretary finds the applicant is willing and able to provide such transportation in conformity with this Act and such transportation is consistent with public convenience and necessity."
