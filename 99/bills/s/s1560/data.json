Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986-1988. Provides formulae for the allotment of appropriated funds to the States. Establishes a minimum allotment of $100,000 for each State. Enumerates the purposes for which the States may use allotments at their discretion. Details the application procedures and grant requirements. Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from prescribing for a State the manner of compliance with such requirements. Requires the chief executive officer of a State to: (1) describe the purposes for which the State intends to use the block grant; and (2) facilitate public comment upon such purposes."
