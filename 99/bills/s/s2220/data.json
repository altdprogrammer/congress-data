    "text": "Mutual Nuclear Warhead Testing Moratorium Act - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should declare that the United States will stop testing nuclear warheads and will invite the Soviet Union to meet with the United States to enter into negotiations for the conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty at the earliest possible date. Declares that the United States should continue the cessation of the testing of nuclear warheads so long as the Soviet Union refrains from the testing of nuclear warheads and substantive Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty negotiations are in progress. Expresses the sense of the Congress that during such cessation the President should seek resumption of the comprehensive test ban talks between the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union. Prohibits the United States from obligating or spending any money for testing nuclear warheads during the six-month period beginning 30 days after passage of this Act if the President does not declare such a cessation of nuclear testing. Authorizes such spending if the President certifies to the Congress that the Soviet Union on or after such date tested a nuclear warhead. Requires the President to include in any such certification: (1) an unclassified report summarizing the basis for the certification; and (2) a classified report describing the Soviet activities that are the basis for the certification. Requires the President to report annually to the Congress on: (1) the progress in nuclear arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union; and (2) whether the President believes that continuation of the cessation of nuclear testing is in the U.S. national security interest."
