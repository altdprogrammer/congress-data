    "text": "Atomic Veterans Relief Act of 1985 - Provides disability benefits to veterans who participated in atomic tests or the occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki after World War II and who, within 40 years, suffer from diseases that may be attributable to ionizing radiation, including: (1) leukemia, (2) polycythemia vera; (3) carcinoma of the thyroid; (4) chromosomal damage; (5) posterior subcapsular cataracts; and (6) other radiogenic cancers. Directs the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to promulgate regulations to resolve benefit claims and provide standards for benefit determinations and the inclusion of additional diseases as the basis for benefits. Provides for survivors' benefits. Directs the Administrator to report to the Veterans' Affairs Committees of the Congress whenever legislative action related to the subject matter of the regulations is needed. Requires proposed and final regulations to be published in the Federal Register by the Administrator within specified periods. Establishes a presumption that a disability is service-connected for a veteran exposed to ionizing radiation while on active duty, notwithstanding the absence of Government records documenting any such exposure. Provides medical care for the treatment of genetic or congenital disorders in the natural children of affected veterans. Entitles such children to educational assistance. Requires the Administrator to carry out an outreach, screening, and counseling program to serve those veterans, dependents, and survivors entitled to benefits under this Act. Directs the Administrator to establish a research and training program for the diagnosis and treatment of disabilities caused by exposure to ionizing radiation, including a centralized registry of claims. Directs the Administrator to make a comprehensive report on these programs in the annual report to the Congress under this Act."
