    "text": "Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to prohibit the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from contracting with a public housing agency unless the Secretary finds that such agency is making all reasonable efforts to encourage resident management of such federally-assisted housing project. Requires as a condition of entering into a resident management program that a majority of the project's residents approve the establishment of a resident's council to determine the feasibility of establishing a resident management corporation. Requires such residents council and the public housing agency to jointly select a management specialist to help establish a resident management corporation. Requires the corporation to provide insurance and bonding. Authorizes such a corporation to contract with the public housing agency to establish respective management responsibilities. Authorizes the Secretary to develop an appropriate model contract. Authorizes the Secretary to publish a list of those Federal requirements which may be waived by such a corporation. Prohibits Federal subsidy reductions during the first three years of resident management. Permits a corporation to retain and use excess revenues to: (1) improve maintenance and operation; (2) acquire ownership; and (3) acquire additional housing units. Requires that such projects be given assistance allocation priority."
