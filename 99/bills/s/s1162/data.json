    "text": "Nuclear Waste Policy Improvements Act of 1985 - Title I - Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to require that the nomination of sites for repositories of high-level radioactive waste be accompanied by an environmental assessment which includes the environmental impact of transporting high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel through the region surrounding such site. Requires the Secretary of Transportation and the President to include, in their consideration of recommended sites, the effect of transportation of high-level radioactive waste on States containing possible transportation routes. Requires the Secretary to include, in a public site recommendation statement, specified details of the effect of such transportation on those States. Requires the Secretary, when considering alternative nuclear waste sites, to take into consideration such transportation routes and the impact of such transportation on routes in States adjacent to the State in which a repository has been selected. Title II - Directs the Secretary to provide assistance to any State that contains likely transportation routes to a high-level nuclear waste repository in such State, if the State's application demonstrates assistance is needed to upgrade or maintain such routes in order to provide adequate public protection from accidents involving high-level nuclear waste."
