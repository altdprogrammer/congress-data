    "text": "United States Peace Tax Fund Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit conscientious objectors to designate their income, estate, or gift tax payments for nonmilitary purposes. Establishes within the Treasury a United States Peace Tax Fund (Fund) to receive such tax payments. Defines a \"conscientious objector\" as an individual who by reason of religious training and belief is opposed to participation in war in any form and either: (1) has been exempted from combat training and service in the armed forces under the Military Selective Service Act; or (2) who satisfactorily demonstrates that he is conscientiously opposed to war in any form. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to deny such status to a taxpayer upon a finding that the taxpayer is not entitled to make such a designation. Allows a taxpayer to challenge such a denial by bringing an action in the United States Tax Court or in a U.S. district court for a declaratory judgment as to whether the taxpayer is an eligible individual and entitled to make such a designation. Requires every taxpayer who makes such a designation for any taxable year to file a questionnaire return during such year for the purpose of determining whether the taxpayer is an eligible individual. Permits the setting aside of criminal or civil penalties imposed upon a taxpayer for nonpayment of tax prior to 1988 if the taxpayer pays the tax due (with interest) and satisfactorily establishes that the nonpayment was due to religious beliefs. Directs the Comptroller General to determine the percentage of actual appropriations made by the United States from the Federal budget during the preceding year for military purposes. Requires the publication of such information in the Congressional Record. Establishes a United States Peace Tax Fund Board of Trustees to direct research efforts on behalf of world peace. Sets forth the membership structure and duties of the Board. Authorizes appropriations."
