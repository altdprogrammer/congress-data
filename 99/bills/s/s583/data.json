Authorizes appropriations for such purposes effective October 1, 1988. Prohibits any such funds from being obligated or expended until there is available to the Board, from private donations or other non-Federal sources, a sum which: (1) matches federally appropriated funds; and (2) when combined with federally appropriated funds is sufficient to carry out the purposes of this Act. Provides for transfer of any portion of such funds to the General Services Administration to carry out such purposes. Requires the Board, in the event of the sale of the facilities comprising the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, to reimburse the United States States out of the proceeds of such sale an amount equal to the Federal interest in the facilities. Directs the Administrator of General Services in the event of such sale to determine the value of the Federal interest based on Federal appropriations used in the construction of Cooper-Hewitt Museum facilities."
