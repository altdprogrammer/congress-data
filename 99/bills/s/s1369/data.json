    "text": "International Airport Security Cooperation Act - Directs the Secretary of State (the Secretary) to: (1) determine which countries are high terrorist threats; (2) determine which international airports in those countries are serviced by U.S. air carriers or are otherwise frequently used by U.S. citizens; and (3) determine which of those airports fail to comply with the minimum international airport security standards. Directs the Secretary to: (1) determine which international airports are not under the de facto control of the government of the country in which they are located; and (2) determine which of those international airports pose a high risk of introducing danger to international air travel. Directs the Secretary to publish a list within six months of enactment of this Act of the airports identified as failing to meet minimum security standards and airports identified as posing a high risk of introducing danger to international travel. Directs the Secretary to issue a travel advisory with respect to each airport on such list. Directs the President, if after 120 days an international airport is still on the list, to prohibit: (1) U.S. air carriers from landing at the listed airport; (2) all air carriers of the country in which the airport is located from landing at U.S. airports; and (3) the air carriers of all other countries from making direct flights between the listed airport and the United States. Lists additional sanctions which the President may impose. Authorizes the President to waive some of the sanctions for national security or humanitarian reasons. Authorizes the President to lift the travel advisory and other sanctions only if the President determines that the international airports in that country no longer meet specified criteria. Prohibits the removal of a sanction from taking effect until 15 days after the President notifies the Congress of such decision. Directs the Secretary to: (1) call for a meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to discuss current compliance of airports with existing international security standards and to upgrade the security standards for international airports; and (2) call on member countries of ICAO to enforce existing standards and impose a moratorium on the use of any non-complying international airport. Directs the Secretary to seek agreement on strengthening enforcement measures and standards for compliance with respect to aircraft sabotage, aircraft hijacking, and airport security. Authorizes additional appropriations to carry out the antiterrorism programs of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for FY 1986 and 1987. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Transportation for research on and development of airport security devices or techniques for detecting explosives. Calls upon the President to seek the establishment of an international committee (the International Anti-Terrorism Committee) to focus the attention and secure the cooperation of governments and of the public on the problems and responses to international terrorism."
