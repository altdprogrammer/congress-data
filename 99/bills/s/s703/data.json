Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Kentucky shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Kentucky which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Kentucky reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Kentucky without express congressional authorization. States that the provisions above shall also apply to national forest system roadless lands in Kentucky which are less than 5,000 acres in size."
