    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation with amendment, S. Rept. 99-411) Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 - Requires the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) to promulgate regulations establishing minimum Federal standards for the licensing, testing, qualifications and classifications of commercial motor vehicle operators, and additional regulations for such operators who transport hazardous materials. Sets guidelines for such standards. Establishes guidelines for civil and criminal penalties to be imposed by the States for violations of such standards. Prohibits commercial motor vehicle operators from possessing more than one operator's license. Sets September 1, 1989, as the deadline by which each State must adopt and administer a classified licensing program which complies with the minimum Federal standards for commercial motor vehicle operators. Requires the States to notify the Secretary of the proposed and actual issuance of a commercial license in order to eliminate the multiple licensing of commercial motor vehicle operators. Restricts the issuance of commercial licenses to persons with acceptable safety records. Provides that States must require commercial operators to turn in other commercial licenses. Provides Federal grants to assist States which have a program for license issuance and administration that comply with the Federal guidelines established under this Act. Requires the Secretary to: (1) withhold highway funds and certain apportionments from States which are not in compliance with this Act as of September 30, 1990; and (2) establish by January 1, 1989, a commercial driver's license information clearinghouse allowing rapid communication among the States. Outlines the functions of such information system. Requires any prospective employer to consult such clearinghouse prior to employing a commercial motor vehicle operator in order to ascertain his or her status. Prohibits the employment of drivers whose licenses have been suspended, revoked or cancelled for cause. Requires the Secretary to establish fees for the use of such information system. Makes funds available for FY 1987 to establish such information system. Amends the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 to require States receiving grants under the Act to: (1) conduct frequent roadside inspections of commercial motor vehicles; (2) conduct tests to determine blood alcohol content levels of commercial motor vehicle operators; and (3) provide for license suspension or revocation for operators who either have certain blood alcohol content levels, or who refuse to submit to blood alcohol content tests. Authorizes the Secretary to provide funds to encourage the States to determine whether commercial motor vehicle operators are driving under the influence of a controlled substance. Increases authorizations for FY 1987 and 1988 for grants to assist States in the implementation of Federal commercial motor vehicle programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 and 1990 for such programs."
