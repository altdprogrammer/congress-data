Limits such program to ten participants during the three twelve-month periods following the date of enactment of this Act. Allows the head of an agency to accept voluntary services if the services: (1) are to be performed by a participant in the exchange program; (2) are not to be paid for by the Government (and any payment for services is limited to that provided by the entity nominating such participant); and (3) will not displace any Government employee. Declares that such participants shall be subject to Federal conflict-of-interest laws and considered agency employees for all purposes except those of pay and benefits. Directs the President's Commission on Executive Exchange to report to the Congress on such program not later than 180 days before the last day of the experimental program."
