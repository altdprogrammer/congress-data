    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 1617 passed in lieu) National Bureau of Standards Authorization Act for FY 1986 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 to the Secretary of Commerce for the following activities performed by the National Bureau of Standards (the Bureau): (1) measurement research and standards; (2) materials science and engineering; (3) engineering measurements and standards; (4) computer science and technology; (5) Center for Fire Research; (6) technical competence fund; and (7) central technical support. Reserves a specified portion of the total of such authorized appropriations to assist in the creation and maintenance of data bases on structural failures. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 to the Secretary for the activities of the Office of Productivity, Technology, and Innovation. Amends Federal law relating to the National Technical Information Service (the Service) to authorize the Secretary to: (1) make scientific, technical, and engineering information available through the Service without regard to specified Federal requirements that Government printing and binding be done at the Government Printing Office; and (2) acquire capital equipment and inventories from receipts for work or services performed or to be performed by the Service. Authorizes additional appropriations for FY 1986 to the Secretary for: (1) the Service's patent licensing activities; (2) the Bureau's expenses incurred outside the United States (to be paid for in excess foreign currency); and (3) adjustments in salary, pay, retirement, and other employee benefits. Provides that appropriations made under the authority provided in this Act shall remain available for periods specified in the Acts making such appropriations. Requires that sufficient income from the Working Capital Fund remain outside the general fund of the Treasury to ensure the availability of working capital necessary to replace equipment and inventories of the Bureau. Requires that fees for specified services provided by the Bureau be at least sufficient to meet these and specified other capital requirements. Provides that the Director of the Bureau shall be compensated at the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule. Authorizes the Bureau, on its own initiative but only after consultation with local authorities, to investigate structural failures in structures used or occupied by the general public. Prohibits any part of any report resulting from such investigation from being admitted as evidence or used in any suit or action for damages arising out of any matter mentioned in such report."
