Defines \"cross compliance\" as the conditioning of price support payment eligibility for a certain crop for which an acreage limitation program is in effect upon the producer's limiting his planted acreage for any other crop also subject to acreage limitations to the acreage base for that other crop. Provides for a five-year period for determining wheat and feed grain crop acreage bases. Amends the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act to permit more than one local agricultural stabilization and conservation committee per administrative area in counties having three or more local committees as of the date of enactment of the Food Security Act of 1985."
