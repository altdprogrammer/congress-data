Requires the Secretary of the Treasury, at least once every six months within the period beginning on November 1, 1985, and ending on October 31, 1988, to determine whether the aggregate quantities of L-ephedrine hydrochloride produced in the United States plus that produced in foreign countries that are not subject to column two duty rates is sufficient to meet the U.S. demand for L-ephedrine hydrochloride. Requires the Secretary, if he makes an affirmative determination, to submit a written certification of such determination to the Congress and not to make any subsequent determinations. Requires each agency head to provide to the Secretary such information and assistance as he may need to carry out his duties under this Act."
