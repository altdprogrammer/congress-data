Sets forth conditions under which geothermal leases in effect as of July 27, 1984, shall be extended for a maximum of three successive five-year periods. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to review any cooperative or unit plan of development every five years after approval in order to eliminate any lease or part of lease not regarded as reasonably necessary to cooperative or unit operations. Makes geothermal leases in effect as of July 27, 1984, eligible for an administrative extension if an application is timely submitted."
