    "text": "Comprehensive Satellite Dish Owners Fairness Act of 1986 - Requires the Federal Communications Commission to initiate a notice of inquiry, solicit comments, and report to the Congress concerning the availability of certain encrypted television programming to satellite earth station owners in a competitive market. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit any person from encrypting any satellite cable programming for private viewing after six months following enactment of this Act, unless: (1) such encryption is conducted according to standards approved by the Commission which shall ensure that only one device will be needed to decrypt such programming; and (2) such a device is available within 60 days after an interested person submits a request. Permits a person aggrieved by any violation of such prohibition to bring a civil action to obtain an injunction against the violation and to recover full costs. Directs the Department of Justice to complete an investigation and report to the Congress on the antitrust implications of the development of the marketing structure of the cable communications industry pursuant to the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 with respect to satellite earth station owners."
