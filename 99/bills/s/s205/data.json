Establishes within the Treasury the National Organ Transplant Trust Fund. Appropriates to such trust fund an amount equal to the amount designated on tax returns for the fund. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations which will establish an organ transplantation program. Directs the Secretary to authorize payments from the trust fund on behalf of eligible individuals to pay costs of organ transplantation procedures, both preoperatively and postoperatively. Defines \"eligible individual\" as an individual who, as determined by the Secretary, has a life-threatening medical condition for which a transplant procedure is reasonably medically necessary and who has no source of payment for an organ transplantation procedure."
