Requires that a private plaintiff suing under RICO must have suffered a competitive, investment, or business injury separate from the injury of the predicate acts themselves. Requires that a least one act of the racketeering activity shall be an offense other than mail, wire, or security fraud. Authorizes the judge in his or her discretion to award attorneys' fees to the defendant if the judge finds that a suit is frivolous and without merit."
