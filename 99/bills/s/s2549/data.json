Excludes from gross income up to $100,000 of gain from the sale of farmland development rights by an individual who is age 55 or older. Allows a charitable contribution deduction for gain from the sale of farmland development rights to a State to the extent that the fair market value of such rights exceeds the amount actually received by the taxpayer."
