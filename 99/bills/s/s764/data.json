    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-03-28", 
    "text": "Job Skills Partnership Act - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to add a new title V, the Job Skills Partnership Program. (Redesignates the current title V as title VI.) Establishes the Job Skills Partnership Program to facilitate the formation of partnership relationships among business and State and local government institutions to provide for the development and expansion of programs of skills training and education directly consistent with employment needs. Earmarks for such Program five percent of the funds for part A (Adult and Youth Programs) of title II (Training Services for the Disadvantaged) and five percent of funds for title III (Employment and Training Assistance for Dislocated Workers). Sets forth formulas for determination of Program allotments to States, based on size of civilian labor force, with maximum and minimum limits. Limits eligibility to participate in job skills programs receiving title V assistance to individuals who are: (1) economically disadvantaged; (2) dislocated workers, identified under specified title III provisions; or (3) workers already employed by an existing industry or business, where job skills upgrading or retraining is necessary to avoid dislocation or where upgrading of existing employees would create new vacancies for other persons eligible for title V programs. Allows up to ten percent of title V program participants to be individuals who do not meet such eligibility criteria but who have encountered barriers to employment (such as individuals with limited English proficiency, displaced homemakers, teenage parents, handicapped, older workers, veterans, criminal offenders, alcoholics, or addicts). Permits title V assistance to States to be used to assist eligible individuals to obtain unsubsidized employment through a job skills program. Provides that such program shall be a cooperative course of instruction bringing together government and businesses to prepare individuals for employment in a specific trade, occupation, or profession. Provides that such programs may involve: (1) short-term skills training; (2) on-the-job skills training; (2) skills training operated by the private sector, including labor organizations or consortia of employers; or (4) skills upgrading or retraining for workers already employed by an existing business where necessary to avoid dislocation or where such upgrading would create new vacancies for the unemployed. Prohibits title V assistance from being used for subsidized employment of any kind. Limits to five percent that portion of a State's allotment which may be used for administrative expenses. Sets the business share of contribution to such job skills programs at 50 percent, the State share at 25 percent, and the Federal share at 25 percent. Directs the State Governor, in order for the State to receive title V assistance, to designate as an entity to administer the job skills program: (1) an existing or newly created State agency, quasi-public corporation, or public nonprofit corporation, to be the statewide agency administering the program; or (2) private industry councils, as provided for under title I of JTPA, to administer the program in each service delivery area. Sets forth the functions of such designated administrative entities. Sets forth requirements for job skills program plans, and for the review and approval of such plans. Sets forth provisions for the selection of service providers under such plans. Directs the Secretary of Labor to prescribe annual performance standards for title V programs, based on placement, retention in unsubsidized employment, increase in earnings, and reductions in welfare dependency. Sets forth program requirements for meeting such standards and procedures to be followed when such standards are not met. Makes specified JTPA provisions relating to State responsibilities, program requirements, and fiscal administration applicable to title V programs. Provides that nothing in title V shall be construed to limit State or private industry council authority to establish other or augmented job skills programs and courses, involving State and business matching contributions, through financial assistance provided under titles II and III of JTPA. Sets forth provisions earmarking specified JTPA funds (as noted above) for title V programs. Adds definitions of \"equipment,\" \"financial support,\" \"job skills program,\" and \"technical assistance.\" Makes technical and conforming amendments."
