    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 6 passed in lieu) Water Resources Development Act of 1986 - Title I - Directs the Secretary of the Army to obligate no sums in excess of those specified in this title for the combined purpose of the \"Construction General\" account and the \"Flood Control, Mississippi River and Tributaries\" account. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1991. Title II: General Provisions - Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements with landowners who are benefitted by local flood control projects to assure that such owners will contribute 50 percent of that portion of the project's costs allocated to the owner's benefits. Limits the commencement period for any such flood control project to ten years from the date of authorization of such project unless the Secretary notifies the Senate Committee on Environment and and Public Works and the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation that such project remains needed and justified. Allows for the submission of Federal projects with a cost of up to $10,000,000. Provides that any project with a cost exceeding $10,000,000 must be authorized by an Act of Congress. Provides further that each such project must contain benefits directly related to agriculture that account for at least 20 percent of the total benefits of the project. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to study and report to the appropriate congressional committees on the feasibility of requiring full public access to all water impoundment facilities that have recreation-related potential. Amends Federal law to provide for the compatibility of Federal flood control projects with any existing or planned local flood control improvement programs. Directs the Secretary of the Army to undertake a program for the control of river ice, to assist communities in the breakup of such ice, and to provide technical assistance to local units of government to control or break up such ice. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1991. Directs the Secretary of the Army to undertake a demonstration program for the control of river ice at Hardwick, Vermont. Authorizes appropriations for such program. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress by March 1, 1988, on activities under this section. Directs the Secretary to undertake an experimental program to protect Salmon, Idaho, from flooding as a result of ice dams. Requires a report to the Congress by March 1, 1988. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose. Directs the Secretary, upon request, to survey the potential of rehabilitating former industrial sites, millraces, and so forth already constructed for use as hydroelectric facilities. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1991. Amends the Flood Control Act of 1970 concerning agreements made between Federal and State governments for cooperation in payment of mutually-beneficial flood control projects. Requires a favorable report from the Chief of Engineers before any flood control facility construction may begin. Directs the Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to promulgate rules governing penalties and interest for any delinquent payments by non-Federal interests required by the Flood Control Act of 1970. Authorizes the Secretary to determine that no funds appropriated to the Corps of Engineers for operating and maintenance are to be used to benefit projects within the jurisdiction of any non-Federal interest which is in arrears for more than 24 months in the payment of charges due. Provides that the Secretary shall not require non-Federal interests to assume operation of any federally-run facility as a condition to the construction of new recreational facilities. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with area Federal Project Repayment Districts for the recovery of appropriate shares of project costs. Requires the Secretary to determine that revenues derived from such contracts will be sufficient to meet cost recovery requirements under Federal law. Authorizes the Secretary to investigate, study, plan, and implement structural and nonstructural measures for the prevention or mitigation of shore damages attributable to Federal navigation works, provided: (1) a non-Federal public body agrees to operate and maintain such measures; and (2) the costs of implementing such measures are shared. Prohibits the Secretary from initiating construction of any water resources project if such project has been modified to increase any of the following project parameters by more than 25 percent: (1) acreage of land acquisition; (2) reservoir capacity; (3) width or depth of any navigation channel; (4) hydroelectric generating capacity; or (5) linear miles of stream channelization. Directs the Secretary to submit to the Congress, within 180 days of proposal, a report on any such project modification together with his recommendations thereon. Amends the Water Resources Research Act to establish the High Plains Study Council to: (1) review research work conducted by State advisory committees; and (2) coordinate such research to avoid duplication of efforts by States of the High Plains. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish within each State of the High Plains Region an Ogallala Aquifer technical advisory committee (the State Committee). Directs such State Committee to: (1) review existing State laws concerning water management and recommend appropriate changes; (2) establish State priorities for water resources research and demonstration projects; and (3) provide information and technical assistance concerning the need for water conservation and management. Directs the Secretary to allocate annually funds to States of the High Plains Region for research in water-use efficiency, cultural methods, irrigation technologies, water-efficient crops, and water and soil conservation. Directs that such funds shall be distributed to State institutions of higher learning on the basis of merit. Directs the Secretary to divide funds among the States of the High Plains Region for research into: (1) precipitation management; (2) weather modification; (3) aquifer recharge opportunities; (4) saline water uses; (5) desalinization technologies; (6) salt-tolerant crops; and (7) ground water recovery. Directs the Secretary to allocate annually funds to High Plains Region States for grants to farmers for demonstration projects in: (1) water-efficient irrigation technologies and practices; (2) soil and water conservation management systems; and (3) the growth and marketing of more water-efficient crops. Provides that such grants to farmers shall be made on the basis of merit. Directs the Secretary of the Army, acting through the United States Geological survey, to monitor the levels of the Ogallala Aquifer, and report annually to the Congress. Allows the Secretary to proceed with advance engineering and design of water resources development projects pending authorization, provided the project is in the public interest. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a study of shoreline protection and beach erosion control policy in view of the prospect for long-term increases in the level of the ocean. Requires the Secretary, within three years of the date of enactment of this Act, to transmit the study together with recommendations to the appropriate congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to require a review of the cost effectiveness of design of each water resources project which has a cost in excess of $10,000,000. Requires the Secretary to prepare a feasibility report for each such project being reviewed, after conducting a reconnaissance of the water resources problems, in order to identify potential solutions. Requires such reconnaissance to be limited to 18 months. Requires non-Federal interests to contribute 50 percent of the cost of any such study. Requires the mitigation of fish and wildlife losses to be undertaken before construction on the project involved begins. Authorizes the Secretary to mitigate damages to fish and wildlife. Requires a report to the Congress when mitigation features are likely to require condemnation.
