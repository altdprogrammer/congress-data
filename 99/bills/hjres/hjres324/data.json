Prohibits both the importation into the United States of Ethiopian goods and services and, except for emergency relief assistance, the exportation of U.S. goods and services to Ethiopia until such time as the President determines that the Ethiopian regime has ceased to conduct a policy of starvation of its people and has granted them fundamental human rights and the Congress has enacted a joint resolution approving such determination. Requires the President to suspend all economic assistance and to deny any security assistance to the Government of Ethiopia. Requires the President to submit a report to the Congress on the progress by the Ethiopian regime to end such policies."
