    "as": "Conference report filed in House", 
    "date": "1985-12-10", 
    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 99-433) Increases the public debt limit to $1,847,800,000,000 or $2,078,700,000,000 on and after October 1, 1985. Directs the Senate Committee on Finance, by July 1, 1986, to report legislation providing for payment of an alternative minimum tax by corporations on the broadest feasible definition of income to assure that all of those with economic income pay their fair share of taxes. Applies the revenue raised toward the Federal deficit. Requires the House Ways and Means Committee to report the same type of legislation before October 1, 1986. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States: (1) demands that no country provide safe harbor or safe passage to the hijackers of the Achille Lauro; (2) expects the full cooperation of all countries in the apprehension, prosecution, and punishment of the hijackers; (3) cannot condone the release of terrorists or the making of concessions to terrorists; (4) should identify the hijackers and the countries and groups that aid terrorist activities; and (5) should take the strongest measures to ensure that those responsible for the murder of an American citizen, Leon Klinghoffer, aboard the Achille Lauro are brought to justice. Title II: Deficit Reduction Procedures - Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) - Part A: Congressional Budget Process - Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to prescribe maximum Federal budget deficits for each of fiscal years 1986 through 1991 providing for the incremental reduction of the deficit to zero by FY 1991. Requires Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) revenues and expenditures to be included in the calculation of deficits. Requires the receipts, revenues, disbursements, budget authority, and outlays of each off-budget Federal entity for a fiscal year to be included in total budget authority, total budget outlays, and total revenues and the amounts of budget authority and outlays set forth for each major functional category of the budget for such fiscal year. Requires amounts paid by the Federal Financing Bank to purchase loans made or guaranteed by a Government entity to be treated as outlays of such entity. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to revise the timetable with respect to the congressional budget process. Eliminates the second concurrent resolution on the budget. Requires the Congress to complete action on an annual concurrent resolution on the budget on or before April 15 of each year. Requires such budget resolution to set forth appropriate budgetary levels for each fiscal year beginning on October 1 of such year and planning levels for each of the two ensuing fiscal years. Provides that such resolution may also set forth: (1) reconciliation directives; and (2) the calendar year in which the Congress believes the unemployment goals of the Employment Act of 1946 should be achieved. Requires that any budget resolution reported by the Committee on the Budget of the House which changes any rule of the House of Representatives be referred to the Committee on Rules. Authorizes the Committee on Rules to report the resolution with an amendment to strike or change the provision affecting the rule. Requires the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction to report their budget views and estimates to the Committee on the Budget of the House or the Senate, respectively, by February 25 of each year. Requires the report of the Budget Committees accompanying a budget resolution to contain congressional committee allocations of total budget authority, entitlement authority, and credit authority under the resolution. Requires the joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report on a budget resolution to set forth the common economic assumptions upon which such statement, report, or any amendment under technical disagreement is based. Requires the Committee on the Budget of the House to consult with the standing committees of the House during the preparation, consideration, and enforcement of the budget resolution with respect to all matters which relate to the jurisdiction or functions of such committees. Establishes a point of order against either House of Congress considering any budget resolution, amendment thereto, conference report thereon, or later revision thereof providing for budget outlays exceeding revenues by more than the maximum deficit amount prescribed for the fiscal year. Allows the House of Representative to waive such point of order by a three-fifths vote under certain circumstances. Requires the joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report on a budget resolution to include committee allocations of new budget authority. Requires, for the House of Representatives, that each allocation divide new budget authority and resulting budget outlays, entitlement authority, and credit authority between mandatory or uncontrollable amounts and discretionary or controllable amounts. Establishes a point of order against either House considering any bill, resolution, or amendment thereto which provides new budget, spending, or credit authority for a fiscal year: (1) within the jurisdiction of any committee until such committee makes any required allocations and subdivisions pursuant to the budget resolution for that year; or (2) in excess of the appropriate committee allocation. Provides that the point of order against either House considering legislation providing new budget authority or increases or decreases in revenues or the public debt for a fiscal year until the concurrent resolution for that fiscal year has been adopted shall: (1) also apply to legislation providing new entitlement or credit authority; and (2) not apply in the House of Representatives after May 15 of a calendar year to any general appropriations bill providing new budget authority for the fiscal year beginning in that calendar year. Sets forth revised House and Senate procedures for the consideration of budget resolutions. Requires the House Committee on Appropriations to report all regular appropriations bills for the upcoming fiscal year by June 10. Requires any House or Senate committee report and each conference report on legislation providing new budget authority (other than continuing appropriations), new spending or credit authority, or an increase or decrease in revenues or tax expenditures for a fiscal year to include: (1) a statement comparing the levels in such measure to the appropriate committee allocations for such year; (2) a statement identifying and justifying the new spending authority; (3) a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projection of how such legislation will affect the levels of such budget authority, budget outlays, spending authority, revenues, tax expenditures, direct loan obligations, or primary loan guarantee commitments for such fiscal year and the four succeeding years; and (4) CBO's estimate of the level of new budget authority for State and local assistance provided by such legislation. Requires CBO's tabulations of congressional budget action to report information on all such legislation to all House and Senate committees at least monthly. Directs each Budget Committee to make monthly summary budget scorekeeping reports including such tabulations to the members of its House. Requires CBO's five-year projection report to include information on entitlement authority and credit authority for each fiscal year. Establishes a point of order in the House of Representatives against considering any resolution providing for an adjournment period of more than three days in July until the House has approved all regular appropriations bills and any required reconciliation legislation for the upcoming fiscal year. Revises the reconciliation process to require that any reconciliation directives by which budget authority, entitlement authority, credit authority, revenues, or the public debt limit need to be changed to effectuate the provisions of a budget resolution be included in such resolution. Allows specified variance in the composition of changes required for a committee through reconciliation, provided that the total amount of changes recommended is not less that the total amount required. Provides that no amendment that would increase specific budget outlays or reduce specific revenues set forth in a reconciliation bill or resolution shall be in order in either House, unless such amendment provides for offsetting adjustments in other outlays and revenues, with specified exceptions. Requires the Congress to complete action on any reconciliation bill or resolution by June 15 of each year. Makes it out of order for either House to consider any reconciliation bill or resolution containing recommendations concerning the OASDI program. Establishes a point of order in the Senate against the consideration of any legislation that would provide new budget or entitlement authority or reduce revenues for a fiscal year for which a budget resolution has been completed, if such legislation would result in a deficit exceeding the applicable maximum deficit amount. Allows consideration in the House of Representatives of legislation providing new budget or entitlement authority, if such legislation would not cause committee allocations to be exceeded. Establishes a point of order against either House considering any legislation which provides new credit authority, unless such new credit authority is to be effective for any fiscal year only to the extent and in such amounts as provided in appropriation Acts. Requires CBO's cost analyses of reported bills to include descriptions of any methods for establishing Federal financial commitments contained in such bills. Requires the General Accounting Office to: (1) study provisions of law providing spending authority and permanent appropriations; and (2) report to the Congress recommendations for the appropriate form of financing for activities or programs financed by such provisions. Requires budget and credit authority and estimates of outlays and receipts for activities of the Federal budget which are off-budget immediately prior to enactment of this provision, excluding activities of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds, to be included in the budget transmitted by the President to the Congress and in the budget resolution. Directs the Speaker of the House to appoint a Member User Group to review and advise the Speaker on the effect and impact of budgetary scorekeeping rules and practices. Requires CBO to: (1) submit its annual fiscal policy reports to the Budget Committees by February 15; (2) report to the Congress by January 15 each year a listing of all programs and activities lacking authorizations of appropriations in the current and upcoming fiscal years; and (4) conduct continuing studies to enhance comparisons of budget outlays, credit authority, and tax expenditures. Requires the President to submit the current services budget to the Congress by the first Monday after January 3 of each year. Requires the Joint Economic Committee to submit its economic evaluation of such budget to the Budget Committees before March 1. Requires that congressional committees receive prompt notification of all changes in budget functional categories. Amends the rules of the House of Representatives to: (1) make it the function of the Rules Committee to conduct a continuing study of, and report to the House on, the congressional budget process; (2) require the election of House committees within seven calendar days after a new Congress convenes; and (3) permit consideration of rescissions of appropriations and transfers of unexpended balances within the agency for which they were originally appropriated when such rescissions or transfers are included in a general appropriation bill.

Part B: Budget Submitted by the President - Requires submission of the President's budget to the Congress by the first Monday after January 3 of each year. Requires the annual budget submitted by the President to be prepared on the basis of the best estimates available so as to ensure that the deficit set forth for a fiscal year shall not exceed the applicable maximum deficit amount.

Part C: Emergency Powers to Eliminate Deficits in Excess of Maximum Deficit Amount - Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Director of CBO: (1) by August 15 of each year (January 10, 1986, for FY 1986), to estimate the budget base levels of total revenues and budget outlays for the upcoming fiscal year; (2) to determine whether the projected deficit for such fiscal year will exceed the applicable maximum deficit amount and whether such excess will be greater than $10,000,000,000 (zero in 1986 and 1991); (3) to estimate the rate of real economic growth for such fiscal year, each quarter of such year, and the last two quarters of the preceding fiscal year; and (4) by August 20 of each year (January 15, 1986, for FY 1986), to report such information to the Comptroller General together with the amounts and percentages by which each non-defense program account and each program, project, and activity within each defense account must be reduced in any fiscal year for which the projected deficit exceeds the maximum deficit amount by over $10,000,000,000 (zero in 1986 and 1991) in order to eliminate such excess. Sets forth procedures for determining such reductions for a fiscal year. Requires that reductions necessary to eliminate one half of the deficit excess for a fiscal year (such excess shall not exceed $11,700,000,000 for FY 1986) be made in outlays under defense program accounts and that reductions necessary to eliminate the other half be made in outlays under non-defense program accounts. Requires automatic spending increases for specified Federal retirement programs to be reduced by a uniform percentage up to 100 percent as necessary to reduce one-half of the deficit excess, also to be divided between defense and non-defense programs.

Requires the Directors' report to the Comptroller General to also specify: (1) the amount and percentage reduction in automatic spending increases by program and the resulting reduction in the deficit excess; (2) the savings to be achieved in the application of each special rule, exception, and limitation to such reduction process prescribed in this Act and the amount of the percentage reduction in Federal payments to States under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970; and (3) a budgetary breakdown of the reductions for defense and non-defense by account, together with estimates of resulting reductions in outlays. Sets forth the economic and technical assumptions to be used by the Directors in determining the budget base to be used in making the estimates, determinations, specifications, and reduction calculations under this Act. Requires the Directors to average differences to produce a single, consistent set of data. Requires the Comptroller General, by August 25 of each year (January 20, 1986, for FY 1986), to submit to the Congress and the President a report based on the OMB-CBO report, providing the same items of information, and explaining any differences in such reports. Requires the Directors, by October 5 of each fiscal year, to submit to the Comptroller General a revised report identifying: (1) any change in the deficit excess for such year as a result of laws enacted and regulations promulgated after the submission of their initial report; and (2) any necessary adjustments in the estimates, determinations, specifications, and reductions contained in the initial report. Requires the Comptroller General, by October 10, to submit a revised version of his report as necessary in light of the revised OMB-CBO report. Sets forth defense program sequestration procedures providing for: (1) the determination of a uniform reduction percentage; (2) the sequestration of new budget authority and unobligated balances; and (3) sequestration from national defense accounts through the termination or modification of existing contracts. Directs the President, on September 1 (February 1, 1986, for FY 1986) preceding each fiscal year for which the Comptroller General's report identifies a deficit excess over $10,000,000,000 (zero for FY 1986 and 1991), to issue an initital order eliminating such deficit excess in accordance with such report by modifying or suspending the operation of each provision of Federal law requiring an automatic spending increase and by sequestering new budget authority, unobligated balances, new loan guarantee commitments, new direct loan obligations, and spending authority. Requires such order to provide for reductions as specified in the report (except as provided for defense programs for FY 1986).

Prohibits the President's order for FY 1986 from resulting in a military base closure or realignment. Requires the President to issue a final order on October 15 of each year (the initial order shall be the final order for FY 1986) providing for any adjustments required pursuant to the Comptroller General's revised report. Prohibits the elimination of any Federal program, project, or activity or the denial of benefits to any eligible person as a result of such a presidential order.
