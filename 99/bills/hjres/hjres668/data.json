    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #208 (47-40)) Title I: (Not Present) Title II: Social Security Trust Funds - Social Security Trust Funds Management Act of 1986 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to direct the Managing Trustee of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund (OASDI trust funds), as soon as possible without exceeding the public debt limit or jeopardizing the timely payment of OASDI benefits, to invest any amounts in the trust funds that have not been invested solely by reason of the public debt limit, if the taxes with respect to which such amounts were appropriated have been received in the general fund of the Treasury. Eliminates such receipt of taxes requirement on July 1, 1990. Defines the term \"debt limit impact period\" as any period for which the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the issuance of Government obligations sufficient to conduct the financial operations of the United States may not be made without exceeding the public debt limit. Requires the Managing Trustee, upon expiration of any debt limit impact period, to: (1) reissue to each OASDI fund obligations identical to obligations which were redeemed during such period and which would not have been redeemed if such period had not occurred; (2) issue to each OASDI trust fund obligations identical to obligations which were not issued during such period but which would have been issued if such period had not occurred; and (3) pay to each OASDI trust fund an amount equal to the interest such trust fund failed to earn because of redemptions, disinvestments, or the lack of investments during a debt limit impact period solely by reason of the public debt limit. Provides for the immediate availability of OASDI tax receipts exclusively for purposes of the OASDI program upon their transfer from the general fund of the Treasury. Requires such transfer to occur upon the receipt of such taxes by the Treasury. (Currently, monthly transfers are made.) Requires members of the OASDI trust funds' Board of Trustees to faithfully execute their duties, but does not impose a fiduciary duty. Requires the Board to meet at least twice each year. Sets forth provisions requiring reports by the Board to the Congress and the Managing Trustee to the Board and the Congress on the status and operation of the OASDI trust funds during any debt limit impact period. Directs the Managing Trustee to immediately invest such portion of the OASDI trust funds as is not required for current withdrawals. Allows the Managing Trustee to sell or redeem OASDI trust fund obligations only for OASDI program purposes. Directs the Managing Trustee to sell and redeem obligations necessary to ensure timely payment of OASDI benefits, even if either OASDI trust fund holds any amounts not invested by reason of the public debt limit, provided the principal amount of such obligations shall not exceed the principal amount of obligations that would have been sold or redeemed under normal operating procedures. Title III: Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control - Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1986 - Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to revise sequestration procedures. Directs the Comptroller General to submit the General Accounting Office's (GAO) initial and revised sequestration reports for a fiscal year to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). (Current law requires such reports to be submitted to the President.) Requires the GAO reports to contain the Comptroller General's views concerning the estimates, determinations, and specifications contained in the report submitted by the Directors of OMB and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Requires the Director of OMB to issue to the President and the Congress: (1) by September 1 preceding the fiscal year, an initial sequestration report based on the initial GAO report, providing the same items of information as contained in the OMB-CBO report, and explaining any deviations between the estimates, determinations, and specifications included and the views of the Comptroller General in the GAO report; and (2) by October 15, a revised report as necessary in light of the revised GAO report. Requires such revised report to contain the same estimated amounts of budget authority, outlays, spending authority, revenues, obligation limitations, obligated balances, unobligated balances, loan guarantee commitments, and direct loan obligations as contained in the initial report unless legislation is enacted, a final regulation is promulgated, or a sale of assets is announced after such initial report which requires a change.
