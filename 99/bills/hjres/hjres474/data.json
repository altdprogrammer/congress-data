Requires the President to urge the Cuban Government to agree to establish a fund to be administered by the International Monetary Fund for the purpose of paying such claims (such fund to be supported by royalties on such commodities as minerals including iron ore, nickel, oil, and others plus sugar, rum, seafoods, and tobacco)."
