Specifies applicable funding levels and limitations on authority. Makes continuing appropriations for FY 1986, under current terms and conditions and at rates not exceeding current rates, for projects and activities for which provision was made in the Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriation Act, 1985, the Military Construction Appropriation Act, 1985, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1985, specified provisions of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1985, concerning natural disaster activities, and the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1985. Makes appropriations for continuing activities which were conducted in FY 1985 and for which provision was made in the Department of Defense Appropriation Act, 1985, under current terms and conditions and at rates not exceeding current rates. Specifies restrictions on defense procurement (including MX missile procurement). Prohibits the use of any such appropriations or authority for any project or activity for which funds or authority were not available during FY 1985. Provides that funds and authority provided by this Act shall remain available until: (1) enactment of an appropriation for a specified project or activity; (2) enactment of the applicable appropriation Act by both Houses without any provision for such project or activity; or (3) November 14, 1985, whichever comes first. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, pending enactment of general farm legislation, to: (1) provide for nonrecourse loans on agricultural commodities at such levels as will reflect a fair return to the farm producer above the cost of production; (2) provide for payment by the purchaser, rather than by appropriation, for commodities sold for domestic use; and (3) issue regulations to enable producers of any agricultural commodity to vote to limit their production to the volume estimated to be needed for domestic consumption, to maintain the pipeline, and to regain and retain by competitive sales their normal share of the world market."
