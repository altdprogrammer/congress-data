Directs the Commission to: (1) describe the development, nature, and functions of Federal poverty definitions; (2) examine the adequacy of current Federal poverty thresholds in reflecting poverty in the United States; (3) determine the types and adequacy of the data bases used by the Government for calculating poverty; (4) evaluate all current efforts to value noncash benefits which may influence the determination of the Federal poverty status of an individual or group; (5) compile a list of Federal and State programs which are linked to any Federal or State poverty definition; (6) develop, assess, and conduct public hearings on options for measuring poverty; and (7) report to the Congress recommendations on methods of measuring poverty which ensure that federally established poverty levels accurately reflect the true nature and extent of poverty. Directs the Commission to submit to the Congress an interim report one year after it is organized and a final report two years after it is organized. Terminates the Commission 30 days after it submits its final report. Requires expenses of the Commission to be paid from the contingent fund of the House of Representatives."
