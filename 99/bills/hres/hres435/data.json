Prohibits a Member from using the equivalent priority mail rate for franked mail, unless the mail is inherently time sensitive. Decreases, after April 30, 1986, the amount of franked mail to which Members are entitled. Provides a formula to count against limitations on the use of the frank, mail matter for the period beginning on May 1, 1986, and ending on December 31, 1986, that relates to a Member's notice of appearance or scheduled itinerary. Provides a formula, for the period beginning on May 1, 1986, and ending on September 30, 1986, to limit the amount of franked mail a Member may mail that is not in direct response to an inquiry or request."
