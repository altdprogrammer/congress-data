    "text": "Requires the House Administration Committee to investigate, recount and report to the House of Representatives on contested elections for the House by January 3 following each general election. Sets forth procedures for a congressional candidate to contest an election. Requires the candidate to deposit $5,000 with the Clerk of the House to secure the right to a full and complete investigation and recount as necessary. Requires the Committee to conduct a recount in all precincts, counties, or voting districts requested as well as any additional voting districts they deem advisable. Allows the Committee to repay the candidate: (1) in full the amount of the deposit if such investigation alters the ultimate result of the election; or (2) if the investigation does not alter the election result, the difference between $5,000 and the expenses incurred in conducting the recount. Authorizes the Committee to file interim reports when the public interest will be best served by such filing."
