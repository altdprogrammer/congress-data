Directs the National Climate Program Office, within one year after the enactment of this Act and triennially thereafter, to develop and transmit to the Congress a report outlining a comprehensive, long-term research program focused on the causes, variability, and prediction of African drought. Sets forth factors which each such African drought research plan shall address. Directs the President to establish an interagency monitoring program integrating satellite, meteorological, agricultural, health, and demographic information to identify and minimize international food supply problems caused by drought. Directs the President, by September 30 of each year, to report to the Congress on such program. Sets forth factors which such report shall address. Makes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration the lead agency charged with implementing the African drought research plan. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1990 for such purpose. Directs the President to designate the lead agency for the interagency drought monitoring program. Authorizes appropriations for purposes of such program."
