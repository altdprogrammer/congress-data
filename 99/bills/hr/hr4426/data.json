Rept. 99-779 (Part I)) Amends the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 to authorize grants and appropriations for FY 1987-1988 for natural gas pipeline safety programs. Amends the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 to authorize appropriations for FY 1987-1988 for hazardous liquid pipeline safety programs. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate regulations requiring pipeline operators to report: (1) any condition that constitutes a safety hazard; and (2) any safety-related condition causing a significant change or restriction in the operation of pipeline facilities. Requires that such reports be submitted in writing within five working days after a determination has been made that a safety hazard exists. Requires that pipeline transportation facilities maintenance plans include terms designed to enhance the ability to discover safety-related conditions and hazards."
