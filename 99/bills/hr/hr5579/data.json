Authorizes the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to provide for such care to the extent that resources and facilities are otherwise available for such care. Directs the Administrator of Veterans Affairs, upon proper proof, to repay each veteran for expenses incurred in receiving (and paying for) the above services at another facility because the Administrator could not furnish such care or services."
