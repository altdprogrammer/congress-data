    "text": "Africa Famine, Recovery, and Development Fund Act - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to provide aid for: (1) relief, rehabilitation, and recovery activities in sub-Saharan Africa; and (2) long-term development in sub-Saharan Africa. Sets forth the objectives of such long-term development assistance. Requires that the funds to carry out this Act will be provided through authorizations that are separate from the development assistance authorizations. Designates the funds appropriated to carry out this Act as the Africa Famine, Recovery, and Development Fund. Makes certain other development and economic assistance funds available for assistance to sub-Saharan Africa. Authorizes the President to procure goods and services for use in carrying out this Act. Authorizes the President to make available certain amounts from the Fund to support activities of international organizations which are consistent with the purposes of this Act and which are undertaken in coordination with the Agency for International Development. Encourages the President to use the authorities provided in this Act in cooperation with activities of the multilateral development banks in sub-Saharan Africa. Expresses the sense of the Congress that appropriate Federal officials should undertake special efforts to reduce trade barriers and otherwise encourage trade between the United States and the developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa and to promote debt relief measures for these countries. Includes in the President's annual report to the Congress on foreign aid programs a report on the progress made in carrying out this Act."
