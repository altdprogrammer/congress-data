    "text": "Amends the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act to authorize a cigarette manufacturer or importer to apply to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to implement a rotation of warning labels on certain brands so that each of the authorized warning labels appears on the manufacturer's or importer's brands an equal number of times within the 12 month period beginning on the date of approval by the FTC. Authorizes the manufacturer or importer to apply for such label rotation if: (1) the number of cigarettes of such brand sold in the preceding fiscal year in the United States is less than one-fourth of one percent of all cigarettes sold in the United States in such year; and (2) more than one-half of the cigarettes manufactured or imported by such manufacturer or importer for sale in the United States are packaged into such brands. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the Congress by January 1, 1986, and biennially thereafter on certain Federal and private sector activities relating to smoking."
