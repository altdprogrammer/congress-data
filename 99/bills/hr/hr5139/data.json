    "text": "Title I: Emergency Relief for the Homeless - Subtitle A: Emergency Shelter for the Homeless - Declares that the homeless are entitled to decent overnight shelter. Amends part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of title IV of the Social Security Act to require States to furnish emergency assistance to the homeless without regard to the durational and eligibility requirements otherwise imposed on such assistance. Includes within such assistance: (1) adequate food and shelter; and (2) social services, such as child care counseling, job search assistance, and the location of permanent housing. Subtitle B: Social Security Assistance to the Homeless - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) establish and conduct an ongoing program to inform the homeless of, and assist them in securing, benefits available under titles II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) and XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Act; and (2) periodically review Social Security Administration procedures so as to remove technical and bureaucratic barriers the homeless face when filing benefit claims. Amends the SSI program to extend SSI eligibility to residents of halfway houses. (Currently, such assistance is provided to those in public emergency shelter.) Eliminates the three-month per year limit on the eligibility of halfway house and emergency shelter residents. Subtitle C: Entitlement Eligibility for the Homeless - Prohibits the lack of a permanent address from affecting a family's or an individual's eligibility for AFDC or SSI benefits. Requires the development of methods for processing claims and providing benefits to homeless AFDC and SSI beneficiaries. Title II: Prevention of Homelessness - Subtitle A: Prevention of Homelessness of Disabled and Institutionalized Persons Under SSI Program - Amends the SSI program to consider chronically mentally ill individuals as presumptively disabled and thus eligible for immediate SSI payments. Provides full SSI benefits to chronically mentally ill individuals through their third month at a medical institution if they continue to maintain and pay the expenses of a home to which they may return upon discharge. Directs the Secretary to establish, maintain, and improve pre-release procedures for individuals in medical, penal, and other institutions which prevent homelessness by permitting such individuals to file an application for SSI benefits prior to discharge. Requires the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture to establish procedures whereby such a pre-release application may also be used to apply for the food stamp program. Subtitle B: Prevention of Homelessness of Families and Children - Amends the AFDC program to modify rules used in assessing a stepparent's income for the purpose of determining AFDC eligibility. Authorizes States to extend AFDC eligibility to students aged 18 to 21. Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Act to authorize foster care maintenance payments on behalf of students as well as supervised independent living program participants, up to age 21. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Sets forth the effective date."
