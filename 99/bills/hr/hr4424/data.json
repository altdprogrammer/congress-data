Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to increase from $1,000 to $10,000 the civil penalty for certain safety violations of such Act or of its regulations by persons operating aircraft for the carriage of persons or property for compensation or hire. Provides a civil penalty of $1,000 for safety violations relating to notification of proposed construction of structures which could pose a hazard to air navigation. (Current law provides only for a criminal penalty.) Declares that it is the sense of the Congress that each aircraft operated in domestic or foreign air transportation should be reinspected and recertified under such Act to ensure flight safety."
