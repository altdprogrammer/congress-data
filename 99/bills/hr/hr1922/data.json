Permits the participant or beneficiary to recover such benefits by proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the administrator erred in denying such benefits. Permits the participant or beneficiary to recover a reasonable attorney's fee and costs of such action from the Administrator if the Administrator or the Administrator's agent is found to have wrongfully denied such benefits in an arbitrary and capricious manner."
