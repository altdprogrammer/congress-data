    "text": "Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984 to apply the guidelines regarding the termination of annuity benefits for survivors of Federal retirees who remarry before age 55, and the guidelines regarding restoration of such benefits upon dissolution of such remarriages, to: (1) remarriages occurring on or after the date of enactment of such Act (November 8, 1984); and (2) periods beginning on or after such date. (This would permit survivors who were widowed before May 8, 1985, the effective date of the guidelines, to remarry at age 55 without losing their benefits.) Provides that a survivor's annuity shall be either 55 percent of the Federal retiree's annuity or that portion which the retiree has designated for survivor annuity benefits. Permits a Federal retiree to elect a survivor's annuity for a former spouse within 18 months of the effective date of certain regulations under this Act (thus granting an 18 month extension to annuitants who wish to modify a previous election.) Allows Federal retirees who have elected a survivor's annuity for a former spouse before certain implementing regulations become effective to modify such election by designating in writing that only a portion of such annuity is to be used as the base for the former spouse's survivor annuity. Directs the Office of Personnel Management to prescribe regulations to implement the survivor annuity provisions, including regulations for making refunds pursuant to an annuitant's election modifications. Permits certain former spouses of Federal retirees who are entitled to a survivor's annuity to enroll in an approved Federal employees health benefits program within 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act. Applies survivor's annuity benefits guidelines to individuals married to Federal retirees as of the effective date of this Act unless: (1) the retiree notifies in writing that such benefits are not desired; or (2) the retiree has married after retirement and did not make a survivor's annuity election before enactment of this Act. Permits Federal retirees who have retired within 180 days after enactment the Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984, and whose spouses have been precluded for certain reasons from receiving survivor annuity benefits, to elect for such benefits in writing within 18 months of the effective date of certain regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management. Establishes guidelines under which certain survivor annuity elections shall be prospectively voided. Amends the annuity computation guidelines to provide that annuity elections made by married employees (or Members of Congress) on behalf of a spouse may be made only if any right of such spouse to a survivor annuity based on the annuitant's service is waived. Directs the Office of Personnel Management to notify Federal retirees who are retired as of the 180th day after enactment of the Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984 of the procedures and deadlines applicable to the exercise of their rights under such Act."
