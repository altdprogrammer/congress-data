Directs the Secretary of Transportation to apportion Federal-aid highway system funds which have been withheld from a State even if 18-, 19-, or 20-year old persons may lawfully purchase alcoholic beverages from such an establishment. Authorizes the Secretary to add eligibility criteria to basic and supplemental grants to States which implement alcohol traffic safety programs. Identifies such criteria as: (1) the establishment of mandatory education programs for new operators of motor vehicles and persons convicted of driving while intoxicated; and (2) the establishment of comprehensive education programs for employees and patrons of establishments authorized to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises."
