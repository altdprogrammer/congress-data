Limits such program to ten participants during any fiscal year. Allows the head of an agency to accept voluntary services if the services: (1) are to be performed by a participant in the exchange program; and (2) will not displace any Government employee. Declares: (1) that such participants shall be subject to Federal conflict-of-interest laws and considered agency employees for all purposes except those of pay and benefits; and (2) that nothing in this Act shall prevent continued pay and benefits from the private-sector employer. Directs the General Accounting Office to report to the Congress on such program not later than March 31, 1989."
