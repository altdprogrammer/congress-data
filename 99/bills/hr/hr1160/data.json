Provides for optional area triggers for such program. Amends the Federal Supplemental Compensation Act of 1982 to extend the period for supplemental unemployment compensation program payments to individuals through September 30, 1985. Revises the definition of the \"period of eligibility\" under such Act, with respect to any individual, to mean any week beginning before April 1, 1986. Sets forth provisions relating to effective dates. Directs the Secretary of Labor to take all steps necessary to establish systems and procedures for the collection of data necessary to carry out this Act."
