    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-12-12", 
    "text": "Trucking Deregulation Act of 1985 - Declares that the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) has no jurisdiction over motor carriers of property (except for those providing transportation of household goods for specified purposes). (Retains ICC jurisdiction over motor carrier transportation of passengers until three years after the effective date of this Act.) Transfers responsibility for issuing certificates of registration for foreign motor carriers operating in the United States from the ICC to the Secretary of Transportation. Authorizes the President to take action to respond to unfair practices against U.S. motor carriers of property by a contiguous foreign country. Removes ICC jurisdiction to suspend and investigate rates for the transportation of household goods for the U.S. Government on the basis that such rates are predatory. Authorizes the President to limit foreign-owned trucking operations in the United States if he determines it is in the national interest to do so. Removes, three years after the effective date of this Act, the special antitrust immunity conferred upon certain business relationships between a household goods van line and its own local agents. Authorizes the ICC to require during such three-year period that household goods van lines and their agents submit for ICC approval agreements involving such special antitrust immunity. Transfers ICC jurisdiction over household goods operations to the Federal Trade Commission. Deletes trucks from the definition of motor vehicles (thus ensuring that trucks previously regulated by the ICC are no longer entitled to preferential financing). Removes the ICC jurisdiction to approve pooling agreements and agreements dealing with division of transportation or earnings among motor carriers of property. (Temporarily retains such jurisdiction over household goods carriers). Prohibits the enactment of any State law regarding interstate rates, routes or services of any motor carrier of property. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to investigate economic regulation of trucking by State regulatory bodies, and to report the results of such investigation to the President and the Congress. Removes the Federal standards of liability for motor carriers of property no longer under ICC jurisdiction (thus making such carriers subject to liability under State law). Repeals the dispute settlement program for household goods carriers. Transfers ICC jurisdiction over motor carriers of property to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Grants the FTC exclusive powers to enforce ICC regulations over household goods. Requires the FTC to review and revise such regulations to ensure that household goods shippers receive adequate protection in their dealings with carriers. Includes private motor carriers of property within the enforcement purview of Department of Transportation safety regulations. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to enforce compliance with registration requirements for foreign motor carriers. Requires motor carriers of property (including foreign motor carriers) to designate agents for service of notice and process with the Department of Transportation. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for foreign carriers who violate registration requirements. Adds motor carriers of property to the list of carriers which may be required to display identification plates on their vehicles."
