    "text": "Publics Works Job Program Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make grants to city and county governments to pay the costs of construction, rehabilitation, renovation, repair, and improvement of local public works. Prohibits the use of such Federal payments for the acquisition of any interest in real property, or for paying maintenance costs for projects constructed under this Act. Requires interested city and county governments to submit a grant application to the Secretary. Specifies eligibility criteria for city and county governments. Requires grant applicants to meet conditions imposed by the Secretary to ensure that: (1) matching local funds will be expended; (2) such funds will be used only for eligible projects; (3) such funds will be used only for projects which, without such funds, would not be completed within 24 months; (4) at least 50 percent of such funds will be expended for employment of unemployed individuals; (5) at least 30 percent of the funds used to employ the unemployed shall be used to employ individuals between the ages of 16 and 25; (6) any project carried out with such funds will be performed by contract awarded by competitive bidding; (7) no currently employed individual will be displaced; (8) at least 50 percent of such funds will go to small business concerns owned by disadvantaged individuals; and (9) any project funded under this Act will be accessible to the handicapped. Specifies the criteria for the apportionment of funds under this Act. States that the rate of unemployment shall, for the purposes of this Act, be determined only for the civilian workforce and shall be determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Provides that population information shall be determined on the same basis that resident population for general statistical purposes is determined. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 and 1987."
