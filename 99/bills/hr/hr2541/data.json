Revises provisions for State \"on\" and \"off\" indicators for purposes of such Act. Provides that there is a State \"off\" indicator for a week if, for the most recent three calendar months for which data are available, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the State averaged: (1) nine percent or more, there is a State \"on\" indicator for a week; and (2) less than nine percent. Repeals provisions which used the insured unemployment rate to determine State \"on\" and \"off\" indicators under such Act."
