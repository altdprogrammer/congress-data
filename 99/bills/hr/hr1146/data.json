Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to set forth standards and procedures for the Secretary of Transportation to use in making inconsistency and nonpreemption determinations about State and local safety requirements in relation to Federal requirements. Directs the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements for the establishment of regional training centers to train State and local personnel to: (1) respond to hazardous materials transportation accidents; and (2) enforce State and local hazardous materials transportation requirements. States that such agreements shall be for terms of three years. Requires any party to an agreement with the Secretary to bear the cost of constructing training facilities. Directs the Secretary to provide, upon request, training materials and other assistance as may be appropriate. Requires parties to agreements with the Secretary, in developing training materials, to consider the procedures and standards for responding to hazardous substance releases as set forth in the national contingency plan required under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. Directs (currently, authorizes) the Secretary to establish: (1) criteria for handling hazardous materials; and (2) minimum levels of insurance coverage sufficient to meet injury or damage claims resulting from transportation of such materials. Directs (currently, authorizes) the Secretary to require transporters or shippers of hazardous materials to submit registration statements and to amend such statements as necessary. Requires the Secretary to study and determine the most effective, equitable, and cost-efficient method for imposing a fee on all participants in the registration program to assist States or political subdivisions in developing and conducting enforcement and emergency response programs related to transportation of hazardous materials. Requires a report to the Congress on such study within 12 months of enactment. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986."
