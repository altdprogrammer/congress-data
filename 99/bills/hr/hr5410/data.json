    "text": "International Drug Traffic Enforcement Act - Title I: Amendments to the Tariff Act of 1930 - Subtitle A: Reference to the Tariff Act of 1930 - Provides that amendments contained in this title refer to the Tariff Act of 1930. Subtitle B: General Provisions - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to prohibit the importation of drug paraphernalia (except that drug paraphernalia imported for medical or scientific purposes) into the United States. Defines \"drug paraphernalia.\" Requires the master of a vessel to report the arrival of such vessel at a U.S. port or port within the Virgin Islands to the nearest customs facility if the vessel is: (1) from a foreign port or place; (2) a foreign vessel from a domestic port; or (3) a U.S. vessel carrying bonded merchandise or foreign merchandise for which entry has not been made. Authorizes vehicles to arrive in the United States only at designated border crossing points. Requires the person in charge of such vehicle, immediately upon its arrival at the crossing point, to report the arrival and present the vehicle and all persons and merchandise on board for inspection to the customs officer at that crossing point. Requires the pilot of any aircraft arriving in the United States or the Virgin Islands from any foreign airport or place to comply with the advance notification, arrival reporting, and landing requirements as prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury (the Secretary). Prohibits a vessel or aircraft, after arriving in the United States or the Virgin Islands and prohibits a vehicle after arriving in the United States, from departing from the place of arrival or discharging any passenger or merchandise except in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Imposes penalties for violations of the arrival, reporting, and entry requirements. Increases the fine for unauthorized unloading of passengers. Requires individuals arriving in the United States other than by vessel, vehicle, or aircraft to: (1) enter only at a border crossing point; and (2) report their arrival and present themselves to the customs facility at that crossing point. Requires individuals arriving in the United States by reported conveyance to remain aboard the conveyance until authorized to depart and report to the customs facility by the appropriate customs officer. Requires individuals arriving in the United States by unreported conveyance to notify customs of their arrival and present their property for customs examination and inspection. Prohibits any person required to report to a customs facility under this paragraph from leaving that facility until authorized by a customs officer. Imposes penalties for violations of such reporting requirements. Repeals the current penalties for failure to report or file a manifest upon arrival in the United States. Authorizes the issuance of summonses to produce all relevent records in customs investigations. (Current law limits the types of records that are subject to summons.) Increases the penalties for filing a false manifest, failing to file a complete manifest, or carrying illegal drugs on board. Repeals the prepenalty procedures in such cases. Increases the penalties for unlawful unloading and transshipment. Makes it unlawful for the pilot of any aircraft to transport or for any individual on board any aircraft to possess merchandise knowing or intending that merchandise will be smuggled into the United States. Prohibits the transfer at sea of prohibited merchandise between a U.S. owned aircraft and a U.S. vessel. Prohibits a transfer at sea between aircraft and vessels, regardless of their nationality, with intent that such merchandise be smuggled into the United States. Imposes penalties, including seizure of the vessel or aircraft, for violations of such anti-smuggling provisions. Sets forth certain acts that, if engaged in within 250 miles of the U.S. territorial seas, shall be: (1) presumed to constitute circumstances indicating intent to smuggle; and (2) deemed prima facie evidence that an aircraft or vessel was used in aiding or facilitating such smuggling. Changes the procedures for seizure of conveyances used in smuggling. Requires the seizure, forfeiture and sale in accordance with the customs laws of any vessel, vehicle, or aircraft if the person in charge of such conveyance is subject to a penalty for violation of the customs laws. Exempts any conveyance used as a common carrier in the transaction of business as a common carrier from such seizure and forfeiture penalties for customs violations relating to merchandise contained on the person, in passenger baggage or cargo listed accurately on the cargo manifest unless the person in charge of the conveyance participated in, or had knowledge of, the violation or was grossly negligent in preventing or discovering the violation. Permits a common carrier conveyance to be seized and forfeited if the prohibited merchandise is found to have been: (1) in packages that are not manifested or in packages whose marks do not agree with the manifest; or (2) concealed in or on the conveyance but not in the cargo. Prohibits such seizure and forfeiture if none of the persons in charge of the conveyance nor any other employee responsible for maintaining and insuring the accuracy of the cargo manifest knew or by the exercise of the highest degree of care and diligence could have known that such merchandise was on board. Authorizes the issuance of search warrants of places suspected of containing: (1) any property which is subject to forfeiture under the customs laws; or (2) any article which is evidence of a customs violation. Authorizes the seizure and forfeiture of any smuggled merchandise. Requires that any deposits made in lieu of forfeiture of property seized under customs laws shall be treated in the same manner as the proceeds of sale of a forfeited item. Requires that the expenses of a forfeiture proceeding shall be a priority claim in the same manner as the court costs. Provides that compensation for informers shall not exceed 25 percent of the net amount recovered. (Current law requires such compensation to equal 25 percent of such amount.) Requires the compensation to be paid out of the net amount recovered before such net amount is deposited in the Treasury or the Customs Forfeiture Fund. Limits to $100,000 the amount to be awarded to any informer who discovers and reports to an appropriate official information concerning a violation or plan to violate any customs law or navigation law. Declares that an action to recover a pecuniary penalty is considered to have been commenced when the penalty notice is issued. Authorizes the Secretary to require the production of landing certificates in order to comply with international obligations. Permits the Secretary to authorize customs officials to exchange information or documents with foreign customs or law enforcement agencies under certain circumstances. Authorizes the Secretary, when authorized by treaty or executive agreement, to station customs officers in foreign countries in order to examine persons and merchandise before their arrival in the United States. Authorizes the customs officers stationed abroad to exercise such functions and perform such duties as permitted by the treaty, agreement, or law of the host country. Permits the Secretary to require compliance with U.S. customs laws in a foreign country (thereby causing the foreign station to be treated as a port of entry in the United States).
