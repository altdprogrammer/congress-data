Prohibits the application of any restriction or limitation on any farm producer until such producers are fully compensated for estimated damages caused by Government-imposed embargoes or the failure of the CCC to offer surplus U.S. farm commodities for sale in world trade at competitive prices during the last decade. Prohibits any officer or employee of the Department of Agriculture, except the Secretary of Agriculture, from serving as a member of the Board of Directors or as an officer of the Commodity Credit Corporation after July 1, 1985, if the CCC fails to offer U.S. surplus farm commodities for sale in world trade at competitive prices. Suspends all payment limitations in the Agricultural Act of 1949 and the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981, in order to restore agricultural income."
