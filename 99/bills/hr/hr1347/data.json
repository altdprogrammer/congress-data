Increases the penalty from five to ten years' imprisonment for persons who export, under license, goods or technology to a controlled country knowing such country uses the goods for military or intelligence purposes contrary to the conditions under which the license was issued. Adds to the penalties for such violations a prohibition against such violators exporting any goods or technology from the United States for five years. Prohibits importing into the United States any goods or technology from a person who, according to reliable evidence, has exported to a communist country goods or technology which under such Act are prohibited from being exported to a communist country. Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish procedures for enforcing such prohibition. Extends the authorities of the Export Administration Act of 1979 through September 30, 1991."
