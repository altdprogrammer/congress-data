Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1989 for the Coastal Zone Management Act. Requires any Federal agency to discuss with a State any concerns that the coastal State may have with a proposed Federal activity which affects the natural resources of, or land or water use in, the coastal zone of any State to determine whether such activity is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the policies of the approved State coastal zone management program. Permits States to submit recommendations to the Federal agency regarding the proposed activity, and requires the Federal agency to accept such recommendations unless a determination is made that the Federal activity is already consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of the approved State coastal zone management plan or that acceptance of the recommendations would not be in the national interest."
