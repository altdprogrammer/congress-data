    "text": "Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to direct the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), in determining whether to provide insurance, financing, or reinsurance for a project, to take into account whether or not the country in which the project would be located has laws that extend international worker rights to its workers and whether or not such laws are being enforced. Directs OPIC to undertake to refuse to insure, reinsure, guarantee, or finance any investment in any country that has not adopted laws that extend internationally recognized worker rights to its workers or does not enforce such laws. Requires the OPIC Board of Directors to hold at least one public hearing each year on proposed projects."
