    "text": "Program Fraud Civil Penalties Act of 1985 - Establishes penalties and assessments to be imposed against any person who knowingly makes a false claim or statement to: (1) an authority of the United States; (2) a recipient of property, services, or money from such authority; (3) a party to a contract with such authority; or (4) any State. Declares that such penalties and assessments are in addition to criminal and civil penalties and assessments provided by other laws. Directs the investigating official of a Federal authority to investigate allegations that a person made a false claim or statement and to report findings to the reviewing official designated for that authority. Directs the reviewing official to refer such allegations to a hearing examiner for that authority upon determining there is adequate evidence to believe that the person is liable for a penalty or assessment. Requires the authority head, prior to notifying the hearing examiner, to notify the Attorney General of any intention to initiate a hearing. Allows the authority head to initiate a hearing if the Attorney General approves it or does not disapprove it within 90 days. Prohibits the referral of allegations to a hearing examiner if the Attorney General transmits a statement disapproving referral. Authorizes the Attorney General, by written statement, to stay any hearing already in progress if such hearing adversely affects a pending or potential civil action related to a fraudulent claim. Prohibits the referral of allegations to a hearing examiner when a fraudulent claim exceeds $100,000. Specifies the authority of the investigating official and the official conducting the hearing, and the procedure for judicial review of the determination reached in the hearing. Authorizes the Attorney General to commence a civil action to recover a penalty or assessment determined by such a hearing. Authorizes the authority head to settle a final penalty or assessment determined by hearing. Grants the Attorney General exclusive authority to settle a claim subject to judicial review or collection procedures. Specifies time limitations for commencing a hearing concerning a false statement or claim and for commencing an action to recover any penalty or assessment. Requires each investigating official to report annually to the authority head on actions taken under this Act during the most recent 12-month period ending September 30. Requires the transmission of such reports to the appropriate congressional committees."
