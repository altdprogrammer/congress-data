    "text": "Agricultural Recovery Act of 1985 - Title I: Supports for Agricultural Commodities - Amends the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 to include within the functions of the National Agricultural Cost Production Standards Review Board a two-year determination of the average cost of production per acre for the 1986 through 1989 wheat and feed grain crops. Extends the Board's termination date from September 30, 1985 to September 30, 1989. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 regarding the 1986 through 1989 wheat and feed grain crops to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) make producer loans and purchases available; (2) make price deficiency payments of at least 65 percent of parity; (3) proclaim national program acreages and acreage limitation and set-aside programs for wheat by June 1 and for feed grains by October 15 of each year; and (4) reduce the minimum allocation factor from 80 percent to 50 percent. Permits haying and grazing on diverted or set-aside wheat acreage. Extends through 1990 specified provisions regarding the nonapplicability of certificate requirements and suspension of marketing quotas for wheat. Makes section 105 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 inapplicable to the 1986 through 1989 feed grain crops. Makes producers personally liable for wheat and feed grain loans in excess of $200,000. Amends the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 to extend through 1989 all wheat and feed grain: (1) payment limitations; (2) Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) sales price restrictions; and (3) supplemental set-aside authority. Requires the Secretary to provide for a production reduction program (at least ten percent less than the 1985 crop) for the 1986 through 1989 wheat and feed grain crops. Title II: Export Authorities - Amends the Food For Peace Act of 1966 to extend the Export Credit Revolving Fund through FY 1989. Amends the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 to require (presently authorizes) the Secretary to implement the special standby export subsidy program under specified conditions. Permits the use of CCC stocks in such program. Title III: Soil Conservation - Subtitle A: General Provisions - Defines specified terms, including \"erosion-prone cropland\" and highly erodible land.\" Subtitle B: Program Ineligibility for Production on Highly Erodible Land - Makes persons who cultivate crops on highly erodible land ineligible for price supports, crop insurance, and other specified agricultural loans. Provides exceptions for: (1) crops produced using approved conservation methods; and (2) certain land previously cultivated through FY 1985. Directs the Secretary to complete as soon as possible certain land capability surveys. Subtitle C: Cropland Base Protection Study - Directs the Secretary to: (1) make a study of various set-aside programs and report to the appropriate congressional committees by February 15, 1986; and (2) conduct an economic study of current soil conservation programs and report to the appropriate congressional committees within nine months. Subtitle D: Conservation Reserve Program - Directs the Secretary to enter into long-term (seven to 15 years) contracts through FY 1988 with agricultural producers to convert erosion-prone cropland into soil or water conservation uses. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide technical assistance; (2) share the cost of carrying out such conservation measures; and (3) pay an annual fee to participating producers. Sets payment limits for each of FY 1986 through 1988. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle E: Administrative Provisions - Directs the Secretary to: (1) publish implementing regulations within 180 days; and (2) establish appeal procedures. Title IV: Storage of Agricultural Commodities - Subtitle A: Storage of Grain Owned or Controlled by Community Credit Corporation - Prohibits storage of CCC grain in a non-Federal facility unless such facility is licensed under the United States Warehouse Act or approved or exempted by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to make approved facility financial information available to producers. Subtitle B: Federal Crop Insurance - Amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to include within such Act's coverage certain losses caused by insolvent approved storage facilities. Requires the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to report annually for five years to the appropriate congressional committees regarding such facilities insurance. Title V: Long-Term Agricultural Policy Commission - Establishes a National Commission on Long-Term Agricultural Policy to conduct a study of the structure, procedure, and methods of formulating and administering U.S. agriculture-related policies and programs. Requires a report to the President and to the Congress within 18 months. Terminates the Commission 60 days after submission of such report."
