Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to local jurisdictions to develop hazardous materials transportation plans. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide training centers concerned with hazardous materials transportation incidents; and (2) make grants to States and local jurisdictions to purchase equipment to be used in handling incidents involving the transportation of hazardous materials.
