Authorizes the Attorney General to deport such aliens. Prohibits the Attorney General from granting such aliens voluntary departure or withholding of deportation. Removes specified diplomatic immunities from such aliens. Makes it a felony to knowingly aid such aliens to enter the United States. Amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 to: (1) define terrorist organization for purposes of such Act; (2) direct the Attorney General to investigate the activities of any person registered under such Act as an agent of a terrorist organization; and (3) make such an agent who knowingly receives funds from such an organization criminally liable."
