    "text": "International Air Transportation Protection Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to revoke an air carrier's international air transportation certificate if the Secretary establishes that a hostile takeover of such air carrier has occurred, and that a sale or transfer of such certificate has occurred (or been attempted) as part of the liquidation of such air carrier (other than in the ordinary course of business). States that the Secretary is not precluded from issuing any certificate for international air transportation if the Secretary finds the applicant is willing and able to provide such transportation and it is consistent with public convenience and necessity. Directs the Department of Transportation to determine whether each major United States international airline is fit, willing, and able to continue the transportation authorized by its certificate of public convenience and necessity. Requires the Department to render a final decision in such proceedings within 90 days after enactment of this Act."
