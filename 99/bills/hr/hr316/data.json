Prescribes the contents of such reports. Amends the Natural Gas Act to authorize the Commission to hold hearings whenever a natural gas company files for a rate change pursuant to any purchased gas adjustment clause under any schedule. Requires the Commission to order such a hearing upon a complaint if a natural gas company files for an increase in any rate or charge. Requires (currently authorizes) the Commission to suspend and defer operation of increased schedule or rate changes pending a hearing and decision, until final appealable agency action has been taken. Authorizes the Commission to permit increased rates to take effect if: (1) final agency action has not taken place within five months after such suspension has begun; and (2) the affected gas company demonstrates that continued suspension would result in severe financial hardship. Authorizes the Commission to extend by a specified maximum period the time required for a hearing and a final decision."
