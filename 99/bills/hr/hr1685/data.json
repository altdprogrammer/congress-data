    "text": "Establishes a permanent boundary for Acadia National Park, Maine. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire specified lands by purchase, exchange, donation, or condemnation. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey unexchanged lands under such Secretary's jurisdiction but not within the prescribed boundary to the towns in which they are located after five years. Directs the Secretary to convey specified lands to Bar Harbor, Maine, for use as a solid waste transfer station with the Secretary contributing part of the construction costs. Authorizes the Secretary to use eminent domain to acquire specified tracts. Permits limited development on such lands which is not incompatible with the purposes of the Park, including residential use. Permits the owner of an improved property acquired by the Secretary to retain a right of occupancy for life or 25 years so long as such owner complies with the purposes of the Park. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire conservation easements in specified lands on the islands of Hancock and Knox Counties which would limit development to preserve such lands' natural qualities and traditional resource-based land use. Requires the Secretary to notify the town where the land is located and the Acadia National Park Advisory Commission before acquiring such an easement. Limits the Secretary's authority to acquire such lands in fee to specified lands. Excludes specified lands from the boundaries of the Park unless the owner is willing to donate or sell, but permits the Secretary to condemn a conservation easement by eminent domain on such lands after notice and an opportunity for comment. Establishes the Acadia National Park Advisory Commission to advise the Secretary respecting the acquisition of lands and land interests when developing the Acadia National Park. Directs the Secretary to make a grant to each of specified towns reflecting the ratio of land owned in fee within such town by the United States to the total amount of land owned by the United States within all such towns. Requires such grant money to be used for specified municipal purposes. Requires the transfer of Federal property on Bear Island to the Secretary for the Acadia National Park. Directs the Secretary to prepare a report establishing transportation capacities for the Park. Authorizes appropriations for the purposes of this Act."
