    "text": "Defense Procurement Reform Act of 1985 - Terminates the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). Transfers the functions of the DCAA to the General Accounting Office (GAO). Provides that the personnel regulations of GAO shall be used to determine the eligibility for employment with GAO of those personnel currently employed by DCAA. Makes the effective date of such agency termination and functions transfers January 1, 1987. Amends Federal law relating to defense contracts to require, in the case of a major defense acquisition program, the head of an agency to include in a solicitation for bids or proposals for a contract for production of a system a description of: (1) the operational need to be fulfilled; (2) specified functions to be performed; and (3) performance standards and contract requirements applicable to such production system. Prohibits contract requirements from being changed after any potential contractor has received notice of the solicitation. Authorizes the head of an agency to establish additional contract requirements if certain notice requirements are met. Makes such provision applicable to all solicitations issued after the 90-day period following enactment of this Act. Amends Federal educational requirements for certain Department of Defense acquisition personnel to require such personnel to have completed a 20-week course at the Defense Systems Management College or other comparable institution in order to work in major defense acquisition programs. Directs the Secretary of Defense, no later than May 1, 1986, to report to the Congress on opportunities for advancement for program managers and other acquisition personnel within the Department of Defense."
