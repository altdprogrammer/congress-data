    "text": "Defense Production Act Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to prohibit any Government acquisitions officer who is authorized to administer procurement contracts for an executive agency from accepting compensation from any contractor who received funds under contracts administered by such officer for two years following such officer's last day of Federal employment. Makes it a felony for a contractor to offer such compensation. Authorizes the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to issue regulations as necessary to implement this Act. Permits an officer who is offered compensation and the contractor offering such compensation to apply to OPM for an advisory opinion concerning the legality of such compensation under this Act. Directs OPM to: (1) publish notice of such application; (2) issue an interim opinion within ten days and a final opinion within 30 days; (3) provide an opportunity for interested parties to present information or comments concerning issuance of such opinion; and (4) publish and give the Congress specified information justifying the Office's opinion. Specifies conditions under which OPM may determine that such compensation does not violate the intent of this Act. States that reliance on such advisory opinion shall be a defense to a civil or criminal case brought under this Act. Requires all meetings of OPM to consider applications for an advisory opinion to be open to the public. Requires the Office to report annually to the Congress concerning its activities and its recommendations for promoting high ethical standards for Government employees. Authorizes appropriations."
