    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "National Acid Deposition Control Act of 1985 - Title I: Acid Deposition Control and Assistance Program - Amends the Clean Air Act to mandate emission reductions and retrofit technology for the 50 fossil fuel fired electric utility generating plants which the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency identifies and lists as having had the largest total emissions of sulfur dioxide during the calendar year 1980. Permits the owner or operator of such a plant to substitute a fossil fuel fired steam generating unit in the same State or plant for an identified electric utility, subject to the Administrator's approval. Requires substitute units to meet certain performance standards beyond their useful lives. Requires emission limitations compliance schedules to require the use of technological systems of continuous emission reduction for each steam generating unit in the generating plant (other than steam units serving as substitutes) and the reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions to 90 percent or 70 percent of 1980 emissions levels. Determines compliance on a plantwide basis and on the basis of average annual emissions. Subjects substitute unit compliance schedules to the same requirements but evaluates compliance for the unit rather than plantwide. Directs owners or operators of listed plants and substitute units to submit a compliance schedule to the Administrator for approval. Directs the Administrator to promulgate a schedule for listed plants without an approved schedule. Requires schedules to mandate contracts for technological systems by the start of 1993, system installation by 1995, and compliance with emission standards for 1995 and subsequent years. Directs the Administrator to make available 90 percent of a system's construction and installation costs from the Acid Deposition Control Fund, Conditions payments upon minimizing rate increases to the customers of the utility. Directs the Administrator to compute each State's share of the 12 million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions required within ten years of enactment of this Act. Counts a State's excess tonnage from fossil fuel fired electric utility plants and steam generating units and industrial process emitters of sulfur dioxide. Sets forth the formula for determining a State's share of total reductions using such excess tonnage. Permits States to reallocate reductions among themselves so long as total reductions meet specified requirements. Directs each State to submit a plan for Administrator approval, detailing how such State is going to reduce its share of emissions to compliance levels in ten years. Subjects States without an approved plant to back-up emission limitations which represent between a 75 and 80 percent reduction for 1980 emission levels or the national average best available control technology emissions limit for industrial process emissions. Permits States discretion in means of compliance. Sets forth fund availability conditions, including an approved State plan and funding based upon a State's share of the total required emission reductions. Allows States to use such funds to effect the requirements of this Act in whatever way the State deems appropriate. Establishes in the Treasury the Acid Deposition Control Fund to provide funding for emissions reductions from specified appropriations. Sets forth conditions and administrative provisions for such Fund. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to the Congress on the current and five-year projected financial condition of the Fund. Imposes a fee on each kilowatt hour of electric energy generated by an electric utility in the contiguous States. Exempts electricity generated by nuclear or hydroelectric power. Directs the Administrator to make payments to utilities who provide electricity to low-income individuals in order to reduce rates for such customers. Establishes civil and criminal penalties and empowers the Administrator to bring civil actions against an electric utility in violation of the fee requirement. Terminates the fee after ten years. Directs the Administrator to carry out a demonstration project of the limestone injected multistaged burner (LIMB) technology, using limited funds. Directs the Administrator to make grants and contracts to accelerate research for developing other advanced industrial processes to reduce levels of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1991. Title II: Control of Nitrogen Oxide Emissions - Directs the Administrator to revise nitrogen oxides emissions standards for electric utility steam generating units which burn bituminous or subbituminous coal. Sets maximum subbituminous emissions at 0.30 pounds per million Btu's and maximum bituminous coal emissions at 0.40 pounds per million Btu's, based on a 30-day rolling average. Requires the Administrator to promulgate emissions standards for new, large fossil-fuel-fired steam generating units. Establishes oxides of nitrogen emissions standards for light duty trucks after model year 1987. Title III: Acid Deposition Damage Mitigation Program - Establishes a grants program for States with Administrator-approved plans for mitigating water quality damage caused by a acid deposition. Limits such grants to 80 percent of State-expended funds for mitigation. Apportions funds among the States upon the basis of need."
