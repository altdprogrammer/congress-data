    "text": "Federal Tort Claims Reform Act of 1986 - Amends the Federal Tort Claims Act to provide that the United States shall not be held jointly and severally liable for an injury (unless the United States and another person were acting in concert). Limits U.S. liability to its pro rata share of fault or responsibility for the injury. Requires that damage awards be offset by amounts received as compensation for the same injury. Limits the amount of damages for noneconomic losses to $100,000. Allows damage awards for future economic damages exceeding $100,000 to be made by periodic payments. Establishes a contingency fee schedule for plaintiffs' attorneys. Makes the provisions of such Act applicable to claims brought against the United States under certain admiralty statutes."
