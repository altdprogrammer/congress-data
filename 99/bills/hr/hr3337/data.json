    "text": "Contract Disputes Act and Federal Courts Improvement Act Amendments of 1985 - Title I: Courts Improvement Act Amendments - Grants the U.S. Claims Court exclusive jurisdiction over claims relating to a Government contract, whether suit is brought before or after the contract is awarded. (Currently, the Court has jurisdiction over such suits brought before the contract is awarded.) Declares that the district courts shall not have jurisdiction to hear such claims. Title II: Contract Disputes Act Amendments - Requires that contractor claims against the Government be submitted to the contracting officer within 18 months of the date on which they accrue. Declares that the statute of limitations for a contractor's right of appeal to a board of contract appeals and the judicial review of board decisions shall begin to run from the date an appeal or suit is first authorized to commence. Authorizes the Government to seek relief in Federal district courts to enforce summarily a contracting officer's decision regarding the award of money or the requirement for performance. Authorizes the Attorney General to apply for provisional relief to any district court having jurisdiction when there is a likelihood that the contract will hinder, delay, or frustrate the contracting officer's decision. Changes from 12 months to 90 days the time for a contractor to appeal to the U.S. Claims Court after receipt of a contracting officer's decision."
