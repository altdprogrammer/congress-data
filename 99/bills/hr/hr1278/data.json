    "text": "Federal Supplemental Compensation Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Federal Supplemental Compensation Act of 1982 to extend the Federal supplemental unemployment compensation program for 18 months, until September 30, 1986. Revises formulas for State triggers for determination of the number of weeks for which Federal supplemental compensation is payable. Provides that, in the case of any benefit period, the applicable trigger is on for any week if: (1) the triggering long-term rate of insured unemployment (LIUR) for such State falls within a specified applicable range (14 weeks benefits if a 5.5 percent or more LIUR; 12 weeks if 4.5 percent or more; ten weeks if 3.5 percent or more; eight weeks if less than 3.5 percent); (2) in the case of a State for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles data on a month-to-month basis with respect to the seasonally adjusted total civilian rate of unemployment (TUR), the triggering TUR for such State falls within a specified applicable range (14 weeks benefits if a ten percent or more TUR; 12 weeks if nine percent or more; ten weeks if eight percent or more; eight weeks if less than eight percent); or (3) in the case of any other State, the triggering rate of insured unemployment (IUR) for such State falls within a specified applicable range (14 weeks benefits if a six percent or more IUR; 12 weeks if five percent or more; ten weeks if four percent or more; eight weeks if less than four percent). Sets forth formulas for the periods to be used in determining the triggering LIUR, TUR, and IUR. (Bases the triggering LIUR on specified periods beginning on or after January 1, 1983.) Requires modification of agreements with States to reflect the amendments made by this Act."
