Kennedy Memorial Stadium; and (2) provide a 50-year lease without consideration to the District of Columbia for the ground under and parking facilities associated with such stadium. Requires the terms and conditions of such conveyance and lease to insure that the property will be used only: (1) for stadium purposes; (2) for providing recreational facilities, open space, or public outdoor recreation opportunities; and (3) for such other public purposes for which the property was used prior to June 1, 1985. Provides that all right, title, and interest in the stadium shall revert to the United States and the lease shall terminate if such conditions have not been complied with and if such noncompliance has not been corrected within 90 days after written notice has been received by the Mayor of the District of Columbia. Prohibits the brining of an action for use violation before 90 days after notice to the Mayor of the alleged violation and the intent to bring such action. Requires the District of Columbia to bear the cost of removing structures or rehabilitating the land or stadium should the stadium revert to the United States. Includes certain parking sections as part of the schematic design of the Map to Designate Transfer of Stadium and Lease of Parking Lots to the District."
