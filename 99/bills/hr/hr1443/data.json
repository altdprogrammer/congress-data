Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth requirements which a State's plan must meet in order to receive such payments. Provides that between the period of October 1, 1985, and October 1, 1988, the Federal payment will be 75 percent. Provides that if a State can demonstrate that any money recouped as a result of the plan will be used in other federally-assisted public assistance programs, then the Federal payment will be 100 percent. Defines the term \"Federally-assisted public assistance program\" to mean the food stamp program and the following programs under the Social Security Act: (1) Aid to Families with Dependent Children (part A of title IV of such Act); (2) Medicaid (title XIX of such Act); and (3) Supplemental Security Income (title XVI of such Act)."
