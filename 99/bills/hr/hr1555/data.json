Requires the President to report to the Congress by April 1 of each year an estimate of the international volume of arms traffic and an estimate of the sale and delivery of weapons and weapons-related defense equipment by all major arms suppliers to all major recipient countries during the preceding fiscal year. Changes the provision dealing with defense requirement surveys to cover all security assistance surveys which includes defense requirement surveys, site surveys, general surveys or studies, and engineering assessment surveys. Requires such surveys to be submitted to the House Foreign Affairs Committee or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, upon request. Requires the President's quarterly report to the Congress on military exports to include an estimate of the number of U.S. military and civilian personnel and the number of civilian contract personnel who were in each foreign country at the end of the quarter and the number of such personnel who were in such country at any time during the quarter in implementation of military sales and commercial military exports. Increases the criminal penalties for certain violations of the Arms Export Control Act. Imposes maximum civil fines for such violations. Includes charges for official reception and representation expenses in the administrative surcharge charged in connection with foreign military sales. Limits the amount of funds from such source that may be used for official reception and representation expenses. Authorizes using the Special Defense Acquisition Fund to keep certain defense articles and services on continuous order in anticipation of their transfer to foreign countries and international organizations. Requires such Fund to consist of collections from sales made under letters of offer or transfers of defense articles and services, together with such funds as are made available to the Fund. Requires such collections to be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts whenever the value of the defense articles and services which have not been transferred from the Fund plus the amount of contracts to acquire such articles and services exceeds a specified amount.

Limits to $50,000,000 of the $250,000,000 made available under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or the Arms Export Control Act that may be allocated to any one country in any fiscal year unless that country is a victim of communist aggression. Limits the total under (1) and (2) above that may be allocated to any one country in any fiscal year to $500,000,000. Prohibits obligating any of the funds appropriated under the Arms Export Control Act for any programs not justified, or in excess of the amount justified, to the Congress for obligation for any fiscal year unless specified committees of the Congress are notified 15 days before such obligation. Provides that such notification requirement does not apply to the reprogramming of less than $25,000 for use under the international narcotics control program or for use under the international military education and training program for a country for which a program under such program for that fiscal year was justified to the Congress. Requires the President to notify the Congress, within 30 days of enactment of any law appropriating funds to carry out the Arms Export Control Act, of each country and organization to which the United States intends to provide any portion of such funds. Deletes the provision which imposes specified reporting requirements on granting military or economic assistance which exceeds by ten percent or more the amount set forth in the President's annual report on allocation of foreign assistance funds.

Prohibits using funds earmarked for Lebanon unless all U.S. hostages in Lebanon have been released except for humanitarian aid. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States should finance and, where appropriate, participate in cooperative scientific and technological projects involving Israel, Egypt, and other Middle East countries.

Title III: Development Assistance - Adds these principles to the principles guiding U.S. development assistance policy: (1) U.S. encouragement of policy reforms is necessary if developing countries are to achieve economic growth with equity; (2) development assistance should promote private sector activity in open and competitive markets in developing countries; (3) U.S. cooperation in development should recognize as essential the need of developing countries to have access to appropriate technology in order to improve food, water, health, housing, education, agriculture, and industry; and (4) U.S. assistance should focus on establishing and upgrading the institutional capacities of developing countries in order to promote long term development. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 and 1987 for: (1) agriculture, rural development, and nutrition programs, including funds for aiding private and voluntary organizations engaged in world hunger issues; (2) population and health programs, including a specified percentage earmarked for the Office of Population in the Agency for International Development; (3) the Child Survival Fund; (4) education and human resources development; (5) energy, private voluntary organizations, and selected development activities, including specified amounts for financing cooperative projects among the United States, Israel, and developing countries; and (6) the private sector revolving fund.

Authorizes the President to deny funds for population planning purposes to a foreign government or international or nongovernmental organization if such denial would promote voluntary family planning. Prohibits making any of the population planning funds available for population planning programs in the People's Republic of China or in any other country where there are valid and consistent reports of coerced abortion or coerced sterilization.

Directs the President to instruct the U.S. representative to any international organization which receives population planning funds to oppose the extension of population planning assistance by that organization to the People's Republic of China if the President determines that such reports are valid. Requires the President, if the President determines that reports of infanticide, coercive abortion, and sterilization in the Peoples Republic of China are valid and that the United Nations Fund for the Population Activities is funding population programs there, to decide on the amount of funds authorized under this Act that shall be contributed to the Fund. Requires the President to report to the Congress in such decision. Extends to 90 days the length of time the President can use to determine whether to prohibit U.S. assistance for projects of private and voluntary organizations in a foreign country after other U.S. aid to such country has been cut off. (Current law gives the President 30 days to make such determination.) Extends through FY 1987 the requirement that 12 percent of U.S. bilateral development and disaster assistance funds be available for private and voluntary organizations. Requires that development assistance shall be provided to rural and urban cooperatives which offer large numbers of low-and middle-income people in developing countries an opportunity to participate directly in democratic decisionmaking. Directs the President to use certain poverty measurement standards in determining target populations for U.S. development assistance and to strengthen U.S. efforts to assure that a substantial percentage of development assistance directly improves the lives of the poor majority, with special emphasis on those living in absolute poverty. Requires that development activities that attempt to increase the institutional capabilities of private organizations or governments or that attempt to stimulate scientific and technological research shall be designed and monitored to ensure that the ultimate beneficiaries of these activities are the poor majority. Requires that information on the targeting of development assistance to benefit the poor majority shall be included in the annual report to the Congress on foreign aid. Increases and extends through FY 1988 the authority for the Housing Investment Guaranty program. Requires the total principle amount of guarantees for each of FY 1986 and 1987 to be comparable to the total principle amount of such guarantees issued for FY 1984.

Requires that at least ten percent of the total of the FY 1986 and 1987 development assistance funds shall be available for activities of economically and socially disadvantaged enterprises, historically black colleges and universities, and private and voluntary organizations which are controlled by individuals who are economically and socially disadvantaged, including women. Directs the Administrator of AID to study and report to the Congress by September 30, 1986, on additional ways to provide development assistance through non-governmental organizations. Title IV: Other Foreign Assistance Programs and International Airport Security - Subtitle I: Other Foreign Assistance Programs - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 and 1987 for: (1) American schools and hospitals abroad; (2) U.S. voluntary contributions to international organizations and programs; (3) international disaster assistance; (4) anti-terrorism assistance; (5) the trade and development program; and (6) operating expenses of the agency primarily responsible for administering the development assistance programs. Prohibits making international organization funds available for the U.S. share of programs for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) or for projects whose primary purpose is to provide benefits to the PLO or associated entities. Prohibits making international organization funds available for the U.S. share for programs for the South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) unless the President certifies to the Congress that such funds would not be used to support the military or paramilitary operations of SWAPO. Prohibits using funds authorized for international organizations and programs for the U.S. proportionate share for programs for specified communist countries. Permits the President to waive such prohibition if it is in the national interest. Directs the Secretary of State to: (1) review annually the budgets of all international organizations receiving U.S. funds; and (2) report to the Congress the amounts spent by each such organization for the PLO, for SWAPO, and for communist countries and the amount contributed by the United States to each such organization. Authorizes making items on the U.S. Munitions List available during FY 1986 and 1987 for antiterrorism assistance if: (1) the items fit into specified categories; (2) the recipient country is not prohibited from receiving assistance under the military assistance program, the international military education and training program of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, or the Arms Export Control Act; and (3) the President notifies the Congress at least 15 days before the articles are made available to such country. Limits the total value of all such items that may be provided to foreign countries during FY 1986 and 1987. Repeals the sunset provision for the antiterrorism assistance program. Directs the Secretary of State to: (1) be responsible for coordinating all antiterrorism assistance provided to foreign countries; and (2) report to the Congress annually on such assistance. Prohibits the United States from providing specified forms of assistance to any country which the President determines grants sanctuary to terrorists or otherwise supports international terrorism. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition if justified by national security or humanitarian reasons. Requires the President to notify the Congress 15 days before such waiver. Declares that the President should call on other countries to impose similar sanctions if the United States imposes such prohibition on a country. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should: (1) call for an international civil aviation boycott with respect to those countries that grant sanctuary to terrorists or otherwise support international terrorism; and (2) take steps to achieve a total international civil aviation boycott of such countries. Directs the President to prohibit imports from and exports to Libya. Subtitle 2: International Airport Security - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to assess the efficacy of security measures at foreign airports which serve either United States carriers, or from which foreign air carriers serve the United States. Requires the Secretary to: (1) use security criteria equal to or above certain internationally established standards; (2) consult with the Secretary of State on the terrorist threat that exists in each country; (3) report to the Congress regarding such assessments; and (4) notify the appropriate authorities if a foreign airport does not administer effective security measures. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to publish in the Federal Register and publicize at all U.S. airports the identity of airports found to have ineffective security. Requires each air carrier providing service between the United States and such an airport to notify all passengers that such airport has been found to have ineffective security. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation, with the approval of the Secretary of State, to withhold, revoke, or impose conditions on the operating authority of any air carrier to engage in foreign air transportation using such airport. Authorizes the President to prohibit air carriers from providing service between the United States and any other foreign airport served by aircraft flying to or from such airport. Provides that the requirements and authorizations of this paragraph shall become effective 120 days after the Secretary of Transportation notifies the appropriate authorities of conditions at such an airport. Permits such requirements and authorizations to become immediately effective under specified conditions. Directs the Secretary of Transportation (with the approval of the Secretary of State) to suspend (without notice or a hearing) the right of an air carrier to engage in foreign air transportation to or from an airport which the Secretary has determined presents a safety threat to either passengers, aircraft, or the public interest. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President is urged to take all appropriate steps to close the international airport in Beirut, Lebanon, at least until Lebanon has instituted antihijacking measures. Directs the Secretary of State to issue a travel advisory on any airport that has been found to have ineffective security. Directs the President to suspend all aid under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or the Arms Export Control Act to any country where such an airport is located. Authorizes the President to waive such suspension for national security or humanitarian reasons. Provides for lifting sanctions against such country only if the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of State, determines that effective security measures are maintained at such airport. Requires the Congress to be notified if such sanctions are lifted. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to study and report to the Congress on the need for an expanded airmarshal program on international flights of U.S. air carriers. Permits the Secretary of Transportation to authorize air transportation security personnel to carry firearms and to make warrantless arrests if they have reasonable grounds to believe a felony is being committed. Directs the Secretary of State to study and report to the Congress on the feasibility of establishing an international sky marshal program. Requires the Secretary to call for an immediate meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization to: (1) discuss international airport compliance with existing international security standards; (2) upgrade security standards for international airports; and (3) call on the member countries of the International Civil Aviation Organization to enforce such Organization's existing standards and impose a moratorium on the use of any international airport which does not comply with such standards. Directs the Secretary of State to seek agreement on strengthening enforcement measures and standards for compliance on aircraft sabotage, aircraft hijacking, and airport security.
