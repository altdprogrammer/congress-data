Declares that the Secretary is still obliged to use all other available means, including assigning retired annuitants and obtaining detailees from other agencies, to reduce the number of claims pending and awaiting review by administrative law judges under such Act. Requires the chief administrative law judge of the Department of Labor and the chairman of the Benefits Review Board to each submit a report to the Secretary at the end of each calendar quarter stating number of cases pending and awaiting review by administrative law judges and such Board, respectively, under such Act at the conclusion of such quarter. Directs the Secretary to transmit these reports to the Congress, with recommendations for reducing such backlog."
