Requires the court, in an action based on a contract, combination, or conspiracy among competitors, to conclusively presume that a person has been released from liability if: (1) such person has not been joined as a defendant; and (2) the defendant has established that such person is legally or practically available as a party to the action. Requires damages based on a price-fixing agreement between competitors to be allocated on the basis of: (1) each competitor's proportionate share of the total competitors' overcharges or underpayments where the claim is based on damages sustained by reason of overcharges or payments resulting from a price-fixing agreement; or (2) each party's relative responsibility for the origination or perpetration of the antitrust violation, whichever method the court determines to be more equitable."
