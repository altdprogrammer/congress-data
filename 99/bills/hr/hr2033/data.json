    "text": "Landfill Gas Collection and Reclamation Act of 1985 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish specific guidelines for landfill gas control which: (1) protect human health and the environment; (2) require facilities required to retrofit to also include gas collection devices in their pollution collection systems; (3) provide for the recovery of energy and materials from methane and other gas emitted from such facilities which are combustible; and (4) provide exemption standards where such guidelines would be inefficient and impractical. Requires State solid waste management plans to comply with the landfill gas control guidelines. Requires the Administrator to review State plans approved before these guidelines become effective, withdrawing approval if such plans do not conform with these requirements. Requires sanitary landfills receiving putrescible waste to comply with such guidelines to retain such status. Grants the Administrator enforcement authority against noncomplying States."
