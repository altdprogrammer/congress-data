Requires CMPs and HMOs to: (1) notify an individual who enrolls or disenrolls of the effective date of such enrollment or disenrollment; and (2) in the case of an individual's enrollment, supply the individual with a guide explaining the rules and procedures of the organization. Provides that in the case of an individual: (1) who enrolls with an HMO or CMP and who is an inpatient of a hospital on the date the enrollment would otherwise become effective, the enrollment shall not become effective until the day after discharge; and (2) who disenrolls and who is an inpatient on the date the disenrollment would otherwise become effective, the disenrollment shall not become effective until the day after discharge. Directs the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, with respect CMPs and HMOs, to conduct a certain study and report to the Congress."
