    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-04-25", 
    "text": "Electric Utility Transmission Reform Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal Power Act to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to direct by order an electric utility to provide transmission services for an applicant electric utility or to increase the transmission capacity of any bulk power transmission facility which it owns or operates whenever the Commission, upon its own motion or upon application by a State commission or any electric utility, determines after public notice, notice to the State commission and electric utilities affected, and a hearing that such action is needed to conserve energy, promote the efficient use of facilities and resources, increase competition in the bulk power supply market, or protect the public interest. Provides that the Commission shall have no authority under this Act to: (1) compel the enlargement of generating facilities; (2) take any action which would significantly reduce the utility's ability to provide adequate service to its customers; or (3) order the transmission of electric energy to an ultimate customer. Provides that an electric utility which has been ordered by the Commission to increase its transmission capacity shall be reimbursed by the recipient utility services for all capital and operating costs related to such increase. Repeals the Commission's authority to prescribe in a final order requiring interconnection or wheeling any terms and conditions regarding transmission services if the parties cannot agree to such services within the time set by the Commission."
