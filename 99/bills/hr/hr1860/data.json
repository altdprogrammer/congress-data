Title II: Policy and Presidential Mandate - Declares that achievement of an orderly movement toward lower exchange rates for the dollar is a primary objective of U.S. economic policy. Directs the President to pursue: (1) negotiations with U.S. trading partners regarding the high value of the dollar on exchange markets; and (2) steps to secure necessary commitments for actions from such countries to help moderate the dollar in international exchange markets. Directs the Federal Reserve Board to consider actions in coordination with the central banks of U.S. trading partners to lower dollar exchange rates. Title III: Commission on International Development - Establishes the Commission on International Development which shall make recommendations to the President and the Congress concerning: (1) changes in U.S. fiscal and monetary policies which will encourage international economic growth and stimulate the volume of international trade; (2) actions which should be taken to stimulate growth of developing economies and to counteract the adverse effects which the high level of international debt is having on developing economies and the U.S. trade imbalance; (3) the restructuring of the international monetary system and the system of international trade finance; (4) new institutional mechanisms to stretch out developing country debt to longer term maturities; and (5) expanded roles for private banks and existing multilateral development institutions.
