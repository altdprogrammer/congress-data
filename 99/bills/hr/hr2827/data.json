Authorizes appropriations to be derived from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund if the two Secretaries find that such an expanded airmarshal program is necessary. Authorizes the Secretary (with the approval of the Attorney General and the Secretary of State) to permit air transportation security personnel to carry firearms and to make warrantless arrests if such personnel have reasonable grounds to believe a felony is being committed. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend any foreign air travel between the United States and a foreign airport if the Secretary determines that safe passage and the public interest requires an immediate suspension of services between the United States and such airport."
