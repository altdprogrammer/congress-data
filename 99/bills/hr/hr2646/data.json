    "date": "1985-06-03", 
    "text": "Revises Federal law concerning recovery by the United States of the cost of certain care and services provided to veterans to give the United States the right to recover the reasonable costs of such care and services from the State, or political subdivision of a State, employer, employer's insurance carrier, automobile accident reparations insurance carrier, or insurance, medical services, or health plan carrier, or contractor, as appropriate, to the extent that the veteran, or the provider of care and services to the veteran, would be eligible to receive reimbursement or indemnification for such care and services if the care and services had not been furnished by a department or agency of the United States. Provides that the United States shall be subrogated to any right or claim that the veteran or the veteran's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors may have against a State, employer, or insurance or health plan carrier. Allows the United States to intervene in court proceedings to enforce such rights. Allows the United States to bring its own action to enforce their subrogation rights if no such action is commenced within a certain period and written notice of their intention to bring such an action has been sent to the veteran. Authorizes the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to enter into contracts or agreements with individuals or organizations for services to recover amounts due the United States under this Act. Outlines provisions to be included in such contracts. Prohibits the law of any State or political subdivision thereof, or any insurance or health plan contract, from operating to prevent recovery or collection by the United States under this Act or any other applicable Federal law. Requires clinical records of a veteran to be made available for purposes of aiding recovery or collection by the United States under this Act."
