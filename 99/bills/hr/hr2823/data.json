    "text": "University Research Facilities Revitalization Act of 1985 - Requires each of the major Federal research and development agencies to establish and carry out a new university research laboratory modernization program, under which an amount equal to a specified portion of the funds available to the agency involved for research and development awards to institutions of higher education will be reserved for the replacement or modernization of such institutions' obsolete laboratories and other research facilities. Requires that funds under such program be awarded in response to specific proposals submitted by universities and colleges, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the head of the agency involved. Requires that such regulations provide that funds to carry out the program be awarded on a competitive basis and in an amount not exceeding 50 percent of the cost of the replacement or modernization involved. Sets forth required criteria for the award of such funds. Defines the \"major Federal research and development agencies\" as: (1) the National Science Foundation; (2) the Department of Health and Human Services; (3) the Department of Defense; (4) the Department of Energy; (5) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and (6) the Department of Agriculture. Title I: Identification and Assessment of University and College Research Facility Needs; Funding for the University Research Laboratory Modernization Program in the National Science Foundation- Authorizes the National Science Foundation (NSF) to design, establish, and maintain a data collection and analysis capability to identify and assess the research facilities needs of universities and colleges. Directs NSF, in conjunction with other appropriate Federal agencies, to: (1) conduct biennial surveys for such identification and assessment purposes; and (2) report the results to the Congress, with the first such report to be due on September 1, 1986. Directs the NSF, when conducting such surveys and reporting to the Congress, to also collect and assess data on the implementation of the university research laboratory modernization programs being carried out under this Act. Sets forth provisions for the funding for the university research laboratory modernization program in NSF. (Note: The following provisions are similar to those for such program funding in the other \"major Federal research and development agencies\" which are set forth in titles II, III, IV, V, and VI of this Act.) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 to NSF to implement and carry out the new university research laboratory modernization program. Requires that a specified minimum amount (equal to a portion, as determined by certain formulas, of the total amount which is appropriated to NSF for FY 1988 through 1996 and which is available for obligation by NSF for research and development awards to universities and colleges) be reserved for purposes of this Act and used only to carry out NSF's university research modernization program. Permits such funds to be used for such program either as a part of awards made to universities and colleges involved for activities carried out under the authority of other laws or through separate awards made for purposes of this Act. Requires that such funds be used only on the basis of proposals submitted by such universities and colleges. Requires that a specified minimum portion of such funds be available only for awards to universities and colleges that received less than $10,000,000 in total Federal obligations for research and development in each of the two preceding years. Title II: Funding for the University Research Laboratory Modernization Program in the Department of Health and Human Services- Sets forth provisions for the funding for the university research laboratory modernization program in the Department of Health and Human Services. (Note: These provisions are similar to the program funding provisions under title I.) Title III: Funding for the University Research Laboratory Modernization Program in the Department of Defense - Sets forth provisions for the funding for the university research laboratory modernization program in the Department of Defense. (Note: These provisions are similar to the program funding provisions under title I.) Title IV: Funding for the University Research Laboratory Modernization Program in the Department of Energy - Sets forth provisions for the funding for the university research laboratory modernization program in the Department of Energy. (Note: These provisions are similar to the program funding provisions under title I.) Title V: Funding for the University Research Laboratory Modernization Program in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration - Sets forth provisions for the funding for the university research laboratory modernization program in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. (Note: these provisions are similar to the program funding provisions under title I.) Title VI; Funding for the University Research Laboratory Modernization Program in the Department of Agriculture - Sets forth provisions for the funding for the university research laboratory modernization program in the Department of Agriculture. (Note: these provisions are similar to the program funding provision under title I.)"
