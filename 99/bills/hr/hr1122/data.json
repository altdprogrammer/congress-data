Increases and extends the authorization of appropriations for such Act. Increases to GS-11 the level to which veterans may be appointed for veterans readjustment appointments and career-conditional appointments (currently to GS-9). Eliminates the disability requirement as a condition to such appointments for Vietnam-era veterans."
