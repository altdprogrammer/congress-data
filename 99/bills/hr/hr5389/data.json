    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1986-09-30", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Alaska Military Lands Withdrawal Act - Withdraws for military purposes certain public lands in Alaska in the areas designated as the Fort Wainwright Maneuver Area, the Fort Greeley Maneuver Area, and the Fort Greeley Air Drop Zone. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) publish in the Federal Register a notice of the legal description of each area withdrawn; and (2) file a map and the legal description of each area withdrawn with the Congress. Makes such maps and legal descriptions available for public inspection at specified sites. Requires the Secretary of Defense to reimburse the Secretary of the Interior for the expense of such activities. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, during the period of withdrawal, to manage the lands withdrawn. Includes among uses for which such lands may be managed: grazing, wildlife habitat, control of predatory animals, and the prevention and suppression of brush and range fires resulting from nonmilitary activities. Requires nonmilitary use of the land to be subject to such conditions as may be necessary to permit military use of such lands as authorized by this Act. Permits the Secretary of the Interior to issue easements, rights-of-way, or other authorizations with regard to the use of such lands only with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Army. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to close such withdrawn lands to the public to the degree required by military operations, public safety, or national security. Directs the Secretary of the Interior (after consultation with the Secretary of the Army, Federal agencies, and the State of Alaska) to develop a management plan for each area withdrawn within one year after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of the Army, and the State of Alaska to develop a fish and wildlife management and conservation agreement for the withdrawn lands within one year after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Army to allow public access to and use of the lands withdrawn for purposes of recreation, hunting, fishing, and trapping to the fullest extent compatible with essential military requirements. Directs the Secretary of the Army to prevent and suppress fires occurring within and outside of the lands withdrawn as a result of the military use of such lands. Authorizes such Secretary to request assistance for such purpose from the Bureau of Land Management on a reimbursable basis. Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Army to enter into a memorandum of understanding to implement the management plan for the withdrawn lands. Requires the Secretary of Defense to notify the Secretary of the Interior in the event lands withdrawn by this Act will be used for defense-related purposes not specified in this Act. Reserves specified amounts of water located on, under, over, or appurtenant to the withdrawn lands for future military use by the Secretary of the Army. Sets forth provisions for acquisition of additional water rights by the Secretary of the Army. Terminates these public land withdrawals ten years after the enactment of this Act. Prohibits such withdrawals from being extended or renewed by an Act or joint resolution. Sets forth a procedure for the relinquishment of such lands if the Secretary of Defense concludes that there is no military need for any or all the lands withdrawn. Requires the Secretary of Defense, before such relinquishment, to determine the extent to which such lands are contaminated with explosive, toxic, or other hazardous materials. Sets forth procedures for contaminated lands to be decontaminated. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to refuse to accept contaminated withdrawn lands for relinquishment if decontamination is economically unfeasible, or the lands would not be open to the operation of some of the public land laws, or if insufficient funds have been appropriated. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to publish in the Federal Register an appropriate withdrawal revocation order, if such Secretary decides to accept jurisdiction of the withdrawn lands which are proposed for relinquishment. Requires the Secretaries of Defense and the Interior to: (1) send to specified congressional committees and the Governor of Alaska a report on the use of present and potential public land and other land in Alaska for military purposes; and (2) update such report at least every two years."
