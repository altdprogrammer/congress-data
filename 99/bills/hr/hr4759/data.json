    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 99-952) Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987 - Title I: Intelligence Authorization - Authorizes appropriations for intelligence and intelligence-related activities in specified departments and agencies of the U.S. Government, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Department of Defense, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence to employ civilian personnel in excess of the ceiling for such personnel when necessary to the performance of important intelligence functions. Restricts support for military and paramilitary operations in Nicaragua. Restricts intelligence agency cooperation with the Government of South Africa. Title II: Intelligence Community Staff - Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Staff for FY 1987. Establishes an end strength ceiling of 237 full-time Intelligence Community Staff employees. Provides that such staff shall be administered in the same manner as the CIA. Title III: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Related Matters - Authorizes appropriations for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund for FY 1987. Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees to provide that certain former spouses of CIA employees are entitled to a survivor annuity. Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to provide that certain former spouses of CIA employees are eligible for coverage under a health benefits plan. Title IV: Counterintelligence and Security - Allows the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Secretary of the Department of Defense to use funds for hosting counterintelligence consultations with foreign officials. Allows the FBI access to State and local criminal records for security clearances. Allows the Secretary of Defense to use the proceeds from counterintelligence operations conducted by components of the military departments to offset necessary and reasonable expenses. Grants the FBI access to the financial records of suspected foreign agents. Requires the Attorney General to inform specified congressional committees of all such requests. Title V: Administrative Authorities Relating to Intelligence Personnel - Grants Defense Intelligence Agency employees medical evacuation benefits. Extends through FY 1987 the Secretary's special authority to terminate the employment of Defense Intelligence Agency employees. Allows the Director of Central Intelligence to pay cash awards to members of the armed forces assigned to foreign intelligence duties for the performance of a special service in the public interest. Allows the Secretary of Defense to establish positions for civilian intelligence officers and employees of the military department to carry out necessary intelligence functions. Allows the Secretary to terminate the employment of any such employee whenever such action is in the interest of the United States. Authorizes the Secretary and the Director of Central Intelligence to establish undergraduate training programs for civilian employees of the National Security Agency and the CIA to develop skills critical to the mission of such agencies. Requires the Secretary and the Director of Central Intelligence to report to specified congressional committees on intelligence personnel systems. Title VI: Miscellaneous - Allows the Secretary to authorize the Defense Mapping Agency to furnish data, supplies, and services to a foreign country or international organization. Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to consider the transfer of a defense article or service exceeding $1,000,000 in value by an intelligence agency to a recipient outside that agency as a significant anticipated intelligence activity for the purposes of such Act. Prohibits the transfer of any defense articles or services outside the agency where funds for the intelligence or intelligence-related activity were denied by the Congress. Provides that an individual shall forfeit his or her Federal pension if convicted of an offense relating to the disclosure of the identities of covert intelligence agents. Title VII: Protection of United States Interests - Amends the State Department Basic Authority Act of 1956 to include any \"entity\" owned or controlled by a foreign government within the definition of \"foreign mission.\" Limits the number of Soviet nationals admitted to the United States as members of the Soviet mission to the United Nations to the same number of United States nationals who serve as members of the United States mission to the United Nations (unless the President determines that the admission of additional Soviet nationals would be in the interest of the United States). Requires the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to report to specified congressional committees on the number of Soviet nationals admitted to the United States and on the implementation of this policy. Requires certain persons engaged in legal commercial transactions to register as agents of foreign governments."
