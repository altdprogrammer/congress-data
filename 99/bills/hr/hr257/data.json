Directs such person to keep a detailed record of any income received or expenditures made to influence legislation, and to submit semiannual reports on such information to the Comptroller General. Directs such person to file a notice upon terminating his or her lobbying activities. Authorizes the Comptroller General to propose such rules as are necessary to carry out this Act. Requires that such rules be submitted to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct of the House and the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct of the Senate. Prohibits any such rule from becoming effective if either Committee disapproves it by majority vote. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties. Repeals the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act."
