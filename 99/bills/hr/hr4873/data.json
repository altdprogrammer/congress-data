Waives any claims or charges the United States may have or have assessed against such tribe, including claims for trespass, arising out of the removal by the tribe of minerals in such lands. Retains an easement to the United States to operate the Jemez Canyon Dam. Declares specified lands to be held in trust for the benefit of the Pueblo of Zia. Authorizes the University of New Mexico to convey specified lands in New Mexico to the United States to be held in trust for the benefit of the Pueblo of Santa Ana. Dissolves the restriction that such lands shall be used for archeological purposes. Authorizes the Pueblo of Santa Ana to convey specified lands in New Mexico to the University of New Mexico. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to publish in the Federal Register the legal descriptions of such lands. Provides that upon completion of the above conveyances the lands conveyed by the University of Mexico to the Pueblo Indians shall become a part of the Santa Ana Pueblo Reservation. Provides that nothing in this Act shall deprive any person (other than the United States) of any existing: (1) right of use or title or right of access to public domain over trust lands mentioned in this Act; and (2) mineral leases in such trust lands. Amends the Cherokee Leasing Act to authorize the Pueblo of Santa Ana to lease restricted lands, except the Santa Ana Pueblo Spanish Grant, for public, religious, educational, recreational, residential, or business purposes for a term not to exceed 99 years. Provides that the provisions of this Act relating to the mineral rights in specified lands in New Mexico are to take effect when the Secretary publishes in the Federal Register notice of his determination that the Pueblo of Santa Ana has consented to specified private easements of access over lands held by, or on behalf of, the Pueblo of Santa Ana. Requires the Secretary to determine whether the Pueblo of Santa Ana has consented to such easements no later than 30 days after the date which the Pueblo of Santa Ana requests the Secretary to make such determination."
