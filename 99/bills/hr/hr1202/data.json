Requires each Secretary to provide professional fish and wildlife management services for each military reservation and to report to the Congress on the expenditures made for such purpose. Amends the Sikes Act to require that cooperative plans for management of such resources on military reservations be reviewed at least every five years, and that such plans be followed when considering other resource development and management plans. Prohibits the sale or lease of land or sale of forest products from land covered by a cooperative plan. Exempts such plans from any requirement of outside service contracts and other specified Federal requirements. Extends for three years, through FY 1988, the authorization of appropriations for carrying out wildlife, fish, game, and migratory game bird conservation programs on military reservations. Requires the deposit in a reserve account of all the proceeds of forest product sales from military reservations. (Under current law, one-half of such proceeds must be so deposited.)"
