    "text": "Indian Gambling State Regulation Act - Grants authority to the States to regulate and tax gambling activity, except bingo, conducted on an Indian reservation or land held in trust by the United States for an Indian tribe. Provides that such authority shall be concurrent with that authority (to regulate or tax gambling activity) granted by tribal law to any Indian tribe if such law is approved by the Secretary of the Interior and is published in the Federal Register. Prohibits such tribal law from being in violation of, or inconsistent with, State laws. Provides that the authority to regulate or tax gambling activity shall be exercised in the same manner as it is exercised on non-Indian land."
