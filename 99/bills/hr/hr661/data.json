Amends the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 to include any unit of the legislative branch as an agency subject to provisions governing labor management relations in Government. Extends the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act to the employees of any unit of the legislative branch of the Government whether a unit has positions in the competitive civil service or not. Includes the legislative branch of the Government within the definition of the term \"employer\" in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967."
