    "text": "Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to immediately suspend (without notice or hearing) the right of any air carrier or foreign air carrier to engage in foreign air commerce to and from a nation in which a commercial passenger aircraft has been unlawfully seized by persons who boarded it in one of the nation's airports. Requires the Secretary (in consultation with the Secretary of State) to suspend the right of any foreign carrier to engage in foreign air transportation if it provides transportation to a foreign airport at which tightened security measures have not been implemented within 48 hours of an unlawful air carrier seizure. Provides that, if a nation does not implement certain minimum security measures within 30 days after the Secretary's notification that such steps are necessary, the Secretary is authorized to: (1) revoke or impose conditions upon the operating authority of that nation's airlines; and (2) suspend the right of air carriers or aircraft operators to engage in foreign air transportation to or from such nation. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress regarding the sanctions imposed upon a non-compliant nation. States that the Secretary's authority to impose conditions upon an airline's operating authority or upon an air carrier's transportation rights shall be deemed to be a condition to any certificate to engage in foreign air commerce. Imposes civil penalties upon air carriers or aircraft operators who engage in foreign air transportation in violation of this Act."
