Defines an \"acquisition junk bond\" as a bond issued after a specified date pursuant to a plan of corporate acquisition which: (1) is subordinated to other obligations or has a rating which is below investment grade; and (2) is part of an issue having an aggregate issue price of $30 million or more. Prohibits federally insured financial institutions and employer retirement plans from acquiring such acquisition junk bonds. Treats \"greenmail profits\" as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. Defines \"greenmail profits\" as any gain realized on the sale or exchange of stock by a stockholder if: (1) the shareholder's holding period is less than two years; (2) during the two year period prior to the sale of such stock the shareholder or anyone acting on his behalf announced a public tender offer; and (3) the consideration received is materially different from that of any other shareholder with respect to stock in the same class as the stock sold or exchanged."
