Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants for the purpose of assisting hospitals in carrying out approved graduate medical education programs. Entitles each qualified institution to a direct grant for the fiscal year in which it applies for the grant. Sets forth a formula for determining the size of the hospital's grant. Limits the total amount which the Secretary may use to make such direct grants."
