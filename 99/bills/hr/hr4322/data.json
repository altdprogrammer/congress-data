    "text": "Trade Reform and Job Creation Act - Title I: International Trade Policy and Action - Declares that it is U.S. policy for the President to respond to actions by a foreign country that violate the rights of the United States under trade agreements by taking like or similar reciprocal actions against the products or services of that country. Title II: Waiver of Federal Requirements to Stimulate Employment - Authorizes an eligible person, within 90 days of the date the President refuses to take action with respect to a recommended action (a response recommended by the U.S. Trade Representative to an unfair trade practice), to request a Federal agency to waive temporarily any regulation: (1) that is administered by the agency; and (2) the waiver of which will result in the maintenance of, or an increase in, the level of employment in a significant number of the firms that would have benefited from the recommended action. Defines an \"eligible person\" as a person representing: (1) one or more firms in a U.S. industry that would have benefited if the President had taken the recommended action; or (2) the workers in one or more such firms. Requires the Federal agency, within 60 days of receipt of such request, to: (1) deny the waiver if it will not result in the effect anticipated by the eligible person or if it is not in the national interest; (2) grant the waiver if it will result in the desired effect and is authorized by law; or (3) send a legislative proposal to the Congress to authorize the waiver if the waiver will result in the anticipated effect but is not authorized by law. Provides for expedited consideration of such legislation. Title III: Relief from Import Competition and Unfair Trade through Antitrust Exemptions - Authorizes a person to apply to the Attorney General for exemption from certain antitrust laws. Requires the Attorney General to grant the exemption if: (1) the applicant is an eligible person; (2) the activities covered by the exemption are reasonably related to enhancing competition with foreign competitors to whom market share has been lost, and, considering worldwide competition, outweighs any adverse competitive impact on the domestic market; and (3) the specified action would not violate other antitrust provisions. Defines an \"eligible person\" as any legal entity that is a member of an industry which: (1) the International Trade Commission found to be seriously injured or threatened with serious injury by increased imports; or (2) was included within the scope of recommended response to an unfair trade practice. Requires the Attorney General to report to the Congress on any exemption granted under this title. Title IV: Fair Competition in Foreign Commerce - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to prohibit a multiple customs law offender from: (1) introducing, or attempting to introduce, foreign goods or services into U.S. commerce; and (2) engaging or attempting to engage any other person to make such introduction or attempt. Defines a \"multiple customs law offender\" as any person who is convicted of, or penalized for, three separate customs violations during a period of ten consecutive years. Requires all fees collected from penalties imposed under this title to be placed in a Deficit Reduction Fund in the Treasury. Title V: Exemption from Cargo Preference Laws for Agricultural Export Programs - Prohibits any agricultural commodity exports from being subject to certain cargo preference requirements. Title VI: Exportation of Alaskan Petroleum and Natural Gas to Japan if Certain Reciprocal Concessions Are Granted - Authorizes the President to enter into negotiations with Japan on a trade agreement under which the United States will permit the exportation to Japan of Alaskan petroleum and natural gas in return for substantial concessions by Japan regarding the importation into Japan of certain exports important to the United States. Title VII: Textile and Apparel Trade Policy and Negotiating Objectives - Sets forth the U.S. objectives in any negotiations relating to the Multi-Fiber Arrangement and the conditions of the domestic textile and apparel industries."
