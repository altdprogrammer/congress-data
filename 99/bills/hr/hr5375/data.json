Terminates Chile's eligibility for designation as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences. Prohibits extending duty-free treatment to imports from Chile. Authorizes the reinstatement of Chile's beneficiary developing country status and duty-free treatment if: (1) the President submits a specified certification to the Congress; and (2) an approval resolution is enacted within 30 days of submission of such certification. Provides that such certification shall contain the President's determination that: (1) the human rights situation in Chile has improved; and (2) Chile has taken significant steps to restore democracy. Prohibits the President from submitting such a certification within: (1) one year of enactment of this Act; or (2) one year of submission of a previous certification if an approval resolution is not enacted with respect to that certification."
