Rept. 99-845 (Part I)) Narcotics Penalties and Enforcement Act of 1986 - Title I: Controlled Substances Penalties - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to modify the threshold quantity and kinds of controlled substances (adding cocaine freebase, controlled substance analogs, and fentanyl analogs) which trigger enhanced penalties. Imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years' imprisonment (20 for subsequent offenses) for violations involving a specified large quantity of such substances. Increases the maximum sentence for such violations to 30 years' imprisonment and a fine of up to $2,000,000 (life imprisonment and a fine of up to $4,000,000 for subsequent violations). Provides for a fine of up to $5,000,000 ($10,000,000 for subsequent violations) for violations involving a person other than an individual (organization). Specifies lesser penalties for smaller quantities of the same substance. Modifies the penalties for violations involving non-narcotic schedule I or II controlled substances, schedule III, IV, and V controlled substances, and certain other substances (including marihuana). Increases the fines for certain Controlled Substances Act violations. Imposes criminal penalties of imprisonment for up to one year and a fine of up to $5,000 (up to two years and $10,000 for subsequent violations) for possession of a controlled substance in a special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Provides increased criminal penalties (a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment, maximum term of life) for certain Controlled Substances Act violations which result in death or a serious bodily injury. Amends the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to modify the threshold quantity and kinds of controlled substances which trigger revised enhanced penalties. (Modifies the quantities and kinds of substances to reflect those in the Controlled Substances Act.) Increases the fines for certain Controlled Substances Import and Export Act violations. Provides increased criminal penalties (a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment, maximum term of life) for certain Controlled Substances Import and Export Act violations which result in death or serious bodily injury. Title II: Controlled Substance Offenses Relating to Children and Schools; Precursor and Essential Chemical Review - Imposes enhanced penalties for the manufacture of a controlled substance in or near an elementary or secondary school. (Current law imposes such enhanced penalties only for the distribution of a controlled substance in or near such schools.) Imposes increased penalties for employing persons under 18 years of age to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance. Directs the Attorney General to conduct a study on the need for legislation, regulation, or alternative methods to control the diversion of legitimate precursor and essential chemicals to the illegal production of drugs. Requires the Attorney General to report his findings to the Congress within 90 days of enactment of this Act. Title III: Controlled Substances Technical Amendments - Grants the Attorney General authority to enter into contracts with State and local law enforcement agencies to provide cooperative controlled substances enforcement."
