Requires the person in charge of such vehicle, immediately upon its arrival at the crossing point, to report the arrival and present the vehicle and all persons and merchandise on board for inspection to the customs officer at that crossing point. Requires the pilot of any aircraft arriving in the United States or the Virgin Islands from any foreign airport or place to comply with the advance notification, arrival reporting, and landing requirements as prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury (the Secretary). Prohibits a vessel or aircraft, after arriving in the United States or the Virgin Islands, and prohibits a vehicle after arriving in the United States, from departing from the place of arrival or discharging any passenger or merchandise except in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Imposes penalties for violations of the arrival, reporting, and entry requirements. Increases the fine for unauthorized unloading of passengers. Requires individuals arriving in the United States other than by vessel, vehicle, or aircraft to: (1) enter only at a border crossing point; and (2) report their arrival and present themselves to the customs facility at that crossing point.

Requires individuals arriving in the United States by unreported conveyance to notify customs of their arrival and present their property for customs examination and inspection.

Increases the penalties for unlawful unloading and transshipment. Makes it unlawful for the pilot of any aircraft to transport or for any individual on board any aircraft to possess merchandise knowing or intending that merchandise will be smuggled into the United States.

Prohibits the transfer at sea between aircraft and vessels, regardless of their nationality, under circumstances indicating the intent of the transfer is to make smuggling possible. Imposes penalties, including seizure of the vessel or aircraft, for violations of such anti-smuggling provisions. Sets forth certain acts that, if engaged in within 250 miles of the U.S. territorial seas, shall be: (1) presumed to constitute circumstances indicating intent to smuggle; and (2) deemed prima facie evidence that an aircraft or vessel was used in aiding or facilitating such smuggling. Changes the procedures for seizure of conveyances used in smuggling. Requires the seizure, forfeiture, and sale in accordance with the customs laws of any vessel, vehicle, or aircraft if the person in charge of such conveyance is subject to a penalty for violation of the customs laws. Exempts any conveyance used as a common carrier in the transaction of business as a common carrier from such seizure and forfeiture penalties for customs violations relating to merchandise contained in passenger baggage or cargo listed accurately on the cargo manifest unless the person in charge of the conveyance participated in, or had knowledge of, the violation or was grossly negligent in preventing or discovering the violation. Requires a common carrier conveyance to be seized and forfeited if the prohibited merchandise is found to have been: (1) in packages that are not manifested or in packages whose marks do not agree with the manifest; or (2) concealed in or on the conveyance but not in the cargo. Prohibits such seizure and forfeiture if none of the persons in charge of the conveyance knew or by the exercise of the highest degree of care and diligence could have known that such prohibited merchandise was on board.

Requires that the expenses of a forfeiture proceeding shall be a priority claim in the same manner as the court costs. Provides that compensation for informers shall not exceed 25 percent of the net amount recovered. (Current law requires such compensation to equal 25 percent of such amount.)

Authorizes the stationing of foreign customs officers in the United States pursuant to a treaty. Provides certain protections for such foreign customs officials. Imposes penalties for making fraudulent statements to such foreign customs officials.

Limits the amount authorized to be appropriated from the Fund for each fiscal year to $20,000,000. Requires any amount in the Fund in excess of $20,000,000 at the end of FY 1986 and FY 1989 to be deposited in the Treasury. Requires any amount remaining in the Fund at the end of FY 1992 to be deposited in the Treasury. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Imposes certain reporting requirements on vessels (hovering vessels) that have received merchandise while in the customs waters beyond the territorial sea or while on the high seas.

Exempts persons who assist customs officers upon request of the officers and in good faith from liability for damages. Imposes a fine for failure to render such assistance without reasonable excuse. Amends the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to prohibit any U.S. citizen on board an aircraft or any person on board a U.S. aircraft to manufacture or distribute or possess with intent to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance. Title III: Denial of Trade Benefits to Uncooperative Drug Source Nations - Narcotics Control Trade Act - Directs the President to make an annual determination of whether any foreign country: (1) is a source of drugs and other controlled substances that is significantly affecting the United States; and (2) has not cooperated with the United States in preventing such drugs and substances from significantly affecting the United States by taking specified actions. Requires the President to submit to the Congress an annual list, based on such determination, of countries that are uncooperative drug source nations. Denies to uncooperative drug source nations: (1) nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored nation treatment); or (2) preferential tariff treatment. Terminates such sanctions against a country designated as an uncooperative drug source nation if the President considers that such country has made significant progress and will continue to make progress in changing its narcotics control programs."
