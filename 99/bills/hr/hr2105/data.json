    "text": "Amends the Food for Peace Act of 1966 to establish in the Treasury an Agricultural Export Credit Revolving Fund for use by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) for financing: (1) commercial export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities; (2) export sales of U.S. breeding animals; and (3) the establishment of facilities in importing countries to improve the capacity of such countries for handling U.S. agricultural exports. Directs the CCC to use the revolving fund only to extend credit to develop and expand markets and only where there is substantial potential for developing or enhancing regular commercial markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to ensure that the revolving fund is used to finance sales to the greatest feasible number of countries consistent with maximizing market opportunities. Sets forth goals for allocating the funds. Authorizes appropriations for the Agricultural Export Credit Revolving Fund. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the Congress on the use of the Fund."
