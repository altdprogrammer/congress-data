    "text": "Stratospheric Ozone and Climate Protection Act of 1986 - Amends the Clean Air Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to list and annually update known substances which contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion, climatic warming, or any other atmospheric or climatic modification. Prohibits the manufacture or importation of listed substances five years after they are listed. Permits the Administrator to adjust such requirement as specified. Requires a reduction phase-in of 20 percent per year, or a more rapid reduction if feasible. Permits exemptions as specified. Prohibits the importation of listed substances later than one year after they are listed unless the source nation is reducing production of such substance on a comparable reduction schedule as required in the United States. Requires such national programs to be certified by the Administrator after a determination that appropriate enforcing legislation in such nation is in place. Requires the Administrator to review certifications on an annual basis, revoking certifications for noncompliance. Requires any product or container including such a listed substance to be labeled accordingly after one year of such substance being listed. Requires producers of listed substances to report to the Administrator annually on such production until it ceases. Establishes a per pound fee for listed substances, commencing one year after listing and increasing on an annual basis. Requires that such fees be deposited into a research support trust fund and be used for grants under this Act. Directs the Administrator to acquire information relating to substitutes for listed substances. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act."
