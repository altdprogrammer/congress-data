    "text": "Federal Food Irradiation Development and Control Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to delete \"sources of radiation\" from the definition of \"food additive.\" Defines \"food irradiation process.\" Applies specified food additive regulatory provisions to food irradiation treatments. Declares it the intent of the Congress to require national uniformity in the regulation of food irradiation treatment. Prohibits States or their political subdivisions from establishing food irradiation requirements different from, or in addition to, Federal requirements. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to state that the Department of Energy should give preference to leasing byproduct material for commercial food irradiation purposes, among other specified priorities. Requires the Subcommittee on Interagency Radiation Research and Policy Coordination of the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology, constituted under the National Science, Engineering, and Technology Policy Organization and Priorities Act of 1976, to coordinate Federal research and development programs pertaining to food irradiation and other radiation matters as assigned and to coordinate and disseminate information."
