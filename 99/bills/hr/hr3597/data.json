    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-10-22", 
    "text": "Indian Economic Development Act of 1985 - Title I: Designation of Indian Enterprise Zones - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for the designation of Indian enterprise zones by the Secretary of the Interior for purposes of extending the tax incentives and regulatory flexibility measures provided by this Act. Provides that tribal governments shall nominate areas for such designation. Limits the designation of Indian enterprise zones to 30 nominated areas over a 36-month period (one-third of which must be in areas with a population of less than 1,000). Limits the period during which such designation shall remain in effect. Provides that the Secretary may designate such zones only if: (1) the area is within the jurisdiction of the tribal government; (2) the boundary of the area is continuous; (3) the area is determined to be Indian lands by the Secretary; and (4) the area meets specified unemployment and poverty requirements. Requires nominating tribal governments, as a condition of the Secretary's designation, to agree in writing to follow a course of action which may include reducing tax rates, improving local services, simplifying or streamlining regulation of business, receiving commitments of private entities to assist employees and residents of the area, or actions for the partial limitation of tribal sovereign immunity for purposes of recourse in contract and other civil disputes within the zone. Terminates the authority of the Secretary to designate such Indian enterprise zones on July 1, 1986, or 36 months after the publication of regulations pertaining to such zones, whichever is later. Describes areas to which preference shall be given in deciding to designate Indian enterprise zones. Requires the Secretary to prepare and submit to the Congress every four years a report on the effects of such Indian enterprise zones' designation. Requires that any tax reduction effected by a tribal commitment under the terms of this Act shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the eligibility of a tribe for Federal assistance or benefits. Specifies that a designation of an Indian enterprise zone shall not give displaced persons from such an area any rights or benefits under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquired Policies Act of 1970. Exempts Indian enterprise zones from certain requirements relating to Federal environmental policy. Title II: Federal Income Tax Incentives - Subtitle A: Credits for Employers - Allows employers located in Indian enterprise zones a nonrefundable income tax credit for increased employment expenditures and employment of the disadvantaged. Allows a three-year carryback and a 15-year carryover of such credit. Sets the amount of such credit at ten percent of the increase in payroll (taking into account $17,500 in wages per year per employee) plus a specified percentage of wages paid to certain disadvantaged workers for the first seven years of the Indian enterprise zone designation. Phases out such credit in the last three years of the enterprise zone designation. Disallows a deduction for the portion of wages taken into account for such credit. Subtitle B: Credits for Investment in Tangible Property in Indian Enterprise Zones - Allows businesses an additional investment tax credit for investment in certain tangible property located in Indian enterprise zones. Limits such credit to five percent for zone personal property, ten percent for new zone construction property, and 20 percent for zone infrastructure investment. Phases out such credit in the last three years of the enterprise zone designation. Requires the recapture of such credit upon early disposition of the property. Subtitle C: Reduction in Capital Gain Tax Rates - Eliminates the capital gains tax on property of corporations acquired after the enterprise zone designation and used in a zone business. Permits property to remain qualified for purposes of the revised capital gains treatment after a designation of an enterprise zone has terminated. Exempts gain from the sale or exchange of property used in a business in an enterprise zone from the computation of the minimum tax. Allows noncorporate taxpayers to deduct from gross income 100 percent of any net capital gain from qualified enterprise zone property. Subtitle D: Rules Relating to Industrial Development Bonds - Provides that limitations on the cost recovery deductions for property financed with tax-exempt industrial development bonds shall not apply to Indian enterprise zone property. Provides that the termination of the small issue exemption shall not apply to industrial development bonds the proceeds of which are used to finance facilities in such enterprise zones. Title III: Regulatory Flexibility - Revises the definition of \"small entity\" for purposes of the analysis of regulatory functions to include qualified businesses (as defined in Title II of this Act) and tribal governments and nonprofit enterprises operating within Indian enterprise zones. Authorizes Federal agencies, upon request by a designating tribal government, to waive or modify rules and regulations which pertain to the carrying out of projects or activities within an enterprise zone. Requires agencies to approve such request if the resulting benefits of job creation, community development, or economic revitalization outweigh the public interest in continuation of the rule changed. Disallows waiver or modification if a rule would directly violate a statutory requirement (including the Davis-Bacon Act and Fair Labor Standards Act) or which would present a danger to the public health and safety. Provides that no waiver or modification of a rule shall remain in effect for a longer period than the period for which the Indian enterprise zone designation is in effect. Title IV: Establishment of Foreign - Trade Zones in Indian Enterprise Zones - Requires the Foreign Trade Zone Board to consider on a priority basis and expedite the processing of applications for the establishment of foreign-trade zones within Indian enterprise zones. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to give priority to, and expedite applications for, the establishment of ports of entry necessary to establish such zones. States that, to the maximum extent practicable, foreign-trade zones should be established within Indian enterprise zones. Title V: Partial Waiver of Tribal Sovereign Immunity - Authorizes the Secretary to approve plans, pursuant to a tribal economic development plan, which include provisions for the partial waiver of sovereign immunity, including provisions for binding arbitration of contract and other civil disputes between tribal entities and non-tribal businesses or entities. Specifies that such a partial waiver of sovereign immunity shall not encumber nor diminish the trust assets of the tribe."
