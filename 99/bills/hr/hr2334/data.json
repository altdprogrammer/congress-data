Allows the drawback for imported merchandise used in the manufacture of exported cognate articles and for imported and domestic cognate articles which are exported in unchanged condition. Sets forth the method for calculation of the drawback amount. Provides that the use of this drawback precludes claims for a drawback under any other provision of law."
