Provides for the reinstatement of such permit and foreign air operations upon the Secretary's determination that such foreign nation effectively administers the minimum security measures standards. Prohibits any air carrier or foreign air carrier to engage in foreign air transportation or commerce in violation of the suspensions imposed by the Secretary."
