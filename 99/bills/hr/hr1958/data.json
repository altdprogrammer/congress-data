    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries with amendment, H. Rept. 99-101 (Part I)) Title I: National Ocean Pollution Planning Act of 1978 - Amends the National Ocean Pollution Planning Act of 1978 to extend the authorization of appropriations for such Act through FY 1988. Establishes in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration the National Ocean Pollution Program Office and the National Ocean Pollution Policy Board. Requires the Office to: (1) perform those responsibilities presently performed by the National Marine Pollution Program Office; (2) serve as support for the Board; and (3) coordinate budgetary review processes. Requires the Board to perform an interagency advisory and review function of both planning and budget relating to ocean pollution. Expresses congressional intent to more effectively coordinate ocean pollution research in the Great Lakes, the Chesapeake Bay, Puget Sound, and other nationally significant estuaries. Title II: Ocean Dumping Research - Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to eliminate the requirement that the Secretary of Commerce report to the Congress on the effects of ocean dumping or dumping in the Great Lakes. Directs the Secretary to ensure that the research program on the long-range effects of pollution, overfishing, and other man-induced changes in the ocean ecosystems complements the regulation of ocean dumping and includes monitoring programs and the assessment of the health and ability of the marine environment to assimilate materials without degradation. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to assess the feasibility of regional management plans for the disposal of waste materials, integrating the activities of all levels of government into a comprehensive strategy. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress and the President within one year on sewage sludge disposal in the New York region, assessing alternatives and recommending legislative changes to reduce adverse effects. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988 to carry out this Act. Directs the Secretary and the Administrator to each report annually to the Congress on the activities carried out under this Act."
