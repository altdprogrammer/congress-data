    "date": "1986-04-17", 
    "text": "Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to provide that permission may not be needed to export certain goods or technology to a non-\"controlled country\" (as defined in such Act) if such exports would require only notification of the appropriate governments under the agreement of the Coordinating Committee on Export Controls. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to require that the Department of Commerce be notified of such exports. Changes the licensing requirements for exports to countries that are subject to national security controls in cases where foreign availability exists (the controlled goods are otherwise available to such countries). Treats cases of foreign availability to China differently from cases involving other \"controlled countries.\" Requires the Secretary of State, in any case in which national security export controls are maintained with respect to China or any other non-\"controlled country\" notwithstanding foreign availability of such exports, to pursue negotiations to restrict the export of such goods and technology. Declares that one of the goals of such negotiations shall be to restrict such exports to \"controlled countries\" (other than China). Prohibits the Secretary of Commerce from requiring a validated license for exports to a country which imposes export controls that, as a result of such negotiations, meet certain standards. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to respond in writing to allegations of foreign availability by export license applicants. Sets forth information to be included in such responses. Provides that if certain technical advisory committees find that foreign availability exists the Secretary of Commerce shall report to the committees and to the Congress that: (1) the Secretary has removed the validated export license requirement on account of the foreign availability; (2) the Secretary has recommended negotiations to eliminate the foreign availability to \"controlled countries\" (other than China); (3) negotiations are being conducted in cases of foreign availability to China or any other non-\"controlled country\"; or (4) the Secretary has determined that foreign availability does not exist. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to review proposed exports only to \"controlled countries.\" (Current law authorizes the Secretary of Defense to review proposed exports to any country subject to national security export controls."
