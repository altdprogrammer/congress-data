    "text": "Summer Youth Educational Enhancement Act - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1988 to the Department of Education for a summer youth educational enhancement program. Requires that such program funds for any fiscal year be allocated among State education agencies (SEAs) in proportion to their allocations for the preceding fiscal year under chapter 1 (Financial Assistance to Meet Special Educational Needs of Disadvantaged Children) of the Educational Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA). Makes ECIA provisions relating to availability of appropriations applicable to funds for this Act. Requires that such funds allocated to an SEA be made available to local educational agencies (LEAs) for programs that: (1) provide basic and remedial education to participants in the summer youth employment and training programs operated under part B (Summer Youth Employment and Training Programs) of title II (Training Services for the Disadvantaged) of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA); and (2) are operated in conjunction with such employment and training programs. Requires an LEA, in order to receive such funds from an SEA, to enter into an agreement which provides for operation of such programs with the administrative entity under the JTPA for the appropriate service delivery area. Authorizes the SEA to approve an LEA application for a grant from funds under this Act if the application: (1) contains or is accompanied by such an agreement; and (2) provides assurances satisfactory to the SEA that the programs are of sufficient size, scope, and quality to give reasonable promise of substantial progress toward meeting the special educational needs of the youth being served."
