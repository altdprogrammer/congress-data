    "text": "Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Committee Act of 1985 - Amends the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act to permit a county committee, by majority vote, to petition the Secretary of Agriculture to change the number of local areas in a county. Directs the Secretary to make such change, except that the number of such areas (from which agricultural stabilization and conservation committees are elected) shall not be fewer than existed as of December 31, 1980. Requires with regard to such committees that: (1) all members, as of January 1, 1986, be elected to three-year terms; and (2) they meet at least four times a year. Sets forth committee duties and makes them effective as of January 1, 1986. Provides that if there is an increase in a county's local areas and local committees as a result of this Act, any member of a local committee elected before January 1, 1986, shall reserve the unexpired portion of his or her term of the committee for the area in which he or she resides. Expands the Secretary of Agriculture's authority to use local and county committees. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to require the Secretary to pay: (1) travel expenses for members of State, county, and local committees; and (2) hourly compensation for work actually performed by county members (at GS-11 rate) and by local members (at GS-9 rate)."
