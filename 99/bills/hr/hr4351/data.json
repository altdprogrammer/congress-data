    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Title I: Withdrawal of Public Lands - Nevada Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 - Withdraws and reserves for the Secretary of the Air Force certain public lands within Nellis Air Force Range in Clark, Nye, and Lincoln Counties, Nevada, for use as a training and weapons testing area. Withdraws and reserves for the Secretary of the Navy certain public lands within the Bravo-20 Bombing Range Churchill County, Nevada, for use as a training and weapons testing area. Prohibits construction on specified \"Security Zone\" lands until the Congress and the Governor of Nevada receive an evaluation of the impact of such construction from the Secretaries of the Interior and the Navy. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to manage such lands. Permits the Secretary of the military department concerned to close such lands to the public if necessary for public safety, national security, or military operations. Requires the Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of the military department concerned, to develop a land use plan and management program for such lands within one year. Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned to control brush and range fires. Permits such Secretary to request the assistance of the Bureau of Land Management on a reimbursable basis. Sets forth special wildlife rules for Nellis Air Force Range. Terminates the withdrawal of such lands after 1996. Requires the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretaries of the military departments concerned to issue environmental impact statements concerning the continued use or withdrawal of such lands. Requires the Secretaries of the Air Force, Navy, and the Interior to jointly report to the Congress an evaluation of the effects on public health and safety in Nevada of the military uses of such lands, including the operation of aircraft at subsonic and supersonic speeds. Requires the evaluation to consider those lands already withdrawn as well as those lands proposed or under consideration for withdrawal. Requires such evaluation to include an analysis of the impact of such use on natural and cultural resources in the State and on private and public property. Requires such report to include possible mitigating measures to be taken, including the acquisition of lands for outdoor recreational use. Terminates the withdrawal of the Nevada lands if the statements and report are not issued within the prescribed time. Permits the Secretary of Defense to relinquish any or all of such lands before the termination time. Permits the Secretary of the Interior to refuse such lands if contaminated and if decontamination is not possible. Requires the Secretaries of Defense and the Interior to report to specified congressional committees on the present and potential withdrawal of public lands in Nevada for military purposes and on the uses of other lands for such purposes. Requires the Secretary of Defense to report on airspace restrictions for nonmilitary aircraft over withdrawn lands. Requires that such reports be made available to the Congress, the Governor of Nevada and the public and revised biennially. Title II: Natural Resources and Fish and Wildlife Management on Military Reservations - Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned to manage the natural resources of each military reservation in the United States under their jurisdiction so as to provide sustained multipurpose use and public access. Requires such Secretaries to maintain fish and wildlife management on such reservations, reporting to the Congress on expenditures made for such purposes during FY 1986. Amends the Sikes Act to require that cooperative plans for management of such resources on military reservations be reviewed at least every five years, and that such plans be followed when considering other resource development and management plans. Prohibits the sale or lease of land or sale of forest products from land covered by a cooperative plan, unless the effects of the sale or leasing are compatible with the plan. Exempts such plans from any requirement of outside service contracts and other specified Federal requirements. Extends for three years, through FY 1988, the authorization of appropriations for carrying out wildlife, fish, game, and migratory game bird conservation programs on military reservations. Requires the deposit in a reserve account of all the proceeds of forest product sales from military reservations. (Under current law, one-half of such proceeds must be so deposited.)"
