    "text": "Requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to develop and implement a new enforcement strategy for commercial aircraft inspection involving: (1) more frequent hands-on and en-route inspections; (2) periodic rotation of field inspectors from region to region; (3) programs designed to prevent the overscheduling of flight crews engaged in air commerce; and (4) a program to assure that the Military Airlift Command is promptly notified by the FAA whenever a contractor airline of such command has been cited for a safety violation. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to provide that upon conviction of an air carrier for either failure to file requisite reports, or the falsification of such reports, the criminal penalty shall include a fine in accordance with Federal criminal law, or a maximum term of five years' imprisonment, or both. Provides a maximum civil penalty of $1,000 for safety violations relating to notification of proposed construction of structures which could pose a hazard to air navigation. (Current law provides only for a criminal penalty.) Increases from $1,000 to $10,000 the maximum civil penalty which may be imposed for violation of certain administrative, security, and safety regulations by commercial aircraft operators. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to prohibit any reprisal by an air carrier against any officer, employee, or contractor of such carrier for the lawful disclosure to a governmental entity (whistle blowing) regarding violations of such Act. Authorizes any person aggrieved by such a reprisal to bring a civil action. Prohibits certain FAA employees from accepting employment with any air carrier following their separation from the FAA, if, during the 24-month period preceding such separation, the employees had any direct control or responsibility over such air carrier in matters directly involving air safety. Imposes a $10,000 fine or three-month maximum imprisonment, or both, for violations of such prohibition."
