    "text": "Clean Campaign Act of 1983 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to establish the method of financing general election campaigns for the House of Representatives. Establishes eligibility criteria entitling candidates to receive campaign payments on a matching basis. Establishes formulae to determine such sums. Limits expenditure of personal funds to $20,000 per election. Waives spending limits for eligible candidates whose opponents have spent sums exceeding the limit imposed upon such candidates. Requires specified independent expenditures to be reported to the Federal Election Commission and to each candidate within specified time-frames. Permits additional payments to certain candidates who have waived specified broadcasting rights. Requires the Commission to certify the eligibility of candidates to the Secretary of the Treasury, who shall disburse funds to such candidates. Directs the Secretary to establish a separate United States House Campaign Fund and to deposit certain sums in such account in accordance with specified guidelines. Directs the Commission to audit campaign accounts. Requires repayment of excess payments and unexpended payments. Penalizes the use of funds for other than campaign purposes. Authorizes the Commission to institute repayment actions in U.S. district courts. Delineates the administrative authority of the Commission in carrying out this Act. Requires the Commission to make certain reports to the House of Representatives. Authorizes appropriations. Limits to $90,000 in any calendar year the amount of contributions which congressional candidates or their authorized political committees may accept from non-party multicandidate political committees. Specifies exceptions for candidates in general and special elections. States that any extension of credit for advertising on broadcasting stations, in newspapers or magazines, or by direct mail, or for other types of public political advertising shall be considered a contribution, if such credit is: (1) in excess of $1,000; and (2) for a period exceeding 30 days. Requires a broadcasting licensee to provide equal time without charge to any candidate whose views, positions, actions, or qualifications are criticized on that station by any time purchaser, including a political committee, unaffiliated with another candidate."
