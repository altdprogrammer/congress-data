    "text": "Police and Citizens Safety Act of 1985 - Imposes a mandatory five-year imprisonment penalty for persons convicted of carrying a firearm in the course of committing a felony in connection with certain controlled substances. Makes it unlawful for a licensed merchant or collector to engage in a firearms or ammunition transaction with certain persons adjudicated to be juvenile delinquents. Prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury from requiring licensed merchants or collectors to maintain records regarding ammunition sales involving less than 1,000 rounds. Requires such recordkeeping for armor-piercing ammunition sales and for firearms transfers by licensed collectors. Permits licensed merchants or collectors to sell firearms upon the premises of certain gun show sales. Requires licensed firearms merchants to notify certain law enforcement agencies before consummating handgun transactions with certain unlicensed individuals. Allows such a transfer to go forward 15 days after notification if the transfer has not been duly informed that the transfer would violate law. Imposes a maximum criminal fine ($250,000) and/or imprisonment (for up to ten years) for the possession of a readily convertible firearm (certain kinds of machineguns) in foreign or interstate commerce. Includes the barrel of a firearm among prohibited firearm imports, with specified exceptions. Amends the National Firearms Act to make it unlawful: (1) to transfer or possess a firearms silencer; and (2) for a registered merchant to import firearm curios and relics as dealer samples. Treats as a transfer, for purposes of the National Firearms Act, the continued possession of firearms acquired as a dealer by an individual who has ceased being a dealer. Makes it unlawful for any person to transfer a firearm or ammunition to certain indictees, convicts, or users of unlawful drugs. Declares that it is the sense of the Congress that legislation should be enacted to regulate plastic handguns."
