Establishes guidelines under which the Secretary is authorized to approve Interstate route withdrawals and substitute projects after September 30, 1983, in certain circumstances, but not later than September 30, 1986. Directs the Secretary to use the Federal share of certain adjusted cost estimates in making apportionments for substitute highway projects on October 1 of the year of adjustment if the Congress has not approved the appropriate cost estimate to make such apportionment."
