    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Makes certain technical revisions to various Federal laws relating to the operations and activities of the U.S. Coast Guard (including revising the definition of \"passenger\", providing for Coast Guard inspection of steam yachts, and allowing for certain actions during sea rescues). Extends until November 1, 1993, the exemption from certain fire safety requirements for vessels which were in operation before January 1, 1968, and operate only on the inland rivers of the United States. Requires the owner or operator of any exempted vessel to notify prospective passengers of its noncompliance with such fire safety requirements, and prohibits the owner or operator from waiving liability for any loss due to fire caused by the owner's or operator's negligence. Gives the master of a documented vessel the same lien for wages and the same priority as any other seaman serving on the vessel. Authorizes the Coast Guard to acquire a site on the State pier in New Bedford, Massachusetts, for specified construction. Authorizes the Coast Guard, beginning in FY 1986, to use appropriated funds for construction on such State pier. Declares Lawyer's Ditch in Newark, New Jersey, to be a nonnavigable waterway. Authorizes the Coast Guard to contract with a municipal utility to provide electricity to a Coast Guard facility within a specified Coast Guard district in Alaska. Declares a certain section of Bayou Lafourche, Thibodaux, Louisiana, to be a nonnavigable waterway. Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, notwithstanding certain registry requirements, to issue certificates of documentation to the vessels Marilyn, Royal Star, Alaskan Shores, Shearwater, Gypsy Rose, Eliminator, Puka Kai, Lobster House, Jane E., and Diane M. Limits the operation of the two last named vessels to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Revises a Federal drug law enforcement provision to redefine the term \"arrangement\" as such word relates to illegal drug transactions made aboard or in connection with a seagoing vessel. Authorizes the Coast Guard to enter into a cost-sharing arrangement with the city of Cape May, New Jersey, for specified highway construction. Amends Federal law relating to the towing of foreign vessels in U.S. ports. Revises the definition of \"common carrier\" for purposes of Federal law relating to foreign ocean commerce, and defines the term \"chemical parcel-tanker\" for such purposes. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to permit three specified vessels to be scrapped in the foreign market, under certain conditions. Authorizes two specified vessels to be sold to a foreign purchaser, under certain conditions."
