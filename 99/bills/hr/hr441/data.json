Rept. 99-123) Grants the United States an independent right to recover the costs of providing medical care and treatment to an individual from a third party who is subject to tort liability with respect to the individual's disease or injury or from the third party's insurer. Provides that in States that have abolished or limited tort liability as a cause of action and have established a system of compensating an individual for medical expenses through an insurance policy, contract, or medical services agreement, the United States shall be deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of such policy, contract, or agreement and shall be reimbursed for the expenses of the medical care provided as if such expenses were incurred by the individual. Declares that this Act shall apply to all cases in which the United States is authorized or required to furnish medical care and treatment, whether such treatment is furnished before or after enactment."
