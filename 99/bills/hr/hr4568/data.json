    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs with amendment, H. Rept. 99-867) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide operational coordination at all levels, including internationally, for the conservation of natural and cultural resources. Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations within six months of enactment, including provisions to integrate environmental factors and values into the Secretary's decisionmaking process for international activities. Limits the assistance the Secretary may offer relating to mineral development in other countries if the United States produces the mineral in question in substantial quantities. Requires the Secretary to delegate, to the extent possible, authorities relating to parks, recreation, and cultural resources under this Act to the Director of the National Park Service and authorities relating to fish, wildlife, and plant resources to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the President and to the Congress on activities undertaken pursuant to this Act. Requires technical assistance relating to water resources outside this country to: (1) focus on efforts to alleviate drought and famine; (2) give priority to working on a small-scale, community-based level; and (3) utilize the standards for similar projects implemented under the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965. Authorizes the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation to provide advice and technical assistance at all levels, including internationally, on historic preservation. Requires the Council to report annually to the President and to the Congress on activities undertaken pursuant to this Act. Amends the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 to direct the Secretary and the Council to promulgate policies and guidelines for Federal agencies to carry out this Act. Makes international activities under this Act subject to the guidance and coordination of the Secretary of State."
