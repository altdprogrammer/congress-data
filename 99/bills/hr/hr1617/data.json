Rept. 99-187) National Bureau of Standards Authorization Act for FY 1986 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 to the Secretary of Commerce for the following activities performed by the National Bureau of Standards (the Bureau): (1) measurement research and standards; (2) materials science and engineering; (3) engineering measurements and standards; (4) computer science and technology; (5) Center for Fire Research; (6) technical competence fund; and (7) central technical support. Reserves specified minimum amounts from the total amount of such authorized appropriations for: (1) steel technology; (2) the Center for Building Technology; (3) the creation and maintenance of data bases on structural failures; and (4) transfer to the Working Capital Fund. Authorizes funds to be transferred among the specified line items, but requires that notification and explanation of any such proposed transfer to or from a line item which exceeds ten percent of the amount authorized for that line item first be given to specified congressional officers and to the appropriate authorizing committees of the Congress. Prohibits any such transfer from having the effect of reducing the applicable minimum amounts specified for certain purposes. Prohibits any of such transferred funds from being used for the construction of the Cold Neutron Source Facility. Directs the Bureau to seek reimbursement of a specified minimum amount from other Federal agencies to expand its efforts in support of basic scientific research on the atmospheric, climatic, and environmental consequences of nuclear explosions and nuclear exchanges. Authorizes additional appropriations to the Secretary for FY 1986 for the Bureau's: (1) expenses incurred outside the United States (to be paid for in excess foreign currency); and (2) adjustments in salary, pay, retirement, and other employee benefits. Requires that sufficient income from the Working Capital Fund remain outside the general fund of the Treasury to ensure the availability of working capital necessary to replace equipment and inventories of the Bureau. Requires that fees for specified services provided by the Bureau be at least sufficient to meet these and specified other capital requirements. Provides that the Director of the Bureau shall be compensated at the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule. Authorizes the Bureau, on its own initiative but only after consultation with local authorities, to investigate structural failures in structures used or occupied by the general public. Prohibits any part of any report resulting from such investigation from being admitted as evidence or used in any suit or action for damages arising out of any matter mentioned in such report. Establishes a goal of 20 positions for the Senior Scientists Program at the Bureau. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 to the Secretary for the activities of the Office of Productivity, Technology, and Innovation. Authorizes additional appropriations for FY 1986 to the Secretary for the National Technical Information Service's patent licensing activities. Provides that appropriations made under the authority provided in this Act shall remain available for periods specified in the Acts making such appropriations. Requires the Director of the Bureau, within 90 days after enactment of this Act, to: (1) review those recommendations of the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control and such other recommendations as may be included in a specified report of the Office of Management and the Budget; and (2) report to specified congressional officers and to the appropriate congressional committees on the implementation status of each such recommendation which affects the Bureau and is within the authority and control of the Director."
