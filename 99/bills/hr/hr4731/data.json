    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Recreational Boating Safety Act of 1986 - Requires the Secretary of Transportation to report to the Congress prior to February 1, 1987, regarding the use of alcohol-blended gasoline in recreational vessels. Delineates the contents of such report. Directs the Secretary to consult with the National Boating Safety Advisory Council in preparing such report. Terminates such Council on September 30, 1991. Amends Federal law regarding recreational boating safety to delete the membership limitation of such Council, and to provide that the Secretary shall appoint members of such Council with expertise in recreational boating safety. Amends the membership requirements to specify the number of members who shall represent certain sectors of the recreational boating public. Declares that a certain conveyance agreement dated December 9, 1977, between the Commandant of the Coast Guard and Koniag, Incorporated, (a regional native corporation in Alaska) shall be interpreted to include: (1) that certain machinery may be maintained on lands conveyed to Koniag if it does not cause harmful electromagnetic interference with the Coast Guard Holiday Beach receiver item or is operated under terms mutually agreeable to the Coast Guard and Koniag, Incorporated; (2) the conveyance of the \"old shipyard\" includes the wharf and all lands beneath it; (3) an access and utility easement is intended as part of the conveyance for Cliff Point; and (4) the construction of a dock facility or other structures is not inconsistent with the easement and access to a barge landing area if such construction is in accordance with Federal approval. Extends to September 30, 1987, the authority of the Secretary of Commerce to make certain loans under the Coastal Zone Management Act. Limits such loan authority to $7,000,000. Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to provide that any portion of a State grant which remains unobligated by the end of the fiscal year or during the second year after the fiscal year for which it was originally authorized by a State for obligation, shall revert to those funds available for the original grant purpose (thus ensuring that funds appropriated for Coastal Zone Management shall be spent for coastal management only)."
