Requires all United States currency to be redeemable in gold Eagle coins which shall be the standard unit of value of money for the United States beginning on October 1, 1987. Directs the Secretary to: (1) mint and issue Eagle coins; (2) maintain all forms of U.S. currency and coin at a parity of value with the Eagle coin; (3) post a daily bid and ask price for gold for the period of October 1, 1986, to October 1, 1987; and (4) establish and fix the official rate of parity between the Eagle coin and the dollar as the arithmetic means between the bid price and the ask price for gold on October 1, 1987. Prohibits the Secretary from limiting the amount of gold traded at any bid or ask price."
