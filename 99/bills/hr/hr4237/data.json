    "text": "Amends general military law relating to the organization of the defense agencies to direct the Secretary of Defense, in appropriate cases, to provide for the performance by one agency or organization of supply or service activities common to more than one military department. Directs the Secretary to periodically (and not less than every two years) review the services and supplies provided by the defense agencies to ensure that such provision is more economical than the provision of such services by the military departments. Specifies various officers and directors whose views are required as part of the Secretary's review. Requires the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to periodically (and not less than every two years) report to the Secretary concerning the combat support agencies. Directs the Chairman to: (1) provide for the participation of the combat support agencies in joint training exercises; and (2) assess the performance of each agency in such exercise and provide for any necessary changes. Requires the Chairman to develop a uniform system for reporting each such agency's readiness to perform in a war or threat to national security. Establishes in each combat support agency a combat support agency policy council. Requires such council to: (1) advise the director of that agency on policy matters relating to the operation of that agency; and (2) consider and provide advice as directed by the Secretary of Defense. Requires the Director of a combat support agency, upon request, to assign a representative of that agency to the headquarters of a unified or specified combatant command. Defines \"combat support agency\" for purposes of this Act. Requires the Secretary of Defense to conduct a study of the functions and organizational structure of the defense agencies. Directs the Chairman of JCS and the Secretaries of the military departments to each conduct a study of the functions and organizational structure of the defense agencies. Requires each such study to be submitted to the Secretary of Defense. Directs the Secretary of Defense, within a specified deadline, to report to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees concerning the study made of the functions and organizational structure of the defense agencies, together with recommendations."
