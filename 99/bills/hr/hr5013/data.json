Rept. 99-767) Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Liability and Safety Act of 1986 - Title I: Liability for Personal Injury on Fishing, Fish Processing, and Fish Tender Vessels - Amends Federal law to limit the liability of an employer for the temporary illness, injury, or disability of a seaman employed on a fishing, fish processing, or fish tender vessel if the employer: (1) provides a cure for such seaman; and (2) has in effect certain prescribed minimum illness or injury maintenance coverage. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to annually review the dollar figure representing such minimum coverage and to make certain adjustments to such figure, if necessary, in relation to changes in the Consumer Price Index for such period. Limits such an employer's general liability for an illness, disability, injury or death of a seaman employee to $500,000, with specified exceptions. Requires a seamen to bring an action to obtain such coverage within two years from the date the cause of action accrued. Title II: Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Safety - Amends Federal law concerning fishing vessels to prescribe and to require the prescription of certain safety standards on all fishing, fish tender, and fish processing vessels. Defines the international equivalent of such required vessel safety standards. Authorizes an appropriate safety official to take appropriate action with respect to vessels operating in an unsafe condition or in violation of standards set forth under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to exempt certain vessels from such standards. Outlines civil and criminal penalties for violation of this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish a Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Advisory Committee (the Committee) to advise, consult with, report to, and make recommendations to the Secretary concerning various vessel safety matters. Directs the Secretary, at least once a year, to publish a notice soliciting nominations for membership on the Committee. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce to designate a representative to participate as an observer with the Committee. Requires the Secretary to consult with the Committee before taking specified action affecting fishing, fish tender, or fish processing vessels. Terminates such Committee on September 30, 1991. Requires the Committee, two years prior to such termination, to recommend to the Congress whether the Committee should be renewed and continue beyond the termination date. Requires the Secretary to compile statistics concerning marine casualties in connection with fishing, fish tender, or fish processing vessels. Title III: Fishery Management Safety - Amends the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to require the contents of fishery management plans to include provisions relating to the safety of persons and vessels engaged in the fishery."
