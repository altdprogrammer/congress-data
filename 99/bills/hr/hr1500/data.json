    "text": "Military Selective Service Amendments of 1985 - Directs the President to resume the registration of individuals pursuant to the Military Selective Service Act. Removes the restriction that only males between ages 18 and 26 may be subject to the selective service, and instead requires registration from all males who reach age 18 after December 31, 1977. Requires that the President provide for the induction of not more than 200,000 persons into the armed forces in each fiscal year after FY 1985 for service in the Individual Ready Reserve of the Army Reserve. Provides that individuals so inducted shall be required to serve not less than 12 weeks of active duty for training. Provides that a random sequence drawing shall be conducted for induction for all registrants. Provides that, effective upon the enactment of authority to induct persons into the armed forces, no deferment will be granted to persons enlisting in any reserve component of the armed forces or the Ready Reserve of any such reserve component. Requires that the entire Selective Service System annually participate in training to simulate emergency mobilization procedures. Exempts the Selective Service System from executive reorganization orders."
