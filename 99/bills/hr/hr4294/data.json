Defines international terrorism as conduct directed against the United States or a national of the United States which would be a violent felony if committed within the United States and is intended by the defendant to: (1) intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (2) influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; (3) affect the conduct of a government by assassination or kidnapping; or (4) retaliate against a government for a policy or conduct of such government. Requests the President to study the threat of terrorist attack and means to control the availability and use of explosives by terrorists. Requests the President to report the results of such study to the Congress. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should establish a process to encourage the negotiation of an international convention to prevent international terrorism."
