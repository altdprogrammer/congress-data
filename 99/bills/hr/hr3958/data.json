    "text": "San Luis Rey Indian Water Rights Settlement Act - Provides for the settlement of water rights claims between the United States and the La Jolla, Rincon, San Pasqual, Pauma, and Pala Bands of Mission Indians (California). Requires the Secretary of the Interior, upon the settlement of all water rights claims, to deliver water to the Indian Water Authority in the vicinity of the Pala Indian Reservation. Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from being obligated to construct any new facilities. Permits the Secretary of the Interior to utilize non-Federal facilities to deliver such water. Requires the Secretary of Energy to provide electric power to deliver water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to the Pala Indian Reservation. Sets forth specified limitations on the uses of such power. Requires the Indian Water Authority to reimburse the United States for the cost of providing such power at a specified rate. Requires the Secretary of Energy to ensure that no additional costs to project customers will result from the delivery of electric power. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Energy to each enter into such contracts to: (1) fulfill any obligations of such Secretary in the delivery of water and electric power; and (2) continue to provide such services. Establishes the San Luis Rey Indian Water Authority. Provides that the Authority, upon the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, may lease, sell, and manage any water or power resource on or off the Reservations of the Bands. Delegates to the Secretary of the Interior exclusive authority to lease, grant rights-of-way across, or transfer title to any Indian tribal or allotted land which is used to divert, convey, and store the waters of the San Luis Rey River for the Escondido communities."
