    "text": "Coastal Resource and Economic Development Grant Act of 1985 - Establishes in the Treasury the Coastal Resource and Economic Development Fund (the Fund). Provides that for FY 1986 and for each fiscal year thereafter the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay specified block grant amounts to each coastal State and to each unit of local coastal government. Sets forth formulae according to which the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall certify the amounts to be paid to each coastal State and to each local coastal government. States that for purposes of payments made to coastal States and local coastal governments, the following islands shall be considered as one coastal State: the Virgin Islands, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) to ensure that the Governor of each coastal State uses a certain percentage of the payments for specified activities determined by such Governor to be helpful to: (1) local coastal communities impacted by this Act; and (2) local Alaskan coastal communities located within the boundaries of the Coastal Resource Areas established under the Alaska Coastal Management Act. Requires the Secretary to ensure that amounts paid to local coastal government units are not used to replace funds which the coastal State would normally provide to such units. Requires a coastal State to match the funds received under this Act by a certain percentage. Specifies the environmental and economic purposes for which funds under this Act must be used. Sets forth penalties for the use of funds which the Secretary determines is inconsistent with the purposes of this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
