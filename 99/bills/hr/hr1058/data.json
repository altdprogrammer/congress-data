    "text": "Omnibus Congressional Compensation Reform Act of 1985 - Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to eliminate the annual adjustment in compensation for Members of Congress. Amends the Federal Salary Act of 1967 to make the President's recommendation for congressional salaries of an advisory nature only, unless otherwise provided by law. Provides that the annual rate of pay for Members of Congress shall be the rate payable on the date of enactment of this Act. Repeals the provision of law which authorizes permanent appropriations for compensation for Members. Directs that any increase in compensation, tax benefits, or increase in outside earned income limitations (including honoraria) shall take effect at the beginning of the Congress following the Congress during which such benefits are authorized. Amends rule VIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives and rule XII of the Standing Rules of the Senate to require a recorded vote on such types of legislation. Makes it out of order in the House or Senate to consider such legislation if it contains items other than those relative to congressional benefits."
