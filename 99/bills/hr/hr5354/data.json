Establishes an \"optimal grade\" (for grain) based on minimal amounts of foreign material, and damaged and broken grain. Measures other grain by the deviation from such standard. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Grain Inspection Service to: (1) conduct a study of the need for and the availability of uniform end-use value tests for grain; (2) revise inspection and certification procedures accordingly; and (3) report to the Congress within one year."
