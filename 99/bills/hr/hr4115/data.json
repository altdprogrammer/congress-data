    "text": "Job Training Partnership Act Amendments of 1986 - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act to allow gubernatorial approval of service delivery area consortiums serving more than one labor market area. Allows redesignation of service delivery areas more often than every two years in order to prevent such areas from receiving reduced allocations. Requires job training plans, in addition to their current contents, to contain requirements for: (1) coordination with specified adult and vocational educational programs; (2) descriptions of arrangements with local educational agencies (LEAs) for attendance and performance standards for youth eudcational programs and for flexible class schedules; and (3) descriptions of arrangements with private nonprofit organizations for attendance and performance standards for alternative youth educational programs. Requires that after June 30, 1986, no service delivery area within a State shall be allocated less than 90 percent of its average allocation for the two years after the program year for which an eligibility determination is made. Requires a ratable reduction in the amount each area is allocated if the amount appropriated is not sufficient to provide 90 percent. Prohibits the Secretary of Labor from establishing a requirement that States have to match the assistance provided to them for dislocated workers under the Act. Requires the administration and monitoring of Native American employment and training programs to be conducted within one unit of the Employment and Training Administration of the Department of Labor."
