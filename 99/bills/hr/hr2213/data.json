Enables the Economic Development Revolving Fund to continue in existence to: (1) receive collections and repayments of assistance extended under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965; and (2) pay all obligations arising in connection with such Act. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to determine when the Fund is no longer needed and deposit any remaining moneys into the general fund of the Treasury. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 for the orderly phase-out of EDA."
