    "text": "Automobile Consumer Protection Act of 1985 - Authorizes a consumer to notify the manufacturer, its agent, or its authorized dealer that an automobile does not conform to all applicable warranties. Requires such nonconformity to be corrected at no charge even though the corrections may have to be made after the expiration of the warranty period. Provides that if the defect or condition not in conformity with the warranty cannot be corrected after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer must either replace the motor vehicle with a comparable one or refund the full purchase price less a reasonable allowance for mileage and any damage not attributable to normal wear and tear. Permits a manufacturer to allege as an affirmative defense to any such claim either that: (1) the nonconformity does not substantially impair the value of the motor vehicle; or (2) it is the result of abuse, neglect, or unauthorized modification or alterations. States that if a manufacturer has established an informal dispute procedure, the refund or replacement requirements of this Act will not apply unless the consumer resorts to such procedure. Prohibits a consumer from waiving, limiting, or disclaiming these provisions. Requires an action brought under these provisions to be commenced within four years after the date of the original delivery of the motor vehicle. Permits the court to award attorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff."
