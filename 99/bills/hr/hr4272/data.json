Sets forth the statement, a copy of which is to be provided to Medicare beneficiaries, informing such beneficiaries of: (1) the process by which Medicare coverage for a hospital stay is terminated; and (2) a patient's right to a peer review organization review of the decision to terminate coverage. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make the discharge rights statement available to other interested parties and to revise the statement when legal and regulatory changes necessitate such action."
