    "text": "Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to consolidate existing renal disease network areas into no fewer than 17 areas, giving existing network organizations the first opportunity to perform network functions in a newly designated area. Requires that the network council and medical review board established by each network organization have at least one patient representative. Expands the list of network organization responsibilities to include the: (1) encouragement of patient and provider participation in vocational rehabilitation programs; (2) implementation of a procedure for evaluating and resolving patient grievances; (3) necessary on-site review of facility and provider compliance with standards of care; and (4) collection of data for specified reports. Requires the Secretary to establish a national end-stage renal disease registry for the purpose of collecting uniform and comprehensive data on all dialysis and transplant patients. Alters the methods of funding network organizations by requiring the Secretary to supply such organizations with 50 cents from each payment otherwise made to a dialysis facility for dialysis services. (Currently, organization funds are provided from the Medicare trust funds.) Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish conditions on the reuse of dialyzer filters by facilities and providers which voluntarily reuse such filters; and (2) consider establishing standards for the reuse of other dialysis supplies."
