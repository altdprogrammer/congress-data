(Current provisions require such payment before an audit.) Requires that expenses of transportation audit contracts be financed from overpayments collected from carriers on transportation bills paid by the Government and other similar type refunds at not to exceed 40 percent of annual collections. Prohibits payment to any contractor from exceeding 50 percent of the overpayments identified by any contract audit. Requires the transfer of the balance of overpayments collected to miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury. Requires the Administrator to include transactions under this Act in budget estimates to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and to the Congress. Directs the Administrator, within 60 days of enactment of this Act, to establish a task force to study and investigate the feasibility, desirability, and economy of an integrated automated system that Federal agencies may use in managing the transportation of property for the United States. Requires a final report to the Congress on the results of such study not later than July 1, 1988. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to remove the certification requirement of the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of Commerce that the importation of foreign surplus property would relieve domestic shortages or otherwise benefit the economy of this country."
