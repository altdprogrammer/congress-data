    "text": "Nurse Education Act of 1985 - Amends the Public Health Services Act to reauthorize funds for FY 1985 through 1988 for the nursing special projects program. Authorizes additional projects that demonstrate: (1) clinical nurse education programs which combine educational curricula and clinical practice; (2) methods to improve access to nursing services in non-institutional settings; and (3) methods to encourage nursing graduates to practice in health manpower shortage areas. Revises the advanced nurse training program to authorize grants and contracts for programs that lead to masters' and doctoral degrees and prepare nurses to serve as nurse educators, administrators, researchers, or to serve in clinical nurse specialties which require advanced education. Authorizes appropriations for such programs through FY 1987. Authorizes grants and contracts for schools of nursing and other non-profit entities to meet the costs of programs for the education of nurse practitioners and nurse midwives. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988. Authorizes grants to schools of nursing for post-baccalaureate fellowships for faculty to: (1) investigate cost-effective alternatives to traditional health care modalities; and (2) examine nursing interventions that result in positive outcomes in health status. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988. Extends the authority for traineeships for nurse anesthetists. Provides financial assistance to nurse anesthetist faculty members for advanced education. Directs the Secretary to set dates by which schools of nursing must file applications for Federal capital contributions. Describes how such appropriations are to be allotted. Revises the date for the distribution of loan fund assets. Provides for the repayment of a specified portion of the balance of the student loan fund within 90 days after a school terminates its participation in such program. Repeals specified provisions of such Act dealing with Federal construction grants and assistance. Provides for the recovery of Federal construction assistance where such facility is: (1) sold or transferred to an entity which is not a public or non-profit school; (2) no longer used for the purpose for which it was constructed; or (3) used for sectarian instruction or as a place for religious worship. Allows the Secretary to waive Federal recovery rights for good cause."
