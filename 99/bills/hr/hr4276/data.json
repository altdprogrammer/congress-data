Authorizes any U.S. agency during FY 1986 and 1987 to use its funds to conduct military or paramilitary operations in Angola or to provide aid to any group engaged in such operations only if such use of such funds is the openly acknowledged U.S. policy. Provides that such policy is considered openly acknowledged only if: (1) the President determines that U.S. support for such operations is important to national security and requests the Congress to approve support for such operations; and (2) the Congress enacts a joint resolution approving support for such operations."
