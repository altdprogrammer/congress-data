    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1986-02-25", 
    "text": "Competitive America Trade Reform Act of 1986 - Declares that it is U.S. policy that: (1) the United States shall call for a multilateral conference to seek a new international monetary regime; (2) the United States shall try to use its foreign aid programs to aid the development of the private sectors in less developed countries; (3) rules of trade, dispute settlement procedures, and penalties for trade violations should be strengthened; (4) new policies are required to aid U.S. industries to improve their international competitiveness; and (5) a new program of transition aid for workers and firms is needed. Title I: International Monetary Reform - Establishes a temporary National Commission on International Monetary Reform which shall prepare a report for the President and the Congress analyzing and evaluating: (1) proposed reforms of the international monetary system; (2) the effects of international capital flows on exchange rate volatility and proposals for restricting capital transactions; (3) proposed methods for coordinating monetary policies of major industrialized nations; (4) objectives for joint intervention in foreign exchange markets; (5) a detailed working agenda to be presented to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a new \"Bretton Woods\" conference; and (6) other matters, including legislative recommendations. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, within 45 days of the submission of the Commission's report, to submit legislation to the Congress implementing policy changes recommended by the Commission and authorizing submission of the agenda to the IMF. Provides for expedited consideration of such legislation. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, within 15 days of enactment of such legislation, to request the IMF to convene a working group to consider the agenda for a conference on monetary reform. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reinstate the 30 percent withholding tax on portfolio interest paid to foreign persons. Title II: Foreign Assistance and Investment - Declares that it is U.S. policy to: (1) administer the aid programs referred to in this title in a manner that promotes the development of as diverse a range of economic sectors within developing countries as is practicable; and (2) prevent any domestic industry or economic sector from bearing a disproportionate economic burden as a result of a bilateral trade or investment agreement or of the operation of a U.S. development program in foreign countries. Authorizes the Secretary of State to: (1) develop a list of those less developed countries in which Cooley Loan Program activities may be conducted; and (2) negotiate and conclude agreements for the implementation of a Cooley Loan Program. Requires such agreements to provide for: (1) the sale of surplus U.S. commodities to be paid for by local currencies; (2) such currencies to be made available to designated accounts under the control of the Secretary of State; (3) spending no less than 50 percent of certain development funds for private sector development; and (4) specifying maximum local currency reserve levels in designated accounts, monetary growth targets in the host country, and termination conditions. Establishes an Economic Security Council. Requires the Council to: (1) advise the President on domestic and international economic matters; (2) develop and oversee U.S. economic policy; and (3) develop an international bankruptcy procedure to guide U.S. banks and agencies in responding to impending defaults by debtor nations. Abolishes the Cabinet Council on Economic Affairs. Authorizes the President to enter into trade agreements with least developed developing countries which provide for liberalization of trade between the United States and such countries. Establishes within the International Development Cooperation Agency the International Private Enterprise Institute which shall: (1) provide expertise and technical aid to less developed countries in attracting financial investment, developing indigenous industries, and promoting exports; and (2) serve as U.S. liaison for the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Requires that funds authorized: (1) for programs conducted by the Agency for International Development shall be used for government-to-government and official activities which foster economic growth and promote a favorable climate for development of the private sector in developing countries; and (2) for programs conducted by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) shall be used to promote economic growth and stability through the direct involvement of the private sector. Creates four special offices within OPIC for program development. Authorizes OPIC to take partial equity interest in qualified development projects. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States should call upon the IMF and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to convene a special meeting of the Group of Ten industrial nations and debtor nations for the purposes of formalizing growth-oriented conditionality guidelines to promote the creditworthiness of less developed countries, debt repayment flexibility, and trade liberalization. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare a report in preparation for such conference and submit such report to the Congress. Title III: Trade Laws and Agreements - Subtitle A: General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - Directs the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to request the contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to join the United States in ministerial sessions preparatory to a new round of negotiations which would seek to: (1) create or strengthen GATT articles on certain trade issues; (2) strengthen the GATT as an institution by means of certain administrative and rules changes; and (3) tighten GATT enforcement mechanisms through reforms of the panel system. Subtitle B: Reform of Certain States Trade Laws - Declares that it is U.S. policy to regard a country as not subscribing to the open trade principles of the GATT and to impose trade sanctions on such country if such country fails to: (1) demonstrate good faith in adhering to GATT principles; (2) cooperate in extending GATT coverage to the areas listed in Subtitle A; (3) seek to eliminate counterfeiting, piracy of intellectual property, or violations of export licensing regulations; or (4) assist in international efforts to curb illicit drug traffic. Requires petitions for import relief that are filed with the International Trade Commission (ITC) to: (1) allege that an article is being imported in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury to the competing domestic industry or a substantial threat of serious injury to a nascent competing domestic industry; and (2) include a statement describing the purposes for which import relief is sought, including the objective of facilitating methods of adjusting to the competition. Requires the ITC to decide within 25 days whether the petition alleges all the elements necessary for import relief. Requires the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) to initiate an import relief investigation if the ITC determines that the petition contains all the necessary elements. Declares that the Secretary shall initiate such an investigation upon request of the President, the USTR, the ITC, or upon the Secretary's own motion. Requires the Secretary, within 90 days of the start of such investigation, to determine whether: (1) any domestic industry is being seriously injured; or (2) any nascent domestic industry is being threatened. Sets forth factors the Secretary shall consider in making such determination. Sets forth the method of determining whether the article that a domestic industry produces is like or competitive with an imported article. Requires the Secretary, if the Secretary determines that imports are injuring or threatening a domestic industry, to: (1) notify the ITC; and (2) make available to the ITC certain information relating to such determination. Requires the ITC, within 30 days of the Secretary's determination, to determine whether imports are a substantial cause of the serious injury, or threat of injury, found by the Secretary. Sets forth factors the ITC shall consider and investigate. Requires the ITC to report to the USTR the ITC's determination and the basis for such determination. Requires the ITC to recommend to the USTR the duty, import restrictions, or adjustment assistance necessary to remedy or prevent the injury. Prohibits another import relief investigation of the same subject matter until one year after the ITC's report to the USTR, unless the ITC determines there is good cause for another investigation. Requires the Secretary and the Secretary of Labor, upon the start of an import relief investigation, to begin negotiations with representatives of the affected domestic industry on an industry modernization agreement. Prohibits granting import relief unless an industry modernization agreement has been entered into and the National Commission on International Competitiveness has approved such agreement. Authorizes the USTR to waive the requirement of having such an agreement for six months if specified conditions are met. Requires the USTR to request certain proceedings under the GATT, if appropriate. Transfers from the President to the USTR certain duties relating to actions taken after import relief investigations. Reduces from 60 to 30 days the amount of time that may elapse between submission of a report recommending import relief and the determination of the method and amount of import relief to be granted.
