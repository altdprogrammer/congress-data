Rept. 99-902 (Part 1)) Nuclear Power Emergency Response Data System Act of 1986 - Establishes the Emergency Response Program within the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to provide the Commission with a data transmission system which will furnish the data needed for the Commission's emergency response functions. Requires that such system include automatic electronic data transmission for use in an emergency at a commercial nuclear power reactor. Declares such system to be the exclusive one for the United States. Requires the operator of certain licensed commercial nuclear reactors, upon declaration of emergency, to transmit data by automatic electronic means to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Operations Center. Requires the Commission to pay all costs associated with such data transmission functions. Establishes the Emergency Response Data System Fund to compensate the Commission for the operation and installation costs of such data transmission system at commercial nuclear power reactor sites."
