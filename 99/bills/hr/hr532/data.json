    "text": "National Agricultural Soil Protection Act of 1985 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into long-term contracts with producers to convert highly erodible land from crop use to soil conservation use (including haying, grazing, and wild living resource conservation). Provides producers with: (1) cash or in kind payments of between 50 and 80 percent of conservation conversion costs, limited to an annual maximum per-acre amount equal to the county's average per-acre land value; and (2) five to ten percent bonuses for conservation conversions in specially designated areas. Permits advance and installment payments. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide technical assistance; and (2) ensure that the amount of converted acreage in any county shall not cause adverse economic effects in such county. Makes any producer who breaches such a contract ineligible for other price support benefits for three years. Redesignates the existing position of Under Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs and Commodity Programs as the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs. Places the Foreign Agricultural Service and the Office of International Cooperation and Development under the direct supervision of such Assistant Secretary. Redesignates the existing position of Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources and Environment as the Under Secretary of Agriculture for Commodity Programs, Natural Resources, and Extension. Places the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, the Soil Conservation Service, the Forest Service, and the Extension Service under the direct supervision of such Under Secretary. Makes conforming amendments to the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 and other Federal laws."
