Rept. 99-229) Health Maintenance Organization Amendments of 1985 - Amends title XIII (Health Maintenance Organizations) of the Public Health Service Act to repeal provisions authorizing assistance for feasibility surveys, planning, and initial development of health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Limits initial operating loan assistance to entities with existing loan eligibility as of October 1, 1985. Eliminates loans and loan guarantees for the acquisition and construction of ambulatory care facilities. Limits the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to borrow through the loan guarantee fund to obligations made before October 1, 1985. Repeals the requirements for: (1) health system agency review of Federal support of HMO activities; (2) periodic demonstration of compliance with Federal requirements by HMO's; and (3) certain financial reports. Requires updates of the digest of State HMO laws to be made annually (presently required quarterly). Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1989 to meet the obligations of the loan fund. Includes organ transplants as part of the basic coverage if such transplants were required to be included in the basic health services on April 15, 1985."
