    "date": "1985-02-06", 
    "text": "InterLATA Telecommunications Competition Act of 1985 - Prohibits the Federal Communications Commission and any State from allowing rates charged to non-dominant interLATA carriers for access to local exchange telecommunication facilities (access charges) to exceed 45 percent of the rate charged to the dominant interLATA carrier for such access. Terminates such prohibition with respect to any LATA (local access and transport area) after the Commission finds that: (1) the dominant carrier does not possess monopoly power in originating interLATA service; and (2) equal access to substantially all end offices within the LATA is available to any non-dominant carrier through access tandems. Prohibits the Commission from deregulating the dominant interLATA carrier or permitting any such deregulation which took effect after January 1, 1984, to remain in effect, until 90 days after the Commission finds that such carrier does not possess monopoly power in providing interLATA service. Requires access charges to be increased as necessary to eliminate any shortfall in access charge revenue to any exchange carrier as a result of the implementation of this Act. Provides for the de novo judicial review of findings of the Commission under this Act."
