Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to provide for uniform tolerances of pesticide residues in food. Establishes an advisory panel. Directs the Administrator to: (1) actively participate in international efforts to develop improved pesticide research and regulatory programs; and (2) report annually to the Congress. Title XII: Agricultural Patent Reform - Agricultural Patent Reform Act - Amends the patent laws to extend the terms of patents which encompass specified products or methods for using a product, including methods of manufacturing which primarily use recombinant DNA technology or hybridoma technology, any of which are subject to certain nonpatent regulatory review periods. Sets forth the terms and conditions of such extension, including a five-year limitation on the extension and a 17-year maximum patent term from the earliest filing. Directs the Commissioner of Patents to notify the appropriate Federal agency upon receipt from the product sponsor of a notice of extension to determine the applicable regulatory review period and whether, within that period, the sponsor acted with due diligence.
