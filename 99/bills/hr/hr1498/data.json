    "text": "Selected Reserve Health Professionals Incentive Act of 1985 - Amends Federal law concerning health professions scholarships to include the possibility for such scholarships to members of the Selected Reserve of the armed forces (currently limited to active-duty personnel). Outlines the military service obligations, either active-duty or Selected Reserve, for members of the scholarship program. Increases the total number of persons authorized to be appointed to such program from 5,000 to 7,500. Authorizes the Secretary of a military department to pay a stipend to a reserve commissioned officer who is a health professional and who is participating in an internship, residency, or similar program of training in a civilian institution leading to qualification in a specialty. Limits the maximum amount of such stipend to $1,000 per month, with specified increases after FY 1986. Provides that any officer receiving such a stipend incurs a military service obligation in the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve to be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. Requires such officer to serve such military training as required. Provides for stipend refund or other military service for officers receiving stipends who fail to successfully complete the required program of training. Provides for credit for time served as a health profession specialist upon appointment as a commissioned officer in the armed forces or reserves. Provides for special pay for reserve medical officers in specified circumstances. Provides for special pay for health professionals of the reserve components (other than reserve medical officers) in specified circumstances. Provides for proficiency pay for enlisted members of the Selected Reserve engaged in health care specialties in specified circumstances. Provides for a signing bonus to reserve medical officers who sign written agreements to serve in the Ready Reserve for at least three years, with a higher bonus paid to those agreeing to serve in the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve. Requires bonus refund by an officer if the agreed-upon service period is not completed. Provides for continuation pay to reserve medical officers for each year of satisfactory service in the Selected Reserve or the Ready Reserve."
