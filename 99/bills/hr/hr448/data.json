    "text": "Provides that Federal supplemental unemployment compensation payments shall be made to any individual who was not eligible, with respect to the week beginning on September 12, 1982, for supplemental compensation under the Federal Supplemental Compensation Act of 1982 because the individual was not entitled to extended compensation under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 for a week which began on or after June 1, 1982, but who would have been entitled to such extended compensation for such week if such individual had: (1) chosen, on becoming unemployed, to receive retirement benefits available as part of a retirement program maintained (or contributed to) by a former employer; and (2) complied with all of the eligibility requirements of the applicable State unemployment compensation law while receiving such retirement benefits. Entitles such individual to such payments from funds appropriated for FY 1985 to carry out the program established by the Federal Supplemental Compensation Act of 1982. Makes the amount of such payments equal to the amount such individual would have received pursuant to such Act under the applicable State agreement (taking into consideration specified reductions) if the individual had been eligible for and had received such compensation throughout the maximum period for which payments were made in the applicable State to individuals who were the first individuals to receive compensation in that State under such Act. Provides that such amount shall be available to any such individual in a lump sum or, in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor, in weekly installments over a period not to exceed 14 weeks."
