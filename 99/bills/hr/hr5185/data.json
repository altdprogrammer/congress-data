    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Job Training Partnership Amendments of 1986 - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (the Act) to revise the definition of \"economically disadvantaged\" to base determinations under such definition on total family income over a 12-month, rather than six-month, period prior to application. Revises the designation of service delivery areas on the basis of their serving a substantial part of one or more labor market areas. Adds to purposes for which State education grants may be used, the provision of: (1) literacy training to youth and adults; (2) dropout prevention and reenrollment services to youth; and (3) a State-wide school-to-work transition program. Requires that specified portions of such funds be used for such purposes. Establishes an intrastate hold harmless allocation requirement. Allows service delivery areas to use specified funds for summer youth remedial education programs. Allows Governors or service delivery areas to use incentive grant funds to develop and implement a data collection system to track the post-program experience of participants. Permits summer youth programs to be offered in school vacation periods during nonsummer months under specified conditions. Prohibits requiring State matching grants under criteria for receipt of grants from the Secretary of Labor's discretionary funds. Includes under the definition of dislocated workers individuals who were self-employed (including farmers) and who are unemployed as a result of general economic conditions in the community in which they reside or because of natural disaster. Directs the Secretary to establishes categories of self-employed individuals and of economic conditions and natural disasters. Prohibits State and local taxation of Job Corps operations. Directs the Secretary to take into account both urban and rural areas in developing an annual statistical measure of labor market related economic hardship. Directs the Secretary to develop a means by which statistical data relating to permanent dislocation of farmers and ranchers due to farm and ranch failures can be collected and to collect such data. Directs the Secretary to publish an annual report based on such data. Requires the report to include a comparison with data used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and an analysis of whether farmers and ranchers are being adequately counted in such employment statistics."
