Limits the amount of such creditable service to the lesser of: (1) the aggregate period of such service performed by such employee before the effective date of this Act; or (2) ten years. Requires any civil service annuity which is computed based on such creditable service to be reduced by the portion of any State annuity or social security benefits received by the individual or his or her survivor on account of such service. Provides for the recomputation of any affected annuity or survivor annuity the commencement date of which occurred before the effective date of this Act."
