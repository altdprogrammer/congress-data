Directs the Commission to develop a Cultural Heritage Plan for the Corridor which sets its boundaries, inventories the historically significant property to be maintained, establishes standards, and develops an historic interpretation plan. Requires the Commission to implement the Plan, granting priority to preserving the Blackstone Canal, providing information for visitors, and encouraging private and intergovernmental cooperation in building restoration and appropriate land use. Terminates the Commission in five years with an up to five-year extension. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to help prepare the Plan and appropriate visitor information and displays, providing technical assistance to the Commission if requested. Requires the cooperation of other Federal agencies. Authorizes appropriations."
