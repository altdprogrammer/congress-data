    "text": "Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to permit any automobile manufacturer to elect to have any of its alternative-fuel-powered vehicles included in the average fuel economy calculated by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Requires such average fuel economy calculation to take into account the petroleum conservation resulting from the use of the alternative-fuel-powered vehicles involved. Defines \"alternative fuel\" as methanol, ethanol, methane, or other suitable motor fuel not derived from petroleum. Sets guidelines to determine the amount of fuel economy adjustment. Applies such adjustment to model years beginning after December 31, 1985. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe regulations regarding the fuel economy calculation adjustment."
