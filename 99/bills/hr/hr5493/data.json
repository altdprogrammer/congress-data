    "text": "Fine Collection and Enforcement Act of 1986 - Amends the Federal criminal code to set maximum criminal fines at: (1) the amount specified in the law setting forth the offense; (2) $250,000 ($500,000 for a person other than an individual) for a felony; (3) $250,000 ($500,000 for a person other than an individual) for a misdeameanor resulting in death; (4) $100,000 for any misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for more than six months; (5) double the gross gain or double the gross loss if the offense results in pecuniary gain to the offender or pecuniary loss to the victim; or (6) double the amount imposable for the most serious offense where more than one arises from a common scheme or plan. Directs the court to impose a fine or penalty only to the extent that it will not impair the defendant's ability to make restitution to the victim. Specifies additional matters to be considered in imposing fines. Provides for the collection and payment of fines and penalties. Sets forth additional fines for anyone who willfully does not pay an amount due: (1) $100,000, or twice the unpaid fine, whichever is greater, or imprisonment for at most one year, or both, in the case of an individual; or (2) $250,000, or twice the unpaid fine, whichever is greater, in the case of an person other than an individual. Requires the court, if a sentence of fine is stayed, to: (1) require the defendant to post bond or deposit, in the court's registry, an amount of fine that is due; or (2) restrain the defendant from transferring or dissipating assets."
