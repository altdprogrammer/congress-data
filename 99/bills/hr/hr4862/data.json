Establishes guidelines for procedures to be followed when an agency is required to notify a submitter that a request has been made for information designated (or treated) as exempt by the submitter. Describes circumstances in which an agency is not required to notify a submitter. Provides for de novo judicial review by a U.S. district court of an agency decision to withhold or disclose records. Directs the court to assess attorney's fees against a submitter where the submitter's reasons for withholding information were not substantially justified."
