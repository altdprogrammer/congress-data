    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a nonrefundable income tax credit for expenses incurred in the care of certain family members with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. Sets the amount of such credit at 30 percent of the expenses incurred for taxpayers with incomes of $25,000 or less. Reduces the rate of such credit, but not below 20 percent, by one percent for each $2,000 of adjusted gross income in excess of $25,000. Limits such credit to taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of less than $60,000. Imposes an aggregate limit of $20,000 on the amount of expenses which may be taken into account with a maximum of $10,000 per family member. Defines \"qualified family member\" as any individual who: (1) is related to the taxpayer by blood or marriage; and (2) is diagnosed by a physician as having senile dementia of the Alzheimer type or related organic brain disorders. Defines \"qualified care expenses\" as payments for: (1) home health agency services; (2) homemaker services; (3) adult day care; (4) respite care; or (5) certain health and equipment and supplies."
