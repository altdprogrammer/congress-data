Subjects the selected design and plans for the memorial to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, the Commission on Fine Arts, and the National Capital Planning Commission. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to select a site for the memorial and to be responsible for its maintenance upon construction. Prohibits the Secretary from permitting construction to commence until sufficient funds are available for completion of the memorial. Authorizes the American Battlements Commission to receive and then to disburse for the erection of the memorial funds received only from non-Federal sources. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years after September 30, 1986, for the establishment of the memorial. Directs any excess amount collected for the establishment of the memorial to offset appropriated funds. Terminates the authority to establish the memorial five years after the enactment of this Act, unless construction has begun during such period."
