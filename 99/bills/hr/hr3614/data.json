Lists the officers and employees of Federal agencies for whom such transportation may be provided. Authorizes such transportation for: (1) certain persons under the protection of the U.S. Secret Service; (2) certain Foreign Service officers; and (3) any officer or employee for whom it is determined that unusual circumstances present a clear and present danger, that an emergency exists, or that compelling operational considerations make such transportation essential to the conduct of official business. Requires that the House Committee on Government Operations and the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs be promptly notified of certain authorizations for home-to-work transportation. Directs the Administrator of General Services to promulgate regulations, not later than March 15, 1987, governing heads of Federal agencies in making determinations authorizing the use of Government vehicles. Requires each Federal agency to maintain recordkeeping to establish the official purpose of home-to-work transportation. Requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to transmit to the Congress appropriate recommendations concerning the transportation needs of the judicial branch."
