Sets forth administrative provisions relating to the membership and employees of the Board. Sets forth provisions governing the Board's evidence-gathering procedures. Requires the Board to determine whether: (1) there are reasonable grounds to believe the injury, loss of life, or property damage was security-related; and (2) there is reasonable cause to believe that a breach of duty by a U.S. employee contributed to such injury, loss of life, or destruction of property. Directs the Board to make recommendations to the Secretary on programs or operations subject to this Act which the Board has reviewed.
