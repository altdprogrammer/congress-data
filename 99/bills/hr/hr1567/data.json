Provides for a refund of duties paid on such alcohol or mixture upon proof that such alcohol or mixture was not and can no longer be used as a fuel or to produce the specified fuel mixtures. Allows the Secretary of the Treasury to establish refund procedures. Restricts application of this Act to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption after 15 days since this Act's enactment and before January 1, 1993."
