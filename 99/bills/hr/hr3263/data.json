Directs the Secretary of Education from specified sums appropriated under this Act and after consultation with the advisory committee established by this Act to make grants to or contracts with SEAs, LEAs, institutions of higher education, or other public and private agencies (including Indian tribes and organizations and Hawaiian native organizations) to assist them in carrying out authorized GTE programs or projects, including personnel or supervisory training. Sets forth authorized GTE programs and projects, including: (1) preservice and inservice training (including fellowships) for GTE personnel (including leadership personnel); (2) model projects and exemplary programs for identification and education, including summer programs and cooperative programs involving business, industry, and education; (3) strengthening SEA and higher education institutions' capability to provide leadership and assistance to LEAs and nonprofit private schools in planning, operating, and improving such programs; (4) technical assistance and information dissemination; (5) research on methods and techniques for identifying and teaching gifted and talented children and youth; (6) conducting program evaluations and surveys; and (7) developing information and analysis. Establishes the National Center for Research and Development in the Education of Gifted and Talented Children and Youth (the National Center) through grants or contracts with one or more higher education institutions or SEAs, or a consortium or combination of such institutions and agencies, to carry out clauses (5), (6), and (7) of the preceding paragraph. Requires the Director of the National Center to carry out such National Center functions as may be agreed upon through arrangements with other higher education institutions, SEAs, LEAs, or other public or private agencies and organizations. Limits to 30 percent of the funds for authorized programs and projects that portion which may be used to conduct activities pursuant to provisions relating to the National Center and its research, evaluation, and information functions. Directs the Secretary and the advisory committee established by this Act, in administering this Act, to give highest priority to programs for: (1) identifying and educating gifted and talented children and youth who may not be identified through traditional assessment measures (such as the limited-English speaking, economically disadvantaged, handicapped, and women); and (2) developing or improving the capability of schools in an entire State or region of the Nation, through cooperative efforts and participation of SEAs, LEAs, higher education institutions, and other public and private agencies and organizations (including business, industry, and labor) to identify and educate gifted and talented children and youth. Sets forth provisions relating to participation of private school children and teachers in programs under this Act. Directs the Secretary to appoint an advisory committee on GTE, with members representative of State education agencies, teacher education institutions, researchers, teachers, and parents. Directs the Secretary to establish or designate an administrative unit within the Department of Education to: (1) administer the programs authorized by this Act; (2) coordinate all GTE programs that the Department administers; and (3) serve as a focal point for national leadership and information on the educational needs of gifted and talented children and youth and the availability of services and programs to meet those needs. Requires that such administrative unit be headed by a person of recognized professional qualifications and experience in GTE. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1991."
