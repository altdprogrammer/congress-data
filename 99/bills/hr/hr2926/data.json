Revises capital to adjusted total asset ratio requirements for such qualified institutions. Amends the Farm Credit Act of 1971 to permit the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration to temporarily: (1) reduce the capital requirements of a bank or association; and (2) provide capital worth certificates as partial payment for the purchase of foreclosed farmland or farmland mortgages. Amends the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 to extend the Net Worth Certificate Act by three years."
