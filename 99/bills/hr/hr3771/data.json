Directs the Board to: (1) determine and publish in the Federal Register the real dollar value for each business day; (2) transmit such value to the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the International Monetary Fund; (3) prepare and transmit to the President, the Congress, the Federal Reserve Board, and other appropriate agencies a quarterly short-term report and an annual long-term report on monetary policy to bring the value of the dollar in the foreign currency exchange markets into line with the real value of the dollar; and (4) make recommendations to the President on items to be included in the agenda of any international economic conference, including a recommendation that the President urge major U.S. trading partners to establish currency evaluation boards. Terminates the Board on December 31, 1994."
