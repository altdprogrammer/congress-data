    "text": "Soil Conservation Act of 1985 - Makes any person who cultivates crops on highly erodible land ineligible as to those crops for: (1) price supports or payments; (2) farm storage facility loans; (3) crop insurance; (4) disaster payments; or (5) specified other agricultural loans. Exempts crops planted: (1) on land cultivated from 1976 through 1985; (2) before enactment of this Act; (3) under specified conservation systems; or (4) in reliance on a Soil Conservation Service determination that such land was not highly erodible. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to complete certain soil capability surveys as soon as practicable. Directs the Secretary to establish a conservation reserve program to assist producers in conserving soil and water resources on highly erodible land. Directs the Secretary through FY 1990 to enter into long-term (ten years or more) contracts under which the Secretary shall pay an annual fee, share conservation costs, and provide technical assistance in return for converting such cropland into less intensive use such as pasture, permanent grass, or trees. Limits annual payments to any one person to $50,000. Directs the Secretary to provide safeguards to protect the interests of tenants and sharecroppers. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out such program through the Commodity Credit Corporation. Authorizes appropriations."
