Increases the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses and for children, as well as the rates of supplemental dependency and indemnity compensation for children. Title II: Veterans' Job Training Amendments - Amends the Emergency Veterans' Job Training Act of 1983 to change the title to the Veterans' Job Training Act. Increases the eligibility of certain veterans to job training programs under such Act by lowering the required pre-application period of unemployment to ten of the last 15 weeks (currently, 15 of the previous 20 weeks). Directs the Secretary of Labor to provide for a program in which periodic contact is maintained with veterans participating in job training programs, and in which counseling services are provided in appropriate situations. Extends through FY 1986 the authorization of appropriations under such Act and makes such sums available through September 30, 1988. Extends the time periods authorized for starting and completing such programs. Provides for the payment to employers of funds for veterans' job training assistance in certain circumstances and upon proper application. Directs the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to take all feasible steps to establish and encourage the development of job training opportunities which are consistent with the purposes of the Veterans' Job Training Act. Directs the Administrator to ensure that, in appropriate cases, payments are made to employers on behalf of veterans for the purpose of job training assistance."
