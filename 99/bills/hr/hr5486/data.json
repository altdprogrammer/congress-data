    "text": "Information Dissemination and Research Accountability Act - Establishes in the National Library of Medicine a National Center for Research Accountability to assist in eliminating duplication of effort in Federal research proposals involving live animals. Directs the President to appoint as members of the Center 20 experts in the biomedical information sciences who are currently employed by a Federal agency in a capacity which qualifies them to make determinations as to whether research proposals involving live animals are duplicative of other research efforts. Sets forth provisions for a Director of the Center. Prohibits Federal agencies from carrying out or funding any research proposal involving live animals unless the proposal is submitted to the Center following agency approval. Prohibits Federal funding of any such proposal which the Center determines would duplicate other research completed or in process. Authorizes the Center to contract with private entities to assist in the conduct of comprehensive full-text literature searches. Directs the President to establish rules to preclude any conflict of interest in the awarding of such contracts. Authorizes the President to appoint uncompensated advisors to the Members of the Center. Directs the Center to report annually to the President and the Congress. Provides for modernization of biomedical information storage and dissemination by the National Library of Medicine. Directs the Library to: (1) acquire, in full-text form, all biomedical information owned or available for use by Federal agencies (except information already in the Library or classified for national security reasons); (2) transcribe and store in full-text all such information acquired by the Library after January 1, 1960; (3) translate into English all foreign-language biomedical information owned or used by the Library; (4) make available through modern technologies, at cost, to medical libraries all full-text biomedical information in its collection; (5) support, by grants and contracts, the creation of new information for teaching and demonstrations, including audiovisual aids and computer graphics technologies; (6) make available, at cost, such new information to research and teaching institutions; and (7) increase the number of persons trained in modern methods of biomedical information storage and dissemination technologies by making available stipends, awards, and grants to persons engaged in such training. Provides that the cost to those requesting such biomedical or such teaching and demonstration information shall include the Federal expenses incurred in acquiring and making it available. Authorizes the Library to award contracts to the private-sector data recording industry to improve: (1) the development of technologies for storage and dissemination of full-text biomedical information; and (2) dissemination of such information to medical libraries for research use. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to appoint uncompensated advisors to the Library for purposes of this Act. Requires the Library to report annually to the Congress on its progress. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 and thereafter."
