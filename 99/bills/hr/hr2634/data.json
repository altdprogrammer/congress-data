Prohibits the President from using the authorities of any law to impose a trade embargo or any other restrictions on trade between the United States and Nicaragua for foreign policy reasons unless the Congress enacts legislation expressly authorizing the President to take such action. Terminates the embargo on trade with Nicaragua established by the President on May 1, 1985, and any other embargo or trade restriction in effect on the date of enactment of this Act."
