Requires that jobs created under this Act be given to certain furloughed maintenance employees, other unemployed railroad workers, and individuals registered on State unemployment rolls, in that order. Directs the Secretary to establish regulations to govern such projects. Authorizes appropriations and sets forth project eligibility requirements. Requires the Secretary to make periodic reports to the Congress and the President on actions taken under this Act, including statements on progress made in reducing unemployment and in improving rail transportation systems. Exempts such projects from the interlocking directorate provisions of the Clayton Act."
