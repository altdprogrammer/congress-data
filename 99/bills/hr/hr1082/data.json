    "text": "Omnibus Intelligence and Security Improvements Act - Title I: Recurring Intelligence Authorization Provision Codification Act - Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to require the Director of Central Intelligence or the Secretary of Defense to notify the appropriate congressional committees of any intent to spend funds in excess of authorization. Prohibits reprogramming or funds transfers except for unforeseen higher priority intelligence activities. Prohibits funds for any activity for which funds were requested and denied by Congress. Title II: Intelligence or Law Enforcement Defense Pretrial Notification Act - Amends the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to require a defendant to give notice prior to trial if he intends to claim in his defense that he was, or believed he was, acting on behalf of a Federal law enforcement or intelligence agency at the time of the alleged offense. Title III: Counterintelligence Investigation Improvements Act - Amends the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 to give the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) access to financial records for counterintelligence investigations. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to give the FBI access to the tax returns and return information of agents of foreign powers. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to allow the Secretary of State to deny to any member of a foreign mission travel within the United States to areas in which there exists: (1) a substantial concentration of high-technology industry; and (2) any industry relating to militarily critical technologies. Provides for waiver of such prohibition for any such travel certified by the FBI Director as consistent with U.S. national security interests. Title IV: Federal Employee Unauthorized Disclosure of Classified Information Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to make it an offense for a Federal employee to intentionally disclose classified information without authorization. Provides for a fine of $15,000 or imprisonment for not more than three years, or both. Title V: Federal Polygraph and Prepublication Review Limitation Act - Prohibits any executive agency or military department, except in the case of law enforcement or intelligence activities, to require or request any person occupying, applying for, or under consideration for a position in the civil service or the uniformed service to submit to a polygraph examination or enter into an agreement requiring prepublication review. Title VI: Espionage and Treason Capital Punishment Procedures Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criteria for the imposition of the death penalty for treason and espionage. Title VII: Foreign Intelligence Source Improvement Act - Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to permit the President to naturalize a maximum of five persons per year admitted for permanent residence under the Act because of their contributions to the security of the United States. Title VIII: Intelligence Identities Protection-Related Amendments - Terminates the Federal annuity benefits of a Federal employee convicted of certain national security crimes. Amends the Federal criminal code to include certain national security crimes investigations within the provision for court orders for the interception of wire or oral communications. Title IX: Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments - Amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to extend to 48 hours the period during which emergency foreign intelligence electronic surveillance may be conducted on the authority of the Attorney General. Permits retention and dissemination of communications constituting threats of death or serious bodily harm overheard while conducting electronic testing, training, or security countermeasures in accordance with such Act. Title X: Congressional Security Survey Act - Requires the Director of the FBI to conduct a study of the personnel, physical, and document and communications security arrangements relating to classified information possessed by the legislative branch. Directs all Federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities to assist the FBI in such survey."
