    "text": "Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to authorize the Commissioner of the Administration on Aging to establish a grant program to reimburse institutions of higher education for a portion of the tuition costs, or costs of individual courses of study, of eligible older persons at such institutions. Sets forth assurances to be contained in grant applications by such institutions. Provides that the U.S. courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction to affirm or to set aside a decision of the Commissioner. States that any older person who is qualified to enroll at an institution receiving reimbursements shall be eligible for such enrollment without being required to defray study or tuition costs. Entitles any institution, upon approval of its application, to receive reimbursements equal to 55 percent of the cost of tuition or study of such an eligible older person. States that reimbursements shall be made only for those students who constitute a greater number than those enrolled in 1980 who would have been eligible for benefits if the program were available."
