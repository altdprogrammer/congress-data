Requires the institution to forgive the borrower an amount (not to exceed 50 percent cumulative) equal to the amount treated as a loss. Authorizes the FCS to pay an institution one-half of the imputed interest on the portion of the loan being treated as a loss. Prohibits such renegotiations after December 31, 1990."
