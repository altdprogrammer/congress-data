    "text": "Makes it an offense for any Federal officer or employee or member of the armed forces, knowing that he or she has AIDS, an AIDS-related condition, or having been reliably informed that he or she has been found to have HTLV-III LAV antibodies, to knowingly transfer or attempt to transfer any of his or her bodily fluid to another individual: (1) while employed as such an officer, employee, or member; or (2) in any Federal facility. Requires anyone convicted of such offense to be quarantined for five years under supervision of the Public Health Service or until there is a cure, whichever occurs first. Defines \"bodily fluid\" and \"transfer.\" Creates as an affirmative defense for anyone charged with such offense proof that: (1) the use of a condom prevented the transfer of bodily fluids, after consent following full disclosure of the risk; or (2) that such transfer occurred after advice from a physician that he or she was noninfectious. Limits consent or previous AIDS infection of the transferee as a defense."
