    "text": "Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to declare that the lawfulness of acts of importation into, or sale in, the United States of articles that infringe a valid U.S. patent, copyright, trademark, or mask work shall be determined without regard to whether such acts have the effect or tendency to destroy or substantially injure a U.S. industry or to impair the establishment of an industry. Permits any person to petition the International Trade Commission (ITC) for the issuance of an order to exclude such articles, during its investigation, from entry into the United States. Sets forth: (1) civil penalties for violations under this Act; and (2) procedures for the modification or recission of an ITC order under this Act. Repeals a specified section of the Tariff Act of 1930 relating to the importation of products produced under a process covered by claims of an unexpired patent."
