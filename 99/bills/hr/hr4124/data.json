    "text": "Amends the Indian Education Act to authorize the Secretary of Education to make grants to, or enter into contracts with, specified Hawaiian organizations which primarily serve and benefit Hawaiian natives for the purpose of preparing individuals for teaching or administering special projects and programs designed to meet the special educational needs of Hawaiian natives, providing in-service training for persons teaching in such programs, and providing fellowships to such natives for study in graduate and professional programs at institutions of higher education. Renames the Office of Indian Education (within the Department of Education) as the Office of Native American Education. Redefines \"Native American\" (for purposes of such Act and specified other education-related Acts) to include any Hawaiian native. Amends the Indian Elementary and Secondary School Assistance Act to authorize the Secretary to make grants to, or to enter into contracts with, local educational agencies which primarily serve the educational needs of Hawaiian natives. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to make technical and conforming amendments. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to, or enter into contracts with, organizations which primarily serve Hawaiian natives for the purpose of providing pilot and demonstration programs for improving educational opportunities for such natives. Amends the Adult Education Act to authorize the Secretary to make grants to, or enter into contracts with, organizations primarily serving Hawaiian natives with respect to the improvement of educational opportunities for Hawaiian native adults."
