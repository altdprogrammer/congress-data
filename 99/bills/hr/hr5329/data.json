Requires the President to submit to the Congress an annual list, based on such determination, of countries that are uncooperative drug source nations. Denies to uncooperative drug source nations: (1) nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored nation treatment); or (2) preferential tariff treatment. Terminates such sanctions against a country designated as an uncooperative drug source nation if the President considers that such country has made significant progress and will continue to make progress in changing its narcotics control programs."
