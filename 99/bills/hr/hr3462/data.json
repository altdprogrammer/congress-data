Permits the transmittal of alternate budget proposals which, if implemented, would result in a deficit or surplus if the President determines that a balanced budget is inappropriate for any fiscal year. Requires that any such alternate budget proposals for a fiscal year include a comprehensive plan to balance the Federal budget. Requires the Committee on the Budget of each House to report by April 15 of every year a balanced budget for the upcoming fiscal year. Requires the Committee on the Budget of either House also to report a comprehensive plan to balance the Federal budget, if it determines that a balanced budget is inappropriate for any fiscal year."
