    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1986-03-25", 
    "text": "High Technology Trade Promotion Act - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to permit the reexport without prior U.S. approval of goods or technology subject to national security export controls from countries that maintain export controls pursuant to the agreement of the group known as the Coordinating Committee on Export Controls (CoCom). Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) to require prior U.S. approval for the export or reexport of such goods or technology to certain end users. Authorizes the Secretary to require any person exporting or reexporting any such goods or technology otherwise subject to national security export controls to notify the Department of Commerce of those exports. Directs the President to appoint a person representing the U.S. electronic industry to the U.S. delegation to the CoCom. Directs the Secretary to make a foreign availability determination with respect to goods or technology subject to national security export controls on the Secretary's own initiative or upon receipt of an allegation from an exporter or a representative of exporters that such availability exists. Provides for publication of notice of receipt of such allegation or of the start of such investigation. Prohibits requiring a validated license for the export of such goods or technology at the end of the four months following the publication of such notice or receipt of such allegation unless: (1) the Secretary determines that foreign availability of such goods or technology does not exist; or (2) the President has eliminated any foreign availability. Requires the President to pursue negotiations to eliminate the foreign availability of such goods or technology whenever the President determines, with respect to the start of an investigation of foreign availability, that it is in the U.S. national security interest to eliminate such foreign availability. Deletes the provision which permits the President to extend the negotiation period if certain conditions are met. Changes the standard for determining foreign availability of goods and technology covered by national security export controls from the foreign availability of such goods or technology of \"comparable quality\" to the foreign availability of such goods and technology of \"sufficient quality.\" Prohibits the number of representatives of U.S. industry on the technical advisory committees established to advise the Secretary on exports of such goods and technology from being less than the number of representatives of specified executive departments. Provides for the publication of the minutes of the meetings of such committees."
