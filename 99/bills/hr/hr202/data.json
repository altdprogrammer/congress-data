Requires as responsibilities of the Office the following: (1) annually identifying Federal and State research programs relating to the Great Lakes system; (2) establishing a Great Lakes research exchange; (3) identifying priority Great Lakes research needs; (4) conducting appropriate current Great Lakes research and monitoring activities; (5) establishing a Great Lakes water quality monitoring system, with specific emphasis on toxic pollutant levels; (6) developing the long term, comprehensive environmental, resource, and economic data bases required for assessing impacts of proposed decisions on the environmental health, productivity, and economic well-being of the Great Lakes; (7) conducting an inventory of all State, Federal, and international agencies with management responsibilities for the Great Lakes system, and updating such information annually; (8) identifying priority management needs to protect and rehabilitate the Great Lakes and their resources, and developing management plans where needed; (9) developing an annual report on the state of the Great Lakes; (10) actively promoting the adoption and execution of the management and rehabilitation plans; (11) serving as the source of issues which the Federal Government refers to the International Joint Commission for study; and (12) hosting a meeting (not less often than annually) for officials of State and Federal agencies involved with the Great Lakes. Requires the Administrator, in the agency's annual budget submission to Congress, to include a funding request for the Office as a separate budget line item. Allows the Administrator to provide financial assistance in the form of grants or contracts for research, monitoring, and planning projects and activities necessary to address Great Lakes priorities. Allows any person, higher education institution, or Federal, State, or local agency or department to apply for such assistance. Requires the Administrator to act upon each grant or contract application within six months of its receipt. Permits the grant to cover, in the discretion of the Administrator, up to 100 percent of the total project cost. Directs the head of each department or agency of the Federal Government which is in any way connected with the enhancement of the Great Lakes to: (1) cooperate fully with the Administrator and the Director; (2) make available such personnel, services, or facilities as may be necessary to assist the Administrator or Director in their purpose; and (3) furnish, upon written request, such data or information deemed necessary by the Administrator or the Director. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Chief of Engineers of the Army, the Chief of the Soil Conservation Service, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service to each submit annual reports to the Administrator regarding their efforts to comply with the Water Quality Agreement of 1978 and with recommendations made by the Office. States that this Act does not affect the jurisdiction or powers of any Federal or State department or agency or international bodies created by treaty with authority relating to the Great Lakes. Authorizes appropriations to the Administration for FY 1986 through 1990."
