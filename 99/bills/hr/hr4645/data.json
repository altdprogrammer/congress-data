    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1986-10-17", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Title I: Cugahoga Valley National Recreation Area - Modifies the boundaries of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area, Ohio. Prohibits the fee title acquisition of certain lands, allowing only the acquisition of scenic easements unless consented to by the owner. Title II: National Park System Fees - Requires the Director of the National Park Service to prepare a resources management plan as a component of each general management plan for each unit of the National Park System. Includes natural and cultural resources in such plan. Provides funding for matching grants to organizations for research, monitoring, and management of system resources. Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to charge new fees and increase certain existing fees for admission into units of the National Park System. Exempts urban, outdoor recreation areas from such fees. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the fee proposed for each unit of the System. Requires that all fees collected be expended for National Park System operations, through FY 1991. Provides that beginning in FY 1992 such fees shall be credited to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Sets forth the priorities under which such fees shall be distributed. Prohibits the Secretary from charging admission fees at the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, Hawaii. Title III: Federal Onshore Competitive Oil and Gas Leasing Act of 1986 - Federal Onshore Competitive Oil and Gas Leasing Act of 1986 - Amends Federal law regarding competitive leasing of oil and gas for onshore Federal lands to increase from 640 acres to 2,560 acres the units of land open to competitive leasing. Provides for lease sales to be: (1) conducted by oral bidding or by a combination of oral and sealed bidding; and (2) held at least quarterly in each State (or more frequently at the Secretary's discretion). Requires the Secretary of the Interior to accept the highest bid which is at least $20 or greater per acre without evaluation of the economic or geologic value of the lands proposed for lease. Requires that all bids for less than $20 per acre be rejected. Makes lands available for leasing for a one-year period if the highest bid received for such lands was less than $20 per acre. Describes circumstances under which certain lands may be leased without competitive bidding. Authorizes the Secretary to disapprove partial assignments of less than 640 acres outside of Alaska, or of less than 2,560 acres within Alaska. Subjects a lease to cancellation by the Secretary after 30 days' notice for noncompliance with the lease terms unless: (1) the leasehold contains a well capable of production of oil or gas in paying quantities; or (2) the lease is committed to an approved cooperative or unit plan or communitization agreement which contains a well capable of production of unitized substances in paying quantities. Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to make leasing in Alaska consistent with that in the contiguous 48 States. Repeals provisions regarding: (1) determination of favorable petroleum geological provinces; and (2) suspension of noncompetitive leasing. Establishes an interim period during which certain pending lease applications will be processed as they would have been prior to the date of enactment of this Act. Prohibits noncompetitive lease applications for specified lands from being processed until such lands are posted for competitive bidding in accordance with this Act. Requires the Secretary to hold at least one competitive lease sale for tracts which but for this Act would have been posted for the filing of simultaneous oil and gas lease applications. Permits the inclusion in such sale of certain tracts which had over-the-counter noncompetitive oil and gas lease offers. Imposes civil penalties upon persons who willfully and knowingly misrepresent the value of lands and leases under this Act. Grants to the States concurrent civil and criminal jurisdiction for violations of this Act. Title IV: American Conservation Corps Act of 1986 - Establishes the American Conservation Corps. Directs the Secretaries of the Interior and of Agriculture to promulgate regulations to implement such Corps. Sets forth the scope of projects the Corps may carry out, including conservation of wildlife habitat, energy conservation, fire prevention, and road maintenance. Limits projects to public or Indian lands unless public benefit can be documented. Specifies that State agencies or Indian tribes may apply for participation in the program. Requires the appropriate State Job Training Coordinating Council to comment on each proposed project. Requires applications to describe program goals, specify the numbers of enrollees necessary, and the kinds of facilities and equipment necessary. Authorizes the Secretaries of the Interior, Labor, and Agriculture to jointly develop regulations for joint projects, including funding under this Act and funding under the Job Training Partnership Act. Authorizes agreements with the Secretary of Defense to assist the military with projects under this Act. Limits enrollment in the Corps to unemployed U.S. citizens or nationals between the ages of 16 and 25, with special emphasis on the economically or educationally disadvantaged. Sets forth special rules for programs limited to the summer months. Requires program directors to establish and enforce standards of conduct. Requires program agencies to provides necessary facilities and services. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior and of Agriculture to provide such services and facilities, including surplus food and equipment. Requires enrollees to pay for room and board. States that enrollees are not Federal employees except for workman's compensation purposes. Permits the use of volunteers for carrying out this Act if a program agency already has the authority to use volunteer services, including the Tennessee Valley Authority. Sets forth rates of pay and stipends. Directs the Secretaries and the Chiefs of the program agencies to coordinate activities under this Act with related activities. Requires the Secretaries to provide guidance in securing academic credit or skills certification for program enrollees. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to evaluate the conduct of the program. Directs such Secretary to study and report to the Congress on Civilian Conservation Corps sites to select a site to commemorate such Corp. Provides limited funds for academic study by enrollees during nonworking hours. Requires program agencies to provide job guidance and placement. Directs the Secretaries to report annually to the Congress on this Act's activities. Requires the Secretary of Labor to make labor market information available to such Secretaries and the program agencies.
