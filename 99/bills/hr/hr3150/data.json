Makes an exception for those practices regulated by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Requires such an organization to register with the Comptroller General not later than 30 days after engaging in lobbying activities to disclose its identification and the identification of any persons or entities retained to make lobbying communications. Requires an organization to notify the Comptroller General when it will no longer engage in such activities. Requires each registered organization to maintain records necessary to make quarterly reports to the Comptroller General. Requires such reports to include the following information: (1) total expenditures and their purposes; (2) identification of retainees and employees who made lobbying communications; (3) issues on which were spent a significant amount of effort; (4) descriptions of certain written solicitations; (5) disclosure of the business relationship with any Federal officer or employee; and (6) a statement of any lobby communication made on the floor of the House of Representatives or Senate. Requires the report which covers the fourth quarter of a calendar year to include information on the receipt of dues or contributions. Specifies the duties of the Comptroller General including: (1) developing filing, coding, and cross-indexing systems for registrations and reports; and (2) making copies of registrations, reports, and summarized information available for public inspection. Makes it the duty of the Attorney General to enforce provisions of this Act. Directs the Comptroller General to report to the President and the Congress by March 31 annually regarding activities in carrying out this Act. Subjects rules or regulations promulgated under this Act to the congressional veto procedure. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Repeals the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1985 through 1987."
