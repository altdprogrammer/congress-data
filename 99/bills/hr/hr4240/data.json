Declares the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands to be States for purposes of emergency relief assistance eligibility. Imposes a $5,000,000 annual limitation upon such emergency relief funding for the territories collectively. Makes such eligibility retroactive to April 15, 1983.
