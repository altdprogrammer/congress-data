Permits such claims to be converted to a lease under the Act if there has been substantial compliance with the requisite annual assessment work. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to cancel certain non-complying claims, and to provide compensation for such claims equal to the amount that can be demonstrated as expended for assessment and development work."
