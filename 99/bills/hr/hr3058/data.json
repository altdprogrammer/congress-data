    "text": "Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to collect fees for the costs incurred by the U.S. Customs Service for the processing of persons, aircraft, vehicles (including cars, trucks, and trains), vessels (including yachts and pleasure boats), and merchandise (including mail) arriving in or departing from the United States. Authorizes the Secretary, under specified conditions, to provide exemptions from such fees. Changes the percentage of customs duties that are not to be refunded with respect to drawbacks (refunds) on imported merchandise that is used in the production of U.S. goods and merchandise that does not conform to sample or specifications, and that are subsequently exported from the United States. Requires such percentage to be retained for reimbursement to the Customs Service appropriation. Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to provide that the National Railroad Passenger Corporation shall be obligated to pay to any Federal agency the costs related to customs services that are incurred by such agency in connection with services performed by the Corporation. Amends the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 to provide for conforming amendments with this Act with respect to the compensation and the expenses of Customs Service employees who perform customs services during overtime. Repeals certain provisions of the Act relating to fees to cover costs for customs services performed by Customs Service employees."
