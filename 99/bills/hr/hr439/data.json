    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Amends the judicial code to require an administrative body to notify the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation if administrative review petitions regarding the same order are filed in multiple appellate courts within ten days after its issuance. Directs such panel to: (1) designate by random selection one appellate court from among those in which review petitions have been instituted; and (2) consolidate all review petitions in such designated court. Requires the appropriate administrative body to file the record in the designated court. Directs an administrative body to file the record in only one court of appeals if the review petition was received for only one court within ten days after the contested order's issuance. Directs an administrative body to file the record in the court in which review petitions were first instituted if petitions regarding the same order were instituted in multiple appellate courts after the initial ten days of the issuance of an order. Requires the courts to transfer all review proceedings regarding the same order to the court designated by the judicial panel. Provides that U.S. Claims Court judges shall continue in office after their 15-year term if reappointed or until a successor takes office. Provides that such judges shall be paid the same salary as U.S. Tax Court judges. Repeals a provision of Federal law which prohibits the use of appropriated funds to increase the salaries of Federal judges without specific authorization by Act of Congress. Waives the application, to Nabil Yaldo, of certain restrictions of the Immigration and Nationality Act on approving petitions for immigrant status. Authorizes the granting of a visa and admission to the United States for permanent residence to Hyong Cha Kim Kay."
