Revises the effect of modifications to plan coverage. Revises the maximum period of continuation coverage. Establishes a grace period for payment of premiums. Provides for termination of continuation coverage upon coverage by another group health plan rather than upon reemployment or remarriage. Entitles each qualified beneficiary to make a separate selection if there is a choice among types of coverage under the plan. Adds a deadline to a certain notice requirement. Revises the definition of group health plan."
