Establishes within the Treasury the Trade Adjustment Assistance Trust Fund which shall be used to provide adjustment assistance for workers. Directs the President to undertake negotiations to change the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) so that a country may impose a small uniform duty on all imports in order to fund a program which assists the workers of that country to adjust to import competition. Imposes an import surcharge on all imports at a uniform rate determined by the President to be in accordance with the GATT and to be sufficient to fund the trade adjustment assistance program for workers. Requires the fees collected from such surcharge to be deposited in the Trade Adjustment Assistance Trust Fund."
