    "text": "(Senate receded and concurred with House amendment with an amendment) Energy Policy and Conservation Amendments Act of 1985 - Title I: Amendments to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to extend from June 30, 1985, to June 30, 1989: (1) the authority granted under the Act regarding domestic energy supply availability including the strategic petroleum reserve (SPR); and (2) the authority for materials allocation granted under the Defense Production Act of 1950. Prohibits any amendment to the SPR Plan transmitted to the Congress by the Secretary of Energy from becoming effective until 60 days after transmittal, unless the President determines that such amendment is required by a severe energy supply interruption or by Federal obligation under the international energy program. Repeals the concurrent resolution congressional review requirements regarding a presidential decision to stop filling the SPR and to continue selling Naval Petroleum Reserve oil. Provides that such a presidential decision may become effective on the date the Congress is notified and shall terminate by nine months later. Directs the Secretary to implement a test drawdown and distribution of about 1,100,000 barrels of crude oil from the SPR in order to evaluate the implementation of the SPR Plan. Requires that any modification of the Plan be transmitted to the Congress within 15 calendar days prior to the offering of any crude oil for sale under this Act. Requires that at least part of the crude oil be sold to or exchanged with non-Federal governmental entities. Prohibits the Secretary from selling any crude oil under this Act at less than 90 percent of the sales price of the comparable crude oil being sold in the same area at the time. Requires the Secretary to acquire crude oil for the Reserve in the same amount as the total amount of crude oil sold pursuant to the test drawdown and distribution. Requires the Secretary to transmit to the Congress a detailed explanation of any test implemented under this Act. Extends all standby energy authorities with respect to the International Energy Program through June 30, 1988. Terminates all other general emergency authorities at midnight, June 30, 1985. Sets forth congressional veto procedures for any plan of action by the U.S. Attorney General for an international energy emergency whereunder normal business transactions (Type I transactions as defined in the International Energy Agency Emergency Management Manual) would be afforded defenses to antitrust and breach of contract actions, even though such normal business transactions are neither approved by the International Energy Agency nor mandated by the U.S. Government. Requires submission to the Congress of any such proposed new plan of action. Permits such proposal to take effect if the Congress fails to enact a joint resolution of disapproval within 90 days after submission. Title II: Reports Concerning Coal Imports - National Coal Imports Reporting Act of 1985 - Requires the Secretary of Energy, through the Energy Information Administration, to: (1) provide quarterly reports and annual summaries to the Congress regarding the status of United States coal imports; and (2) report to the Congress regarding the findings of a comprehensive analysis of the coal import market in the United States. Details the contents of the quarterly reports and the comprehensive analysis."
