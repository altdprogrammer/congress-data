    "text": "War Resisters Exoneration Act of 1983 - Grants general amnesty to persons who violated certain laws between August 4, 1964, and the date of enactment of this Act, including laws with respect to: (1) draft evasion; (2) abetting draft evasion; (3) draft card destruction; (4) refusing induction into the armed forces; (5) desertion; (6) abetting desertion; (7) using contemptuous words against specified governmental officials while a commissioned officer; and (8) causing or attempting to cause disloyalty or mutiny by any member of the armed forces. States that the effect of the amnesty shall be to nullify all legal consequences of any such violation. Establishes an Amnesty Commission and directs the Commission to grant amnesty to any person who, between August 5, 1964, and the date of enactment of this Act, violated any Federal law not enumerated in this Act or any State or local law if it finds that: (1) such violation was in substantial part motivated by the individual's opposition to United States involvement in Indochina; and (2) the individual was not personally responsible for any significant property damage or substantial personal injury to others. Directs the Commission to grant amnesty to any person whose violation of law resulted in such damage or injury if it finds the violation was justifiable on the basis of a deeply held moral or ethical belief. Authorizes appropriations."
