Allows the governing body of the Tribe to spend the principal, interest, and dividends for economic and community development of the Tribe. Requires $100,000 to be paid the heads of households residing and owning improvements at the Tat Momoli village in 1969 or their heirs. Provides that the Secretary of the Interior shall not be responsible for the review, approval, or audit of the use and expenditure of such sums, nor shall he be liable for claims that arise from such use and expenditure by such Tribe. Authorizes appropriations. Conditions the Secretary of the Interior's obligation to carry out functions under this Act upon tribal waiver of certain claims against the United States and the grant of appropriate rights with respect to the construction of the Tat Momolikot Dam.
