    "text": "Amends the copyright law to alter the provisions concerning the limitation of exclusive rights concerning secondary transmissions. Permits the reception of signals by means of the direct reception of a free space radio wave. Permits secondary transmission by a cable system to the public of a primary transmission made by a licensed station if: (1) the cable system serves fewer than 2500 subscribers; or (2) the cable system is located within the local service area of the primary transmitter and the cable system has a maximum capacity of 12 stations; or (3) the cable system is located in whole or in part within the local service area of the primary transmitter and the cable system provides as minimal service all the signals of every broadcast television station within that area; or (4) the primary transmission is of a network television station and the cable system is not located in whole or in part within the local service area of an affiliate and the transmission is from the most proximate network television station affiliated with the same network. Prohibits changes in such transmissions, except as specified. Eliminates compulsory licensing for such transmissions. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from regulating secondary transmissions of programs originated by a broadcast station."
