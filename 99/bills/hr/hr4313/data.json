Prohibits beginning a development stage until such an authorization and appropriation takes place. Outlines information to be included in a development stage funding request from the Secretary of Defense to the Congress. Requires notification to the Congress and suspension of appropriated funds if the Secretary concerned determines that there is a significant adverse system change while carrying out a development stage for which funding has been approved. Terminates such suspension of funding after 45 days. Defines \"significant adverse system change.\" Authorizes the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary concerned to change the current baseline description and cost of a major defense acquisition program after the Congress authorizes and appropriates funds for the development stage of such a program. Requires such Secretary to notify the Senate and House Armed Services Committees of any such changes not later than ten days after such a change is made."
