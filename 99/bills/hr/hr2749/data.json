Describes risk assessment as the use of factual bases to quantify the effects of exposure to potentially hazardous materials and situations. Directs the President to designate an appropriate scientific advisory agency to coordinate the projects. Directs such agency to submit a report to the Congress which includes: (1) a review of the risk assessments presently being carried out in Federal agencies; (2) recommendations for sharing research results among Federal agencies; (3) a proposal for the risk assessment demonstration projects required by this Act to be undertaken by specified Federal agencies; and (4) identification of the areas where the use of the results of a risk assessment is required, encouraged, limited, or prohibited by current law, regulation, or practice. Requires specified Federal agencies to recommend to the coordinating agency research projects relating to risk assessment. Directs the coordinating agency to report to the Congress with recommendations concerning risk assessment."
