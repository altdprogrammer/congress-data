    "text": "Anti-Fraud Criminal Enforcement Act of 1985 - Authorizes the Defense Contract Audit Agency of the Department of Defense to administer oaths and request by subpoena the production of all documents, reports, records, and other materials made or maintained by any contractor receiving over $100,000 in any one year pursuant to a contract or subcontract. Sets forth criminal sanctions against anyone who attempts to influence, obstruct, or impair with the intent to deceive or defraud a Federal auditor in the performance of official duties in relation to a contractor receiving $100,000 from the United States in any one year period. Provides that the plant, employees, and books of a contractor or subcontractor furnishing goods, equipment, or services to an agency of the United States shall be subject at all times to inspection, interview, and audit by such agency. Allows the Attorney General to seek injunctive relief against any person believed to be engaged in a fraud or a conspiracy to defraud the United States. Authorizes a Federal court to require a defendant, upon conviction of a fraud or a conspiracy to defraud the United States, to pay the costs of investigation and prosecution. Disallows as costs in a Government contract any costs incurred in the defense of any criminal or civil fraud investigation or litigation brought by the United States against a contractor. Provides that within three years after the expiration of the five-year statute of limitations, a prosecution for fraud or breach of fiduciary obligation may be still brought against a Government contractor within one year after the facts relating to the offense became known to, or reasonably should have been known by, the Federal public servant responsible to act in such circumstances."
