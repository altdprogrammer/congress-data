    "text": "Professional Sports Community Protection Act of 1985 - States that it shall be lawful for a professional sports league or its member clubs to enforce rules or agreements that: (1) decide that a member club may not relocate; (2) divide revenues to promote economic opportunities for member clubs; and (3) establish procedures and standards for the election and termination of club ownership. States that the provisions of this Act shall not affect any antitrust suit brought by any league or the Federal Government. Prescribes a notice requirement for clubs seeking relocation. Lists factors for consideration in determining whether a league will permit a club to relocate, which include: (1) the adequacy of the existing stadium and facilities; (2) the operating revenues or losses for the preceding three years; and (3) the number of professional and college teams playing the same sport in that community. Provides that judicial review of the league's determination may be sought in a civil action brought in a district court of the United States by: (1) the club seeking relocation; (2) the stadium owner or operator; or (3) the local government. Prohibits the bringing of such action in a district court within the club's home or proposed territory. States that the provisions of this Act do not affect the applicability of any employment or collective bargaining matter. Preempts State and local laws inconsistent with this Act."
